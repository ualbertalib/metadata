   <description>The actualization of real-time economically optimal process operation requires proper integration of real-time optimization (RTO) and dynamic control. This dissertation addresses the integration problem and provides a formal design technique that&#xd;
properly integrates RTO and model predictive control (MPC) under&#xd;
parametric uncertainties. The task is posed as an adaptive extremum-seeking control (ESC) problem in which the controller is&#xd;
required to steer the system to an unknown setpoint that optimizes a user-specified objective function. &#xd;
&#xd;
The integration task is first solved for linear uncertain systems. Then a method of determining appropriate excitation conditions for nonlinear systems with uncertain reference setpoint is provided.&#xd;
Since the identification of the true cost surface is paramount to the success of the integration scheme, novel parameter estimation techniques with better convergence properties are developed. The&#xd;
estimation routine allows exact reconstruction of the system's&#xd;
unknown parameters in finite-time. The applicability of the identifier to improve upon the performance of existing adaptive&#xd;
controllers is demonstrated.&#xd;
&#xd;
Adaptive nonlinear model predictive controllers are developed for a class of constrained uncertain nonlinear systems. Rather than relying on the inherent robustness of nominal MPC, robustness&#xd;
features are incorporated in the MPC framework to account for the&#xd;
effect of the model uncertainty. The numerical complexity and/or the&#xd;
conservatism of the resulting adaptive controller reduces as more information becomes available and a better uncertainty description is obtained.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, the finite-time identification procedure and the adaptive MPC are combined to achieve the integration task. The proposed design solves the economic optimization and control problem at the&#xd;
same frequency. This eliminates the ensuing interval of "no-feedback" that occurs between economic optimization interval,&#xd;
thereby improving disturbance attenuation.</description>

   <title>An investigation of the relationship between levels of apoptosis during aging and longetivity</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-09 03:57:11.27</description>
   <description>In multicellular organisms, apoptosis plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and removing damaged cells that present a threat to the integrity of the organism. Several lines of evidence suggest that apoptosis might also play a role in the normal aging process. In Drosophila, inhibition of apoptosis in muscle tissues results in lifespan extension. The magnitude of lifespan extension depends on the nature of the UAS-DIAP1 transgene. These results led to the working hypothesis that there might be an optimal level of apoptosis needed to maximally extend lifespan, and was tested with two experimental approaches. First, in order to determine the correlation between longevity and the level of apoptosis in four different genotypes that overexpress DIAP1 using the DJ694-GAL4 driver, DIAP1 expression and caspase activity were examined by way of western blots and caspase assays, respectively. Second, the hypothesis was also tested through the manipulation of DIAP1 expression levels. The number of the UAS-DIAP1 transgene was doubled in the genome, which resulted in an increase in DIAP1 expression levels. &#xd;
The DJ694 driver is able to drive the expression of the UAS-DIAP1 transgene, which resulted in DIAP1 overexpression during adult life as confirmed by western blots. The elevated DIAP1 protein levels resulted in lower caspase activity in animals with one copy of the UAS-DIAP1 transgene and a DJ694 driver. Lifespan extension was observed in these animals overexpressing DIAP1. In animals possessing two copies of the UAS-DIAP1 transgene and a DJ694-GAL4 driver, there was a two-fold increase at transcriptional level. Elevated levels of the DIAP1 protein and a reduction in caspase activity were observed in these animals, but these animals did not exhibit a greater extension in lifespan as compared to the animals driving the expression of only one UAS-DIAP1 transgene.&#xd;
Based on the results obtained, three models for the relationship between longevity and inhibition of apoptosis were proposed. The first model predicts that lifespan is expected to increase with apoptosis inhibition. According to the second model, a specific level of apoptosis inhibition is needed to achieve an optimal extension in lifespan. Inhibition of apoptosis outside of this specific level results in a shortened lifespan. The third model hypothesizes that there is a maximum lifespan that can be achieved by the presence of apoptosis inhibition, however further inhibition beyond this point will not result in an additional increase in longevity.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-08 19:27:48.283</description>
   <description>We present a new Channel State Information (CSI) signalling strategy for single- &#xd;
branch Mobile Multihop Relay (MMR) systems. This novel signalling strategy reduces the signalling overhead at each relay by at least 50%, and eliminates the need for channel estimation at the relays. We prove that this significant overhead reduction comes at the expense of no performance loss at all when hard Maximum Likelihood detection is carried out at the destination. Furthermore, we consider the use of our system with concatenated channel codes to carry out soft Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) detection, and show that with channel codes employed the optimum detection rule becomes prohibitively complex to implement. We propose two approximate soft MAP detection schemes to make the detection feasible for our system, and demonstrate that the performance is either almost identical or slightly degraded from the ideal case with full CSI at the destination. We demonstrate the validity of our analysis through performance simulation plots.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-11 23:30:10.708</description>
   <description>Epidemiological studies have identified kneeling as an occupational risk factor for knee joint osteoarthritis (KOA), but direct biomechanical evidence for this relationship is lacking. We hypothesize one mechanism by which prolonged static kneeling may cause KOA is by compromising the integrity of the knee joint thereby increasing knee joint instability, which manifests as altered ambulatory loading profiles. Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the effect of sustained static kneeling on knee joint gait parameters. &#xd;
 Ten healthy male subjects (24.1 years ± 3.5) volunteered for this study. Each subject’s dominant leg was instrumented with markers to track lower limb motion and with surface electromyography electrodes to record quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscle activity. Subjects performed ten walking trials at a self-selected normal pace over a force plate embedded in the floor. They then performed a kneeling protocol of three bouts of ten minutes of kneeling, each separated by a five minute seated rest period. Subsequently, a set of ten walking trials were performed after a short rest and equipment verification period. &#xd;
 The ground reaction force and motion data were used to calculate the peak knee adduction moments, knee flexion moments, and knee flexion angles during the stance phase. The total muscle activity for each muscle during a single gait cycle as well as the co-contraction of the medial thigh muscles and the lateral thigh muscles were calculated from the surface electromyography data. One-sample t-tests were run on the absolute value of the pre- and post-kneeling outcome measures. All outcome measures were different across conditions indicating that the loading patterns were altered, in no specific direction, as a result of the static kneeling protocol. &#xd;
 These results offer preliminary evidence to support the epidemiological findings that thirty minutes of daily occupational kneeling is associated with a higher prevalence of KOA. Further investigation is required to explore the importance of post-kneeling recovery, posture-induced blood occlusion, and cartilage stress due to cumulative loading while kneeling, as well as to test the clinical significance of the present findings.</description>

   <description>An electro-mechanical device was developed to provide mechanical stimulation to cell populations for the purpose of studying how mechanical signals affect cell activity.  The system can dynamically deform cubes of hydrogel seeded with cells by applying combinations of normal and shear forces to the faces of the hydrogel cube using plastic pads attached to the cube. The compact device was fabricated using rapid prototyping methods with ABS plastic and uses shape memory alloy actuator wires to generate the necessary forces. The actuator wires can be independently activated in sequence to create stimulation routines involving compression, tension and shear forces. All of the components can be sterilized and are corrosion resistant so they are not affected by the high humidity environment of a tissue incubator where cell stimulation studies are performed. The system fits inside a standard plastic lab container measuring 7 cm tall by 4 cm in diameter to maintain sterile conditions and hold the liquid culture medium required by the cells. During operation the hydrogel cube and the contact pads are submerged in the culture medium. The shape memory alloy actuators have been modeled in a two step process: 1) the electrothermal model, relating input electrical current to the wire temperature due to resistive heating and 2) the thermomechanical model relating the wire temperature to the wire strain and actuator stroke due to the shape memory effect. Testing was completed to validate the models and calibrate the shape memory alloy actuators. There was good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results. For experiments with a hydrogel cube with sides measuring 1 cm, the system was capable of compressing the hydrogel cube up to 8 %, and generating shear strains of up to 7%. Tensile strains were much smaller at 0.9%. The dynamic deformations were applied at a frequency of 0.5 Hz.</description>

   <title>The effect of social and causal information on children's imitation</title>

   <subject>Imitation</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-12 17:31:46.892</description>
   <description>Current theories regarding imitation tend to emphasize either its role as a mechanism for&#xd;
learning about objects without resorting to trial and error, or its role as a means by which we understand the mental states of others. Few studies have attempted to reconcile these two approaches by systematically investigating what information children learn from imitating others. In this thesis, I examined the relative influence of both physical and social information on children’s imitation in an attempt to bridge these two approaches. In Study 1, children used their causal knowledge to ignore a physically irrelevant action done by an adult demonstrator. In Studies 2 and 3, children imitated the irrelevant action more often when information was provided that multiple individuals performed that action and when a single individual performed that action consistently. These findings suggest the possibility that shared practices play an influential role in imitation, above and beyond learning about the physical functioning of an object.</description>

   <description>This qualitative multiple-case study examined the pedagogical role that performance arts training played in the emergence of students’ mature artistic identities. As one of many instructors in the musical theatre program of a post-secondary college, the author fulfilled both the roles of researcher and studio music teacher. Multiple learning contexts were observed for eight first-year students; these contexts included the regimens in various artistic classrooms and in the vocal studio. The data comprised field observations from studio and classroom settings, individual interviews with eight students from the vocal studio, and audio recordings from their studio sessions. Data analysis revealed that the students’ construction of identity was positively impacted by: the “triple-threat” program components, the unique dyad relationship between the vocal studio teacher and her students, and the rigorous, professional training the students underwent. A study of the interactions amongst the disciplines of music, dance, and drama exhibited several implications in relation to the students’ acute identity experiences. Recommendations for improved musical theatre curricula centred on improved integration of the three disciplines, enhanced studio time, and greater skill development in the studio. Suggestions for future research in performance arts education were also offered.</description>

   <description>It has been almost 150 years since Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” was published, yet the mechanisms that lead to the creation of new species are still a topic of fervent research in Evolutionary Biology. In the last several decades, there has been considerable interest in how genetic drift and adaptive processes internal to populations may lead to population divergence. It has been recognized that intersexual co-evolution may drive the rapid evolution of reproductive traits, leading to reproductive isolation between populations in allopatry. To explore the nature of this process, I conducted a series of interpopulation interaction experiments using a set of laboratory-evolved Drosophila melanogaster populations. These “B” (for baseline) populations share a common ancestor and had evolved in identical habitats in allopatry for 650-700 generations prior to my experiments. When different populations were combined in competitive fitness assays, I found that foreign males usually suffer depressed fitness when competing with males who share a common evolutionary history with the focal females. I selected a subset of B populations to investigate potential sources of variation that could explain this result. I examined; 1) characters involved in post-copulatory interactions between mates and 2) traits involved in mating behaviour. I found that sperm precedence patterns varied significantly depending on female population of origin and suggestive evidence that males between populations vary in ability to compete in sperm offence. Males also varied in mating behaviour between populations, however we found no evidence that divergence of these traits was correlated to that of traits involved in post-copulatory interactions, suggesting that understanding how intersexual co-evolution drives population divergence requires considering independent components of the reproductive phenotype and their contributions to overall fitness differences.</description>

   <description>After two decades of a disappointing relationship between Canada and the People's Republic of China (PRC)-- seriously damaged during the Korean War and relieved by wheat sales after the Great Leap-- Pierre Trudeau's government wanted to end China's isolation. The new prime minister was determined to ensure that his country could recognize the Communist regime. Even more surprisingly, Ottawa's opening of relations with Beijing would soon be followed by Washington. Such words as "rapprochement" were therefore repeated in North America as this extraordinary diplomatic event began to unfold in the late 1960s.&#xd;
In hindsight, Sino-Canadian rapprochement seems full of contradictions: at a time when Canada's closest ally was still fighting in Vietnam, and when the Chinese were shouting anti-imperialist slogans during the Cultural Revolution, how could it be possible that Ottawa and Beijing wished to become friends? The central question this thesis poses and answers is why the two governments suddenly shifted positions at such a politically sensitive moment. Offering different ways to understand this thirty-year-old question, the thesis re-examines Trudeau's and Maoist China's remarkable, but often forgotten, diplomatic breakthrough. Indeed, although Canadians were paying closer attention to the nation's "October Crisis" in 1970, the "October Handshake" in Stockholm between representatives of Canada and China in the same month was also a significant event. The success of such a diplomatic achievement could be seen in the Sino-American rapprochement that followed and in China's new place in the world community. Drawing on various historical records, including materials from the archives of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Queen's University, this study explains the agreement between Beijing and Ottawa in 1970 as the coincidence of three crucial conditions: the rapidly changing geopolitical circumstances at the time, a favourable internal political climate, and the matching mentality of the extraordinary players from both countries. Furthermore, while existing accounts of Sino-Canadian rapprochement highlight both countries' external relations, this thesis will argue that an exploration of the dynamics of domestic politics and the roles of individual leaders can expand our understanding of decision-making during the process of normalization of relations between China and Canada.</description>

   <description>The enteric nervous system (ENS) continues its development after birth, with formation of ganglia and functional synapses; plasticity is also demonstrated in significant axon growth that occurs after experimental colitis in the adult colon.  However, little is known about factors in the postnatal intestine that influence and regulate these processes.  Therefore we tested the effects of known neurotrophins, NGF, NT-3, BDNF and GDNF on neonatal rat myenteric neurons.  Cocultures were developed by isolating the myenteric plexus and surrounding muscular wall from neonatal rats, and effects of exogenous treatment of neurotrophins were analyzed using immunocytochemistry and image analysis.  Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were performed to detect implicated neurotrophins and their receptors in the postnatal intestine.  Functional aspects of effects of implicated neurotrophins were assessed by [3H]choline uptake and acetylcholine release in myenteric neurons.  Last, TNBS-colitis was induced in adult rats to determine changes in GDNF secretion during the course of the disease.  Application of 100ng/mL GDNF to a neonatal intestinal coculture containing neurons, glia and smooth muscle cells produced a 91.5% (p≤0.05) increase in axons.  GDNF induced morphological changes in the structure and organization of neurons and axons; the incidence of neurons present in ganglia increased by 11.2% (p≤0.05), with a 32.9% (p≤0.05) increase in aggregated axons.  Western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed intestinal smooth muscle as the major source of GDNF and demonstrated the presence of the GDNF receptor complex, GFRα1 and RET in the myenteric plexus.  Choline uptake significantly increased at 50, 100 and 150ng/ml doses of GDNF, whereas stimulated ACh release increased only at 100 and 150ng/ml doses.  In TNBS-colitis, a decrease in 35kD GDNF at days 1 and 6 post-induction of inflammation was observed, with a concomitant increase in 15kD GDNF.  We conclude that GDNF, produced by intestinal smooth muscle, is a key factor influencing development of the postnatal myenteric neuron and may play a role in ENS-restructuring post-inflammation.</description>

   <description>Robotic rehabilitation and assessment of the human upper-limb following stroke is currently limited in part by the inability of robots to replicate natural motion.  In particular, motion of the shoulder girdle is usually neglected, despite the fact that the shoulder girdle is necessary to stabilize and orient the upper-limb during activities of daily living.  Without direct control of the shoulder girdle, it is not possible to monitor or prevent a patient from making compensatory movements, which inhibits functional recovery, nor is there a means to properly regain strength and coordination.  The more the robot is able to realistically mimic upper-limb motion, the more able the robot will be to assist with true functional movement training, which gives the patient the best chance of motor recovery.  To address this issue, a new adjustable robotic exoskeleton called MEDARM is proposed for rehabilitation and assessment of the shoulder complex.  MEDARM provides independent control of six degrees of freedom of the upper-limb: two at the sternoclavicular joint, three at the glenohumeral joint and one at the elbow.&#xd;
&#xd;
A key design feature of the new robot is an innovative curved track mechanism actuated by a cable-drive transmission system.  To facilitate a performance evaluation of this new mechanism, a planar version of MEDARM was designed.  A full prototype of this planar robot was constructed and several fundamental metrics, including friction, inertia, and compliance, were used to test its mechanical performance.   Additionally, the functionality of the robot was examined using preliminary data recorded during a standard reaching task, and by implementing some basic rehabilitation algorithms.  This thesis describes the design of MEDARM and its planar counterpart in detail and the performance evaluation of the prototype is presented.</description>

   <description>The mechanism by which chiral selectivity takes place is complicated by the surface morphology, the possible involvement of the solvent, and the characteristics of the chiral molecules at the surface. My goal is to model and understand the factors which lead to significant discrimination in the case of three closely related chiral stationary phases: N-(1-phenylethyl)-N’-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]-urea (PEPU), [(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-amino]-N-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]-2-phenylacetamide (DNB-phenyglycine), and [(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino]-N-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]-4-methylpentanamide (DNB-leucine). &#xd;
&#xd;
   Ab initio calculations are used to develop molecular models of these chiral selectors. These models are employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provide the theoretical framework for modelling chiral interfaces in different solvent mixtures. The MD simulations of PEPU interfaces show that, in alcohol/water mixtures, the alcohols form domains at the interface with the hydrophobic portions of the molecule tending to orient towards the surface.  This disrupts the water hydrogen bonding networks at the interface and leads to the exclusion of water from the surface region relative to the bulk. The MD simulations of DNB-phenylglycine and DNB-leucine selectors in hexane/2-propanol mixtures demonstrate that the interfaces are distinct both in terms of the selector orientations at the surface and in the number of hydrogen bonds formed with 2-propanol. This occurs despite the structural similarity between these two selectors. &#xd;
&#xd;
   The interfaces are also prepared experimentally by attaching the chiral selectors onto oxidized Si(111) samples and AFM tips. In particular, for DNB-phenylglycine and DNB-leucine samples, two synthetic routes have been explored. Using AFM, the morphologies of the resulting chiral interfaces are obtained.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and refraction-absorption infrared spectroscopy provide information regarding the relative distribution of the compounds on the surface. Using chemical force microscopy (CFM) measurements, chiral self-selectivity is examined in various solvent mixtures. For PEPU interfaces, the extent of hydrogen bonding at the surface is the dominant contributor to the measured forces. In the case of  DNB-phenylglycine and DNB-leucine, CFM measurements of the chiral self-selectivity in 2-propanol demonstrate that chiral discrimination is present in both systems, but larger forces are observed for DNB-phenylglycine, consistent with the molecular dynamics study that shows much weaker solvent interactions with this species.</description>

   <description>My thesis is an examination militarized masculinity in Canada's JTF2 Special Forces and the Private Security Firm Blackwater. I employ a gender analysis to highlight how militarized masculinity impedes women's participation from Special Forces and private security firms. Feminist scholarship by Cynthia Enloe, Ann Tickner, Sandra Whitworth, and Charlotte Hooper has examined how militarized masculinity is associated within a particular political/situational context and therefore should be understood in its plural--as militarized masculinities. However, there is limited scholarship focusing on how masculinities vary in Special Forces and private security firms. This lack of scholarship results in limited knowledge of the implications militarized masculinity in these units has for women's security and for women's participation in these units. The purpose of this thesis is to add to the current literature by exploring, through militarized masculinities, the gender barriers to women's participation and the consequences of the security produced when these units deploy. To analyze the impact of militarized masculinity in these units I conducted interviews with authorities on these units, applicants interested in participating in these units, and performed a content analysis of Blackwater's website. I argue based on the information gathered that militarized masculinity, while varied in its application in special units and private security firms, continues to impede women's participation and in some cases can cause greater insecurity for women where these units are deployed.</description>

   <description>This research explored Chinese college English teachers’ beliefs and conceptual change in relation to the government-mandated shift from the traditional grammar-based approaches to language teaching to communicative language teaching (CLT). &#xd;
This study employed an ethnographic approach and was conducted at a university in China. Six Chinese college English teachers agreed to participate in a three-month study during which their classroom teaching was observed and they were interviewed about their teaching experiences, understanding of the new teaching methods, and interpretations of the curriculum change. Three patterns of conceptual change were found in their beliefs about language teaching and learning: (a) change in teaching methods but no significant change in conceptions and beliefs, (b) change in both teaching methods and conceptions accompanied by painful conceptual conflict, and (c) change in both teaching methods and beliefs and an acquisition of broader curriculum perspectives. The stories and experiences of the participants indicate the complex, non-linear nature of conceptual development in their beliefs about language teaching. They struggled to expand their conceptual space by dwelling in the Zone of Between—between Chinese and Western educational traditions, between social, cognitive, and psychological processes of conceptual growth, between teaching and educating, and between curriculum-as-plan and curriculum-in-use. &#xd;
This study is expected to have suggestions for ongoing college English teaching in China, provide insight for the research of teachers’ beliefs related to curriculum development in other cultural contexts, and inform language teacher education and development programs.</description>

   <description>Testing is an indispensable mechanism for assuring software quality. One of the key issues in testing is to obtain a test data set that is able to effectively test an implementation. An adequate test data set consists of test cases that can expose faults in a software implementation. Mutation-based testing can be employed to obtain adequate test data sets, and numerous mutation operators have been proposed to date to measure the adequacy of test data sets that reveal functional faults.  However, implementations that pass functionality tests are still vulnerable to malicious attacks. Despite the rigorous use of various existing testing techniques, many vulnerabilities are discovered after the deployment of software implementations, such as buffer overflows (BOF), SQL injections, and format string bugs (FSB). Successful exploitations of these vulnerabilities may result in severe consequences such as denial of services, application state corruptions, and information leakage. Many approaches have been proposed to detect these vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, very few approaches address the issue of testing implementations against vulnerabilities. Moreover, these approaches do not provide an indication whether a test data set is adequate for vulnerability testing or not. &#xd;
   We believe that bringing the idea of traditional functional test adequacy to vulnerability testing can help address the issue of test adequacy. In this thesis, we apply the idea of mutation-based adequate testing to perform vulnerability testing of buffer overflows, SQL injections, and format string bugs. We propose mutation operators to force the generation of adequate test data sets for these vulnerabilities. The operators mutate source code to inject the vulnerabilities in the library function calls and unsafe implementation language elements. The mutants generated by the operators are killed by test cases that expose these vulnerabilities. We propose distinguishing or killing criteria for mutants that consider varying symptoms of exploitations. Three prototype tools are developed to automatically generate mutants and perform mutation analysis with input test cases and the effectiveness of the proposed operators is evaluated on several open source programs containing known vulnerabilities. The results indicate that the proposed operators are effective for testing the vulnerabilities, and the mutation-based vulnerability testing process ensures the quality of the applications against these vulnerabilities.</description>

   <description>With many unique advantages compared to traditional sensors, optical fiber sensors have been studied and applied to many different areas. Interferometric sensors are one of the most useful sensor types due to their high sensitivities and relatively relaxed requirement on the stability of the optical source’s power level. In-line optical interferometric sensors received further attention as a result of compactness and robustness to the reference channel instability.&#xd;
Long period gratings (LPG) are one of the most useful components in the in-line optical fiber sensors. However, the fabrication cost is normally high due to the expensive masks and stringent photolithographic procedures. Two new sensor components, namely abrupt tapers and connector-offset attenuators, are proposed as couplers in the optical fiber to couple light from core to cladding (or reverse) to replace LPGs. Using OPTIBPM software, the coupling coefficients between core and cladding modes are calculated. For an abrupt taper, coupling mostly happens between LP01 and LP0m modes; the first ten LP0m modes account for 98% of the incident mode energy. For a connector-offset attenuator, coupling mainly happens between LP01 and LP1m modes; the first ten LP0m and first ten LP1m modes account for 92% of the incident mode energy. The relative direction of two connector-offset attenuators is found to be very important to the interference performance. Phase dependent interference (attenuation range from 1 dB to 35 dB) is observed in the simulation for the interferometers using abrupt tapers and connector-offset attenuators.&#xd;
Three interferometers are realized in the experiment using the abrupt tapers (Mach-Zehnder and Michelson) or the connector-offset attenuators (Michelson). Due to the interference between core and cladding modes, transmission is strongly dependent on wavelength ranging from 3 dB to 26 dB in the best implementation. Although it is difficult to make two perfect parallel connector-offset attenuators required by the Mach-Zehnder interferometers by using the fusion splicer, some evidence of constructive interference is observed in the experiment.&#xd;
The interferometers are tested as refractive index (RI) sensors using the maximum attenuation wavelength shift relative to the RI change. Given that the minimum resolution of optical spectrum analyzer is 10 pm, ~10-4 difference of the RI can be detected by the interferometric sensors using the abrupt tapers or the connector-offset attenuators.</description>

   <description>The purposes of the present work were: 1) to develop a computerized model that could predict the personal lift-assist device (PLAD) spring excursion and control spring stiffness for various individuals based on their anthropometry and working posture and 2) to test the PLAD’s (Version 6) effectiveness and user acceptability during static forward bending in an automotive assembly plant. Study 1 required 30 subjects to carry out a protocol that simulated unloaded stoop, squat, and freestyle lifting. Trunk inclination and knee angles were determined via 3 FastrakTM sensors, whereas a displacement transducer attached in-line with the PLAD determined excursion when the trunk or knees flexed. A model was created to determine spring excursion, and it was successfully validated with 10 additional subjects. A computerized model applying the excursion model and mathematical equations was also developed to calculate the required spring stiffness for offsetting a proportion of the L4/L5 bending moment for each individual in various postures. Study 2 investigated the effectiveness and user acceptability of the PLAD at an automotive manufacturing facility, using operators who performed an assembly process requiring forward bending and static holds. Surface EMG data were collected at six sites on the low back and abdomen, and a tri-axial accelerometer was mounted on each subject’s sternum to measure trunk inclination. A 20% reduction in the L4/L5 bending moment was provided to each wearer using the aforementioned computerized model. The PLAD was able to significantly reduce low back muscular activity, predicted-compression, and ratings of perceived exertion, without significantly changing abdominal activity or trunk inclination. Workers had positive opinions about the device, and 80% said they would wear the device everyday on-line. Additionally, the computerized model developed in Study 1 was effective, as worker low back muscular activity was reduced by approximately 20% when wearing the PLAD. With slight alterations, the PLAD appears to be beneficial in reducing low back forces and discomfort in many tasks that place excessive biomechanical loading on the low back.</description>

   <description>Adolescence marks a time of increased social freedoms and opportunities to participate in new productive and leisure activities. As compared to typically developing high school students, those with intellectual disabilities (ID) can face more barriers to involvement in these activities. This study examined the involvement of high school students with and without ID in productive and leisure activities. Furthermore, it identified factors related to involvement, and it examined students’ satisfaction with their social interactions. Forty-seven typically developing high school students completed in-person interviews, and 45 of the students’ parents completed telephone interviews. Archival data from 63 parents of high school students with ID and 41 students with ID were also used. Students provided information about their satisfaction with social interactions, and, additionally, typically developing students provided information about the productive and leisure activities in which they participated. Parents in both groups provided information about their adolescents’ adaptive functioning and maladaptive behaviour, and parents of students with ID also provided information about the productive and leisure activities in which their adolescent participated. Results showed that typically developing students were more likely to be involved in employment and unstructured leisure activities than students with ID; however, there was no difference in involvement between the two groups for volunteer and structured leisure activities. Adaptive functioning was related to involvement in structured and unstructured leisure activities. Maladaptive behaviour was related to involvement in productive activities. Typically developing adolescents had a greater number of general daily interactions than adolescents with ID, and they were more satisfied with the quality of these interactions than students with ID. There was no difference in the quantity of close personal interactions between the two groups; however, typically developing students were more satisfied with the quality of their close personal interactions than students with ID. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</description>

   <title>Defining the Role of the SHP2 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase in FcepsilonRI Signaling in Mast Cells</title>

   <description>Mast cells are granulocytes that are a key component of the innate and adaptive immune system, and contribute to allergic disorders. Mast cell activation following clustering of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) by multivalent antigens requires reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of myriad signaling proteins. Activated mast cells rapidly release granule contents (eg. histamine and serine proteases) that cause vascular permeability, and in a more delayed manner they also synthesize and secrete eicosanoids and numerous cytokines (eg. IL-6 and TNFalpha) that recruit activated leukocytes. FcepsilonRI signaling is initiated by Lyn, a Src Family Kinase (SFK), that phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) found on the FcepsilonRI beta and gamma chains. This allows recruitment of Fyn SFK and Syk kinase that bind ITAMs and phosphorylate numerous downstream targets. Src Homology 2 domain-containing Phosphatase 2 (SHP2, encoded by ptpn11/shp2) is known to be recruited to several phosphorylated proteins following FcepsilonRI aggregation in mast cells, however attempts to define the role of SHP2 have been hampered by its essential role during embryonic development and hematopoiesis in mice. Recently, conditional SHP2 knock-out mice (shp2fl/fl) have been created allowing for shp2 inactivation in a tissue-specific manner by Cre recombinase. Here we describe the use of transgenic mice expressing a modified estrogen receptor-Cre Recombinase (TgCreER*) on a shp2fl/fl genetic background, that allows for maturation of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) prior to shp2-inactivation using 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-TM). SHP2-depleted BMMCs display reduced phosphorylation of the FcepsilonRI beta chain, but exhibit extended phosphorylation of Syk kinase. Additionally, SHP2-deficient cells display a defect in the activation of both Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, which correlates with an observed defect in the production of TNFalpha and Leukotriene C4.  Finally, we show that SHP2-deficient BMMCs display elevated FcepsilonRI-evoked phosphorylation of Csk-Binding Protein (Cbp or PAG) on residue Y317, which recruits C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) that phosphorylates SFKs on an inhibitory tyrosine. This hyperphosphorylation of Cbp correlates with elevated phosphorylation of the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine on Fyn kinase. This study provides new insights into the role of SHP2 as a positive effector of FcepsilonRI signaling and cytokine production in mast cells.</description>

   <description>This thesis explores the intersections of culture, nationalism, and neoliberal globalization through examination of the construction of Mexican identity in Canada after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.  I evaluate how visual art has been used by the governments of Canada and Mexico to negotiate new bilateral relationships in the face of increased North American integration under free trade.  My study includes analysis of two Canada-based exhibitions, “Mexican Modern Art, 1900-1950” and “Panoramas: The North American Landscape in Art.”  Framing my discussion within the larger history of North American integration, I argue that these two exhibitions are part of a larger exchange in the area of cultural diplomacy between Canada and Mexico, which was especially prominent at the turn of the millennium.  These case studies provide a means to assess the manipulation of culture, the creation of a new North American identity, and the management of national/ist narratives within the larger project of neoliberal globalization.  Critically situating my study within the current discourse of globalization theory, I contend that artworks in these exhibitions were positioned in a manner to positively reinforce new trade relationships under NAFTA.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-21 16:05:02.797</description>
   <description>Background:  Significant interest in homocysteine exists due to its established role in embryogenesis, cardiovascular disease and neurotoxicity. This research investigates total plasma homocysteine in the context of carcinogenesis among healthy individuals aged 20 to 50 years. It is hypothesized that during this timeframe, elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) concentration implicates a breakdown of the methionine-homocyteine biosynthesis pathway, in which folate deficiency, oxidative stress and altered DNA methylation capacity are potential consequences relevant to cancer etiology. &#xd;
Purpose:  The overall purpose of this research is to identify novel genetic predispositions to a biomarker of cancer risk (tHcy). Interactions with dietary and genetic factors that act on this pathway are explored. &#xd;
Methods:  The study population consisted of 284 healthy male and female volunteers recruited in Kingston, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia between 2006 and 2008.  Specifically, polymorphisms under consideration included: i) the thymidylate synthase enhancer region (TSER) tandem repeat polymorphism and ii) the GC single nucleotide polymorphism (G/C SNP) both found on the 5’untranslated region (UTR) of the TS gene, and iii) the 6 base pair deletion at base pair 1494 (TS1494del6) found on the 3’UTR. TS polymorphisms were categorized based on either 5’ or 3’ location and were dichotomized to either high or low TS expression. Gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in TS and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T) on tHcy concentration were also analyzed.  In addition, gene-diet interactions between serum folate and vitamin B12 status were examined.   &#xd;
Results:  Mean tHcy concentration for this study population was 8.65 µmol/L (standard deviation=1.96 µmol/L). After adjustment for confounders, higher mean tHcy levels of 0.48 μmol/L and 0.46 μmol/L were observed for the main effects of 5’polymorphisms (5’High) (p=0.04) and 3’polymorphism (3’High) (p=0.05), respectively.  The largest difference in mean tHcy concentration was observed for the joint effects of TS polymorphisms (µ=0.74 μmol/L, p=0.11).  Gene-gene interaction was observed between TS and MTHFR polymorphisms on tHcy concentrations (p&lt;0.01).  &#xd;
Conclusions:  The findings of this research provide evidence of an association between TS polymorphisms and tHcy concentrations. These results suggest that TS polymorphisms, independent of dietary factors, may lead to elevated tHcy levels and potentially contribute to cancer development.</description>

   <description>A number of computational methods have suggested means by which gene transcription – the process through which RNA is created from DNA – is activated, but there are factors at work that no model has been able to fully explain. In eukaryotes, gene regulation is quite complex, so models have primarily focused on a relatively simple species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). Because of the inherent complexity in higher species, and even in yeast, a method of identifying transcription factor (TF) binding motifs (specific, short DNA sequences) must be efficient and thorough in its analysis. This thesis shows that a method using the Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) algorithm to uncover binding motifs as well as cooperatively binding groups of motifs can explain variations in gene expression profiles, which reflect the level at which DNA is transcribed into RNA for a number of genes. The algorithm is very fast, exploring a motif list and constructing a final model within seconds to a few minutes. It produces model terms that are consistent with known motifs, while also revealing new motifs and interactions, and it causes impressive reductions in variance with relatively few model terms over the cell-cycle.</description>

   <description>Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a wild type, obligate methanotroph that grows only on one-carbon compounds and, in the absence of copper, produces high levels of soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) to metabolize methane to methanol.  SMMO has gained a great deal of attention in the bioremediation and chemical industries because of its low substrate specificity and its ability to oxidize chlorinated hydrocarbons. Much literature exists on cultivating this organism on methane, however no one has achieved dry cell weight densities exceeding 18 g/L. Biomass growth is limited due to mass transfer of methane to cells. This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity. &#xd;
Methanol was found to completely inhibit growth at 40 g/L. For online methanol measurements during fed-batch cultivation, an in situ probe was constructed from autoclavable materials and equipped with a Figaro TGS822 vapor sensor. The probe was designed to prevent the sensor coming in contact with water aerosols which affect its performance. The probe was an essential component of a feedback methanol control system. The cumulative CO2 production (CCP) strategy was used to feed methanol in fed-batch experiments.&#xd;
In an initial bioreactor study, growth nutrients were fed in excess. The yields of biomass to nutrients were determined and the growth medium modified accordingly.  A biomass density of 19 g/L (growth rate of 0.013-0.065 h-1) was achieved with sMMO activity of 300 to 500 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass]-1[h]-1. The subsequent bioreactor study involved feeding of nutrients based on their yields in relation to methanol, a biomass density of 62 g/L (growth rate of 0.034- 0.08 h-1) was achieved. &#xd;
The inoculum cultures utilized in the bioreactor studies were maintained on Noble agar plates containing nitrogen minimal salts medium and methane. After 6 months of subsequent plate transfers, M. trichosporium lost the ability to produce high levels of sMMO. The enzyme activity in methanol grown cells was recovered by subculturing in liquid NMS medium with methane as the sole carbon source, the activity increased from 8 to 600 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass]-1[h]-1. It is recommended that further studies be carried out on stimulating sMMO activity during cultivation on methanol.</description>

   <title>A comparison between solute transport in a discrete fracture and in a fracture network using a novel method for tracer detection</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-25 02:48:16.066</description>
   <description>Characterization of field-scale transport in bedrock aquifers is necessary due to the preponderance of groundwater contamination in these settings, and the increasing attention paid to these sites by regulatory bodies. However, as a result of the inherent complexity, and the consequent uncertainty in the dominant transport processes, large-scale transport in fractured rock is poorly understood.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this study an investigation of large-scale transport was accomplished in part by conducting a radial-divergent tracer experiment in a 15 m thick section of aquifer with observations over a 245 m distance, using a novel tracer detection method capable of detecting breakthrough in individual fractures. The tracer experiment was conducted at a well-characterized field site in Smithville, Ontario, which is underlain by several large-scale bedding plane fractures, and used a submersible fluorometer to detect tracer arrival in-situ and to obtain vertical fluorescence profiles (VFPs) from observation boreholes.&#xd;
&#xd;
To complete the investigation, hydraulic characterization data and VFPs were used to approximate the dominant transport pathways and a numerical model which solves for flow and transport in discrete fracture features (HydroGeoSphere) was used to simulate the tracer experiment. The results of the experiment and the modeling exercise were compared to those from a large-scale single fracture tracer experiment conducted previously at the same site, for which the modeling was revisited.&#xd;
&#xd;
The experimental results of the fracture network experiment (FNE) were markedly more heterogeneous than those of the previously conducted single fracture experiment (SFE), with multiple peaks in the breakthrough curves, and scale dependent changes in breakthrough character. The VFPs illustrate that differences in the observed transport arise due to tortuous transport pathways within individual fracture features, and the combined effect of this tortuosity in the numerous fractures contributing to transport in the fracture network.&#xd;
&#xd;
For the observation boreholes closest to the source (&lt; 55 m), both the FNE and SFE models were capable of fitting the data using parameters within the range of values determined from prior lab and field experiments at the site. These fits became poorer over increased transport distances however, where the models used could not account for the increased effects of tortuosity.</description>

   <description>Previously disturbed and regenerating forests make up a significant proportion of the North American land area, and therefore play an important role in the exchanges of heat and trace gases between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. Assessment of local to global variability in CO2 exchanges by forests requires a combination of CO2 measurements made by eddy covariance (EC), field measurements, remote sensing data, and ecosystem models. The integration of these is problematic because of a mis-match in scale between measurement techniques. Despite the importance of regenerating forests on the global carbon balance, the processes affecting the carbon cycle within these forests is not well understood. &#xd;
&#xd;
Airborne scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) instruments provide new opportunities to examine three-dimensional forest characteristics from the level of individual trees to ecosystems and beyond. Lidar is therefore an effective link between plot measurements, eddy covariance, and low resolution remote sensing pixels. This thesis dissertation presents new science on the use of airborne lidar for evaluating remote sensing products within heterogeneous and previously clearcut ecosystems. The goals of this thesis were to first understand the processes affecting CO2 exchanges within a previously disturbed boreal jack pine chronosequence located in Saskatchewan, Canada and then to apply this understanding to evaluate low resolution remote sensing data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using airborne lidar.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first objective of this dissertation examined the factors that control light use efficiency (LUE) within the jack pine chronosequence during dry and wet years. The second objective examined the importance of vegetation structure and ground surface elevation on CO2 fluxes within a mature jack pine forest. The third objective developed and tested a simple model of lidar fractional cover and related this to the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR). This was then used to evaluate the MODIS fPAR product across the lower part of a watershed. Finally, the fourth objective was to model gross primary production (GPP) from airborne lidar. Lidar estimates of GPP were then compared with those from the EC system at the jack pine chronosequence and with the MODIS GPP (Collection 5) product.</description>

   <description>Benzene is an ubiquitous pollutant and industrial solvent that has been identified as a human leukemogen. Early exposure to environmental carcinogens such as benzene has been postulated to play a role in the etiology of childhood leukemia, however the association remains controversial. Genotoxic agents such as benzene can cause an increase in the frequency of DNA double-strand breaks, which may remain unrepaired or result in the initiation of DNA recombinational repair mechanisms.&#xd;
The first objective was to investigate the induction of DNA double-strand breaks following in utero treatment to 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg benzene i.p. using the phosphorylated histone γ-H2A.X as a marker. Using immunoblotting, treatment with benzene did not increase the formation of γ-H2A.X in bone marrow cells of adult C57Bl/6N male mice and in maternal bone marrow, fetal liver, and post-natal bone marrow cells following in utero exposure to 200 mg/kg or 400 mg/kg benzene throughout gestational days 7 to 15.&#xd;
Secondly, the study investigated the induction of micronuclei following in utero exposure to benzene. Acute exposure to 400 mg/kg benzene resulted in a statistically significant increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells in adult male bone marrow cells. In utero exposure to 400 mg/kg benzene throughout gestational days 7 to 15 also caused a statistically significant increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells in maternal bone marrow and post-natal bone marrow cells. Fetal liver cells also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells following 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg benzene.&#xd;
The third objective was to investigate the initiation of DNA recombination following in utero exposure to benzene using the pKZ1 mutagenesis mouse model as a surrogate marker for non-homologous end joining activity. Adult pKZ1 mouse tissue yielded no recombination events; however, post-natal bone marrow cells did contain detectable recombination frequencies.&#xd;
iii&#xd;
In utero benzene exposure did cause an increasing trend in recombination events, and upon analysis of only the samples containing detectable levels of recombination, in utero exposure to 400 mg/kg of benzene caused a statistically significant increase in recombination frequency within this group.&#xd;
These results demonstrate that benzene does not increase the formation of γ-H2A.X after acute and in utero exposure, however, the induction of micronuclei following acute and in utero benzene exposure confirmed that benzene is a genotoxic agent causing chromosomal breaks. In utero benzene exposure increased the frequency of DNA recombination in bone marrow from post-natal day 9 pups exhibiting detectable levels of recombination. Further investigations into different types of DNA damage and repair pathways are warranted to fully elucidate the role of genotoxic mechanisms in the etiology of benzene-induced childhood leukemias.</description>

   <description>There are many opportunities to use engineering skills to improve the conditions for mar-ginalized communities, but our current engineering education praxis does not instruct on how engineering can be a force for human development.  In a time of great inequality and exploitation, the desire to work with the impoverished is prevalent, and it has been proposed to adjust the engineering curriculum to include a larger focus on human needs.  This proposed curriculum philosophy is called humanitarian engineering.&#xd;
&#xd;
Professional engineers have played an important role in the modern history of power, wealth, economic development, war, and industrialization; they have also contributed to infrastructure, sanitation, and energy sources necessary to meet human need.  Engineers are currently at an important point in time when they must look back on their history in order to be more clear about how to move forward.  The changing role of the engineer in history puts into context the call for a more balanced, community-centred engineering curriculum.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Qualitative, phenomenographic research was conducted in order to understand the need, opportunity, benefits, and limitations of a proposed humanitarian engineering curriculum.  The potential role of the engineer in marginalized communities and details regarding what a humanitarian engineering program could look like were also investigated.  Thirty-two semi-structured research interviews were conducted in Canada and Ghana in order to collect a pool of understanding before a phenomenographic analysis resulted in five distinct outcome spaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
The data suggests that an effective curriculum design will include teaching technical skills in conjunction with instructing about issues of social justice, social location, cultural awareness, root causes of marginalization, a broader understanding of technology, and unlearning many elements about the role of the engineer and the dominant economic/political ideology.  Cross-cultural engineering development placements are a valuable pedagogical experience but risk benefiting the student disproportionately more than the receiving community.  Local development placements offer different rewards and liabilities.  &#xd;
&#xd;
To conclude, a major adjustment in engineering curriculum to address human development is appropriate and this new curriculum should include both local and international placements.  However, the great force of altruism must be directed towards creating meaningful and lasting change.</description>

   <description>Although carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas is a serious environmental concern, it remains a valuable C1 source if viable methods are available for its conversion into useful products.  Herein, we present recent progress in the synthesis of aliphatic, aromatic, cyclic, and bicyclic beta-ketocarboxylic acids and the promising results from subsequent asymmetric hydrogenation to give beta-hydroxycarboxylic acids.&#xd;
&#xd;
For the synthesis of the beta-ketocarboxylic acids, we investigated the effects of temperature, reaction time, and amount of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU), which is a promoter for carbon-carbon bond formation with CO2.  The highest-yielding conditions for this DBU-promoted carboxylation reaction were used to carboxylate a number of aliphatic and aromatic substrates.&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to determine whether the hydrogenation reaction will effectively compete with the in situ decarboxylation of the beta-ketocarboxylic acids, 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor the rate of decarboxylation.  The solvent, electronic, and steric effect on the rate of decarboxylation was investigated by testing a variety of beta-ketocarboxylic acids.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using RuCl2{(S)-BINAP} catalyst precursor, we determined the effect that solvent, H2 pressure, base, and substrate substitution had on the enantioselectivity of the asymmetric hydrogenation.  CH2Cl2 and MeOH were determined to be the best solvents because of the high hydrogenation selectivity, high enantioselectivity, and decreased reaction times.  These standard conditions were used to hydrogenate the variety of aliphatic and aromatic beta-ketocarboxylic acids previously synthesized.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additional experiments, including deuterium labelling, were performed in an attempt to elucidate the hydrogenation mechanism and the actively hydrogenated tautomer.  These results lead us to believe that different reaction pathways occur in protic versus aprotic solvents.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results discussed herein represent the first in depth investigation of transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of beta-ketocarboxylic acids.  These results are very encouraging because enantioselectivities greater than 99 % were achieved for multiple beta-keto acids.  This synthesis is industrially advantageous due to the limited number of reactants required, their low-cost, and the potential for recycling unused materials.</description>

   <description>This phenomenological study examined the long-term significance of participation in elementary school musical theatre productions. The research aimed to explore the common and unique themes that emerged from adults recalling their childhood experiences, and how these experiences affected the development of musical and life-related skills. A questionnaire was used as the initial exploratory tool. It was distributed to a diverse group of 134 individuals, in retail, business and education settings, representing a stratified sample in two Ontario communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants to elicit further memories of significant experiences related to their participation in elementary school musical theatre. The data analysis revealed five core themes and qualities related to the elementary school musical theatre experience including community and gender roles. The most significant meaning of school musical experiences for the participants had little to do with the skills developed in the arts, but rather focused on an increased sense of community and growth in self-awareness and confidence. Suggestions for future research on other salient aspects of elementary school are offered to shed further light on this phenomenon, which appears to have life-long and deep effects on those who are able to participate in elementary school musical theatre.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation, I examine how IT can support individuals, and in turn their organizations, in learning about and knowing their external environment on the Web.  Specifically, I examine novel-knowledge discovery in the context of the multi-level organizational learning process, focusing on cognitive developments and changes to mental models.  Novel knowledge is defined as knowledge that is potentially strategically important to the organization, not currently known to the organization, indirectly relevant and therefore difficult to find. Novel knowledge is proposed to be one of three different types of knowledge that organizations seek to discover in their environment. A theoretical framework is developed to identify the sets of tool characteristics, collectively referred to as levels, which are proposed to support the discovery of different types of knowledge, as well as different modes of learning and learning processes.  In addition, extensions to the 4I organizational learning process model are proposed, specific to searching and learning on the Web: 1) adding a fifth process – information foraging and search-term development, and 2) adding a fourth level to the learning process – the machine-level.  A competing theories approach is used to develop a rich understanding of knowledge discovery and learning on the Web.  Understanding which types of tools are useful in different learning contexts has implications for learning effectiveness and may help firms understand how to “manage” their learning. Tools for the discovery of highly novel knowledge are less prevalent than tools to support the other levels of knowledge discovery. Accordingly, a design theory for novel-knowledge discovery tools is proposed based on organizational learning theories.  An instantiation of the design theory, a novel-knowledge discovery tool, is developed and tested within the organizational learning process and compared to tools at the other two levels of knowledge discovery.  In addition, different processes involved in using a novel-knowledge discovery tool at the group level are examined.  Three separate studies were conducted, including a lab and field experiment, and case study. The results are proposed to demonstrate how novel-knowledge discovery tools can support organizational learning.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-27 14:53:55.892</description>
   <description>The wrist extensor muscles have been implicated in a work-related upper limb disorder referred to as non-specific arm pain (NSAP), which has an unknown pathophysiology.  The primary objective of this thesis was to perform an electrophysiological evaluation of NSAP to gain a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Secondary objectives were to determine the utility and reliability of the decomposition-based quantitative electromyography (DQEMG) system used to examine NSAP. &#xd;
	The utility of the DQEMG system was first tested to determine whether physiological changes in muscles of healthy individuals performing low-level fatiguing contractions could be detected using this approach.  Next, the reliability of the outcome variables produced through this system was tested on healthy individuals performing low-level non-fatiguing contractions.  A case-control study was then performed using DQEMG to determine whether there were measurable changes in electrophysiological variables that suggest whether NSAP is myopathic or neuropathic in nature.  Finally, the case control study was repeated using a less invasive approach of electrophysiological evaluation to determine if this method might be equally useful in determining the pathophysiology of NSAP.&#xd;
Results revealed DQEMG can be effectively and reliably used to detect changes in the physiological characteristics of motor units that accompany fatigue. Specifically, decreases in mean motor unit firing rates along with increases in amplitude, duration, and area parameters of needle- and surface-detected motor unit potentials (MUPs) suggest that recruitment is a main cause of increased electromyographic amplitude parameters with fatigue.  Results of the reliability study suggested that DQEMG provides sufficiently consistent results to allow it to be effectively used for quantitative electromyographic (QEMG) analysis. In the first case control study, the QEMG parameters suggested that the underlying pathophysiology in NSAP may be myopathic in nature; specifically, QEMG findings for the NSAP group revealed smaller MUPs compared to the other groups. Lastly, the case control study using spike shape analysis across different levels of isometric wrist extension contractions was deemed to be useful in determining differences among the groups. This research suggests that NSAP may be myopathic in nature, since the NSAP group showed significantly lower mean spike amplitude and mean spike slope values compared to healthy subjects.</description>

   <title>Regulation of cation channel voltage- and Ca2+-dependence in Aplysia bag cell neurons</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-26 13:20:16.528</description>
   <description>Ion channel regulation is key to the control of excitability and behaviour.  In the bag cell neurons of Aplysia californica, a voltage- and Ca2+-dependent nonselective cation channel drives a ~30-minute afterdischarge, culminating in the release of egg-laying hormone.  Using excised, inside-out single channel patch-clamp, this study tested the hypothesis that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which is produced during the afterdischarge, and channel-associated protein kinase C (PKC), which is activated throughout the afterdischarge, cause a left-shift (enhancement) in both the voltage- and Ca2+-dependence of the cation channel.  &#xd;
Kinetic analysis of bag cell neuron cation channel voltage-dependence revealed that, with depolarization, the channel remained open longer and reopened more often.  A cation channel subconductance was also observed, and found to be 13 pS vs. the typical 23 pS full-conductance.  The cytoplasmic face of cation channel-containing patches was exposed to 1 mM ATP, as a phosphate source for channel-associated PKC, and/or 5 uM IP3.  Apparent PKC-dependent phosphorylation left-shifted voltage-dependence by -3 mV, although this effect was more prominent at negative voltages (between -90 and &#xd;
-30 mV).  Conversely, IP3 right-shifted voltage-dependence (change in V1/2 of 6 mV).  Cation channel Ca2+-dependence was similar to that previously reported, with a control EC50 of 3-5 uM.  This was right-shifted by PKC (EC50 = 30 uM) and even more so by IP3 (apparent EC50 = 20 M).  PKC largely rescued the Ca2+ responsiveness in the presence of IP3 (EC50 = 20 uM).  Unexpectedly, IP3 plus ATP resulted in an increase in channel unitary conductance at more positive voltages.&#xd;
The multi-faceted regulation of the bag cell neuron cation channel suggests sophisticated modulatory control.  Upregulation, such as depolarization and the left-shift in voltage-dependence with PKC, would drive the afterdischarge, while counteracting effects, such as IP3 right-shifting voltage-dependence, as well as PKC and IP3 suppressing Ca2+-dependence, would simultaneously or subsequently attenuate the channel, thus preventing an interminable afterdischarge.</description>

   <title>Motor imagery: does strategy matter?</title>

   <subject>Motor imagery</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-26 15:58:21.277</description>
   <description>Motor imagery requires individuals to form an internal representation of a specific action within working memory without any overt output. Motor imagery has proven effective in improving motor performance of specific skills. This study explored whether different motor imagery strategies influence corticospinal excitability in young (20-35 years) and older subjects (over 55 years).  In addition, the effectiveness of these strategies in targeting modulations in motor cortical output and whether the hand “performing” the task was important were also examined. Motor imagery ability was measured using the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) and mental chronometry. Working memory including visuospatial, verbal and kinesthetic domains was measured by immediate serial recall. To determine the effect of imagery on corticospinal excitability transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the contralateral motor cortex as subjects imagined abducting their index finger. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi muscles (ADM). As subjects performed motor imagery, they were guided by visual, auditory or a combination of visual and auditory cues. Strategies were introduced in randomized sequence interspersed with a rest and a muscle activation condition. Motor imagery ability and verbal working memory were comparable between young and older subjects (p > 0.05). In both groups, MEP amplitudes in the FDI muscle were significantly increased during motor imagery compared to rest regardless of the strategy used (p &lt; 0.001). Visual cueing was the most effective at isolating facilitation to the target muscle (FDI), whereas with the auditory and combined strategies both FDI and ADM muscles generated MEPs that were comparable in amplitude (p > 0.05). TMS induced MEPs were greater in amplitude when the left hemisphere was stimulated during motor imagery of the right finger while being guided by either auditory or visual cueing. In combination, these findings suggest that motor imagery increases corticospinal excitability and the strategy used may serve to target the facilitation.</description>

   <title>Considering childlessness:  an argument for the extrication of childbearing and motherhood from the concept of womanhood</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-27 00:43:24.991</description>
   <description>The stereotypical concept of womanhood is tethered to childbearing and motherhood.  Even though childlessness is becoming more common, the belief seems to be that all women must want and should have children as well as should assume the role of primary caregiver.  &#xd;
	I explore and argue against the belief that bearing and raising children is essential to the concept of womanhood.  I pinpoint four reasons why childbearing and motherhood are thought to be rightly tethered to the concept of womanhood:  that childbearing and mothering are the “norm” for women, that women’s potential to bear life is considered a sufficient and necessary condition to reproduce, that the presence of a “maternal instinct” means women want to bear children and they exhibit maternal behaviour, and that it is “natural” for women to want to procreate and mother.  &#xd;
	I then present a series of arguments showing why childbearing and mothering must be extricated from the concept of womanhood.   I focus on the concern that the concept of womanhood demanding procreation means a woman cannot independently meet the criteria for womanhood, the oversimplifying consequences of making a biological possibility a defining characteristic of women, the oppressiveness of prescribing the demanding role of motherhood to all women, and the freedom associated with the child-free life.  I argue against the existence of the maternal instinct and point to the coercive manner in which the term “natural” is employed.  After illustrating the social pressures women face to procreate and mother, I argue that such pressure would not be needed if procreation and mothering were indeed “natural” for women.  Allowing for the possible existence of the “maternal instinct” I argue that its existence is irrelevant in light of the wax and wane of the importance placed on what is “natural” and the ability of social pressures to overcome what is deemed “instinctual” and “natural”.  Finally, I argue that both a belief in the “maternal instinct” and the idea that wanting and raising children is “natural” undermine belief in women’s intelligence.</description>

Despite research on IS acceptance and continuance, little is known about individuals’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes and their associated outcomes after the initial adoption of a system. My research aims to address this shortcoming. In doing so, this dissertation combines novel theories – the ecological perspective based on ecological psychology and the emotional perspective based on neuroscience, physiological, and psychological research – with the current IS post-adoption literature – the deliberative perspective – to the study of IS use as an ongoing behavioral process that unfolds over time.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Two studies were conducted to investigate these processes and outcomes. The first study used an experience sampling method. Employees of different organizations who used IS for their work were asked to carry a booklet and a pager for two weeks. Every time they were paged, they were asked to fill out both open-ended and close-ended questions about their feelings, thoughts and performance at the moment in the booklet. The second study followed an experimental design in order to investigate the phenomena of interest in a more controlled environment. The experiment combined multiple sources of data: such as protocol analysis, heart rate data, and analysis of behaviors through video coding. The overall results from both studies suggest that users do not think about the IS nor experience feelings related to the IS unless they are facing a difficulty with it (e.g., an error). Furthermore, the results indicate affective and physiological changes following difficulties with an IS as well as changes in cognitive and behavioral processes. Finally, the results show a relation between these affective processes and self-reported performance, and a relation between some of the cognitive and behavioral processes and both objective and self-reported performance. &#xd;
&#xd;
Overall, this thesis provides a refreshing theoretical and empirical examination of the various events, processes and associated outcomes involved during actual IS use. The two empirical studies provide support for the theory of post-adoption IS use developed in this thesis. Finally, this thesis suggests exciting opportunities for future research.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-27 12:16:37.142</description>
   <description>Composite polymer particles were made of two or more polymers. If these polymers are incompatible, the particles after polymer phase segregation exhibit complex morphologies which determine their properties and applications. Such particles may have applications in both academia and industry. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, polystyrene (PS)/ poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate) (PCEMA) and poly(acetyloxyethyl methacrylate) (PAEMA)/PCEMA composite polymer particles are prepared by the evaporation of toluene from PS/PCEMA/toluene and PAEMA/PCEMA/toluene droplets dispersed in an aqueous solution containing surfactants. The surfactants used for the two systems are poly(glyceryl methacrylate)100-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)15 (PGMA100-b-PCEMA15) and poly(glyceryl methacrylate)300-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate-ran-acetyloxyethyl methacrylate)37 (PGMA300-b-P(CEMA-ran-AEMA)37), respectively, for the PS/PCEMA and the PAEMA/PCEMA systems. The morphologies of the PS/PCEMA and PAEMA/PCEMA composite particles are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results indicate that the particles are polydisperse and of nanometer size. For the PAEMA/PCEMA particles, the preferred morphology is hemisphere, while for the PS/PCEMA system the morphology is a mixture of acorn and occluded core-shell. Based on Gibbs free energy theory, and knowing the corresponding surface tensions and interfacial tensions, the thermodynamic equilibrium morphologies for both kinds of composite particles were found. Due to the uncertainty during measurements and calculations, and the influence of kinetic factors, the theoretical predictions agreed only partially with the experimental observations.</description>

   <description>Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have gained popularity at an unprecedented rate, at home, at work and in public hot spot locations. In this thesis, a Selectivity Function Scheduler (SFS) is proposed for IEEE 802.11e WLANs. The SFS aims at providing Quality of Service (QoS) assurance for different traffic types such as delay bound and throughput while maintaining fairness among flows and accommodating fluctuations of real-time applications. The SFS defines several functionalities that accurately analyze and compute the number of data frames at each traffic stream’s transmission queue, and allocate adaptive transmission opportunities (TXOPs) to traffic streams based on online observed physical rate instead of minimum physical rate. Moreover, the SFS incorporates a selectivity function (SF) that differentiates between traffic streams and assigns polling priorities accordingly. SFS appropriately calculates variable service interval lengths depending on actual traffic conditions. The SFS scheme is evaluated under different mixes of traffic and for various characteristics of the IEEE 802.11e and compared with the performance of the standard scheduler. Simulation results indicate that the SFS scheme achieves better system performance in terms of high throughput and low packet drop ratio, succeeds in providing QoS assurance for both constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) traffic. The SFS scheme also shows higher fairness among users of a same class, as well as between different classes.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-27 16:18:13.815</description>
   <description>This qualitative case study describes how two teachers translate communication messages from curriculum statements into classroom practice. These illuminative cases illustrate the perspectives and practices of two teachers who support the spirit of the Ontario Mathematics Curriculum by working to implement communication in the Foundations of Mathematics (MFM1P), Grade 9, Applied course (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2005). Data for this study were collected from individual interviews with teachers, classroom observations, and document analysis. Grade 9 Applied mathematics teachers across Ontario indicate on surveys that they support communication in the mathematics classroom (Education Quality and Accountability Office, 2007; Suurtamm &amp; Graves, in press). Despite evidence of support for this aspect of the curriculum, findings from this study point to a need for finer analysis of teachers’ perspectives and practices when it comes to communication in mathematics. The cases presented in this thesis illustrate different images, or meanings, associated with communication in mathematics. Furthermore, even in unique cases where the gap between curriculum developers and teachers images is minimal, the idealized vision of communication may not be realized in classroom practice since teachers may face challenges in implementation. The teachers report that despite additional challenges involved with implementing communication in Grade 9 Applied mathematics, teaching in this context can be a rewarding experience. To minimize the gap between images of communication that are translated from curriculum statements into classroom practice, findings from this study indicate that curriculum developers must find ways to help teachers understand the rationale behind curriculum initiatives. Future research might explore ways to help familiarize teachers with the theory and research underlying communication in mathematics. Research might also examine the impact that these initiatives have on teachers’ perspectives and practices.</description>

   <description>Over the past 10 years, internet use has become an integral part of adolescent&#xd;
socialization. Teenagers use the internet to communicate with known others as well as with&#xd;
strangers. They engage in online entertainment in the form of gaming and surfing the web.&#xd;
While adolescents mainly use the internet to maintain pre-existing friendships, some&#xd;
adolescents make close friendships online. They also encounter negativity online in the&#xd;
form of cyberbullying. Despite the pervasiveness of internet use, relatively little is known&#xd;
about long-term effects of internet activities on adolescent psycho-social adjustment. This&#xd;
group of studies aimed to identify change over time associated with various aspects of&#xd;
internet use. First, the long-term associations between different internet-based activities&#xd;
and adolescent social relationships were identified. Second, the differences between&#xd;
adolescents who form close internet-based friendships and those who do not were&#xd;
examined. Finally, the importance of internet-based bullying was identified. Overall,&#xd;
results suggest that while some internet-based activities are associated with increased&#xd;
positive effects, some internet activities are also associated with negative outcomes over&#xd;
the long term. Having close online friends as part of one’s peer group is associated with&#xd;
negative psychosocial factors. Cyberbullying was identified as a form of bullying that is&#xd;
associated with many important outcomes. The implications of these findings call for an&#xd;
increase in monitoring, involving not only supervision but direct communication, of&#xd;
adolescents’ internet activities, and increased communication in families about internet use.</description>

   <description>Objective: This study attempts to estimate the proportion of incident cases of bladder cancer in Ontario, Canada that is due to exposure to occupational carcinogens.&#xd;
Methods: The population attributable risk approach is used to estimate the proportion of bladder cancer in Ontario that is due to occupation.  Risk ratios were obtained from a review of epidemiologic literature using a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Summary risk estimates for each bladder carcinogen included were calculated using RevMan 4.2.  The CAREX Canada database provided Ontario-specific estimates of the proportion of workers exposed to bladder carcinogens. &#xd;
Results: In Ontario, the proportion of bladder cancer due to occupational exposure is approximately 5.6% (95% CI 0.2% to 14%).  Based on the incident number of bladder cancer cases in 2001 in Ontario, it is estimated that approximately 52 new cases of bladder cancer were due to occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), diesel exhaust, aromatic amines and 2-naphthylamine.  An alternate interpretation is if these occupational exposures were eliminated, 52 cases of bladder cancer per year in Ontario alone could be avoided.  &#xd;
Conclusion and Recommendations: The current study advances our knowledge of the extent to which specific occupational bladder carcinogens contribute to the overall bladder cancer burden in Ontario.  The current study highlights the utility of the CAREX Canada database in advancing current knowledge on the burden of occupational cancer in Ontario.  The methods used to estimate the proportion of bladder cancer attributable to occupational exposure in Ontario may be replicated to estimate the proportion of cancer in Ontario that is due to occupational exposure.</description>

   <description>Roughly speaking, a separating algebra is a subalgebra of the ring of invariants whose elements distinguish between any two orbits that can be distinguished using invariants.  In this thesis, we introduce the notion of a geometric separating algebra, a more geometric notion of a separating algebra. We find two geometric formulations for the notion of separating algebra which allow us to prove, for geometric separating algebras, the results found in the literature for separating algebras, generally removing the hypothesis that the base field be algebraically closed. Using results from algebraic geometry allows us to prove that, for finite groups, when a polynomial separating algebra exists, the group is generated by reflections, and when a complete intersection separating algebra exists, the group is generated by bireflections.  We also consider geometric separating algebras having a small number of generators, giving an upper bound on the number of generators required for a geometric separating algebra. We end with a discussion of two methods for obtaining new separating sets from old. Interesting, and relevant examples are presented throughout the text. Some of these examples provide answers to questions which previously appeared in print.</description>

   <description>A serious consequence of maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS): characterized by growth deficiency (both pre- and post-natal), craniofacial dysmorphology and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction.  However, in the absence of the characteristic facial features, and without confirmed history of alcohol exposure, clinical diagnosis remains a significant challenge.  Recently, the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) has been adopted to encompass all diagnoses relating to a history of prenatal alcohol exposure.  The purpose of this study was to test the following three general hypotheses: Children with FASD 1) demonstrate specific deficits in oculomotor control that can be measured using saccadic eye movement tasks, 2) display specific deficiencies in multiple domains of executive function that can be determined using standardized neuropsychological tasks, and 3) reveal deficits in oculomotor control that correlate with deficiencies in executive function as measured using standardized neuropsychological tasks.  A preliminary study revealed significant deficits in saccadic eye movement tasks and provided the foundation for a large, multi-centered study assessing oculomotor control and neuropsychological function in children with FASD.  A mobile laboratory was created, which facilitated recruitment of 92 control subjects and 89 subjects with FASD.  We found significant evidence for oculomotor deficits across multiple outcome measures following the saccadic eye movement experiments, especially for oculomotor tasks that probe aspects of executive function.  Additionally, children with FASD exhibited performance deficits in neuropsychological tasks that assess planning, attention, spatial working memory and strategy; cognitive skills also included within the domain of executive function.  Finally, significant correlations between these two objective measures were found for children with FASD, which were not evident in the control sample.  These findings are consistent with significant frontal lobe dysfunction.

   <description>Human pregnancy is characterized by significant increases in central ventilatory drive and perceived respiratory discomfort (breathlessness).  The physiological mechanisms of hyperventilation and breathlessness in pregnancy remain largely unknown and understudied.&#xd;
Objective:  The main purpose of this research was to elucidate the mechanisms of maternal hyperventilation, and to systematically examine the contribution of alterations in central ventilatory drive, static/dynamic respiratory mechanics and their interaction with respect to the intensity of perceived breathlessness during exercise in pregnancy.&#xd;
General Methods:  Experiments were conducted between 34-38 wks gestation and again 4-5 months post-partum in a total of 35 healthy, young women.  A comprehensive mathematical model of ventilatory control was used to examine the role of alterations in wakefulness and central chemoreflex drives to breathe, acid-base balance and female sex hormones in maternal hyperventilation.  The effects of pregnancy on detailed ventilatory (breathing pattern, airway function, operating lung volumes, esophageal pressure-derived indices of respiratory mechanics) and perceptual (breathing and leg discomfort) responses to incremental cycle exercise to the limits of tolerance were also examined.&#xd;
Results:  Maternal hyperventilation resulted from a complex interaction between alterations in arterial and central acid-base balance and other factors that directly affect ventilation, including increased wakefulness and central chemoreflex drives to breathe, increased metabolism and decreased cerebral blood flow.  Mechanical adaptations of the respiratory system, including recruitment of resting inspiratory capacity and reduced airway resistance, accommodated the increased demand for tidal volume expansion during exercise in pregnancy, while preserving effort-displacement and breathlessness-ventilation relationships.  Variation in the severity of gestational breathlessness could not be explained by respiratory mechanical/muscular factors, but ultimately reflected variation in the amplitude of maternal hyperventilation and temporal desensitization to the sensory consequences of increased ventilation.&#xd;
Conclusion:  Our results indicated that 1) the hyperventilation and attendant hypocapnia/alkalosis of pregnancy can be explained by alterations in wakefulness and central chemoreflex drives to breathe, acid-base balance, metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow; 2) mechanical adaptations of the respiratory system obviated the anticipated rise in perceived breathlessness for a given ventilation during exercise in pregnancy, and helped to ensure that peak aerobic working capacity was admirably preserved, even in late gestation; and 3) gestational breathlessness ultimately reflected the normal awareness of increased ventilation and contractile respiratory muscle effort.</description>

   <description>The development of intratumoral hypoxia is associated with resistance to therapy in many forms of human cancer, and pre-exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia confers multidrug resistance. Research over the last several years has led to considerable advances in the understanding of the cellular response to oxygen deprivation, however the hypoxia-induced mechanisms that contribute to the chemoresistance phenotype are still not well understood. Recent studies have identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a master transcriptional regulator of oxygen homeostasis, as an important mediator of hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in cancer cells. The research described in this thesis confirms these findings and demonstrates HIF-1 is required for hypoxia-induced resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide in human tumor cells. In addition, novel findings revealed that hypoxia-induced drug resistance occurred independently of changes in the apoptotic fraction and was associated with decreased drug-induced senescence. DNA damage measured at the single-cell level revealed that the increase in survival correlated well with a HIF-1-dependent decrease in etoposide-induced DNA strand breaks, providing direct evidence that exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia leads to protection against some forms of drug-induced DNA damage. Characterization of several classical mechanisms of drug resistance upstream of DNA damage identified multiple determinants of cellular resistance to anticancer agents. The relative contributions of each varied depending on the particular drug and cancer cell line studied. Together, the findings presented here support a model in which hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is a multifactorial phenomenon that is regulated, at least in part, through HIF-1-dependent mechanisms.</description>

   <description>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) alters neuronal regulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The superior mesenteric ganglia (SMG) contain sympathetic neurons that modulate GI functions such, as motility and blood flow. IBD reduces the release of noradrenaline, a sympathetic neurotransmitter.  We hypothesized that the reduction in NA release is due to inhibition of voltage-gated calcium current (ICa), as calcium influx is a regulator of neurotransmitter release.  We also hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a proinflammatory cytokine elevated during IBD, can also inhibit the ICa of SMG neurons. Therefore, we compared ICa amplitude in neurons from normal mice and mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS; 5% w/v)-induced colitis.  Neurons dissociated from the SMG were cultured overnight and changes to ICa were investigated using electrophysiological, Ca2+ imaging, PCR and neurotransmitter release techniques. Colitis significantly reduced ICa of SMG neurons by selectively inhibiting N-type Ca2+ channels.   This was accompanied by a reduction in mRNA encoding the N-type channel alpha subunit (CaV 2.2) and a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of activation of ICa.  Colitis reduced the NA release from the colon and jejunum.   Depolarization-induced release of tritiated-NA was inhibited by ω-Conotoxin GVIA (300 nM). These results suggest that the changes in VGCC observed at the cell bodies of SMG neurons were also occurring at the nerve terminals during colitis.  &#xd;
Similar experimental techniques were performed using SMG neurons incubated overnight in TNFα (1nM). TNFα decreased ICa and depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx in SMG neurons. Similar to DSS-induced colitis, the reduction in ICa was limited to N-type Ca2+ channels.   Preincubation of neurons with SC 514 (20μM) and Bay 11 7082 (1µM), inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B signaling, prevented the reduction in ICa. Preincubation with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, PD 169316 (30µM), recovered a smaller portion of the reduction in Ca2+ influx. These data suggest that DSS colitis and TNFα inhibit N-type VGCC ICa in sympathetic neurons and identify a novel role for NF-κB and p38 MAPK in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. These findings also suggest that DSS colitis inhibits NA release by altering sympathetic N-type VGCC in the colon and jejunum.</description>

   <description>The PICASSO project is a direct dark matter search experiment located 2070 metres underground in SNOLAB.  Superheated droplets of Freon (C4F10) are used as the active mass, providing a target for the incoming neutralinos.  Recoiling nuclei  deposit energy in the superheated Freon droplets, triggering a phase transition, the pressure waves of which can be detected using piezo-electric sensors.&#xd;
&#xd;
Previously published limits using an exposure of 1.98 +/- 0.19 kg day obtained a peak spin-dependent cross section exclusion limit for neutralino-proton interactions of 1.31 pb at a neutralino mass of 29 GeV/c^2 at a 90% confidence level.  Improvements in the detectors installed in the underground experiment have provided 20.99 +/- 0.25 kg day for analysis and improvements in the analysis method have produced an exclusion limit of 2.9 X 10^(-2) pb at a neutralino mass of 16.7 GeV/c^2.&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition, a thorough study of the backgrounds, corrections and systematic uncertainties has been included, indicating that this limit does not exceed 3.5 X 10^(-2) pb when considering the one sigma error on the uncertainty band.</description>

   <title>Toward the structure and function of carbon-phosphorus lyase enzymes</title>

   <description>Organophosphonates are characterized by a very stable carbon-phosphorus bond. Eshcherichia coli and many other strains of bacteria possess a multi-enzyme system called carbon-phosphorus (C-P) lyase that enables these organisms to cleave the C-P bond of organophosphonates when inorganic phosphate is scarce in the local environment. Genetic studies have demonstrated that C-P lyase is encoded by the fourteen-gene phn operon, phnCDEFGHIJKLMNOP. However, the mechanism for C-P bond cleavage is still unclear. We have expressed, purified, and characterized phnP from this operon. PhnP is a phosphodiesterase which will hydrolyze both bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate and 2’:3’-cyclic nucleotides as substrates. In collaboration with Dr. Zongchao Jia and Katarenya Podzelinska (Queen’s Biochemistry), we have crystallized phnP and solved the crystal structure at a resolution of 1.3 Å. The structure displayed similarity to zinc-dependent metallo-β-lactamase family proteins. However, phnP displays unique structural features with two metal binding sites per monomer: the active site containing potentially two manganese ions, and a ‘structural’ site coordinating one zinc ion. Potential active site residues were identified and corresponding point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Studies based on the importance of these residues and the knowledge from our high resolution structure will help elucidate the mechanism of phnP as well as its function in the C-P lyase pathway. Furthermore, we performed a broad range of ligand screening for phnH, another key member from the C-P lyase pathway, by ITC experiments, co-crystallization and high throughput ligand screening. However, all the trials for the identification of the true physiological substrate for phnH proved unsuccessful. Although the mechanism of C-P bond cleavage by C-P lyase still remains unclear, we synthesized a fluorescently labelled organophosphonate (FPn) and utilized it for probing the in vivo degradation of the C-P bond by wild type E. coli and various mutants. Analysis by TLC and mass spectrometry demonstrated the production of the expected alkane product. With this promising fluorescent probe, potential intermediates and substrates can be identified for individual C-P lyase enzymes. Taken together, our studies on the C-P lyase pathway will contribute to elucidate the still unknown mechanism of the cleavage of the stable C-P bond.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-06 13:54:23.707</description>
   <description>In this thesis, I undertake a study of skilled immigrant labour market integration in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) by examining the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC). TRIEC is a relatively new governance institution in the Toronto city-region established to address barriers preventing immigrants from gaining meaningful employment in their fields.&#xd;
Barriers include systemic discrimination, lack of credential recognition, and lack of Canadian work experience. TRIEC was created in response to a recommendation from the 2003 Toronto City Summit Alliance (TSCA) report Enough Talk. TRIEC is a multi-stakeholder organization that aims to engage employers to find solutions to address labour market barriers facing skilled&#xd;
immigrants in the GTA. This thesis examines some of these labour market barriers and the work of TRIEC and poses the following research questions: &#xd;
- What are the factors both impeding and facilitating the labour market integration of skilled immigrants in the GTA?&#xd;
- Has the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council model proven effective in terms of its impact on skilled immigrant labour market integration in the GTA?&#xd;
- What are possible solutions for addressing the challenges that impede the labour market&#xd;
integration of skilled immigrants in the GTA?&#xd;
To answer these questions, this thesis draws on insights from immigration geography literature, statistical and policy data, as well as fifty-seven (57) semi-structured interviews with a variety of key stakeholders in the GTA. The results point to TRIEC as a potential model to emulate for&#xd;
other large city-regions facing challenges with respect to labour market integration. In addition to highlighting TRIEC’s advantages, this thesis also provides recommendations at a more general&#xd;
societal level for improving skilled immigrant labour market integration in Canadian city-regions.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-29 16:19:29.922</description>
   <description>Increasingly, it is understood that in order to realize healthy cities the urban environment must include viable and accessible open space. In order for urban planning and development agencies to ensure the presence of open space within cities, it is necessary to understand what constitutes ‘quality’ open space and the impediments to its creation. The focus of this thesis is to further understand the issues surrounding planning and management of open space in the Msunduzi Municipality in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A case study of the Camps Drift Waterfront Project, a local open space area that is currently being developed, is investigated through both key informant interviews with relevant stakeholders and through a comprehensive survey of written information. The thesis reveals a further understanding of how open space is planned locally, the issues surrounding creating quality and accessible open space and the key areas for further research. Finally, this thesis highlights how the case study of Msunduzi can broaden the debates and concepts in open space theory and planning.</description>

   <description>Thorough understanding of the electronic and optical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) will no doubt benefit future technological applications. Since the discovery of band gap photoluminescence from isolated semiconducting SWCNTs, significant progresses in studying the optical properties of SWCNTs have been made (e.g. linear polarization along the tube axis for the absorption and emission of light, excitonic nature in SWCNT excitation). However, there are still several controversial parameters of SWCNTs (e.g. quantum efficiency, absorption cross section, radiative lifetime, and Auger recombination lifetime). With the advancement in SWCNT sample preparation, studies of SWCNT intrinsic properties have shifted from ensemble to a single tube level, in which the ambiguities in elucidating intrinsic properties posed by the assortment of different tube species can be minimized. By examining individual SWCNTs suspended in air, in contrast to micelle-encapsulated SWCNTs, we believe that the environmental effects can be reduced. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis will demonstrate the capability of doing spectroscopy on a single semiconducting air-suspended SWCNT. In continuous-wave excitation, the photoluminescence excitation map and high resolution photoluminescence (PL) image of a SWCNT can be constructed, and PL polarization is proven. Quantum efficiency of 5% is experimentally estimated for (9,8) and (10,8) chiral SWCNTs. Pulse excitation allows us to study the intrinsic exciton dynamics of a SWCNT. To gain insight into exciton nonlinear decay processes, PL saturation in pump power dependence measurement is investigated and compared to the simulated results from stochastic models of exciton dynamics. Femtosecond excitation correlation spectroscopy with 150 fs time resolution is employed to time-resolve the PL of a single tube suspended in air.</description>

   <description>The experiences of racial minority teacher candidates are often unheard in teacher education programs considering that the student population is increasingly diversifying and the teaching population does not reflect this dynamic.  In a country that is internationally known for its multicultural practices, it is important to examine the experiences of racial minority teacher candidates in order to gain a better understanding of the ways in which issues of race and power persist in our education system.&#xd;
     This qualitative study documents the experiences of a small group of racial minority teacher candidates who recently completed post baccalaureate teacher education programs at universities in Ontario, Canada.  With a particular focus on their practicum placements, the five participants were interviewed in order to bring to light their experiences of working and living in an education system that sustains, what has been called by critics, “a culture of whiteness.” &#xd;
     Over the course of the interviews, the five racial minority teacher candidates reveal that the often covert and overt forms of racism are systemic to the education system. It became obvious that in many cases, the participants did not consciously recognize the racism they encountered while working, living, and learning within the education system. Considering a culture of whiteness that is endemic in schools, power relations were further jeopardized and imbalanced by their race.  Despite this, the participants also exhibited forms of resistance to the Eurocentric culture that is so deeply entrenched in the education system.  Through an investigation of these themes, this thesis offers implications for future racial minority teacher candidates and anti-racist educators.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-29 14:18:10.308</description>
   <description>Alkyl-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (alkyl-PAHs) constitute more than 90% of the total PAHs in crude oil and are the main constituents toxic to fish. Little characterization of alkyl-PAHs has been reported and is needed to predict the effects of crude oil following spills.&#xd;
&#xd;
The objectives of this thesis were: (1) to evaluate the toxicity of alkyl-phenanthrenes and alkyl-anthracenes to the early life-stages of medaka (Oryzias latipes) using the partition controlled delivery of toxicants (PCD); (2) to investigate the effect of light on alkyl-anthracene toxicity; (3) to further characterize the PCD method; (4) to better understand alkyl-PAH mechanisms of toxicity; and (5) to identify the major phase I and phase II alkyl-PAH metabolites in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and in medaka by both in vitro and in vivo methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
It was determined that the toxicity of both series of alkyl-PAHs increased with the number of carbon substituents on the rings. Some alkyl-PAHs had EC50 values lower than the value from conventional semi-static exposure methods. These values were below the water solubility limit, consistent with the ability of PCD to correct for values from nominal concentrations above solubility. PCD provided stable concentrations for up to 17 days but could not always compensate for losses of alkyl-anthracenes by photodegradation.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both series of alkyl-PAHs were toxic through different mechanisms that resulted from their physical and chemical properties. Alkyl-phenanthrenes such as 7-isopropyl-1-methylphenanthrene (retene) were more toxic to medaka embryos than phenanthrene. The appearance of blue sac disease suggested toxicity enhancement through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway. Alkyl-anthracenes were toxic by narcosis in the absence of light and by phototoxicity in the presence of light. The photoproducts of alkyl-anthracenes were not toxic to fish.&#xd;
&#xd;
The in vitro phase I metabolism by rainbow trout CYP1a enzymes and in vivo phase II metabolism in rainbow trout produced alkyl-anthracenes metabolites substituted mainly on the ring system. The phase II in vivo metabolites of alkyl-phenanthrenes in medaka larvae were substituted mainly on their alkyl chains. For all alkyl-PAHs, a predominance of glucuronide conjugates was identified in the phase II metabolites.&#xd;
&#xd;
This characterization of the toxicity of alkyl-PAHs may contribute to predicting the toxicity of crude oil based on its composition.</description>

   <description>Objective: We aim to improve our understanding of sleep physiology by describing the&#xd;
changes in mandibular position during sleep in normal subjects. Methods: We developed&#xd;
a novel method for mapping mandibular position simultaneously in three dimensions&#xd;
(anteroposterior, vertical and lateral) using magneto-resistive sensors strategically placed&#xd;
around 3 different moving joints on an external apparatus attached to the head and&#xd;
mandible. Spherical coordinates derived from these sensors provided information of jaw&#xd;
position in each of the three measurement planes. We assessed changes in jaw position in&#xd;
twelve healthy subjects (6 male, 6 female) aged (mean ± SD) 23 ± 7 years, Body Mass&#xd;
Index 22.5 ± 3.4 kg/m2, and with nasal resistance 3.24 ± 0.67 cmH2O/L/s by recording&#xd;
mandibular position simultaneously with overnight sleep polysomnography. Results: Jaw&#xd;
position was significantly influenced by sleep stage (p&lt;0.001). The transition from wake&#xd;
to light sleep (stage one) was accompanied by significant jaw closure and jaw protrusion&#xd;
(p&lt;0.05). As non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep deepened from stages 1 through&#xd;
slow wave sleep (SWS), vertical jaw opening (p&lt;0.05) and posterior jaw movement&#xd;
progressively increased (p&lt;0.05). REM sleep was associated with the greatest degree of&#xd;
jaw opening of all sleep stages (p&lt;0.05). Lateral jaw position was not significantly&#xd;
different between sleep stages. Conclusion: This study describes, for the first time, an&#xd;
accurate method of measuring changes in mandibular position during sleep in all three&#xd;
dimensions. The observed changes during sleep in healthy subjects suggest a&#xd;
simultaneous modulation of upper airway muscular tone, which may be important in the&#xd;
understanding of upper airway occlusion in Obstructive Sleep Apnea.</description>

   <description>Carbon filled columns were built and tested as prototype radon filters. The length of time taken for&#xd;
a pulse of radon to travel from one end of the filter to the other was measured using nitrogen, and&#xd;
then air as the carrier gas. Its dependency on two variables were investigated: temperature of the&#xd;
tube and the flow-rate of carrier gas through the column. Using Height Equivalent to a Theoretical&#xd;
Stage (HETS) the carbon was found to have a adsorption constant (ka) of 9.7 ± 1.7 L/g at STP,&#xd;
and a binding energy value (Eb) of (30±1) kJ/mol. The radon concentration in the carrier gas was&#xd;
measured using a silicon detector housed in a metal chamber with a charged collector plate. Most filter &#xd;
tests measured Rn concentrations by measuring levels of the daughter atom 218Po. A&#xd;
computer simulation was created for aspects of both the working detector chamber and a prototype&#xd;
detector chamber. The charged fractions of 218Po and 214Po were calculated by comparing the&#xd;
Monte Carlo simulation to data obtained from the detectors. The positively charged fraction of&#xd;
218Po was found to be (80 ± 9)% and 214Po was (110 ± 180)%.</description>

   <description>Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has emerged to be a major field&#xd;
of research recently. Channel optimized vector quantization (COVQ)&#xd;
is a simple feasible JSCC scheme introduced for communication over&#xd;
practical channels.&#xd;
In this work, we propose an iterative design&#xd;
algorithm, referred to as the iterative maximum a posteriori (MAP)&#xd;
decoded (IMD) algorithm, to improve COVQ systems. Based on this&#xd;
algorithm, we design a COVQ based on symbol MAP hard-decision&#xd;
demodulation that exploits the non-uniformity of the quantization&#xd;
indices probability distribution. The IMD design algorithm consists&#xd;
of a loop which starts by designing a COVQ, obtaining the index&#xd;
source distribution, updating the discrete memoryless channel (DMC)&#xd;
according to the achieved index distribution, and redesigning the&#xd;
COVQ. This loop stops when the point-to-point distortion is&#xd;
minimized. We consider memoryless Gaussian and Gauss-Markov sources&#xd;
transmitted over binary phase-shift keying modulated additive white&#xd;
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. Our scheme,&#xd;
which is shown to have less encoding complexity than conventional&#xd;
COVQ and less encoding complexity and storage requirements than&#xd;
soft-decision demodulated (SDD) COVQ systems, is also shown to&#xd;
provide a notable signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) gain&#xd;
over the conventional COVQ designed for hard-decision demodulated&#xd;
channels while sometimes matching or exceeding the SDD COVQ&#xd;
performance, especially for higher quantization dimensions and/or&#xd;
rates.&#xd;
In addition to our main result, we also propose another&#xd;
iterative algorithm to design SDD COVQ based on the notion of the&#xd;
JSCC error exponent. This system is shown to have some gain over&#xd;
classical SDD COVQ both in terms of the SDR and the&#xd;
exponent itself.</description>

   <description>The cognitive processes underlying reading achievement in Chinese English immersion students are not yet clear. This study investigated the effects of phonological awareness (PA) and naming speed (NS) on reading achievement and explored the evidence for cross-linguistic transfer in Chinese English immersion students. In addition, the differences between immersion and non-immersion students on Chinese measures were examined. The participants were 135 English immersion students and 103 non-immersion students from Grades 2, 4, and 6 in mainland China. For English immersion students, English predictors proved to be strong predictors of English reading achievement at the three grade levels. However, the unique predictors of English reading achievement were English PA in Grades 2 and 4, but English NS in Grade 6. Chinese PA was a significant predictor of Chinese achievement, but only in Grade 2. There was little evidence of cross-linguistic transfer. With regards to the Chinese performance of the two groups of students, English immersion students demonstrated an advantage over non-immersion students in Grade 6, but no significant differences were found in Grades 2 and 4; these results suggest either the long-term effect of a bilingual program or a selection effect. Results are discussed in terms of theories of reading development, and suggestions are offered for overcoming the limitations of the present study in future research.</description>

   <description>Specialized in form and function, the sperm cell is a unique microsystem unto itself where in the cytoskeletal processes and structures of the somatic cell often find new purpose and characteristics within the sperm.  Unlike other cells in the human body, this unique cell polarizes and transforms itself from a line of germ cells to evolve into a functional, hydrodynamic haploid spermatozoon.  The success of fertilization is dependent on this haploid cell and its specially designed vesicular structure, the acrosome, which provides the leading edge of oocyte penetration.  To date, there is little insight into the mechanics of how acrosomic vesicles are successfully targeted and transported to the nuclear envelope and tether to its surface.  Our laboratory has identified a novel 15 kDa sperm specific histone variant, SubH2Bv, which possesses a distinct and functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) that associates with the acrosomic vesicle.  This study provides evidence that SubH2Bv’s bipartite NLS (an NLS with two basic domains linked together by 10-12 amino acid residues) is responsible for directing acrosomic vesicles to the nuclear envelope using the somatic import receptor, karyopherin alpha (Kap α).  Based on bipartite NLS-receptor conventions, where karyopherin alpha is known to specifically associate with this NLS-type, SubH2Bv would be the karyophilic cargo and karyopherin alpha would act as part of the underlying transport mechanism.  Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry characterized Kap α as a membrane-associated sperm protein that is co-localized with SubH2Bv around the proacrosomic granules and the acrosomic vesicle during spermiogenesis.  Their co-expression and co-localization, as demonstrated by immunolabelling, suggested a potential binding relationship that was confirmed by a His-tag-recombinant SubH2Bv-pull-down assay.  The co-developmental acrosomic expression of Kap α and SubH2Bv in haploid cells, combined with the pull-down evidence of their binding affinity, provides a compelling argument that these two proteins work in concert to traffic the acrosomic vesicles to the nucleus.  The exclusion of these two otherwise nuclear proteins from the nucleus, and their co-localization to the subacrosomal region in elongating spermatids, also implies a contingent role for SubH2Bv and Kap α in acrosomal docking,  that may involve the classical bipartite/Kap α nuclear import pathway.</description>

   <description>Using a social constructionist perspective, this thesis explores the development of the concepts of “parental alienation syndrome” and “false allegations” in the context of custody and access, as ‘social problems’. Following Joel Best’s framework for critically analysing social problems, it examines the life course of these concepts through an historical account of Canada’s divorce arena and recent changes to custody and access law. It analyzes the reasoning and motives of the major claimsmakers: the Fathers’ Right Movement, medical experts, the legal arena and the counter-claims of Feminist activists. It examines the role of the supervised access facilitator in the construction of the concepts as ‘social problems’. The theories of psychiatrist Richard Gardner are examined in particular, due to their pivotal role in the advancement of the claimsmakers’ goals. Finally, empirical studies are reviewed and analyzed, demonstrating how the concepts of “parental alienation syndrome” and “false allegations” have mutated and permeated the domain of divorce and access in Western society.</description>

   <description>The electronegativity of thiolate ligation in the hemeprotein nitric oxide synthase (NOS) proteins has been identified as an influence on autoinhibition in this enzyme.  The mutation of a conserved tryptophan residue, which hydrogen bonds to the coordinating thiolate ligand and therefore influences its electronegativity, to either phenylalanine or tyrosine has had various effects including heme loss and dimer disruption in the inducible isoforms, while hyperactivity occurs in the neuronal isoforms.  I have performed the analogous mutations in W180 of eNOSoxy, the endothelial isoform.  UV/visible and resonance Raman spectroscopy have demonstrated that the mutants experienced increased basicity of the thiolate due to loss of the hydrogen bond between the mutated residue in the absence of the cofactor (6R)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B).  The mutants also displayed relative rates of NO2- production that were comparable to the nNOSoxy mutants, which is consistent with the nNOSoxy results.  The presence of H4B alters porphyrin planarity, which enabled hydrogen bonding to occur in W180Y, thus restoring thiolate basicity to that of wild-type eNOSoxy.  Reduced overall activities by the proteins suggest that H4B stabilizes the heme.&#xd;
	The analogous W56 mutants of saNOS, a NOS oxygenase domain-like protein from Staphylococcus aureus (saNOS), have been previously characterized using resonance Raman spectroscopy.  These mutants also exhibit increased thiolate electronegativity over wild-type.  As the homodimers had already been investigated, saNOS was an ideal system in which to explore heterodimers.  Heterodimers were generated through the co-expression of one wild-type and one mutated subunit, enabling the examination of each subunit individually through resonance Raman spectroscopy.  The subunits of the resulting proteins were shown to have heme environments that resembled those of their corresponding homodimers.  The activity of saNOS did not vary significantly for the various W56 mutants, suggesting that saNOS catalysis may be unaffected by thiolate electronegativity.</description>

   <title>The Mammary Epithelial Cell-Specific Role of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR)γ in DMBA-Mediated Breast Tumourigenesis</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Pathology &amp; Molecular Medicine) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-04 11:45:16.472</description>
   <description>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, among women world-wide. Improved understanding of breast tumourigenesis may facilitate the development of more effective therapies. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ is a transcription factor that regulates the genes involved in insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis.  In vitro and in vivo studies also suggest that PPARγ suppresses breast tumour progression; however, the mechanisms remain to be clarified.  In the current study, I investigated the mammary epithelial cell-specific role of PPARγ in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-mediated breast tumourigenesis. Mammary epithelial cell-specific PPARγ knockout (PPARγ-MG KO) mice and their congenic, wild-type controls (PPARγ-WT) were treated with either DMBA alone or in combination with a PPARγ ligand (rosiglitazone)-supplemented diet, and followed for tumour formation. DMBA-mediated mammary tumour multiplicity decreased 4.5-fold among PPARγ-WT, but only 1.2-fold in PPARγ-MG KO mice upon co-treatment with rosiglitazone. Similarly, compared to respective DMBA alone groups, mammary tumour volumes were decreased, and onset was delayed, more among DMBA + Rosiglitazone treated PPARγ-WT versus PPARγ-MG KO mice. To assess whether DMBA could alter cell growth, in vitro studies using two human breast cancer cell lines were performed. Human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DMBA, rosiglitazone or both, and assessed for changes in proliferation, apoptosis and target gene expression. DMBA exerted minimal effects on proliferation; whereas, treatments induced apoptosis in MCF-7, and necrosis in MDA-MB-231, cells. The expression of MCF-7 PPARγ1 protein increased with all treatments, while MDA-MB-231 PPARγ2 protein and BRCA1 mRNA expression increased following rosiglitazone or co-treatment. This work advances our understanding of the mammary epithelial cell-specific role of PPARγ signaling in DMBA-mediated breast tumourigenesis, and supports a role for PPARγ activation in the suppression of breast tumour progression. These findings may assist with the development of more effective anti-breast cancer agents.</description>

   <description>The physical response of composite landfill liners consisting of a geomembrane on top of a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) are examined under simulated landfill conditions.  The deformation and strains of a 1.5-mm-thick high-density polyethylene geomembrane and thickness and hydraulic performance of a nominally 7-mm-thick GCL are quantified when the composite liner was buried beneath 50 mm coarse gravel, at applied pressures up to 1000 kPa, with a firm sand foundation layer, and with and without a wrinkle in the geomembrane.&#xd;
At an applied pressure of 250 kPa, with either no protection or conventional thick nonwoven needle-punched geotextile protection layers, the tensile strains in the geomembrane exceeded a 3% allowable limit and the GCL was reduced in thickness to as little as 2.2 mm from extrusion of bentonite beneath a gravel particle.  Whereas a 150-mm-thick sand protection layer limited strains in the geomembrane to 0.1% and prevented extrusion in the GCL so that deformation was from bentonite consolidation and not from extrusion. &#xd;
A GCL with a thickness of less than 3 mm from extrusion was shown to be susceptible to failure from internal erosion of bentonite in the GCL at hydraulic head differences across the GCL between 1-10 m.  Conversely with the sand protection layer, the GCL could withstand a head difference of greater than 100 m without any evidence of internal erosion.  Further, the permittivity of an extruded 3.5-mm-thick GCL was found to be 4.5 times larger than a 7-mm-thick GCL that did not experience extrusion.</description>

   <description>A practical engineering design problem is used to examine the over-conservativeness of designs obtained using deterministic optimization with worst-case parameter assumptions and a safety factor. Additionally, an attempted application of reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) demonstrates the limits of RBDO for practical problems. The design problem considered here is TESCO's Internal Casing Drive System (ICDS), which is used in feeding pipeline, or casing, into predrilled holes.&#xd;
After developing a finite element model of the ICDS, experimental data is used to successfully validate modeling methods and assumptions. The validated model is then subjected to multiple analyses to determine an appropriate design configuration to be used as the starting point for optimization. Worst-case, safety factor-based design optimization (SFBDO) is then applied considering two and three design variables, and is successful in increasing the critical load of the ICDS, Pcrit, by 35% and 45%, respectively.&#xd;
An efficient and recognized RBDO method, Sequential Optimization and Reliability Assessment, is selected for application to the design problem to determine an optimum design based on reliability. Due to the optimization formulation, however, SORA cannot be applied. The ICDS design problem represents a practical example that demonstrates the difficulties and limits in applying RBDO to practical engineering design problems.&#xd;
To evaluate the over-conservativeness of worst-case SFBDO, structural reliability analysis is performed on the deterministic optimum designs. It is found that the value of Pcrit for both the two and three variable optimum designs can be increased by 53% while maintaining acceptable probability of failure, demonstrating the over-conservativeness of the worst-case SFBDO.</description>

   <description>Zr-2.5Nb is currently used for pressure tubes in the CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) reactor.  A complete understanding of the deformation mechanism of Zr-2.5Nb is important if we are to accurately predict the in-reactor performance of pressure tubes and guarantee normal operation of the reactors. This thesis is a first step in gaining such an understanding; the deformation mechanism of ZrNb alloys at room temperature has been evaluated through studying the effect of texture and microstructure on deformation.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In-situ neutron diffraction was used to monitor the evolution of the lattice strain of individual grain families along both the loading and Poisson’s directions and to track the development of interphase and intergranular strains during deformation. The following experiments were carried out with data interpreted using elasto-plastic modeling techniques: 1) Compression tests of a 100%Zr material at room temperature. 2) Tension and compression tests of hot rolled Zr-2.5Nb plate material. 3) Compression of annealed Zr-2.5Nb. 4) Cyclic loading of the hot rolled Zr-2.5Nb. 5) Compression tests of ZrNb alloys with different Nb and oxygen contents.&#xd;
 &#xd;
The experimental results were interpreted using a combination of finite element (FE) and elasto-plastic self-consistent (EPSC) models.  The phase properties and phase interactions well represented by the FE model, the EPSC model successfully captured the evolution of intergranular constraint during deformation and provided reasonable estimates of the critical resolved shear stress and hardening parameters of different slip systems under different conditions. The consistency of the material parameters obtained by the EPSC model allows the deformation mechanism at room temperature and the effect of textures and microstructures of ZrNb alloys to be understood.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work provides useful information towards manufacturing of Zr-2.5Nb components and helps in producing ideal microstructures and material properties for pressure tubes. Also it is helpful in guiding the development of new materials for the next generation of nuclear reactors.  Furthermore, the large data set obtained from this study can be used in evaluation and improving current and future polycrystalline deformation models.</description>

   <description>Recent theory on the role of celebrity in a contemporary context emphasizes the unique manner in which celebrity pervades public discourse.  This thesis examines the interrelationship between celebrity and disaster theory in order to evaluate the extent to which celebrity had access to public and media discourse about Hurricane Katrina.  Attention is also focused on the ways in which celebrity was manifested within this discourse.  Social constructionism is employed here as the theoretical lens through which celebrity and disaster merge.  With regard to methodology, qualitative elements of Altheide’s (1987) ethnographic content analysis are used to decipher the claims made by and about celebrity within the Katrina news media narrative.  In order to address questions of context, Fine’s (1997) adaptation of Smelser’s (1962) value-added model is used to identify some of the structural considerations from which these claims emerge. &#xd;
From this examination, three substantive themes emerge: (1) Gabler’s (1998) celebrity theory offers a suitable approach to the examination of the intersection between celebrity and Hurricane Katrina; (2) Due to the character of this assessment, constructionist applications which consider not only the role of claims-makers but the structural context of claims-making activities provide the most comprehensive framework; (3) The pervasiveness of celebrity in the contemporary context, combined with the dissensus surrounding the Katrina event, allowed celebrities to adopt unique roles within the Katrina narrative.</description>

   <description>Commissioned in 1865 for London’s South Kensington Museum (now the V&amp;A), the Green Dining Room was conceived during an exciting period in Victorian Britain, when idealistic artists and architects elevated the status of the decorative arts in fine art circles, promoted the ideal of joy in labour, and sought beauty in the everyday.  The Green Dining Room is considered a quintessential example of an early decorative scheme by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., a collective of artists who helped to inspire Britain’s Arts and Crafts movement through their products and their principles of art manufacture.  It is adjoined by two other refreshment areas: one designed by James Gamble (a salaried employee of the museum) and the other by Edward Poynter (a promising young painter with an affinity for the decorative arts).  The three rooms manifest varied, even conflicting, opinions on the cultivation of design.  They indicate how different design professionals hoped to see their art progress.  However, the rooms were not simply artistic statements.  They were also functioning dining areas for the use of guests and employees of the museum.  By assessing the aims of the South Kensington administration, the ambitions of the designers who contributed to the museum’s fabric, and the impressions of Victorians who witnessed the results, I will illustrate how the Green Dining Room occupies a unique position in the history of nineteenth-century design reform.</description>

   <description>The polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is an alternative method for producing electroluminescence (EL) from conjugated luminescent polymers. The in situ electrochemical doping process that leads to a dynamic p-n junction makes the devices highly insensitive to device thickness and relatively insensitive to electrode materials. These characteristics make an extremely large planar configuration accessible for observing the cross-section of the device and watching it turn on dynamically. By cooling the device to freeze ionic motion, the junction can be stabilized and photovoltaic (PV) characteristics investigated. In the planar configuration, the p-n junction was found to make up a small fraction of the inter-electrode spacing. Enabled by the insensitivity to electrode materials, small metallic particles embedded in the LEC film led to a large number of p-n junctions that could be turned on in series and parallel. This alleviates the issue of low specific emitting area suffered by planar devices and leads to improved EL effciency as well as a high open circuit voltage (Voc) when operated as a PV cell. The bulk homojunction fabrication process has been optimized by segregating the metallic particles to eliminate large aggregates. A new technique to achieve highly uniform EL from large planar LECs is also presented here. By the evaporation of a thin gold or silver film on top of an LEC, independent islands form that act as doping initiation sites across the device width. A bulk homojunction is turned on in the top layer of the LEC with a high applied bias. Island diameters and spacings are several orders of magnitude smaller than the particles in previously-reported bulk homojunction devices. Both island and particle devices had their interelectrode spacings scaled down by at least a factor of 10. The successful scaling is a promising result for the possibility of a sandwich configuration bulk homojunction device. In the case of silver island devices, cooling a 50-micron wide device after turn-on resulted in a PV cell with an open circuit voltage of 8.3 V, several times the band gap of the luminescent polymer used.</description>

   <description>Global awareness of environmental issues such as climate change and resource depletion has grown dramatically in recent years.  As a result, there has been a surge of interest in developing alternative building techniques and materials which are capable of meeting our structural needs with lower energy and material consumption.  These technologies are particularly attractive for housing.  Much of the global demand for housing is currently being driven by economic growth in developing countries.  Additionally, natural disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami have destroyed houses in many countries where limited economic wealth makes reconstruction a challenge.  This has resulted in shortages of permanent housing in these areas.&#xd;
	This thesis explores the structural behaviour of earthbag housing under vertical compressive loading, in an attempt to broaden our quantitative understanding of this alternative building technique.  Furthermore, this technique is assessed, along with other alternative construction techniques, for suitability in southern Sri Lanka, an area heavily damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.&#xd;
It was determined that the compressive strength of unplastered earthbag housing specimens meets or exceeds the vertical compressive strength of conventional stud-frame housing technology using a variety of fill materials, with the greatest strength being observed for soil-filled bags.&#xd;
Furthermore, the results of observational research from a site visit to Sri Lanka in 2006, combined with resource availability data and interviews with Sri Lankan citizens, suggest that earthbag housing is a very promising technique for housing construction in the southern coastal region.</description>

   <description>Capturing the mechanism of gene regulation in a living cell is essential to predict&#xd;
the behavior of cell in response to intercellular or extra cellular factors. Such prediction capability can potentially lead to development of improved diagnostic tests and therapeutics [21]. Amongst reverse engineering approaches that aim to model&#xd;
gene regulation are Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). DBNs are of particular&#xd;
interest as these models are capable of discovering the causal relationships between&#xd;
genes while dealing with noisy gene expression data. At the same time, the problem of discovering the optimum DBN model, makes structure learning of DBN a challenging topic. This is mainly due to the high dimensionality of the search space of gene expression data that makes exhaustive search strategies for identifying the best DBN structure, not practical.&#xd;
In this work, for the first time the application of a covariance-based evolutionary search algorithm is proposed for structure learning of DBNs. In addition, the convergence time of the proposed algorithm is improved compared to the previously reported covariance-based evolutionary search approaches. This is achieved by keeping a fixed number of good sample solutions from previous iterations. Finally, the proposed approach, M-CMA-ES, unlike gradient-based methods has a high probability to converge to a global optimum.&#xd;
To assess how efficient this approach works, a temporal synthetic dataset is developed. The proposed approach is then applied to this dataset as well as Brainsim dataset, a well known simulated temporal gene expression data [58]. The results indicate that the proposed method is quite efficient in reconstructing the networks in both the synthetic and Brainsim datasets. Furthermore, it outperforms other algorithms in terms of both the predicted structure accuracy and the mean square error of the reconstructed time series of gene expression data.&#xd;
For validation purposes, the proposed approach is also applied to a biological&#xd;
dataset composed of 14 cell-cycle regulated genes in yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.&#xd;
Considering the KEGG1 pathway as the target network, the efficiency of the proposed&#xd;
reverse engineering approach significantly improves on the results of two previous&#xd;
studies of yeast cell cycle data in terms of capturing the correct interactions.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-09 12:20:52.184</description>
   <description>We present new submillimetre images of the dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10, taken&#xd;
with the Submillimeter Bolometer Common-User Array, mounted on the James Clerk&#xd;
Maxwell Telescope. Combining this new data with archival data from the 2MASS&#xd;
survey, ISO, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, and the VLA, we plot the observed spectral energy&#xd;
distributions from 1.24 μm to 850 μm for two star forming regions within IC 10,&#xd;
namely IC 10 SE and IC 10 NW. The spectral energy distributions were subsequently&#xd;
modelled using a dust model with PAHs, and silicate and graphite dust grain components.&#xd;
This is the first time that well-constrained spectral energy distribution models&#xd;
of two individual regions within IC 10 have been presented. From our results, we find&#xd;
that IC 10 SE and IC 10 NW share the same physical characteristics in most cases,&#xd;
such as the gas-to-dust mass ratio, the mass fraction of PAHs comprising the total&#xd;
dust mass, and the fraction of PAHs that are ionised. The most significant difference&#xd;
is seen in the peak wavelengths of the SEDs, which are ~70 μm and ~45 μm for&#xd;
IC 10 SE and IC 10 NW, respectively. From this we conclude that the primary dust&#xd;
component within IC 10 NW is warmer than that of IC 10 SE, due to the hot young&#xd;
stars at the heart of the star forming region within IC 10 NW having a larger heating&#xd;
effect on the nearby dust than the interstellar radiation field. The similar environments of these two regions lead us to suggest that the star formation taking place within them was triggered by the same starburst, and that both stellar populations evolved together.&#xd;
We also find that IC 10 has physical conditions that are common amongst other low-metallicity,&#xd;
dwarf irregular galaxies, implying that IC 10 does not have an abnormal&#xd;
interstellar medium in these regions.</description>

   <description>Pervasive Computing presents an exciting realm where intelligent devices interact within the background of our environments to create a more intuitive experience for their human users. We demonstrate enabling context-awareness through our creation of a standardized context-management framework. Our framework moves towards device intelligence by supporting context-awareness. &#xd;
&#xd;
Context-awareness is what gives devices the ability to understand and exchange information about each other. Context information is used to determine device purpose, capabilities, location, current state, and other properties. &#xd;
&#xd;
Several elements are required in order to achieve context-awareness, including a suitable ontology, a context model, and a middleware platform upon which to implement the context model. In this work, a complete context-management framework is presented and evaluated. We propose our own ontology specification and context model, and implement a middleware using the Web Services Distributed Management (WSDM) interoperability standard.</description>

   <title>Experimental and Numerical Investigations into Optimal Partial Concrete Filling of FRP and Steel Tubular Poles</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-10 22:38:37.671</description>
   <description>Glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubular poles can be superior to conventional poles, in that they are lighter in weight and more durable. Thin-walled tubular poles, however, tend to fail in flexure by local buckling, before fully utilizing the high tensile strength of GFRP. Increasing the wall thickness would solve this problem, but at a significant material cost. A simple and economical solution is to partially fill the tube with concrete. The aim of this study is to establish the optimal length of concrete filling that is required to achieve the highest moment capacity at a minimum dead weight in cantilevered GFRP and steel poles. &#xd;
The study comprises experimental and numerical phases. Six 3660 mm long and 220 mm in diameter GFRP tubes of 4.15 mm wall thickness as well as four 1855 mm long and 114 mm in diameter steel tubes of 3 mm wall thickness, were filled with concrete of varying lengths, ranging from zero to a 100% of the span. The tubes were tested to failure in cantilever bending. The completely filled tubes achieved nearly double the strength of the hollow ones. Furthermore, it was found that the optimal ratio of concrete filling length was 0.34 and 0.46 of the span, for the GFRP and steel tubes, respectively. This is defined as the minimum filling length required to achieve the capacity of the completely filled tube.&#xd;
Numerical models have been developed to predict the behaviour of partially concrete-filled GFRP and steel tubes as well as the optimal filling ratio. The models incorporate other models developed for hollow and completely filled tubes and account for the slight non-linearity of multi-layer GFRP tubes, concrete, and steel plasticity. An important feature of the models is their ability to account for ovalization and local buckling of the hollow part of thin tube. The models were successfully validated and used in a parametric study to investigate the effects of key parameters, namely diameter-to-thickness (D/t) ratio, GFRP laminate structure and steel yield strength. It was shown that the optimal filling ratio increases as D/t ratio is reduced or as more GFRP fibres become oriented longitudinally. However, it was unaffected by the steel yield strength.</description>

   <description>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to characterize a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surface with covalently attached proteins. Protein-terminated PMMA surfaces have possible applications as substrates for bio-reactive surfaces or biosensors. The PMMA surfaces were first aminated using hexamethyldiamine; the resulting –NH2 sites were reacted with the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-EMCS. The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester terminal and maleimide terminal groups of Sulfo-EMCS can react with surface amine groups and sulfhydryl-containing proteins respectively. A surface that has covalently bonded with such proteins is interesting, as it may be used to develop techniques to compare the mechanical properties of proteins that have similar functions, but different structures. This study characterizes Thermotoga maritima β-glucosidase 1 (TmGH1), which belongs to a family of proteins that facilitate hydrolysis of glucose-related monomers with retention of conformation. The resulting surfaces were characterized by XPS to monitor surface composition and coverage. Tapping and contact-mode AFM methods were used to image the surface and obtain force curves. Data that suggests the creation of a covalently bonded surface of TmGH1 on PMMA has been obtained, as well as force curves using dodecanethiol-terminated AFM tips that suggest specific unfolding events when a mechanical force is applied to TmGH1. These results have applications to the further investigation of protein folding and unfolding mechanisms of family GH1 proteins using AFM-related techniques.</description>

   <description>Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of vulvodynia affecting 12% of pre-menopausal women in the general population. It is commonly described as a sharp or burning pain at the entrance of the vagina in response to contact or pressure to the vulvar vestibule. PVD has negative impacts on sexual functioning, relationship adjustment, psychological well-being, and overall quality of life. Studies suggest that increased muscle tension in the pelvic floor of women with PVD may play an important role in maintaining and exacerbating their pain. Despite this finding, no prospective studies of pelvic floor physiotherapy (PFP) for PVD have been carried out. The purpose of the current study was to prospectively examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive PFP intervention in treating the physical and psychosexual components of PVD. Thirteen women with PVD completed 8 sessions of PFP. Women were assessed at pre- and post-treatment via gynecological examinations, vestibular pain threshold testing, structured interviews and standardized questionnaires measuring pain variables (pain during intercourse, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Pain Disability Index), cognitive variables (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale-20, coping strategies), and sexual function (frequency of intercourse, Female Sexual Function Index). To-date, ten women have also completed a 3-month follow-up interview. Results indicated that vestibular pain thresholds significantly increased from pre- to post-treatment, indicating reduced pain sensitivity. As compared with pre-treatment, women reported significant reductions in pain intensity during the gynecological examination and during intercourse. Women also significantly improved on measures of negative pain cognitions and various components of sexual function. There were no changes with respect to mental health or quality of life. The treatment was considered to be successful for 10 (77%) of the 13 women and treatment satisfaction was rated very high. Predictors of successful treatment outcome at the follow-up period were a longer period of time in treatment and decreases in pain catastrophizing and pain-related anxiety. Results provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of PFP in treating the physical and psychosexual components of PVD. These findings indicate the need for large-scale, randomized studies of the effectiveness of PFP in comparison and in conjunction with other treatment options.</description>

   <description>Control of the contact force between a robot manipulator and a workpiece is critical for successful execution of tasks where the robot’s end effector must perform a contact operation along the contour of a workpiece.  Representative tasks include polishing, grinding and deburring.  Considerable research has been conducted on force control with electric robots.  By contrast, little research has been conducted on force control with pneumatic robots.  The later has the potential to be considerably cheaper.  However, the compressible nature of air as the working fluid and relatively high friction means pneumatic robots are more difficult to control.  The subject of this thesis is the design and testing of a controller that regulates the normal contact force and tangential velocity of the end effector of a pneumatic gantry robot while tracking the contour of a planar workpiece.  Both experimental and simulation results are presented.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A PI Force Velocity (FV) controller for contour tracking was designed and tested experimentally.  Three different workpiece edge geometries were studied: straight, inclined and curved.  The tracking performance with the PI FV controller was comparable to the performance reported by other researchers with a similar controller implemented with an electric robot.  This result confirms the potential of pneumatically actuated robots in force control applications.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A system model was developed and validated in order to investigate the parameters that affect performance.  A good match between experiment and simulation was achieved when the friction of the z-axis cylinder was modeled with a Displacement Dependent Friction Model (DDFM) instead of a Velocity Dependent Friction Model (VDFM).  Subsequently, a DDFM based friction compensator was designed and tested.  However, it was found that performance could not be improved even with perfect friction compensation, due to the effects of system lag.&#xd;
&#xd;
Two Neural Network (NN) compensators were designed to compensate for both the lag and friction in the system.  Simulation results for straight and curved edges were used to examine the effectiveness of the NN compensators.  The performance of the PI FV controller was found to improve significantly when a NN compensator was added.  This result confirms the value of NN’s in control compensation for tracking applications with pneumatic actuation.</description>

   <description>Phosphoryl transfer reactions are vital to life. In response to the slow intrinsic rates of phosphoryl transfer, Nature has evolved a series of enzymes designed to accelerate these reactions and allow them to occur at biologically relevant rates. These metallo-enzymes are largely characterized by bi- or tri-nuclear active sites with effective dielectric constants that more closely resemble those of organic solvents than water. This project was designed to better understand the mechanisms by which metallo-enzymes cleave phosphodiesters with poor leaving groups.  The stability of the phosphodiester is central to the storage of genetic information in DNA and RNA. The cleavage of a series of more reactive RNA models, 2-hydroxylpropyl aryl phosphates 1a-g, catalyzed by a dinuclear Zn(II)2 complex of 53 in methanol was explored. A solution of 53:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3) was observed to accelerate the decomposition of 1a-g with rates that were 10^11-10^12-fold greater than the methoxidepromoted reaction at ss pH 9.47, approaching rate accelerations achieved by natural enzymes.  The remarkable activity of 53:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3) and 36:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3) towards the cleavage of 1a-g probed the study of the decomposition of diribonucleotides(3'->€™ 5')UpU and (3'->€™ 5'€™)ApC in methanol. The 53:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3)- and 36:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3)-catalyzed decomposition of UpU achieved k2 values of 1.21 ± 0.17 and (7.04 ± 0.99) x 10^-2 M^-1s^-1. The reactivity of ApC in the presence of these systems was unimpressive, however Zn(II) ions in ethanol resulted in the isomerization of 3'->€™ 5'€™)ApC to (2'->™ 5'€™)ApC providing support for the existence of a pentacoordinate phosphorane intermediate.  The pentacoordinate phosphorane was further explored through the reaction of 36:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3) with the cyclic phosphate 58 and 2-hydroxylpropyl methyl phosphate (59). In the presence of 36:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3) the rate of isomerization of 59/59a (kobs = (4.7 ± 0.5) x 10^-3 s^-1) exceeded that of expulsion of the methoxy group (kobs = 1.62 x 10^-3 s^-1), thus confirming the existence of a pentacoordinate phosphorane intermediate (60)and providing support for a two-step phosphodiester cleavage reaction.  The catalytic efficiency of 36:Zn(II)2:(-OCH3) towards the cleavage of stable phosphodiesters probed its application towards the decomposition of dimethyl phosphate (2) in methanol-d4. The exchange of OCH3 for OCD3 occurred with kcatmax = (2.27 ± 0.03) x 10^-6 s^-1.</description>

   <description>The currents generated by excitatory and inhibitory synapses on motoneurons can be amplified by noradrenalin and serotonin. Both of these neurotransmitters act, and interact, via the same Gq-protein second-messenger system to modulate L-type Ca++, persistent-Na+, and leak K+ channels on motoneuron dendrites. However, noradrenergic and serotonergic synapses only modulate nearby excitatory and inhibitory synapses, so their relative distributions play a major role in the regulation of the overall output of the motoneuron. Moreover, the relative proximity between noradrenergic and serotonergic synapses may allow their individual effects to combine nonlinearly when co-activated, thereby regulating the magnitude of the amplification. The goal of the present study is to determine whether the distributions of noradrenergic and serotonergic synapses are biased along motoneuron dendritic trees.&#xd;
&#xd;
The dendritic trees of five intracellularly stained feline splenius motoneurons were reconstructed. On them were plotted the locations of noradrenergic and serotonergic contacts, as determined by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of noradrenergic contacts was moderately biased both dorsally and distally in all five cells. Serotonergic contacts on the same neurons showed a moderate ventral bias. These findings suggest that excitatory and inhibitory inputs located dorsally and/or distally are preferentially amplified by noradrenergic synapses. Also, those synapses which are located ventrally are favorably amplified by serotonergic synapses. Both serotonergic and noradrenergic contacts are strongly biased towards innervation along small diameter (&lt;2μm) dendrites.&#xd;
&#xd;
The relative distributions between serotonergic and noradrenergic contacts have also been analyzed for all five cells. There was a bias towards minimizing the distance between like contacts (NE to NE and 5-HT to 5-HT). This increases the likelihood of interaction within populations when contacts are co-activated. Conversely, the distances between neighbouring noradrenergic and serotonergic contacts (NE to 5-HT and 5-HT to NE) were biased towards greater separation. This decreases the likelihood of interaction between populations when contacts are co-activated. &#xd;
&#xd;
In summary, these findings suggest that noradrenalin and serotonin, having different location biases along the dendritic tree, will amplify some synapses in a biased manner. Additionally, like synapses may work in a coordinated manner with respect to their relative proximity. Coordination between noradrenergic and serotonergic synapses is less likely.</description>

   <description>This paper looks at liberal multiculturalism through the lens of its cosmopolitan critics.  In particular I examine the arguments of four theorists who issue a variety challenges to the concept of state-sanctioned minority rights.  The first two of these theorists, K. Anthony Appiah and David Hollinger, offer cosmopolitan challenges to multiculturalist views on identity (Appiah) and historical critiques of the effects of racial and ethnic political claims-making (Hollinger).  My analysis attempts to show how these views are indicative of distinctly a American emphasis on race and immigration which inhibits them from a better appreciation of the Canadian experience with national minorities, one of liberal multiculturalism's main concerns.  The third theorist, Patchen Markell, presents a theory of incomplete individual agency the acknowledgment of which he argues is necessary for an adequate political theory yet remains unappreciated by proponents of recognition.  I attempt to show that while his concept is useful, it is simply misplaced to the arguments he wishes to criticize.  The fourth theorist whose work I examine is Seyla Benhabib.  She presents a more substantial account of what cosmopolitan minority claims might look like, relying on a postnational view of world affairs which eschews the state-centric approach of liberal multiculturalism.  I largely reject her criticisms, but I argue that this postnational vision is one that could have implications for liberal multiculturalism.  I finally offer a modest account of what these implications might be and where the terrain of this multiculturalist-cosmopolitan debate may be headed.</description>

   <title>The role of the visual train ornament in the courtship of peafowl, Pavo cristatus</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-12 16:29:20.772</description>
   <description>The peacock (Pavo cristatus) has long been considered the quintessential example of a sexually selected animal, and in the last two decades, peafowl have provided widely-cited evidence for female mate choice as well as the genetic benefits of mate preferences for ornamented males. However, previous studies have failed to reach a consensus with respect to the importance of various signaling modalities in peafowl courtship. In this thesis, I repeat two previous studies of peacock train morphology and I describe the use of light by males during their courtship displays, to clarify the role of visual signaling. I confirm previous reports that removing a large number of eyespots decreases male mating success, yet I find substantial variation in mating success among normal males that cannot be explained by eyespot number. I show that these two apparently conflicting results are not contradictory, since the removal treatment modifies males beyond the normal range of eyespot number. Next, I describe the two display behaviours used by males during courtship. When males perform their pre-copulatory “train-rattling” display, they are oriented at about 45° relative to the sun on average, with females directly in front. This directional pattern suggests that train-rattling is involved in the communication of a visual signal. The “wing-shaking” display, on the other hand, is performed with females positioned behind males, and is always elicited when a model female is positioned on the shaded side of a male. The wing-shaking display may therefore allow males to control female viewing geometry. These results indicate that mate choice in peafowl is complex, and that visual signaling is important despite recent claims to the contrary. Females may avoid males missing a large number of eyespots via a threshold-based mechanism, while choosing among full-trained males based on some other (possibly visual) cue.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-14 10:48:10.178</description>
   <description>Style conventions are specialized ways of performing a given activity (e.g., dressing, eating, etc.) that have minimal practical significance, but play a crucial role in signaling ones membership or status within a particular social community. The primary goal of this study was to examine whether preschool-aged children would adhere to a novel style convention simply given information that the style was shared by others. A secondary goal was to investigate whether the way that the information about the style convention was framed would affect their adhering to that convention. Forty-eight five-year-olds and 48 three-year-olds were shown a novel apparatus and given a basket of yellow and orange balls. The simple game consisted of putting the balls into the apparatus, which made the apparatus light up. In a fully between-subjects design, half of the participants participated in the focal “convention” condition, in which they were then told that using one colour of balls was the norm. Half of the children in the convention condition received this information in inclusionary terms (ie. everybody uses orange), and half in exclusionary terms (ie. nobody uses yellow). Children’s performance in these focal conditions was compared with that of children who participated in control conditions in which the experimenter’s ball choice was explained by statement of her preferences (i.e. I like to use only orange/I don’t like to use yellow). The main finding was that when playing the game themselves, 3-year-olds were significantly more likely to systematically select target-coloured balls in the convention than in the preference control condition, whereas 5-year-olds did not show systematic performance in either. There was also a significant condition x frame interaction, whereby children were more likely to systematically select target balls in the preference exclusion frame than in the preference inclusion frame. These results show that explicit information about a shared style is sufficient to promote adherence to style conventions in 3-year-old children, though, perhaps not 5-year-olds. These findings are discussed with respect to the mechanisms that guide children’s acquisition of conventional forms across domains.</description>

   <title>Developmental, but not activational, roles for estradiol and its receptor in paternal and sexual behaviour of Phodopus campbelli males</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-15 10:52:00.161</description>
   <description>The neuroendocrine basis of paternal behaviour is hypothesised to be homologous to that of maternal behaviour, with the expression of paternal behaviour resulting from the activation of estrogen-sensitive pathways in the brain. However, despite the fact that Phodopus campbelli fathers are highly paternal, previous studies have failed to identify an activational role for estradiol in the expression of this behaviour. The goal of this thesis was to exclude or define a role for estradiol in P. campbelli paternal behaviour. &#xd;
In the first study, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression was examined in three brain regions relevant to maternal behaviour (medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial amygdala). Male and female P. campbelli and its close relative P. sungorus were sampled as sexually naïve adults, following mating to satiety, or as new parents. As predicted, new fathers of either species did not upregulate ERα expression in these brain regions. Mating also had no effect on ERα expression in males or females from either species. However, ERα expression was also not upregulated in any of the three brain regions in new mothers. Thus, it is possible that estradiol does not play a primary role in activating maternal behaviour in Phodopus females. &#xd;
In the second study, P. campbelli males were administered the aromatase inhibitor letrozole at three different developmental stages (independence from the mother, testicular maturation, and sexually naïve adult) and tested for adult sexual and paternal behaviour. Aromatase inhibition during juvenile development resulted in diminished expression of adult paternal and sexual behaviour, suggesting that estradiol acts at critical periods in development to organize the paternal brain for subsequent behavioural responses. Treatment of sexually naïve adults did not alter male behaviour, which further supports previous evidence that estradiol does not activate paternal behaviour in P. campbelli males, although sexual behaviour in females is completely estradiol-dependent in this species. These findings suggest that the activational roles of estradiol in maternal and male sexual behaviour identified in the rat do not generalize to Phodopus, and imply greater species to species variation in the neuroendocrine control of these behaviours than previously suspected.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, German) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-15 11:26:19.721</description>
   <description>This thesis analyses the role of animal symbolism as a reflection on the zeitgeist of the 19th century. The three works Die schwarze Spinne (1842) by Jeremias Gotthelf, Der Schimmelreiter (1888) by Theodor Storm and Effi Briest (1895) by Theodor Fontane show how animals are used to convey what the stylistic restrictions of the epoch do otherwise not allow for.&#xd;
The first chapter analyses the animal image of the “black spider.” The picture is a powerful tool to highlight patriarchal fear, local legends and beliefs of a small community in contemporaneous Switzerland. The second chapter represents the allusions of  animals such as a horse or a cat, which represent  suppressed human motions. Used in this way, they express the pessimism and alienation of humankind that is read as social criticism. The third chapter demonstrates an example of the virtuous character of a  dog through which the deep crisis of the society and humanity at that time is mirrored.&#xd;
The use of the animal figures in Realism proves a deep connection of humankind to nature. The imagery generates new perspectives on the crisis of the  era, for which religious dilemmas, isolation and alienation of the individual in society are characteristic.</description>

   <title>Explaining Copyright: The Normative Implications of its Sociotechnical Construction</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-30 14:55:33.895</description>
   <description>The construction of copyright law can be causally explained by two possible types of explanation: dialectical explanations and material explanations. I argue that an adequate causal description of the copyright discourses of Western legal systems must incorporate a material explanation in order to account for many of the general and particular characteristics of the evolution of copyright. As a vast variety of contingent and interactive social and technical conditions have caused the evolution of copyright, we should expect a plausible material explanation to be multifaceted and multi-layered.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, in addition to providing a causal sociohistorical description, a good legal explanation should also seek to include a normative account detailing the moral grounds of the law, or lack thereof. Dialectical explanations can be teleological: they can presuppose that the law is directed towards a perfect legal state and that it is essentially guided by a set of moral ideals. Material explanations, on the other hand, are essentially non-normative and do not explicitly address moral questions. But this does not entail the elimination of moral considerations from material explanations.&#xd;
&#xd;
As I aim to show, we should not address the moral and sociohistorical elements of copyright legal discourses independently because they are causally connected: moral justifications have been rhetorically used by social actors to influence lawmaking processes, and conversely, changes in technical conditions have given rise to sociotechnical formations that enable and structure the norms of copyright. Given this, I propose that lawmakers should adjudicate and legislate from a broad and flexible standpoint. They should not attempt to merely apply old principles to new problems, but should comprehend new moral norms introduced by new conditions, and balance them against the older, more established principles enshrined in traditional intellectual property theories.</description>

   <description>The RET receptor tyrosine kinase has essential roles in cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. Oncogenic activation of RET causes the cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), and is a frequent event in sporadic thyroid carcinomas. Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (MEN 2B), a subtype of MEN 2, is caused primarily by a methionine to threonine substitution of residue 918 in the kinase domain of the RET receptor (2B-RET), however the molecular mechanisms that lead to the disease phenotype are unclear. In this study, we show that the M918T mutation causes a 10 fold increase in ATP binding affinity, and leads to a more stable receptor-ATP complex, relative to the wildtype receptor. We also show that 2B-RET can dimerize and become autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand. Our data suggest that multiple distinct but complementary molecular mechanisms underlie the MEN 2B phenotype and provide potential targets for effective therapeutics for this disease.&#xd;
In the second part of the study, we identified a novel β-catenin-RET kinase signaling pathway which is a critical contributor to the development and metastasis of human thyroid carcinoma.  We show that RET binds to, and tyrosine phosphorylates, β-catenin and demonstrate that the interaction between RET and β-catenin can be direct and independent of cytoplasmic kinases, such as SRC.  As a result of RET-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, β-catenin escapes cytosolic downregulation by the APC/Axin/GSK3 complex and accumulates in the nucleus, where it can stimulate β-catenin-specific transcriptional programs in a RET-dependent fashion.  We show that downregulation of β-catenin activity decreases RET-mediated cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumour growth in nude mice. &#xd;
Finally, we used a structure guided approach to identify and characterize a novel, non-ATP competitive, RET inhibitor; SW-01. We show that SW-01 provides significant RET inhibition in an in vitro kinase assay using purified RET. Moreover, RET phosphorylation is blocked, or dramatically reduced, in vivo in cells overexpressing active RET. We observe a significant decrease in cell proliferation and colony formation in RET-expressing cells in the presence of SW-01.  Together, our data suggest that SW-01 has potential as a novel RET kinase inhibitor with clinical utility.</description>

   <description>Aristotle argues in Chapter 2 of Book I of the Politics that the polis exists by&#xd;
nature. I argue that this notion of a natural polis, what I call the Naturalness Thesis, is fundamentally important to Aristotle's political philosophy. The Naturalness Thesis is discussed in only one place by Aristotle, and it is found alongside two further claims—the claim that humans are the most political animal and the claim that the polis is naturally prior to the individual. Together these three ideas constitute Aristotle's political naturalism. I begin by examining the relationship between the Naturalness Thesis and the&#xd;
other two claims. I argue that the Naturalness Thesis is the central idea in Aristotle's political naturalism. I then proceed to defend the argument Aristotle gives in support of the Naturalness Thesis from David Keyt's critique of it. Keyt argues that Aristotle's argument is unsuccessful and that, furthermore, Aristotle himself has reason to believe&#xd;
the polis exists by art rather than nature. Because of this, Keyt believes that there is a blunder in Aristotle's political naturalism. I argue that it is Keyt, and not Aristotle, who blunders. Keyt makes the mistake of interpreting Aristotle's account of the rise of the polis out of the village and household as an account of three distinct social arrangements. As I see it, Aristotle is instead suggesting that village, household, and polis are three&#xd;
stages in the development (or growth) of one thing, namely the polis. That is, households&#xd;
and villages are essentially the same (they contain the same form) as the polis, though&#xd;
they are underdeveloped. Finally, I expound on the Naturalness Thesis by interpreting Aristotle's account of the rise of the natural polis from a number of perspectives. First, the account is sociobiological: Aristotle's polis is literally a naturally living thing.&#xd;
Second, the account is historical: it alludes to other accounts of prehistory and reveals Aristotle's ascription to the theory of a perpetual rise and fall of civilization. Third, the account is ethical: it seeks to break down the distinction between nomos (=law) and phusis (=nature) to ground politics in nature.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of decomposition-based quantitative electromyography (DQEMG) in detecting signs of motor unit loss and collateral sprouting in compression neuropathy. In order to accomplish this, needle- and surface-detected motor unit potential (MUP) morphological features, determined by DQEMG, were used to determine evidence of collateral sprouting. Evidence of motor unit loss was measured using motor unit number estimates (MUNEs). &#xd;
Six subjects with severe carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), eight subjects with mild CTS and nine healthy individuals with no known neuropathy participated in this cross sectional study. All subjects completed two phases of data collection: 1) an examination consisting of physical and electrophysiological tests to assess the presence and/or severity of CTS and 2) quantitative electromyography techniques to record MUNEs and MUP morphological characteristics. The needle-detected MUP parameters included peak-to-peak amplitude, duration and number of phases. The presence of satellite potentials was also investigated in the needle-detected MUPs. The surface-detected MUP parameters examined included peak-to-peak amplitude, duration and negative peak area. Kruskall-Wallace tests were used to determine group differences for all outcome measures.&#xd;
The MUNEs were lower (p&lt;0.017) in the severe CTS group as compared to those with mild or no CTS. This result suggests that individuals with severe CTS experience a decrease in the number of functioning motor units. Despite statistically similar surface-detected MUP morphology, there were significantly larger needle-detected MUP amplitudes (p&lt;0.017) and satellite potentials (p&lt;0.05) were present in the severe CTS group as compared to the mild CTS group and healthy control group. These findings suggest there is collateral reinnervation in individuals with severe CTS. The results of this study support the use of DQEMG in future studies of compression neuropathies as an effective means to document the progression of motor deficits.</description>

   <description>The focus of this thesis is to estimate evacuation vulnerability in a non-specific evacuation context. Three measures were calculated to evaluate the evacuation vulnerability of locations within Frontenac County, Ontario: population/capacity ratios, link removal analysis and the composite vulnerability measure. By utilizing both population/capacity ratios, as typified by Cova and Church (1997), and link removal analysis, a composite estimate of vulnerability can be determined. The composite vulnerability measure integrates the population/capacity ratios and the link removal analysis to examine the effect of link unavailability on evacuation difficulty. Subsequently, a linear regression analysis is utilized to estimate these complex measures incorporating simple variables. These include population, road and dead-end densities. The advantage of a regression analysis is that it can be used in any situation and for any given area.&#xd;
This research demonstrates that evacuation vulnerability of a network is of key importance for identifying which parts of a populated area may need plans put into place before the necessity of an evacuation occurs. Certain road configurations are shown to be more vulnerable than others, particularly neighbourhoods with a limited number of exits. Overall, the composite vulnerability measure identifies areas of increased and decreased vulnerability throughout Frontenac County. This regression analysis demonstrates a spatial pattern of calculated vulnerability values similar to those predicted based on the regression equation. Importantly, the regression analysis has demonstrated that it might be used to identify vulnerable areas in a simpler manner.</description>

   <description>The relining of deteriorated gravity flow and pressure pipes with polymeric liners is now popular practice. In the water industry, health concerns and challenges associated with re-opening water services in a lined small diameter pipe have limited the use of liners. Sanexen Environmental Services Inc. in Montreal, Canada, manufactures a cured-in-place liner system which can restore water service connections after lining from within the pipe, using a remote controlled robot.&#xd;
&#xd;
The installation of the liner within cast iron water pipes can result in the formation of geometric imperfections (wrinkles) as the external diameter of the liner often exceeds the internal diameter of the host pipe. Previous studies have suggested that the wrinkles have a detrimental effect on the structural performance of the liner. In this study, experimental and analytical investigations were conducted to evaluate further the effect of the wrinkles on the circumferential (hoop) strength of the liner.&#xd;
&#xd;
The experimental investigation involved testing 33-25 mm wide ring samples of the liner with and without wrinkles, using the split-disk test method which is defined by ASTM Standard D2290. The laboratory tests were conducted to examine the effects on the response of the liner of loading rate, cyclic loading, and presence of different wrinkle configurations. A series of two-tailed Mann-Whitney statistical tests were conducted on the obtained test data. The analytical investigation examined the behavior of two of the three types of wrinkles observed in the liner using finite element models. The results from the models were evaluated using the experimental results.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study confirmed that the wrinkles were a source of weakness in the liner as failure was initiated at the wrinkle in all the test samples. It also showed that their presence may or may not result in a reduction in the ultimate hoop tensile capacity of the liner depending on wrinkle pattern. The loading rate had no significant effect on the first cracking load of the resin within the wrinkle. However, lower ultimate hoop tensile capacities were observed at very slow loading rates. Under the 50-year cyclic loading, the resin within the wrinkle was susceptible to cracking while the jackets of the wrinkle remained intact.</description>

   <title>Development and Application of Non-Tapered Electrospray Emitters for Nano-ESI Mass Spectrometry</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-17 19:07:12.847</description>
   <description>Nano-ESI mass spectrometry is an attractive analytical technique due to its high sensitivity and small sample consumption, which is especially important for research areas such as proteomics. However, current nano-ESI emitters become a bottleneck for nano-ESI to be widely applied because of problems such as clogging, poor robustness, large flow resistance, and poor spray efficiency for highly aqueous solutions. The objective of this thesis study is to address the problems associated with tapered emitters and provide alternative solutions by developing advanced nano-ESI emitters. Two strategies that were explored to improve the clogging resistance and robustness while maintaining comparable electrospray performances include the development of emitters with larger apertures and multiple channels. &#xd;
Following these strategies, five types of emitters were fabricated without tapering either internal or external diameters, which include a roughened open tubular emitter, a porous membrane-assisted emitter, a microstructured multiple channel photonic crystal fiber (MSF) emitter, a packed ODS bead emitter, and an entrapped ODS bead emitter. The successful transformation of MSF fibers to nanoelectrospray emitters demonstrates a new practical approach to expand the application of nano-ESI because of its availability, compatibility, precisely controlled channel dimensions, variety of channel patterns, and feasibility for surface modification.  &#xd;
The fundamental mechanism of non-tapered emitters was studied at nano flow rates. The fact that a plume of mist, instead of single Taylor cone, is generated from multiple channel emitters at nano flow rates suggests multiple Taylor cones may be formed. The calculated sensitivity gains from a MSF emitter compared to a single-tip tapered emitter are related to the number of the orifices containing on a MSF emitter. &#xd;
The characterization of impacts of operational parameters on nanoelectrospray performances shows that non-tapered emitters are more robust and less dependent on the emitter’s fine positioning. It was also found that unlike tapered emitters, non-tapered emitters can be positioned ten times further from the orifice of a mass spectrometer, which is greatly beneficial to online sample manipulation and purification. Furthermore, the electrospray efficiency of spraying highly aqueous solutions (e.g. 90%) was greatly improved through the hydrophobic modification of a MSF emitter exit.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-17 12:37:48.16</description>
   <description>A biostimulation field trial was conducted to determine the effect of nutrient addition on microbial populations in a fractured rock environment. The ultimate goal of this research is to induce bioclogging in rock fractures as a method of in situ containment and remediation of contaminated groundwater. This trial focused on biostimulation of indigenous bacteria in a single fracture through the addition of bioavailable carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources.&#xd;
&#xd;
Bench-scale experiments were conducted to determine the optimal source and concentration of nutrients for microbial growth. The final mixture selected for the field trial consisted of sodium lactate plus two liquid fertilizers, resulting in a 100:9:4 molar solution of bioavailable carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus with a carbon source concentration of 8.9 g/L.&#xd;
&#xd;
The field trial was conducted in an uncontaminated area adjacent to an abandoned quarry in southern Ontario, Canada. The geology of the site consists of flat-lying dolostone pervaded by bedding plane fractures, with minimal overburden. An arrangement of three boreholes isolated a single fracture at a depth of 17m using straddle packer systems. A groundwater recirculation system was created with groundwater withdrawal at BH7 and reinjection of amended water at BH9.&#xd;
&#xd;
Throughout the three-week biostimulation experiment, general groundwater parameters, including temperature, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity, were monitored frequently. Geochemical and microbiological conditions including available electron acceptors, biochemical oxygen demand, heterotrophic plate counts, and microbial diversity were evaluated before and after the experiment.&#xd;
&#xd;
Monitoring results for the withdrawal well confirmed that nutrient delivery was occurring, albeit with substantial mass loss due to incomplete flow field development. Numerical modelling of the system estimated a nutrient mass loss of 29%. Geochemical monitoring of key electron acceptors suggested that redox conditions in the isolated fracture were greatly affected by nutrient addition. Biological data indicated significant changes in the microbial populations, with heterotrophic plate counts increasing significantly in the isolated fracture. Changes in microbial diversity were also observed through 16S rDNA analysis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis results indicated substantial diversification and growth of the microbial community following biostimulation. Further research will investigate the potential for bioclogging at a NAPL-contaminated fractured bedrock site.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we consider a wireless network consisting of d source-destination pairs&#xd;
and R relaying nodes. Each source wishes to communicate to its corresponding destination.&#xd;
By exploiting the spatial multiplexing capability of the wireless medium, we&#xd;
develop two cooperative beamforming schemes in order to establish wireless connections&#xd;
between multiple source-destination pairs through a collaborative relay network.&#xd;
Our first communication scheme consists of two steps. In the first step, all sources&#xd;
transmit their signals simultaneously to the relay network. As a result, each relay receives&#xd;
a noisy faded mixture of all source signals. In the second step, each relay transmits&#xd;
an amplitude- and phase-adjusted version of its received signal, i.e., the relay&#xd;
received signals are multiplied by a set of complex coefficients and are retransmitted.&#xd;
Our goal is to obtain these complex coefficients (beamforming weights) through minimization&#xd;
of the total relay transmit power while the signal-to-interference-plus-noise&#xd;
ratio at the destinations are guaranteed to be above certain pre-defined thresholds.&#xd;
Our second scheme is a distributed downlink beamforming technique which is&#xd;
performed in d + 1 successive time slots. In the first d time slots, the d sources&#xd;
transmit their data to the relay network successively. The relay nodes receive and&#xd;
store the noisy faded versions of the source signals. In the (d + 1)th time slot, the&#xd;
relays aim to collectively provide downlink connections to all d destinations. To do so, each relay transmits a linear combination of the stored signals received during the&#xd;
first d time slots. Again, our goal is to determine the complex weights (used at the&#xd;
relaying nodes to linearly combine the source signals) by minimizing the total relay&#xd;
transmit power while satisfying certain quality of services at the destinations.&#xd;
We use semi-definite relaxation to turn both problems into semi-definite programming&#xd;
(SDP) problems. Therefore, they can be efficiently solved using interior point&#xd;
methods. We showed that our proposed schemes significantly outperform orthogonal&#xd;
multiplexing schemes, such as time-division multiple access schemes, in a large range&#xd;
of network data rates.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
Background:&#xd;
     Many studies have demonstrated that health is a function of relative and not absolute income within populations. Canadian studies are not conclusive. There is a need for further investigation of the ‘relative income’ hypothesis in the Canadian population.&#xd;
Objectives:&#xd;
     The primary objective of this research was to test the “relative income” hypothesis across Canadian health regions. The second objective was to extend the first hypothesis to consider rural versus urban populations in Canada.&#xd;
Methods: &#xd;
     This research involved ecological analyses. The source of the data was the Canadian Community Health Survey, CCHS 2005 cycle 3.1. The units of analysis were health regions of Canada. Health of a region was estimated as the percentage of people who rated their health as good or excellent. The primary exposure variable was the ratio of people whose personal income was less than $15,000 relative to those reporting more than $80,000. Correlation analyses and multiple linear regressions were performed to ascertain the relationship between income inequality and health status in populations, adjusting for important covariates. &#xd;
Results:&#xd;
     The measure of relative income inequality alone appeared to explain 18 per cent of the variability in the measure of health status in populations. However, after adding the measure of absolute income to the model, although 29 per cent of the variability was explained, the independent contribution of the inequality measure became non-significant. Linear regression models suggested that the absolute income variable alone could explain 30 per cent of the variance in the health status of populations. Other variables with a statistically significant contribution to the final multiple regression model were education and alcohol consumption. &#xd;
Rural/urban status did not change the individual relationship between relative income inequality or absolute income and the measure of health status in populations. &#xd;
Conclusion:&#xd;
     Across Canadian health regions, health status in populations was a function of absolute income but not relative income. Regions with higher levels of education had better levels of self-rated health. A larger percentage of heavy drinkers was also correlated with lower population health status. The study findings have implications for public health, economic policies, and social policies.</description>

   <description>There has been a recent paradigm shift in the study of animal communication from&#xd;
examining interactions as dyads to considering interactions as occurring in a&#xd;
communication network. The dawn chorus of songbirds, a striking acoustic phenomenon,&#xd;
provides an ideal opportunity to study network communication because multiple singers are within range of each other, permitting eavesdropping by both males and females. I used a 16-microphone Acoustic Location System (ALS) to simultaneously record and analyse the dawn chorus in a population of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) breeding in eastern Ontario.&#xd;
Males frequency-match neighbours 24% of the time at dawn, more often than expected by chance or during daytime singing interactions. The amount of matching&#xd;
between males from different over-wintering flocks is significantly greater than between&#xd;
flockmates. Males of the same winter dominance rank match significantly more than do males of disparate ranks. Male black-capped chickadees are interacting vocally with neighbours at dawn, using the dawn chorus to mediate social relationships in ways that suggest useful information is available to the network of male and female receivers.&#xd;
Matching levels are not related to distance between opponents. However, males with&#xd;
non-fertile mates move over larger areas while chorusing and are further from their nest than males with fertile mates, suggesting dawn mate guarding. Males with non-fertile mates spend more of their chorus near boundaries with fertile neighbours than non-fertile neighbours possibly positioning themselves to facilitate eavesdropping by fertile females.&#xd;
Male chickadees of high and low winter social rank do not differ in either the size of their communication network, or the way they use their songs when interacting with neighbours. Males match multiple neighbours both sequentially and simultaneously.&#xd;
Simultaneous matching is most often the result of a former flockmate joining an&#xd;
interaction between two males who had been in different winter flocks. High-ranked&#xd;
males join the interactions of their lower-ranked flockmates, preferentially when those&#xd;
males are matching other high-ranked males. The dawn chorus is an interactive&#xd;
communication network in which all males participate and is characterized by&#xd;
interactions between multiple senders and receivers with males eavesdropping on&#xd;
interactions in which they are not involved.</description>

   <description>Adiponectin (ADP) is an adipokine, which acts as an insulin sensitizing hormone.  Recent studies have shown that adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1, AdipoR2) are present in the CNS; however, there is some debate as to whether or not ADP crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB).  Circumventricular organs (CVO) are CNS sites outside the BBB, and thus represent sites at which circulating adiponectin may act to influence the CNS without having to cross the BBB.  The subfornical organ (SFO) is a CVO that is responsive to a number of different circulating satiety signals including amylin, CCK, and ghrelin.  We report here that the SFO also shows a high density of mRNA for both adiponectin receptors.  These observations support the concept that the SFO may be a key player in sensing circulating ADP.  To test the hypothesis that ADP influences the excitability of SFO neurons, we used current-clamp electrophysiology on dissociated SFO neurons to observe changes in membrane potential.  ADP (10 nM) application effected the excitability of SFO neurons, where the cells either depolarized (8.9±0.9 mV, 21 of 97 cells) or hyperpolarized (-8.0±0.5 mV, 34 of 97 cells).  Using single-cell RT-PCR we found that the majority of the responsive neurons expressed AdipoR1 or R2 and the non-responsive neurons expressed neither. &#xd;
 &#xd;
In view of the recognized role of ADP in the regulation of energy balance, we next examined the effects of food deprivation for 48 hours on ADP signaling in the SFO.  Our previous microarray analysis of SFO showed increases in AdipoR2 mRNA, with no significant change in AdipoR1 mRNA.  We have also assessed the effects of such changes in receptor expression on ADP signaling in SFO neurons using calcium imaging and patch clamp techniques.  In SFO neurons obtained from control animals, ADP induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ were observed in 25% of cells, while following food deprivation 0% of cells showed this response.  Furthermore, 77% of neurons from starved animals showed clear depolarization, while no hyperpolarizing responses were observed.  The results presented in this study suggest that adiponectin modulates the excitability of SFO neurons and that the response to ADP changes during starvation.</description>

   <description>A novel CMOS operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is proposed and demonstrated in this thesis. Due to its feedforward-regulated cascode topology, it breaks the previous OTA frequency limit of several hundred MHz and operates at frequencies up to 10 GHz with a large transconductance. This is confirmed by an in-depth high-frequency analysis, simulations, and experimental demonstrations using purpose-built circuits. Experimental results also show that the proposed OTA has high linearity and low intermodulation distortion, which is of particular interest in microwave circuits. The OTA’s noise behavior and the effects of process variations, device mismatch, and power supply noise on the transconductance are also studied. To the best of our knowledge, the noise analysis here is the first of its kind on regulated cascode circuits, which can be applied to other regulated cascodes with minor changes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Three microwave applications of this OTA are explored in this thesis: 1) an active bandpass filter with a wide tuning range, 2) a 2.4-GHz ISM-band variable phase shifter, and 3) a microwave active quasi-circulator, which are all in CMOS MMIC form. These three circuits can be easily integrated with other chip components for System-on-Chip (SoC) realizations. The use of the OTA makes these three applications super compact: the active filter is at least 5 times smaller than previous circuits with a similar topology, and the phase shifter and quasi-circulator are at least 3 times smaller than previous works in that frequency range. Furthermore, the tunability of the developed OTA on its transconductance gives its applications extra freedom in tuning their frequencies and gains/losses electronically. In the first application, the active bandpass filter has a novel narrowband-filtering topology and has a wide tuning-range of 28% around 1.8 GHz, which makes it very suited for reconfigurable multi-band wireless systems. In the second and third applications, the active variable phase shifter has a comparable variable phase shift range of 120º in the 2.4-GHz ISM band and the active quasi-circulator has transmissions close to 0 dB and directivities over 24 dB from 1.5 GHz to 2.7 GHz.</description>

   <description>Human Genetic Enhancement (HGE) has the potential to provide great benefits to a large number of people in terms of alleviating inherited disease and disability and maximizing individual liberty. There are many arguments against research and application of this new technology based on a variety of grounds, including both deontological and consequentialist objections. In this thesis I examine arguments from both of these positions and argue that neither offers a satisfactory justification for prohibiting research into HGE nor do they demonstrate that the application of the knowledge gained from such research is necessarily wrong. I also suggest that there is a strong argument in favor of HGE in that it may offer a way to reduce the amount of disadvantage currently present in our society as a result of genetic disease and disability by addressing the genetic causes of these conditions. Further, I argue that the pursuit of HGE is necessary in order to promote individual liberty and promote equality of opportunity. Finally, I argue that by examining principles that require us to promote individual liberty we can establish the categories of enhancements which we should publicly fund and those that should merely be permissible.</description>

   <description>The effects of some associated minerals on thiosulfate gold leaching were studied through thermodynamic analysis and leaching experiments on composite ore samples containing various minerals and a reference silicate gold ore.&#xd;
In the leaching test on the reference gold ore, about 93% of gold was extracted within 3.0 hours. The presence of various amount of pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcocite, bornite, and some lead species, has significant detrimental effects.&#xd;
Under reduced oxygen conditions, the thiosulfate consumptions could be significantly reduced. High gold extractions (i.e. >= 90%) were observed in the leaching tests with reduced dissolved oxygen (i.e., 0.7% oxygen in the supplied gas) in the absence or in the presence of sulfide minerals such as pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite. High copper concentration and a pre-aeration step was also found to largely increase the gold extractions under such conditions.&#xd;
Thiosulfate-copper-ethylenediamine system was found effective in the leaching of gold. The leaching kinetics was significantly slower than that of the conventional thiosulfate-copper-ammonia leaching. The consumption of thiosulfate, however, was largely reduced. This leaching system worked effectively on the reference gold ore within a wider pH range (e.g., 6-11), with or without ammonia. The presence of ammonia in a low concentration improved the leaching rate but also increase the consumption of thiosulfate. Comparable gold extractions were observed in the leaching of the composite ores containing various sulfide minerals, such as pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcocite, galena and chalcopyrite.&#xd;
The leaching of gold in the presence of iron sulfides was also improved by applying chemical additives, such as, carbonate, calcium, galena, phosphate, and additional hydroxide anion. It is proposed that these additives either passivated the harmful surface of sulfide minerals or masked some detrimental aqueous species.&#xd;
Finally, some improved leaching methods concluded in this study were applied on a few industrial ore samples in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. It was found that by comprehensively applying these improved thiosulfate leaching strategies, satisfactory gold extractions and thiosulfate consumption results were archived on these ores.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-18 16:58:44.385</description>
   <description>In their natural environment animals must balance their safety requirements (i.e., avoiding predation) with their need to satisfy their energy demands (i.e., securing food).  How the brain integrates these competing demands to promote adaptive responding is not well understood.  The current study examined the effects of chronic food restriction on rats' behavioural defense profiles in two animal models of anxiety; the shock-probe burying and elevated plus-maze tests.  In agreement with previous research, food restriction dramatically increased rats' open-arm exploration in the plus-maze.  By contrast, food restriction did not alter the duration of time rats spent burying an electrified probe in the shock-probe burying test.  Furthermore, food restricted rats displayed increases in risk assessment behaviour in both tests.  Animals’ behaviour in both animal models of anxiety does not suggest a food-restriction induced reduction in anxiety. Alternatively, the results suggest that rats' willingness to explore normally avoided open arenas is sensitive to their current energy demands.  In particular, it appears that under conditions of food scarcity rodents adapt their defensive profiles in order to meet both safety needs and satisfy energy demands.  Further, the dramatic shift in open-arm exploration displayed by food-restricted animals seems to involve activation (as indexed by cFos) of brain regions previously implicated in feeding behaviour and normal open arm avoidance.  Notably, an interaction effect of feeding and testing was observed in the anterior basolateral amygdala.  This nucleus may be involved in integrating the competing demands of safety and energy requirements.</description>

   <description>Meaningful semantic context has been shown to improve comprehension of spoken sentences by young and old adults, especially in difficult listening conditions. Whether older adults benefit differently than younger adults is a topic of some controversy. I asked young (14 participants, 18-25) and older adults (20 participants, 60-75) to report entire sentences which contained either a coherent or anomalous global semantic context (e.g. coherent: “Her new skirt was made of denim”, anomalous: “Her good slope was done in carrot”). Sentences were mixed with signal-correlated noise, at 10 signal-to-noise ratios (-6 to +2 dB and clear speech). Percentage scores were converted to rationalized arcsine units and subjected to a repeated-measures ANOVA; slopes from psychometric functions fitted to the transformed data were also analyzed. Cognitive and hearing threshold differences were considered as factors influencing results. Finally, individual variability in the use of context was explored. Comprehension by both groups benefited from meaningful context, without a clear difference in the overall amount of benefit obtained. Cognitive factors did not appear to influence the results, although differences in hearing thresholds likely contributed to the consistent performance decrement for older adults. Individuals varied greatly in their use of context, a possible explanation for inconsistent results in studies comparing context use by young and older people. &#xd;
fMRI was then used to look at neural activity associated with deriving benefit from meaningful context. Whole-brain EPI data were acquired from young (16 participants, 19-26) adults using a sparse imaging design. Participants heard coherent and anomalous sentences in the scanner, and were asked to report what they heard on half of the trials. Individual’s word-report data obtained in the scanner were used to model intelligibility in the analysis and results were compared to an analysis conducted using intelligibility estimates based on group data from another study. In addition to bilateral temporal activity associated with increasing intelligibility, I observe a large left inferior-frontal region in which BOLD signal correlated more strongly with highly intelligible anomalous compared to highly intelligible coherent prose, presumably reflecting challenged semantic integration and supporting Hagoort’s (2005) model of semantic unification.</description>
