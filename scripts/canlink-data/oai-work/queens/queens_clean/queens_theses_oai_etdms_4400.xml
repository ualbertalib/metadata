   <description>This thesis deals with soft-switching bidirectional converters for aerospace applications. The modern More Electric Aircrafts (MEA) have a great demand for efficient, compact, and lightweight converters to interconnect their conventional low voltage (28V) and new high voltage (270V) utility buses. Fulfilment of these requirements is quite challenging, especially from no-load to full-load with wide voltage variations of the buses. Dual active bridge (DAB) converters have been proposed for high power bidirectional DC-DC conversion, but still suffer from shortcomings such as limited soft switching range, bulky filter requirements, and low utilization of converter capability for maximizing efficiency. In this thesis new modulation techniques and new topologies are proposed for full-range soft switching and optimal efficiency without auxiliary circuits. Two converter topologies are explored for use in single or modular high power converters. First, the dual half-bridge converter with a new duty cycle plus phase shift control is presented to obtain a fully soft-switched and efficiency optimized converter. The soft-switching zones in the control space are found and a design method to get full range soft-switching is presented. The minimum loss points inside the soft-switching zones for all conditions are also obtained and presented. The converter is operated at minimum loss using lookup tables containing the optimal points. To obtain higher power and more flexibility, a new current-fed dual active full-bridge converter with 3 control degrees of freedom is also proposed and its operation under different combinations of control parameters is analysed. Also an interleaving modular design is presented to use the aforementioned converters as building units to construct higher power modular converters. Finally, a dynamic modeling technique based on state space averaging is proposed to obtain an approximate full order dynamic model of the converter in continuous time such that classic control design can be applied to the multivariable control system. Simulation and experimental results are provided. Experimental results are obtained from a 1kW dual half-bridge and a 2kW dual full-bridge converter operating at 250kHz. Despite the common imperfections in lab prototypes, efficiencies as high as 96% are measured, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

   <description>Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are a popular option for human movement analysis. The untethered, self-contained nature of IMUs overcomes many limitations of conventional measurement systems. The potential of IMU systems makes it worthwhile to pursue clinical and research use. However, IMUs have not proven to be sufficiently reliable or valid. Two barriers facing IMU-based joint kinematics are: (i) the misaligned, unique reference frames of each IMU in the system, hindering joint angle calculation, and (ii) anatomical calibration accuracy and reproducibility, hindering the anatomical relevance of joint angles. A comparison of available methods would help to understand and overcome the current barriers preventing IMU use. The present thesis aimed to provide these comparisons.&#xd;
Several methods have been proposed to align coordinate frames. Three methods were compared mathematically and experimentally. The equivalency of all methods was proved mathematically. Experimentally, all three methods were equivalent (&lt;2Â° different) in two applications relevant to biomechanics (finding a common IMU reference frame and comparing the IMU orientation to a marker-based orientation). &#xd;
Several methods have also been proposed to find anatomically relevant axes of the lower limb body segments. The joint angles from five methods were compared using the joint angles of a marker-based method as reference. The methods were used for the hip, knee and ankle joint, if they were applicable. The joint angles from three of the methods were similar, while two methods had some joint angles that differed, primarily by a bias. The two dissimilar methods relied on static-normalization, which caused the errors, particularly in the transverse plane angles. Drift (degradation of IMU accuracy over time) between trials was the problem affecting the static-normalization, so it was the IMU sensor fusion and not the method itself that was the cause of dissimilarity. Further research is required to recommend one method for future use.&#xd;
Overall, current methods performed similarly in both methodological options, suggesting that current research is reaching a plateau in improvements. Further research in reliability and agreement is required to understand the strengths, weaknesses and fields of improvement required for research and clinical use of IMUs in human movement analysis.</description>

   <description>Background: This study assessed the relationship between the patient-centred medical home (PCMH), as exemplified by the Family Health Team (FHT) program in Ontario, and healthcare access and utilization by adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) aged 18-64 years. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Using administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, a retrospective cohort was developed to compare an intervention group, patients treated through a PCMH model, the FHT, against a control of patients treated through primary care models lacking key features of PCMH care. A difference-in-differences (DiD) approach was used to estimate the effect of the PCMH model on four access indicators â uptake of the periodic health exam, and screens for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers â and one utilization indicator â avoidable emergency department (ED) utilization rate. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: FHT-based care reduced the proportion of patients who had an exam over three years by 4.4 percentage points (p&lt;0.0001). It the proportion of patients who were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screens by 4.9 percentage points (p=0.0035). Breast and cervical cancer screenings also showed positive results of 2.9 and 2.4 percentage points respectively, although the results in both were not significant (p=0.214 and 0.0565, respectively). The PCMH care showed no impact on avoidable ED visits. Models were tested for potential confounders including patient demographics, comorbidities, physician demographics, and practice characteristics. In all five tests, the DiD estimator remained relatively constant between simple models and full models which adjusted for confounding variables, suggesting that the models are robust.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: The results show the complexity of evaluating the impacts of primary care models. The positive trends in cancer screening uptake under PCMH care suggests that with proper incentives PCMH does have a positive impact on access to care by adults with IDD. The negative impact on periodic health exam uptake highlights the need for a tool specific to this populationâs needs to ensure guidelines are met. Future research should assess PCMH care against a broader range of healthcare utilization indicators and advance this studyâs identification of relevant covariates including complex comorbidities and the effects of physician and practice characteristics on healthcare access and utilization.</description>

   <description>The demands placed on high performance student athletes (athletes who perform at a competitive level) continue to intensify (Conzelmann &amp; Nagel, 2003) and finding a balance between athletic and educational responsibilities can be a significant challenge (European Commission, 2004). When students are unable to find a balance between their athletics and education responsibilities, they run the risk of decreased performance in at least one of these areas. I decided to complete qualitative research that examined the role that teachers play in supporting high performance athletes in balancing sport and academic responsibilities.  I discovered that limited research has been conducted on the role that teachers play in supporting high performance athletes with their sports and academics. The research indicated that various aspects could influence high performance athletesâ inability to balance their sports and academics. My research examined how private secondary school teachers promote and support a more balanced orientation to athletic and academic development; ultimately, aiming to provide valuable information to teachers on how to do so. This research was conducted through a two-phase, qualitative study. The first phase involved individual interviews with three teachers and three student athletes. The second phase involved paired interviews with the same student athletes and teachers.  Three core themes emerged from this research related to teachersâ support for high performance athletes: (a) flexibility, (b) relationship, and (c) support. With the application of these three themes, it is believed that teachers can better assist student athletes in balancing their athletics and education, which will result in a positive outcome in both areas.</description>

   <description>There are two components to a blast which create damage in a rock or grout material: the initial stress wave, followed by the crack penetrating gases. In order to understand the development of fragmentation in grout as a result of the individual and combined action of these components, three types of experiments were conducted.&#xd;
Medium scale grout cylinders were used to measure pressures in the material away from a detonating charge, located in a borehole having the same axis. Some of the cylinders were lined with copper tubes to minimize gas penetration from the detonation of the charge. It was determined that there are statistically significant differences in the slope of the attenuation of pressure for unlined spherical and lined cylindrical samples.&#xd;
Small scale grout cylinders loaded with various charges and coupling configurations were blasted with reduced loads in order to crack the cylinders without destroying them. This process allowed for measurement of the crack patterns produced. A third of the samples were lined with copper tubes, another third were stemmed without tubes. The remaining samples were not stemmed nor lined. Post blast analysis revealed that individual cracks were significantly propagated by gases in unlined samples. However, when measuring overall damage, there were no significant differences between copper lined, unlined and stemmed samples. These results suggested that stress waves were mainly responsible for the crack patterns produced.&#xd;
Computer modelling using Particle Flow Code (PFC) was performed to confirm experimental crack patterns of small scale grout cylinders. PFC produced similar cracks as the small scale cylinders, in number and length, without modelling gas penetration. A secondary study into delay times showed evidence of short delay times being the most effective in producing smaller fragments. This confirmed the role of stress waves as a major contributor towards developing fragmentation.</description>

   <description>TAZ and YAP are transcriptional coactivators negatively regulated in the tumor suppressor (TS) Hippo pathway. TAZ and YAP play essential roles in tumorigenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as cell resistances to different chemotherapeutic drugs such as the antitubulin drug Taxol. Although previous studies from the Yang Lab have shown that TAZ induces Taxol resistance through activation of downstream targets Cysteine rich 61 (Cyr61) and Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), the upstream regulations of YAP and TAZ during Taxol treatment is largely unknown. &#xd;
In this study, a Hippo independent negative regulation of YAP and TAZ is identified. In response to antitubulin drug treatments, Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) kinase can directly phosphorylate YAP and TAZ at multiple sites with SP/TP (S, serine; T, threonine; P, proline) motifs. The phosphorylation of YAP abolishes its interactions with transcription factor (TF) TEAD, whereas phosphorylation of TAZ by Cdk1 decreases the stability of TAZ. Our studies provide potential strategies and biomarkers to treat and predict antitubulin resistance. In addition to Cdk1, another kinase PIK3CB was identified as a positive regulator of TAZ/YAP. PIK3CB induces EMT and tumorigenesis by activating TAZ/YAP through inhibition of LATS. Collectively, the findings in our study provide another two novel regulators of TAZ and YAP in addition to the canonical Hippo pathway, which broadens our understanding of the molecular signaling network of the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, our research findings have significant implications for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer patients in the future.</description>

   <description>Inflammation plays a vital role in promoting naÃ¯ve cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CD8+ T cell) differentiation. Infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) elicits a robust CD8+ T cell response in the mouse. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are involved in inflammation and the transgenic mice (TG) overexpressing the cysteinyl leukotriene 2 receptor (hCysLT2R) exhibit increased expression of pro-inflammatory transcription factors after stimulation. Here, we investigate how increased inflammation can affect the activation of CD8+ T cells during viral infection in TG mice with different doses (low vs. high) of LCMV. &#xd;
Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum of TG mice were increased after infection with low or high viral doses. The data also showed the accumulation of a higher number of effector CD8+ T cells in TG mice compared to WT mice on day 12 p.i with low or high viral doses in peripheral tissues. &#xd;
Analysis of memory CD8+ T cells 40 days p.i indicated increased accumulation of central memory CD8+ T cells in peripheral tissue (lungs) of TG mice compared to WT mice, irrespective of the viral doses. However, for the lymphoid tissue (spleen) no difference in memory CD8+ T cell formation was recorded during infection with a low viral dose, but a lower central memory CD8+ T cell number was recorded in the spleen of TG mice compared to WT mice with higher viral doses.  &#xd;
From the results obtained, it can be concluded that increased inflammation can cause a stronger migration of effector and memory CD8+ T cells to peripheral tissue irrespective of the viral dose. On the other hand, increased inflammation resulted in decreased central memory CD8+ T cell formation in lymphoid tissue (spleen) during a high viral dose infection, but not during infection with a low viral dose. Therefore, using mice expressing the hCysLT2R has enabled us to examine how increased inflammation during viral infections can impact the activation of T cells and how this influences their memory phenotype formation.</description>

   <description>During the Sixties Scoop, there was a mass apprehension of indigenous children from their families and communities during the 1960âs and 1980âs within Canada. This unprecedented disruption to the fabric of indigenous communities still resonates in the contemporary over- representation of indigenous children within the settler colonial child welfare system. In the field of indigenous studies, there is little research documenting this history and in this thesis I sought to contribute to this existing literature. Drawing upon indigenous and black feminist theories and Foucaudian genealogy I analyze archival materials, memoir and creative texts that explain the Sixties Scoop as part of an ongoing displacement of indigenous peoples. This thesis explores the underlying racist and colonial logics to question the legitimacy of the child welfare system. Coupling this frame, I sought to highlight the significance of relationality and kinship bonds among indigenous and non-indigenous people. The thesis positions the creative writings of Beatrice Mosionierâs novel In Search of April Raintree (1983) and her memoir Come Walk with Me (2009) and my autoethnographic story as narratives that work across as well as outside a colonial frame. Within entangled threads of colonial histories, and through indigenous storytelling we can witness the narrative threads of indigenous peoples surviving displacement and familial separations and practicing cultural continuity. Storytelling allows us to build our communities and envision renewed ways to relate to each other.</description>

   <description>Published in 1866, Sites et vÃ©gÃ©taux du Canada was an early photographic experiment in botanical illustration. It was the result of a collaboration between AbbÃ© Ovide Brunet (1826-1876), a botany professor at the UniversitÃ© Laval, and the photography studio of Livernois &amp; Cie., noted QuÃ©bec City photographers and artists. Previous research has considered the album as the aesthetic accomplishment of Jules-IsaÃ¯e BenoÃ®t dit Livernois (1830-1865), excluding Brunet from the art historical narrative. In this thesis, I present an analysis of the various contexts through which the images were imbued with meaning, considering the botanical alongside the aesthetic, to understand how this album fit into the visual culture of early Canadian science. I examine Sites et vÃ©gÃ©taux du Canada as a physical object and the product of an international network of art and science. Viewed internationally at the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris, it showcased thirty-five albumen print photographs as part of the Canadian displays. In its representation of Canadian landscapes and native plant specimens, the album effectively employed photography to present Canada as a centre of cutting-edge scientific investigation.</description>

   <description>Chondrocyte sensitization and desensitization to mechanical stimuli are complex phenomena that can limit the effectiveness of mechanical stimulation in cartilage tissue engineering.  The studies in this thesis aim to provide a more complete understanding of chondrocyte mechanical sensitivity as well as to develop new methods to aid in the successful use of dynamic compressive stimulation for tissue engineering applications.  Through the examination of the durations of dynamic compressive loading, it was observed that a minimum amount of stimulation was required to elicit an anabolic response, but desensitization could quickly be reached with increased loading cycles.  These anabolic responses could be predicted through the observation of calcium signaling, where an increase in intracellular calcium signaling levels correlated with an anabolic response.  Calcium signaling could also be used to predict the wait time needed between successive applications of stimuli, where a return to baseline signaling levels indicated a full recovery of mechanosensitivity.  To maintain mechanosensitivity throughout loading and to mitigate load-induced desensitization, which could negatively impact the anabolic response to mechanical stimuli, stochastic resonance in the form of superimposed random vibrations was investigated.  In younger cells, stochastic resonance was able to improve cellular sensitivity and elicit further increases in matrix synthesis.  Load-induced desensitization was also limited by stochastic resonance, allowing the cells to remain sensitive to increased loading durations.  The recovery rate also appeared to be decreased by stochastic resonance indicating that less time would be required between successive applications of stimuli.  In older cells which are normally insensitive to mechanical stimuli, stochastic resonance was able to induce sensitivity resulting in a positive anabolic response.  The beneficial effects of stochastic resonance were able to be maintained over long term culture, where matrix accumulation was enhanced through the increased production of collagen and the mitigation of proteoglycan loss during dynamic compressive loading.  Therefore the overall positive effects of stochastic resonance observed in this thesis indicate that it can be a valuable tool for the successful application of mechanical stimuli to engineered cartilage constructs.</description>

   <description>The Ganges Delta is a dynamic landscape that has experienced substantial transformation over the last half century and is particularly susceptible to future change as a result of rising sea levels. The aim of this project was to analyze recent trends in land cover in southwest Bangladesh, and to better understand the natural and anthropogenic factors responsible for this transformation. Three study areas spanning a salinity gradient across the region were selected for analysis. Research was conducted by linking multi-temporal remote sensing data (Landsat MSS, TM, and OLI; 1973-2014) and validating these data with ground-based survey information to understand historical land use and vegetation changes. Results indicate that throughout the basin, ecosystems ranging from freshwater to saline (all of which are found in the low-lying topographical zones of Bangladesh) have experienced a wide range of anthropogenic influences and geophysical driving forces. Cultivable areas have been decreasing substantially in the freshwater floodplain due to expansion of waterlogged and settlement areas. It was frequently observed that a decrease of agricultural land and natural freshwater bodies was accompanied by an increase in shrimp farms in the southernmost brackish and saline zone; this process has been moving northward over the past several decades. These interferences have physically altered the ecosystems of the basin and the land therein. As a result, agricultural land has diminished by approximately one percent per year during our 40 year study period, most significantly in the last two decades. This study also indicates that part of the worldâs largest mangrove forest in the Ganges Delta has not significantly decreased during the last decade; however, dynamic coastal processes and excessive anthropogenic activities on the peripheries could cause mangrove deforestation. The outcome of this research will be important for coastal communities seeking to protect the ecosystem and its dependent population. Improved policies on the control and monitoring of anthropogenic activities related to land use and resource extraction, would create a zone suitable for sustainable farming and living.</description>

   <description>Large-eddy Simulations were carried out on a flat-plate boundary layer over smooth and rough surfaces in the presence of an adverse pressure gradient, strong enough to induce separation. The inlet Reynolds number (based on freestream velocity and momentum thickness at the reference plane) is 2300. A sand-grain roughness model was implemented and spatial resolution requirements were determined. Two roughness heights were used and a fully-rough flow condition is achieved at the reference plane with roughness Reynolds numbers 60 and 120. As the friction velocity decreases due to the adverse pressure gradient the roughness Reynolds number varies from fully-rough to transitionally rough and smooth regime before the separation. The double-averaging approach illustrates how the roughness contribution decreases before the separation as the dispersive stresses decrease markedly compared to the upstream region.&#xd;
Before the flow detachment, roughness intensifies the Reynolds stresses. After the separation, the normal stresses, production and dissipation substantially increase through the adverse pressure gradient region. In the recovery region, the flow is highly three dimensional, as turbulent structures impinge on the wall at the reattachment region. Roughness initially increases the skin friction, then causes it to decrease faster than on a smooth wall, generating a considerably larger recirculation bubble for rough cases with earlier separation and later reattachment; increasing the wall roughness also leads to larger separation bubble. In addition, roughness causes early flow reversal upstream of the real separation (which occurs when the zero-velocity line moves away from the wall) because the small-scale separation regions downstream of the roughness elements become larger and merge together as a result of the APG. However, this flow reversal remains below the roughness crest. The reasons for the earlier separation are larger momentum deficit in rough-wall flows and the shutting down of the production of shear both before and after the separation, mainly due to the decrease in the velocity gradient in the outer layer. After the separation, roughness effects can be felt throughout the boundary layer because of the advection of near-wall fluid around the recirculation region.</description>

   <description>This dissertation is the first comprehensive examination of the history, interpretation, and potential application of section 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, guaranteeing rights and freedoms "equally to male and female persons."  It seeks to answer two questions: first, why, despite women being only marginally successful in advancing Charter claims involving gender equality, courts have so profoundly marginalized section 28; and second, whether and how section 28 might be transformed into a fully effective constitutional provision in accordance with its original, feminist meaning.&#xd;
The dissertation approaches these questions first by examining flaws in the existing interpretative approach to Charter adjudication, arguing instead for a new approach that structures consideration of a provisionâs original meaning and legislative history.  It then demonstrates the wealth of resources history has to offer in relation to construing the meaning of section 28. At its core, section 28 was meant to require courts to view rights through a gender equality lens and channel judicial discretion towards transformative interpretations of rights that support the eradication of womenâs subordination.  The dissertation relies on cultural theories and theories of feminist geography to demonstrate how the liminal spatiotemporal location of section 28âs feminist framers in the patriation process became embedded in section 28âs meaning.  Ultimately, section 28âs liminality led most courts to construct the provision as a âthreat.â Through a forgetting of the work of its feminist framers, they applied section 28 in a manner that perverted its meaning and ultimately attempted to consign it to desuetude.&#xd;
In the end, this dissertation demonstrates that properly interpreted, section 28 could fundamentally reshape how rights are adjudicated, ensuring the Charter delivers on its promise of guaranteeing Canadian womenâs equal personhood in fact.</description>

   <description>The emotional history of men represents a frontier in masculinity studies that often promises to give authentic feeling back to men, and to give men who feel back to women. So-called vulnerable feelings such as grief sustain these hopes for male self-awareness and transformation above all. In such narratives, however, male grief remains mostly aspirational, stuck in the process of recovering or opening up, thus deferring the work of mourning beyond the reach of readily claimed experiences of manhood. I hope to unsettle this narrative by exploring one permissive and quite animated site of male grief: men mourning mothers in the early twentieth century. Such a study in modernism is long overdue considering how this period produced numerous images of toughened masculinity and pointed to their invariably performative nature. My first chapter explores how Freudâs reading of mourning solidifies this dualism by conceiving of the affect of grief as an always surprising response to the pain of loss, to a wound that exists outside the self strictly speaking but materializes in mind and body. Grief represents lingering extensions of the self that tell the history of its desire and socialization. One place where these desires are regularly contested and adapted in representations of menâs emotional lives is in memories about lost or dead mothers. Most often, mothers in menâs writings about grief work serve as permissible locations of emotional injury in languages about otherwise hardened, unfeeling masculinity. The chapters below consider how British and Irish modernists explore specific iterations of masculinity by grieving mothers in the context of colonialism, nationalism, and totalitarianism. I argue that narratives about men mourning mothers participate in fashioning key discourses of masculinity during modernism. Many of the writers I consider resist accepting the loss of a mother as a sign of accomplished male autonomy. Instead, they unpack customary consolations for surviving mothers, and open spaces to take a critical look at the social and political conditions that authored such losses. In the process, they enrich our understanding of how emotion and grief function in menâs ideas about masculinity during the modernist period.</description>

   <description>It is the aim of this thesis to present the textile production tools from the 2012â2014 excavations at Caere, an Etruscan city northwest of Rome. While all textile tool finds â loom weights, spools, and spindle whorls â are presented, the discussion is focused on complete loom weights. The likely loom set-up, thread type, and appearance of the final fabric are suggested.</description>

   <description>While research suggests that context, structural socioeconomic and cultural factors matter in intimate partner violence research, quantitative research on the subject in sub-Saharan Africa, and in particular Ghana, has disproportionately focused on prevalence and individual level correlates of spousal violence. This research has ignored the role of the structural socioeconomic and cultural factors and contexts in understanding the causes and consequences of spousal violence in a setting where family life is heavily influenced by traditional norms and beliefs. These norms and beliefs may lead to inadequate and ineffective interventions geared at preventing or reducing spousal violence and its consequences. Guided by an integrated theoretical approach and Macmillanâs sociogenic framework, this study addresses these issues by estimating a series of multilevel logistic regression models where the effects of both individual and community level risk factors of spousal violence and its health and economic consequences are assessed. Data for the study come from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey and the Ghana Population and Housing Census. The findings confirm the salient role of structural socioeconomic and cultural factors, such as patriarchal norms and residential instability, in the perpetration of spousal violence against women. Consistent with the sociogenic framework, this study found support for the view that womenâs exposure to spousal victimisation has deleterious effects on their health and economic outcomes and that these adverse effects may be exacerbated by the same risk factors that contribute to womenâs abuse. An anticipated buffering effect of social support on spousal victimisation and its consequences was largely unsupported by the findings. Policy implications of the findings and directions for further research are discussed.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents an in-depth structural analysis of infrared images of nearby galaxies and considers the difficulty of constraining the disk, bar, and bulge components in these galaxies. The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) provides a view at a wavelength largely unaffected by extinction that probes the older stellar populations of 2352 galaxies, of which a subset of 316 galaxies are selected for analysis based on size and morphology. The non-parametric fitting algorithm DiskFit is first used to model the bar, bulge, and disk from S4G-like simulated galaxy images to validate DiskFit's effectiveness and assess its strengths and weaknesses on the subsample. DiskFit is easily able to recover input disk and bar properties, while struggling to recover the input bulge properties. After validating DiskFit on simulated galaxy images, DiskFit is then used to model the components of the S4G subsample, while comparing to existing models made using the parametric algorithm GALFIT from the literature. It is found that DiskFit and GALFIT constrain the bar and disk similarly for the majority of the subsample galaxies, but the bulges are recovered differently. Most of the models with the two algorithms agree well, but many of them fail in either DiskFit or GALFIT. It is suggested that the verification of an algorithm on a relevant set of models is necessary, that parameterizing all of the bars with the same functional form is not optimal for all galaxies, and that the large scatter between values recovered in DiskFit and GALFIT relative to the mean uncertainty values returned by DiskFit's bootstrap resampling technique implies a reconsideration of how uncertainties are handled when constraining these components, in order to test current models of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

   <description>Self-swabbing mediated by a telephone health helpline (THHL) was explored as a community based surveillance tool for the detection of influenza viruses in Ontario. This surveillance system was designed to complement other surveillance systems and clinical based testing for influenza viruses by extending the reach of surveillance, through self-swabbing, to persons outside of the traditional health care setting. The âself-swabbing studyâ population, in terms of age and gender, residential environment, and marginalization, were explored and compared to influenza data captured by Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) during the same influenza year. Although these two populations were similar in many ways, the evaluation highlighted an increased use of the self-swabbing system among young children (age two to four years) and adults (age 20 to 39 years), and those from an area of greater ethnic concentration. Also, a larger portion of participants from rural or small population centres completed all steps of the study, as compared to those who agreed to participate initially but did not follow through. Further, this study was evaluated as a tool for early detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses relative to Public Health Agency of Canadaâs FluWatch data, PHOL data, and Ontarioâs Acute Care Enhanced Surveillance system. The self-swabbing study detected a rise in influenza B cases at the same time as the earliest corresponding surveillance sources using the peak comparison method; however, no sooner than any system. Lastly, the efficacy of using self-swabbing to sample influenza A and influenza B viruses was evaluated by comparing molecular test results from two different platforms: real-time reverse- transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex PCR. In conclusion, self-swabbing is an appropriate method for obtaining and testing samples for influenza A and influenza B viruses based on a moderate and strong level of agreement between the results for the two viruses, respectively. Moreover, self-swabbing proved to be a successful sampling method for respiratory viruses broadly, given the detection of 13 additional respiratory viruses using this method. As such, the THHL mediated self- swabbing surveillance system has significant potential for use as a tool for laboratory-confirmed community based viral surveillance in Ontario.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2015-12-31 17:02:51.404</description>
   <description>In this thesis, I examine existing theories that attempt to explain the asset pricing phenomenon known as momentum.  I revisit the seminal work of Chordia and Shivakumar (2002); Cooper, Guiterrez and Hameed (2004); and Stivers and Sun (2010). Using an updated sample, I reexamine their findings, while also comparing the results by credit rating. It has been shown that, among rated firms, momentum appears to exist only among firms with a non-investment grade credit rating. By comparing the results of the investment grade firms with those of the non-investment grade firms, we can see which are being driven by firms that experience momentum. The results indicate that momentum is more closely related to the state of the market than the state of the economy. However, among market-state variables, it is the return dispersion within the market that is more important, as opposed to the returns of the market themselves. Return dispersion is negatively related to momentum returns. If return dispersion is considered to be a measure of market uncertainty, then this is inconsistent with many leading behavourial theories that include uncertainty as a driving factor of momentum. In response to this, I present an alternative risk-based explanation that is consistent with these findings, as well as reconcile them with much of the existing empirical evidence supporting these behavioural theories.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2016-01-04 13:02:35.361</description>
   <description>In 1993, Maxine Greene issued a call to expand the standard of humanness and to look beyond normative culture in the hopes of moving toward a greater inclusivity of diversity in schools. Current Canadian curriculum theory is seeking to include more voices into a conversation that seeks to recognize unheard narratives. To contribute to this goal this study sought to speak to those who successfully navigate the normative world through their unique narratives, unswayed by the pull towards the norm. In a discussion of successful arts teachers, Smithrim and Upitis (2001) describe a person who is unswayed by normative pressures as âsomeone who is able to write his or her life like a poem, who marches to his or her own drum, and whose identity is strong enough to withstand the many influences of the dominant cultureâ (p. 21). They name these individuals strong poets. By exploring the perspectives and experiences of students who are strong poets, this research contributes to the understanding of how curriculum can encourage people to extend the standard of humanness by embracing their non-normative narratives. This study used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Data were collected through two phases that emphasized the interpretation of texts and the negotiation of the meaning of those texts through a community of strong poet interpreters. The data were analyzed and presented through the use of hermeneutic windows in order to develop an understanding of those who accept their own unique narratives without hesitation. The four windows described present the essence of how the strong poet participants interpreted the expansion of the standard of humanness through their awareness of self, their ability to humanize the humans around them, and the ways in which they creatively resist and negotiate norms. The strong poets who participated in this study shared their experiences of the lived curriculum and shed light on how they embraced their own non-normative narratives and how they encouraged others to embrace their own stories.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2016-01-04 13:53:27.668</description>
   <description>The need for enantiopure chiral compounds has driven the development of asymmetric synthesis, and more specifically asymmetric catalysis. The ability to selectively produce one enantiomer versus another has been a significant discovery for the production of natural products and pharmaceuticals, as both enantiomers may elicit very different interaction in living animals, either being therapeutic or toxic. This thesis investigates the structure of the substrate and its effect in the homogeneously-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of C=C and C=O double bonds.&#xd;
&#xd;
In a study of the asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated carboxylic acids, the effects of the length of the linker between the unsaturation and the carboxylic acid functional group on the yield and selectivity of the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction were investigated. We selected Noyoriâs Ru-binap catalysts and their derivatives as they are known to work well, in terms of high conversions and enantioselectivities, for the asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as atropic or tiglic acid. Other catalysts selected were a Rh-catalyst, and two Ir-catalysts reported to hydrogenate unsaturated carboxylic acids.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the subsequent chapter, this study was extended to ketoacids. The effect of the change in unsaturation, i.e. olefin to ketone, is discussed, as well as the effects of the length of the linker on the asymmetric hydrogenation. &#xd;
&#xd;
In these two studies, it was found that a gamma, delta-unsaturated carboxylic acid and a gamma-ketoacid could be asymmetrically hydrogenated in medium to high yield and enantioselectivity; however, the asymmetric hydrogenation of substrates with a greater distance between the unsaturation and the acid group had poor yield and selectivity.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the fifth chapter, a new methodology for the asymmetric hydrogenation of allylamines was developed. This new method takes advantage of a reversible reaction between amines and carbon dioxide (CO2) to suppress unwanted side reactions. The effects of various parameters on the enantioselectivity and conversion of the reaction were studied. It was found that the homogeneous-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-phenylprop-2-en-1-amine resulted in complete conversion and good enantioselectivity. Also, the presence of CO2(g) impeded the side reactions and the formation of unwanted byproducts.  The best results found for 2-phenylprop-2-en-1-amine were implemented in the hydrogenation of its derivatives.</description>

   <description>The Kingston region has become a hub for sustainable energy development, in part because of the local geographyâs potential to support biomass, wind and solar energy, as well as the availability of workers with necessary skill sets and knowledge, and the presence of educational institutions associated with alternative energy. A 2011 review of the region also found that Ontarioâs Green Energy and Green Economy Act (2009), which provides incentives for renewable energy development, has had a significant influence on the initial growth of the local renewable energy sector.  &#xd;
        Kingstonâs renewable energy sector will be assessed to explore the local green labour trends and specific features of work, using four green job definitions (new direct, new indirect, ongoing direct and ongoing indirect)  to effectively characterize green employment. This research combines a review of local projects, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews to gain a comprehensive perspective of green work within the sector. Green work was categorized into new, ongoing and temporary as well as direct and indirect employment to provide greater detail based on the type of green work.  The results suggested that the regionâs renewable energy sector is dominated by employment in solar energy, and that workers are predominantly specialized with technical skills.   Approximately 65% of survey respondents noted their work indirectly supports renewable energy projects, providing secondary services and products.  &#xd;
	A series of multipliers were developed to estimate the number of jobs created in each category of employment on a per megawatt (MW) basis.  Specifically, survey data estimates that for every one new direct job, 0.65 new indirect jobs might be created, while 0.39 ongoing direct jobs and 1.06 ongoing indirect jobs might be retained.  Using these multipliers, it can be estimated that 242 direct and indirect green jobs related to the renewable energy sector will be created across twelve wind and solar projects completed, approved or proposed within the region.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-01-06 21:42:26.141</description>
   <description>Water distribution systems (WDSs) are responsible for delivering potable water to millions of consumers in urban centers around the globe. These systems consist of a multitude of interconnected components, including pipes, pumps, tanks, and reservoirs. The intent of this thesis was to characterize the energy dynamics of four real WDSs located in Ontario, Canada. First, a critical review of the existing body of research related to energy indicators for WDSs was completed. The review focused on two main themes: the relationship between water distribution and energy consumption and the application of energy indicators to provide meaningful guidance to WDS operators and owners regarding energy use. Previously developed energy indicators were then used to evaluate and compare the energy efficiency, energy lost to friction, energy lost to leakage, and the surplus energy of the four systems. Hypothesis testing was completed to identify statistically significant correlations between system characteristics (topography, hydraulic redundancy, peak demand) and energy use patterns in each system. The test systems were found to have a high energy efficiency ranging from 75-94% (leak-free) and 58-70% (leaky). Friction losses comprised 3-22% of the total energy input to the systems. Energy lost to leakage comprised 23-26% of total energy input to the test systems. The standard deviation of node elevation and hydraulic redundancy did not have a statistically significant correlation with the energy use indicators. High frictional energy losses during peak demand periods was identified as the cause of a strong and statistically significant correlation between peak hour factor and energy use in the four systems for the leak-free scenario.</description>

   <description>von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is a plasma multimeric glycoprotein involved in platelet&#xd;
adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury, and the carrier for coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII). Levels of VWF are influenced by many genetic and environmental factors, but appropriate&#xd;
levels are needed for a balanced hemostasis, since high levels of VWF are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, while low levels result in prolonged bleeding. Aging is associated with both increased levels of VWF and a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease,&#xd;
however, the exact mechanism responsible for this age-related increase remained unknown.&#xd;
In this thesis, we describe the age-related pathophysiology of VWF and the mechanisms&#xd;
responsible for the quantitative changes in VWF using human and mouse models. First, we found that the increase in VWF levels with age is highly dependent on ABO blood type, as both factors exert interrelated influences on VWF levels through secretion and clearance mechanisms. Second, we evaluated if similar age-related increases in VWF levels occurred in mice and found that&#xd;
C57BL/6 mice showed similar increases. Consequently, we used the mouse model to test the three mechanisms that influence VWF levels in plasma: synthesis, secretion and clearance. An age-related&#xd;
increase in Vwf expression was observed in lung, brain, spleen and liver samples obtained from aging mice. In addition, increased secretion of VWF, measured by mouse VWF propeptide levels, was also observed with advancing age. No significant changes with age were observed in VWF clearance, but several findings suggested that the mouse might not be the appropriate model to study age- and ABO-related VWF clearance mechanisms. Finally, we found that despite increased VWF oxidation and reduced ADAMTS13 activity, a neutral effect on VWF function was attained in later life.&#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, this is the first detailed study of the age-related pathophysiology of VWF. This thesis provides new insights into the mechanisms that control the increase in VWF levels with aging. The findings of this thesis could also have implications on the prevention of cardiovascular disease in older individuals, and on the treatment of patients with von Willebrand disease and&#xd;
hemophilia A in later life.</description>

   <description>This research presents the design and development of a magnetically actuated nozzle/diffuser micropump for use in the treatment of glaucoma. The micropump is composed of a cast poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) body containing all fluidic features, a spin coated PDMS membrane for sealing the fluidic features, and commercial silicone tubing for an inlet and an outlet. All components of the micropump are sealed together using only PDMS. The micropump has a final thickness of approximately 1mm due to a novel in-plane inlet and outlet tube attachment method, is flexible due to an all PDMS construction, easily fabricated due to a simple fabrication procedure, and is made of materials which show evidence of good biocompatibility. The pump is wirelessly actuated using a solenoid actuator and a small magnetic or ferromagnetic object placed on the surface of the PDMS membrane. The geometry of the solenoid has been optimized to produce the greatest magnetic field strength. Research work also involved the characterization of the thickness and Youngâs Modulus of PDMS and iron-PDMS composite membranes. Various pumps were fabricated and tested. For the most successful design, a peak flow rate of 135.0Î¼L/min and a maximum back pressure of 25mmH2O were obtained using an actuation frequency of 12Hz, duty cycle of 25%, and a 4-40 low strength steel nut for membrane actuation. Results show that increasing the membrane thickness, using the most strongly attracted membrane actuator, and using a 50% actuation duty cycle increases micropump performance. The results also suggest that using a magnetic material as opposed to a ferromagnetic material would allow for the membrane actuator to be reduced in size. The peak flow rate of the micropump is significantly greater than the rate of aqueous humor production (2.8 Â± 0.8Î¼L/min), meaning that the performance of the micropump is sufficient for the intended application.</description>

   <description>The focus of this research study was to provide insight into high school studentsâ perceptions of engineering and the work engineers do. Participants included Grades 9 and 10 students, all of which were enrolled in academic English, Math, Science courses and are on the pathway towards college or university. This research was framed within a constructivist theoretical framework, and sequential multiple methods were utilized for data collection. The phase 1 questionnaire incorporated closed and open-ended questions pertaining to the engineering profession and was completed by 97 students, while 11 students participated in the phase 2 semi-structured interviews.&#xd;
The findings show that the major categories that emerged from these studentsâ descriptions of engineering involve the mental aspects of designing or creating, knowledge in Math and Science, and the physical aspect of building. In addition, some students were very clear that designers are the source of creative and innovative ideas, scientists are the source of new theories, and engineers are responsible for turning those creative ideas and/or the new theories into reality by physically building something. The perception that engineering involves building was a major source of confusion as many of these students described engineers in roles that could also be used to describe skilled trades. Therefore, a significant percentage of these Grades 9 and 10 students have unclear views about engineering, which suggests they currently cannot make an informed decision in considering engineering for a possible career path.&#xd;
An increase in student awareness of the engineering profession is needed to ensure students have the knowledge to make informed career choices, which may lead to achieving high-quality engineering graduates and diversifying the profession in Canada. One way to meet the current demand for engineers within Canada may be to ensure that pre-university students have sufficient knowledge about the work of a professional engineer as well as the important aspects of the profession. With this knowledge, they can make an informed decision in considering engineering as a possible choice for post-secondary study.</description>

   <description>Plants, as sessile organisms, require rapid and efficient signalling pathways in order to respond to environmental stimuli and to coordinate developmental programs. Stimulus-specific transient elevations in free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt ), otherwise referred to as calcium (Ca2+) signals, are known to encode information regarding external stressors or internal developmental cues, which can be interpreted by Ca2+-binding proteins (CBPs), termed Ca2+ sensors. Though much is known about Calmodulin (CaM), the most abundant Ca2+ sensor, relatively little is known about the CaM-like family of Ca2+ sensors (CMLs), which comprise a 50-member family in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). In order to understand how CMLs contribute to Ca2+ signalling, it is necessary to study their biochemistry and physiological roles. In this study, two paralogous CMLs of unknown function, CML15 and CML16, were studied through a combination of approaches including protein biochemistry, gene promoter-reporter analysis, and physiological assays. Promoter-reporter analysis demonstrated that the CML16 promoter is constitutively active across a range of Arabidopsis tissues, whereas CML15 promoter activity is restricted to the stamen. Among a range of environmental conditions tested, salinity stress was observed to inhibit CML16 promoter activity. Phenotypic analysis, across a range of growth stages, of gene-knockout transgenic plants lacking either CML15 or CML16 did not reveal any differences from wild-type plants. Biochemical characterization of CML15 and CML16 indicated that these CMLs possess properties consistent with their predicted roles as Ca2+ sensors. CML15 and CML16 were observed to undergo Ca2+-dependent conformational changes that expose hydrophobic residues, likely for interaction with unknown protein targets. Furthermore, both CMLs were found to bind magnesium (Mg2+) in the absence of Ca2+, but demonstrated high affinity Ca2+ binding in the presence of Mg2+. Putative protein targets for CML15 and CML16 were isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening although the physiological relevance of these as CML effectors remains unknown. Collectively, my data reveals that these CMLs behave biochemically like typical Ca2+ sensors, possess distinct and largely non-overlapping gene expression patterns, and do not appear to be critical for Arabidopsis growth and development under typical growth conditions.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a visual technique for localization in underground mines and indoor environments that exploits the use of a calibrated monocular camera. The objective of this work is to provide 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF) localization in the presence of a 3D map made up of 3D point clouds co-registered with intensity information. An efficient data structure, referred to as the feature database, is used to store the image features appearing in the 3D map, and to efficiently retrieve a match for a query image during localization. The Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem is then used to compute the 6 DoF position of the calibrated camera at the time of image capture given the location of the 2D query image features and their 3D coordinates. &#xd;
&#xd;
Two experiments were performed using this technique: ground truth experiments and localization experiments. The ground truth experiments, performed on two datasets, compare the localization output against a reference position. The results of the ground truth experiments indicate that the calculated camera position using the proposed technique approximates the reference position, with small errors on the order of millimetres. It was also found that the accuracy of localization increases as more inliers become available in the query image. The localization experiments were performed on datasets collected in underground mines and indoor environments to test the performance of the technique in different environments. The query images used in the localization experiments were captured with two different cameras, demonstrating that any type of monocular camera may be used during localization, as long as a sufficient number of environmental features can be extracted from the query images.</description>

   <description>Aluminum alloys AA5754 and AA6063 were thermomechanically processed (TMP) to investigate the relationship between structure, strength, and ductility, and effect on failure. Model parameters from the Saimoto-Van Houtte (SVH) constitutive equation were determined from experimentally measured stress-strain curves and correlated to the evolving microstructure of the two alloys at various stages of TMP.  Using the SVH equation and the concept of equivalent plastic work, the yield loci for AA5754 after four different treatment conditions were modeled, allowing for the balanced biaxial and plane strain loading ratios to be found.  Interfacial decohesion was observed in both alloys by analysis of the fracture surface and is attributed to iron atom segregation during cooling. This quench sensitivity effect can ideally be removed through TMP.  Nano-void nucleation and growth ductile failure models were developed for both undeformed control and prestrained AA6063 conditions to determine if the source of failure is present within the initial microstructure, as proposed by Lloyd. The evolving fracture strains, yield stress and inter-obstacle spacing at yield were all found to evolve with a temporal exponent of 0.3 and 0.2 for the control and prestrained conditions, respectively. This evidence indicates that both TMP routes result in failure initiating at precipitates and that introduction of dislocations changes the diffusion kinetics of artificial ageing. If the quench-sensitivity effect remained after TMP, higher temperature annealing at 230Â°C was found to improve ductility, and is believed to be due to precipitation of Al6Fe into the grain boundaries. The balanced biaxial conditions in AA5754 were determined from the SVH-based yield locus model to be all located off the 1:1 applied stress ratio. The plane strain conditions were determined to change due to the differences in work hardening in the two directions. The plane strain condition is redefined as a net zero increase in minor strain, rather than imposing a zero strain in the minor direction.</description>

   <description>In this research, a novel method for visual odometry (VO) and the integration with multi-âsensors navigation systems for vehicular platforms is proposed. The proposed method âpartitions the field of single camera view into regions of interests where each region likely âcontains different types of visual features. By applying computer vision processing âtechniques, ambiguous pose estimation is calculated up to a scale factor. The proposed âmethod uses aiding measurements from vehicleâs odometer to adaptively resolve the scale âfactor ambiguity problem in monocular camera systems. Unlike some state-of-art âapproaches, this work does not depend on offline pre-processing or predefined landmarks âor visual maps. In addition, this work addresses unknown uncontrolled environments where âmoving objects likely exist. Innovative odometer-aided Local Bundle Adjustment (LBA) âalong with a fuzzy C-mean clustering mechanism is proposed to reject outliers âcorresponding to moving objects. A Gaussian Mixture approach is also applied to detect âvisual background regions during stationary periods which enables further rejection of âmoving objects. Finally, an empirical scoring method is applied to calculate a matching âscore of the different visual features and to use this score in a Kalman filter as âmeasurement covariance noise to integrate VO-estimated pose changes within a larger multi-âsensors integrated navigation system. Experimental work was performed with a physical âvehicular platform equipped by MEMS inertial sensors, GPS, speed measurements and âGPS-enabled camera. The experimental work includes three testing vehicular trajectories in âdowntown Toronto and the surrounding areas. The experimental work showed significant ânavigation improvements during long GPS outages where only VO is fused with inertial âsensors and the vehicleâs speed measurements.â</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-01-12 14:57:18.108</description>
   <description>Water reuse is an increasingly popular consideration for municipalities, developers, and businesses. Currently, the majority of water reuse applications originate from Australia, Southeast Asian nations, and the Middle East. Stresses posed by population growth and/or water scarcity are the primary drivers for the prevalence of reuse applications in these regions. However, an increasing number of regions in North America are in the process of implementing, or have already implemented, some form of water reuse. Water reuse is increasingly adopted by municipalities due to its potential to combat (a) increasing water scarcity in urban areas, (b) decreasing water quality of receiving waters due to wastewater discharge and urban runoff inputs, and (c) diffuse pollution inputs from rural areas within municipalities. &#xd;
This thesis focuses on stormwater reuse. Historically, stormwater has been regarded as an inconvenience. Traditional stormwater management efforts have primarily focused on channeling stormwater away from urban centres as efficiently as possible. However, the adverse impacts of urban runoff on receiving waters, as well as the increasing need for more intelligent water resources management, are gradually changing the perspective on stormwater. Increasingly, stormwater is being regarded as an asset rather than an inconvenience, as well as a potential alternative water source which could be used to supplement domestic water supplies.      &#xd;
This thesis presents the results of the research undertaken to develop a decision-making framework to aid Canadian municipalities in the planning and implementation of stormwater reuse. The objective of the framework is to provide planners, developers, and engineers with a management model to aid in understanding the interactions among the decision-making variables in stormwater reuse.    &#xd;
The thesis begins with a literature review covering the history of reuse in North America. Next, a critical assessment of the reviewed literature is used to develop a decision-making framework for stormwater reuse implementation within Canadian municipalities. The framework delineates the major decision-making factors potentially influencing implementation choices, as well as the interactions among these factors. Finally, the thesis provides an example of framework application, discussion of potential framework limitations, and recommendations for future work.</description>

   <description>The overarching goal of the current dissertation was to examine how emotion regulation (ER) underlies the development of anxious and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Each study took a comprehensive and longitudinal approach. Study 1 described spontaneous, real-time individual differences in regulation of emotional responses (experience, expression, and arousal) in adolescence and the relation with internalizing symptoms across one year. Using latent profile analysis, five different patterns of emotional responses to social stress were identified and were related to different ER habits and internalizing symptoms. The majority of adolescents had similar emotional responses one year later; however, changes in avoidance, depressive symptoms, and trait shame were related to transitions from lower emotional responses to higher emotional responses. Study 2 used a multiple mediation model to test the relations between shame and internalizing symptoms (depression and social anxiety) across two years. The relations between shame and internalizing symptoms were bidirectional. The ER habits of avoidance and suppression (measured in the laboratory) mediated relations between shame and increased internalizing symptoms, whereas rumination was more central to understanding how social anxiety symptoms led to further shame. Study 3 involved delivering a 6-week training on improving ER (e.g., improving awareness, reappraisal, acceptance, and mindfulness, and reducing avoidance, suppression, and rumination) for first year university students aged 17 to 20 years. Results indicated some significant positive change in ER across the training sessions for the training group, whereas there was no significant change in the comparison group.  However, there were no significant positive effects on ER or internalizing symptoms at the post or follow-up assessments. In fact, anxiety was elevated in the training group in relation to the comparison group at the follow-up. Emotional responses and ER habits were strongly related to internalizing symptoms across all studies. Results and future directions were discussed in relation to four major themes in adolescent emotion regulation research: (1) ER habits in adolescence, (2) ER across time, (3) Goal-Based ER, and (4) ER in social contexts.</description>

   <description>Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is an opportunistic human pathogen known to cause severe pneumonia in those infected. It primarily infects human alveolar macrophage cells, altering vesicular trafficking while evading innate immune response. Once internalized through phagocytosis by the host macrophage cell, L. pneumophila hijacks the host cellâs signaling and vesicular trafficking pathways. To accomplish this, L. pneumophila has evolved a type IVB secretion system that is capable of transporting effector proteins through its inner and outer membranes and through the vacuole into the host cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the effector proteins perform post-translational modifications (PTMs) to the host proteins, altering their functions. The aim of this thesis was to characterize an effector protein that was identified using the process of âmachine learningâ, aptly named Lem23 (Legionella effector identified by machine learning). Using protein crystallography, poorly diffracting Lem23 crystals were obtained and, subsequently optimized using reductive lysine methylation. The optimized crystals led to a structure with a resolution of 1.55 AÌ; further analysis revealed that Lem23 is a Fic protein. Lem23 contains the required 6 Î±-helices that constitute a Fic core, a slightly modified catalytic loop, and a large insertion that may be an interaction domain for its target proteins. Using sequence analysis and structural knowledge the possibility of Lem23 AMPylating its protein target was assessed. AMPylation is a post- translational modification common to Fic proteins. Finally a HEK293 expression and co- immunoprecipitation procedure was used to pull-down Lem23âs target proteins during host cell infection. Preliminary mass spectrometry results of co-immunoprecipitated proteins revealed Lem23 interacts with two proteins involved with the cellular apoptotic pathway. This study provides further information about one effector protein, Lem23, and its potential importance in the infection process to inhibit the host cells innate immune response.</description>

   <description>Surface limitations in terms of infrastructure and the need for more direct transportation routes often call for the development of underground construction works in geotechnically unfavourable conditions, which oftentimes require a temporary pre-support system prior to excavation in order to avoid tunnel collapse or surface settlement. One such pre-support system is the umbrella arch system, which has been gaining popularity due to its lower cost and reduced time to employ when compared to other pre-support systems. However, the umbrella arch system has been employed without a complete understanding of its mechanical response. The system has been found in the literature to be either under- or over- designed with negative impacts on safety and/or cost.  This study makes three major contributions with respect to increasing the understanding of the relevant geomechanical aspects and the use of the umbrella arch system. &#xd;
The first major contribution is the development of a relevant nomenclature standard in order to categorize and define umbrella arch elements and systems, which lead to the creation of an empirically driven Umbrella Arch Selection Chart (UASC) with a view to aiding initial design of tunnel support. &#xd;
The second major contribution is the establishment of a design methodology, based upon advanced numerical modelling techniques to aid in the optimized design of the umbrella arch arrangement for site-specific conditions. These techniques were based primarily on robust parametric analyses utilizing advanced two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical models complemented with field data from select case studies for validation purposes. &#xd;
The third major contribution is the development of a semi-analytical model for umbrella arch systems employed in squeezing ground conditions by incorporating elastic foundation theory and Convergence-Confinement Method (CCM). The model addresses the deficiencies associated with the CCM when supports are installed close to the tunnel face. As umbrella arch systems are always employed within close proximity of the tunnel face, an investigation and subsequent improvement to the CCM was conducted.&#xd;
These three major contributions are introduced and explained in detail; including a discussion of how they are incorporated into the tunnel support design process and throughout the construction and monitoring phase of the project.</description>

   <description>Social networks represent a set of participants and the pairwise relationships between them.&#xd;
There are several different types of networks, such as directed networks, networks with typed edges, dynamic networks and signed networks, as well as composition of different types of networks. Each individual behaves in certain ways in particular situations. Each social situation could represent a status over a time interval for a dynamic network or a specific relationship or role, such as a working relationship or friendship in a network with typed edges, or an incoming role or outgoing role in a directed network. &#xd;
&#xd;
In much social network analysis, edges are only positively weighted, and also of a single type. Ignoring the qualitative differences of relationships rules out several interesting kinds of analysis. &#xd;
I develop a novel way to analyze such networks by considering the qualitatively different social roles that each individual can play in a network. Each individual is represented by copies corresponding to the roles. &#xd;
&#xd;
Each role or status and the corresponding connections define a subgraph. I model the subgraph as a layer, and show how to weight the edges connecting the layers to produce a consistent spectral embedding.&#xd;
This embedding can be used to compute social network properties of graphs of different types, to predict edges, edge types, and edge direction, as well as to track the change of role over time. I illustrate the approaches using synthetic and real-world datasets.&#xd;
&#xd;
Furthermore, conventional Laplacian approaches are designed for graphs with positively weighted edges and do not deal with signed graphs, which have positively and negatively weighted edges. I derive spectral analysis methods for signed graphs  and extend the methods for graph based semi-supervised learning. Using real-world data, I show that they produce robust results.</description>

   <description>This qualitative phenomenological study examined the intersections of gender, technology, and composition pedagogy. The purpose of this study was to explore how female students and diverse instructors incorporated personal experiences in writing and teaching practices in an asynchronous online composition course. Life experiences allow students to reflect on past knowledge to generate ideas, topics, and evidence in academic essays. Such knowledge situates authors as rhetorical agents and adds to critically reflective thinking and writing, particularly for female students who choose narratives that challenge mainstream narratives. In an asynchronous online course, time, space, and technology change the quantity and quality of interpersonal communication. The results of this study show that the separation of the participants from other individuals offers benefits and challenges. Three online instructors were interviewed and fourteen in-depth interviews were collected from a diverse group of female participants enrolled in online composition courses in a rural public college. The findings of the study indicate that personal narratives contribute to knowledge-building when the participants establish a strong social presence with other learners and when instructors create positive online contexts that promote a community of inquiry. Various forces influenced how and why these participants incorporated autobiographical experiences into their writing. These forces include the participantsâ writing goals, online communication, audience awareness, and the participantsâ assumptions about academic writing contexts. The results of this study offer new insights on how to incorporate narratives in online writing courses in meaningful ways.</description>

   <description>Movember, the annual month-long charitable event in which men grow moustaches to raise funds and awareness for various âmenâs healthâ causes, originated in 2003 as a challenge between a group of Australian friends to âbring back the moustacheâ as a fashionable grooming practice. Since its humble beginnings, Movember has grown as a charitable initiative, boasting over 4.5 million participants and raising $677 million. With participants coming from as many as 21 countries worldwide, Movember is a global phenomenon closely articulated with contemporary fashion and popular culture trends. By examining the 2012 and 2013 campaigns, I consider what social and historical forces have contributed to the popularity of Movember and the resurgence of the moustache as a trendy grooming practice for men. I investigate how the movementâs fun-loving approach to charity shapes, and is shaped by, dominant ideas about masculinity and gender more broadly. I conceive of Movember as a global brand and explore how the campaign is situated within consumer culture and how it influences contemporary philanthropic practices. &#xd;
&#xd;
Informed by the theoretical perspectives of Michel Foucault, I conduct extensive discourse analyses of online resources related to Movember including the campaign website, blogs and social media. I also examine media coverage about the movement, moustache-related popular culture, and promotional materials distributed by the campaign and its sponsors. My findings reveal how Movember is constructed as a post-political movement. The campaignâs use of irony as a discursive strategy and promotion of universal values concerning health and social progress actively depoliticizes conversations about âmenâs health.â Throughout my dissertation, I develop two ideas â brand(ed) activism and ironic masculinity â to conceptualize how Movember enables problematic understandings of gender and philanthropy while constraining the space for politicized discussions about health and masculinity. Through these concepts, I explore the relationship of Movember to broader cultural trends including shaving and grooming rituals, hipster culture, kitsch and retro commodities, the politics of selfies, and hockeyâs playoff beard. I argue that Movemberâs mission to âchange the face of menâs healthâ is limited because it preserves normative definitions of gender and activism within the confines of neoliberalism and commercialized popular culture.</description>

   <description>In a multi-agent system where each agent acts in its respective self-interest, the problem of many-to-many allocations is explored. The question for the regulator making the allocations is: what should be the allocation protocol when there are many resource provider agents and many resource seeker agents? A regulator, given that it cannot force an agent to choose a specific strategy, must design a protocol that supports its agenda. Motivated by the needs in the emerging electricity networks, this thesis considers the problem under&#xd;
incomplete information, i.e., when the type, the abstraction of an agent's particulars which influence the agent's strategy choice, of any specific agent is not known. Two kinds of allocation models are developed, namely, (i) one based on bilateral agreements, and (ii) one based on use of incentives to influence the strategy choices. The models are presented in&#xd;
the electricity distribution contexts.&#xd;
With a nominal role for the regulator, the thesis explored a multi-cycle model and a&#xd;
single-cycle model in which the allocations result from a series of bilateral bargaining encounters. The possibility of multiple equilibria in these models implies an unpredictable outcome, as the agents are uncertain of the specific equilibrium selection. This motivates the pursuit of a dominant strategy solution. Providing a stronger role for the regulator,&#xd;
the conditions for dominant strategy solution are identified in a single-cycle model. In this bilateral encounter and bargaining model, influencing a set of resource providers to pursue&#xd;
a specific strategy results in dominant strategy equilibrium. Given the parameters of the model, each agent can determine its respective dominant strategy by using the commonly known probability distribution of agents' types. &#xd;
Relaxing the requirement that the agents know the probability distribution of agents' types, the model of a regulator empowered to provide incentives to influence agents' strategy choices is adopted. A many-to-many allocation procedure is composed using two one-to-many allocation mechanisms. The conditions under which a system of incentives leads to a dominant strategy solution, are identified.</description>

   <description>The hip joint is often described as a ball and socket joint, which has two key implications: congruent interacting bony joint surfaces and purely rotational relative motion.  This model can be challenged in two ways: that the geometry of the hip does not have the congruency&#xd;
required for sphere-on-sphere contact, and that the joint translation occurs when the joint is moving within its accepted range of motion.&#xd;
The closely related shoulder joint is known to have translatory motion; however, the extent of these translations attributable to different soft-tissue constraints is not well understood.  The subject&#xd;
of this dissertation is the measurement of translatory motions and understanding the role of surrounding soft tissues in the overall kinematics of human hip and shoulder joints.&#xd;
&#xd;
Here, human cadavers were used as a model for studying detailed passive motion.  A surgical navigation system, with sub-millimeter accuracy, was used to measure the translatory motion of these cadavers&#xd;
in different soft tissue states.  Every cadaver hip and shoulder exhibited subtle but definite aspherical motions.  Soft tissues partially constrained the hip but did not correct for underlying morphological asphericity.  There was no consistent pattern of translation.  Changes in the shoulder soft tissues led to distinct changes in the translatory motion that could be used to describe the&#xd;
etiology of shoulder instabilities.</description>

   <description>A method to fabricate solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) anodes in a controlled process has been developed. Adjustment of deposition rate was found to alter the anode porosity and particle size distribution. A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) testing system was enhanced to complete steam electrolysis testing of the cells with prepared anodes. &#xd;
To prepare anodes of desirable morphology and uniform thickness the effect of spraying parameters on anode morphology were studied. Sonication of the anode inks was found to reduce particle agglomerations in the ink dispersion. A technique for obtaining and analyzing SEM cross sections of SOECs was developed to study prepared anodes. Investigation of sprayed anodes revealed that the porosity decreased as the deposition rate was increased. Using ImageJ analysis software particle size distributions of prepared anodes were determined. Anodes deposited at higher deposition rates were seen to have larger particle sizes. A greater anode deposition rate increased the likelihood of particle settling and agglomeration, leading to the decreased porosity and increased particle size in the anodes. &#xd;
A membrane humidifier was developed and tested to steadily supply steam to the electrolysis cell, the first such humidifier combined with a ProbotStatTM testing rig. Using the modified testing system, a testing method for SOEC analysis was developed. The process for producing polarization curves was studied to determine the desired testing conditions. During testing hysteresis between increasing and decreasing polarization curves, and anode conditioning during constant current electrolysis were seen for some cells. The appearance or absence of both phenomena were seen to be connected.</description>

   <description>Background: &#xd;
Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a cluster of risk factors associated with increased incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Personalized lifestyle interventions using diet and exercise are effective approaches to reverse metabolic syndrome, but have not been well adopted by Canadians. The Canadian Health Advanced By Nutrition and Graded Exercise (CHANGE) demonstration project focused on implementing a physician-led lifestyle intervention program in the primary care setting. Understanding how dietitian and kinesiologists sessions impact patient outcomes may help the implementation of other lifestyle intervention programs.&#xd;
Methods: &#xd;
A retrospective pre-post cohort study was conducted using data collected prospectively as part of the CHANGE demonstration project. Patients in the CHANGE demonstration project were adults diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in one of three Canadian primary care clinics. All 305 patients were provided a one year intensive personalized diet and exercise program through a multidisciplinary approach involving their family physician, a dietitian and a kinesiologist. Metabolic syndrome severity was measured using a continuous metabolic syndrome score standardized to have a standard deviation of one. Half a standard deviation change in metabolic syndrome score represents a moderate effect size. Robust multiple linear regression with multiple imputation was the method used to model the association between the exposures and outcomes while controlling for potential confounders and precision variables. A mediation analysis was also conducted where warranted and the statistical significance was tested by bootstrapping of the imputed sample. &#xd;
Results: &#xd;
	The mean decrease in metabolic syndrome score was 0.5 after three months of intervention. The number of kinesiologist visits was not significantly associated with change in metabolic syndrome score but each dietitian visit was associated with a -0.048 [CI -0.09, -0.01] change in metabolic syndrome score. Although statistically significant, only 12.5% of the improvement in the metabolic syndrome score associated with dietitian contacts was partially mediated by the Healthy Eating Index. &#xd;
Conclusion:&#xd;
	In the context of a multi-modal primary care-based lifestyle intervention program, increasing dietitian contacts appears to be associated with an improvement in metabolic syndrome score. More research is needed to understand what mediates the treatment effect of dietitian visits.</description>

   <description>Stroke is a leading cause of disability that can result in a variety of motor, sensory, and/or cognitive deficits. Importantly, use of sensory feedback to guide motor actions, a crucial component of voluntary motor control, may be compromised in these individuals. Assessment of these impairments is important to guide decisions about clinical rehabilitation. However, current clinical tools are often subjective and use coarse criteria-based scoring. We took a novel approach of using a robotic exoskeleton to provide objective and continuous measures of impairments post-stroke. Subjects with stroke and non-disabled controls were assessed on a series of robotic tasks. Impairments were defined as performance outside the range of 95% of non-disabled controls.&#xd;
In our first study, we assessed the use of limb afferent feedback to make a motor corrective response with a postural perturbation task. Up to 79% of subjects with stroke had impairments in the coordination, timing, and/or accuracy of their corrective responses. Interestingly, impairments were often bilateral.&#xd;
In our second study, we investigated whether impairments in the use of limb afferent feedback for action and perception are independent. Stroke-related impairments were independent in the perturbation and limb position matching tasks, both of which rely entirely on limb afferent feedback (Fisher, p=0.79). Performance was weakly correlated between the perturbation and visually-guided reaching task, both of which are motor tasks (rs=0.39, p=0.002). Thus, each task provides unique information of individual impairments post-stroke.&#xd;
In the final study, we designed an Object Hit and Avoid task where subjects were instructed to hit target objects falling from the top of the screen while avoiding distractor objects. Up to 78% of subjects with stroke were identified as impaired in task parameters and 50% had impaired hit selectivity. The specificity of objects hit was correlated with cognitive function (rs=-0.49, p=2x10-10).&#xd;
The results of this thesis highlight that many individual subjects with stroke have impairments in the use of sensory feedback to select and control motor actions. These tasks provide unique information on impairments associated with stroke. Future studies are necessary to identify how this information may guide patient-centered rehabilitation to ameliorate the effects of stroke.</description>

   <description>The coagulant protein Factor VIII (FVIII) has been the subject of much debate and controversy regarding where, when, and how it is expressed and produced in the human body for much of the past 30-40 years. Expression was only recently linked exclusively to the endothelial cells; its main source is in the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, while extra-hepatic vascular endothelium is the secondary source. This is highly notable as von Willebrand Factor (VWF), FVIIIâs carrier protein, is made primarily in the vascular endothelium. However, FVIII expression is known to not be ubiquitous across the endothelium. The mechanisms behind what allows certain endothelial cells, but not others, to express and produce FVIII are largely unknown. This thesis examined aspects of the endothelial microenvironment that may influence how the endothelium behaves in vivo with a focus on inflammation: biochemical factors in the form of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFÎ±, short-term laminar and short- and long-term oscillatory biomechanical shear stress. This study investigated how these conditions were able to modulate the gene expression and protein production of FVIII and VWF, and provides evidence for a role of both these conditions as potential regulators of FVIII and VWF expression and secretion. Through the examination of these conditions in multiple endothelial cell isolates, we propose the significance of accounting for endothelial cell heterogeneity in this type of study. In particular, we have shown that a quiescent phenotype post-inflammation may induce FVIII, and that an inflammatory phenotype, through oscillatory and short-term shear, can induce FVIII in some cases. We also linked our data towards defining the acute phase response in endothelial cells, and provide evidence as to the extra-hepatic FVIII response. Endothelial cells continue to be a major source of interest with reference to FVIII synthesis, storage and secretion, and as we continue to learn more about the molecular regulation of FVIII; this provides new avenues in understanding the balance between hepatic and extra-hepatic FVIII synthesis.</description>

   <description>The primary goal of this research is to understand the response of the tyrosine receptor kinase A (trkA)-expressing cells of the myenteric plexus, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) to&#xd;
augmented levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) within the descending colon. Using lines of transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the NGF promoter, we found a subpopulation of adendritic EGFP+ neurons in the myenteric plexus.&#xd;
These colonic EGFP+ neurons display positive immunostaining for calretinin but not nitric oxide synthase 1, (NOS1), two biomarkers of mouse myenteric neurons. Induction of colonic inflammation confirms local increases in NGF mRNA/protein levels, which coincide with heightened detection of EGFP by myenteric neurons. Though NOS1+ myenteric neurons display&#xd;
positive immunostaining for trkA (the receptor required for NGF binding/signalling), transgenic&#xd;
overexpression of NGF by smooth muscle cells in the colon does not alter the survival, somal size, or axonal density of trkA-expressing NOS1+ myenteric neurons. Mice lacking functional p75NTR (the second receptor required for NGF binding) exhibit significantly less axonal damage among NOS1+ myenteric neurons, in response to chemically induced colonic inflammation. Likewise, trkA-expressing sympathetic axons that innervate the myenteric ganglia&#xd;
display less damage in the absence of p75NTR. Immunostaining of the lumbar DRG of mice with DSS-induced colitis for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) shows reactivity of Iba1+, macrophage-like cells. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2DPAGE) coupled with Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) several increases in protein expression were found in the lumbar DRG of mice with DSS-induced colitis.</description>

   <description>The College English Test (CET) is a large-scale language testing program implemented for the purpose of enhancing English as a foreign language (EFL) in the Chinese tertiary education context. Its results have been used for different purposes in varied contexts. The multiple uses have generated growing concerns and debate over consequences and validity. However, in the field of language assessment, there are few empirical studies that investigate test consequences within a coherent validation framework. Without such studies, itâs hard to know how and why the CET program influences teaching and learning. To address this research gap and research problem, this multi-phase, multi-method study investigated the intended and unintended consequences of the CET, focusing on its washback on studentsâ learning and learning outcomes. Drawing on the argument-based validation approach, I linked evidence about the CET consequences to construct validity. Participants of this study were multiple stakeholders including the test developer, test users and students. Interview, questionnaire, and test score data were collected. The interview data were analyzed thematically. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the questionnaire and the test score data. Findings of this study highlight the complexity of the consequences of the CET in the Chinese educational and societal contexts. This complexity was attributable to both properties of the test and other contextual forces, particularly uses of the test in the educational and societal contexts. These findings indicate that while the CET provides useful information about studentsâ achievement of the curriculum, the decision to use the testing program to enhance EFL education is not supported by evidence regarding its consequences. This study sheds light on understanding why and in what ways the CET washback exists in the Chinese educational context. Findings of this study have significant implications for future washback research and for the CET implementation as well as EFL teaching and learning.</description>

   <description>Software quality is vital to the success of a software project. Fixing defects is the&#xd;
major activity to continuously improve software quality. Given that a real development team usually exhibits limited resources and tight schedules, it is important to&#xd;
prioritize testing activities and optimize development resources. Predicting defective entities (e.g., files or classes) ahead helps achieve such a goal. Defect prediction has attracted&#xd;
considerable attention from both academia and industry in the last decade.&#xd;
A typical defect prediction model is built upon software metrics and labelled defect&#xd;
data that are collected from the historical data of a software project. A defect prediction&#xd;
model can be applied within the same project (within-project defect prediction) or on other&#xd;
projects (cross-project defect prediction). However, due to the diversity in development&#xd;
processes, a defect prediction model is often not transferable and requires to be rebuilt&#xd;
when the target project changes. As it consumes additional effort to build and maintain&#xd;
a defect prediction model for a particular project, it is of significant interest to generalize&#xd;
a defect prediction model. A generalized defect prediction model relieves the need to&#xd;
rebuild a defect prediction model for each target project. Moreover, it helps reveal a general&#xd;
relationship between software metrics and defect data.&#xd;
In this thesis, we analyze the feasibility of generalizing defect prediction models. First,&#xd;
we analyze how the distribution of the values of software metrics varies across projects of&#xd;
different context factors (e.g., programming language and system size). We observe that&#xd;
such distributions do vary across projects, but can also be similar across projects of different context factors. Second, we investigate the impact that the pre-processing steps (in&#xd;
particular, transformation and aggregation of software metrics) have on the performance of&#xd;
defect prediction models. We find that the pre-processing steps impact the performance of&#xd;
defect prediction models, and therefore need to be considered towards generalizing defect&#xd;
prediction models. Finally, we propose two approaches for generalizing defect prediction&#xd;
models with supervised (requiring the training data) and unsupervised (without the training&#xd;
data) methods, respectively. Our results show that both approaches are feasible to generalize defect prediction models.</description>

   <description>In 1540, Duke Cosimo I deâ Medici and his wife Eleonora di Toledo moved from the Medici palace on the Via Larga into the Palazzo Vecchio, the former seat of the Florentine republican government. As part of the ducal coupleâs efforts to fashion their public identity, they embarked on an extensive new decorative program, which included entire walls, ceilings, and tapestries ornamented with grotesques. When Cosimoâs son and heir, Francesco I, married Giovanna dâAustria and then ruled years later with his second wife Bianca Cappello, they commissioned more grotesques for the palace. Though they are used throughout the seat of Florentine politics, the grotesques of the Palazzo Vecchio have been largely unstudied.&#xd;
According to sixteenth-century sources, artists had the license to follow their whims and fancies when they executed grotesques. The central question of this study is why these patrons would have commissioned so many works in which they were expected to relinquish control of the project to the artists, especially in spaces in which their self-fashioning was paramount. Cosimo was, after all, well-known for his rigid control over even minute political and cultural affairs. Particularly revealing are the texts of Giorgio Vasari, who both championed the status of the artist and tirelessly promoted the interests of his patrons, and the grotesques executed by Marco da Faenza under Vasariâs supervision. These works suggest that certain themes and guidelines were dictated to the artists, but that within the given parameters a great deal of freedom, whimsy, and humour were welcome, complementing the values held by sixteenth-century Italian courts. These themes and the degree of license permitted varied according to the location of the grotesques as well as the gender of the intended viewers.  The rich cultural connotations of the style and the capriciousness with which imagery could be manipulated produced a range of allâantica painting that could be elevated or base, religious or secular, serious or playful. In every case, with their rhetoric of freedom, grotesques created the impression that the Medici cultivated free expression and established a Golden Age in which liberty reigned.</description>

   <description>âFrederick H. Evans: A Man of Catholic Interestsâ considers the ways in which art, literature,&#xd;
theatre, music, and politics were essential elements in shaping the photographic work of Frederick H.&#xd;
Evans (British, 1853-1943). Key to this study is the appreciation of the social circles in which Evans&#xd;
circulated. Evans was connected to important figures that emerged from the Aesthetic movement,&#xd;
such as craftsman William Morris, illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, and playwright George Bernard&#xd;
Shaw. Praised for his architectural photography, Evans was much more than an architectural&#xd;
photographer, and he worked in a variety of genres, including portraiture and landscape. Evans&#xd;
contributed to the period in which he lived not only through his photographic work, but also&#xd;
through his writing, publishing, lectures, and involvement in the photographic community.&#xd;
Chapters focus on various elements of Evansâs life, including his relationship with the written word&#xd;
as a bookseller, writer, bibliophile, and publisher; his political views and how these were expressed&#xd;
in his study of Kelmscott Manor, the country home of William Morris; his social connections as&#xd;
illustrated through his portraiture; different aspects of performance as an important part of his&#xd;
life, as seen through a series of photographs he made of the cast of Mrs. Warrenâs Profession; and&#xd;
the influence of literature upon his landscape work. While this retrospective consideration cannot&#xd;
recreate the artwork as it was seen and experienced at the time, this approach can explain how&#xd;
Evansâs wider interests and social connections were an integral part of his creative process. In many&#xd;
ways, Evans was a point of convergence and connected people and ideas through his photography.&#xd;
Therefore, this thesis argues that Evansâs photography responded in meaningful ways to what was&#xd;
occurring artistically, socially, and politically during the Victorian and Edwardian periods, and in&#xd;
doing so places his work within a cultural context.</description>

   <description>Wet sedge meadows are the most productive vegetation communities in the High Arctic. Preliminary research suggests that this vegetation type is a net carbon sink, yet the controls â and the scale at which those controls act â are not well understood. If warming of the High Arctic enhances or limits wet sedge growth, we may observe changes in the percentage of land area occupied by these meadows, resulting in significant alterations to the carbon balance of high arctic landscapes.&#xd;
	Here, the factors controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of wet sedge meadows are examined at different spatial and temporal scales and environmental data is used to create predictive models of CO2 exchange. Automated and static CO2 exchange systems recorded CO2 exchange at three wet sedge sites at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, NU, from June to August, 2014. In conjunction, time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were collected to quantify the phenological stage of the wet sedge vegetation type through the growing season, and soil temperature, air temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil moisture, and active layer depth were measured.&#xd;
Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements indicated dominant plant uptake through photosynthesis, and spectrally separable âwetâ and âdryâ sedge areas yielded significantly different NEE values at both sampling scales. NDVI measurements indicated that spring greening and peak summer biomass differed between wet and dry areas, but that NDVI was not strongly related to CO2 exchange trends in these systems. Abiotic factors such as air and soil temperature and soil moisture â varying over time and space throughout the season â influenced CO2 exchange to varying degrees at each scale. &#xd;
	Predictive models of ecosystem carbon flux were created using NDVI in combination with environmental measurements as predictors. This facilitated an evaluation, at two scales, of the drivers of CO2 exchange in these communities â both spatially and temporally. Static chamber measurements (bi-weekly) were unsuccessful in modelling CO2 exchange, but autochamber measurements (half-hourly) provided reasonable predictions. I suggest, though, that linear multivariate-regression models are insufficient for capturing variation in these systems, and that more complex models may provide greater success in the future.</description>

   <description>Within the surveying community, more specifically in underground mining, the challenge for surveying and mapping is  affordable, fast and accurate positioning that works well within constraints of  underground mining environments. Current surveying methodology for underground environments has not changed much in the last half century. This thesis proposes use of new tools and procedures employed by the robotics community to provide opportunity to improve upon some methods of underground surveying and mapping.&#xd;
&#xd;
Underground mining environments comprised of ramps, shafts and tunnel type corridors  link areas of mineral extraction to the surface environment. Since these environments are GPS-deprived, automatic positioning in a global context providing centimetre level positioning and single-digit, degree orientation is challenging, especially to mark the start and end of  mobile mapping traverses.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Current mobile  mapping strategies use 2D and 3D laser scanners in conjunction with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques to map and model underground environments from point cloud data. These strategies currently operate mostly within local reference frameworks that can later be transformed to a global mine geodetic reference framework. They utilize beacon technology such as RFID tags, barcodes and other methods that include using natural features as beacons, providing positioning results outside the positioning accuracies required for surveying and mapping, in the mine surveying context.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis studies and makes contributions in several areas. First it compares and contrasts between conventional surveying and mapping, and mobile mapping. Second, it applies tools and techniques from mobile robotics to bear on problems and tasks in conventional surveying.  It importantly focuses on fast, accurate and reliable registration of a mobile mapping tool to a global geodetic reference system, with minimal human input, whilst generating rigorously adjusted position estimates with associated uncertainties. Third, it demonstrates through experiments, strengths, weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages of the automated underground positioning method. Last, it highlights potential applications beyond surveying and mapping where this positioning method may be applicable. Within this list of contributions is the design, construction, calibration  and testing of  an equivalent mine reference system that uses geometric reference beacon technology to facilitate mobile positioning and mapping.</description>

   <description>Transition zones between vegetation types have been highlighted as areas of high biodiversity and are longstanding focal areas of research. There is increasing evidence to suggest these areas might be uniquely affected by climate change. These transitions can span a variety of scales and can vary in spatial pattern and steepness of gradient. This study focuses on the patterns of distribution and the factors limiting growth of tree species in the eastern deciduous-boreal forest transition zone (DBT) of eastern North America, with focus on species at their range-edge. Data from vegetation inventory plots from the Kawartha Highlands (KH) and Frontenac Arch (FA), both located in eastern Ontario, were analysed using multivariate statistics (ordination and cluster analyses) and spatial analysis (GIS). My findings indicate the DBT is a region of high species mixing at the plot-scale and study area-scales, with no strong evidence for recurring species associations or spatial aggregation of associations in either study area. Only at a regional scale, when comparing and contrasting the two study areas does evidence for differentiation emerge. Boreal species carried higher importance values (a combined measure of abundance and basal area) on the northern half of the KH study area, but were found to be of lower importance throughout both study areas. Range-edge eastern deciduous forest (EDF) species appear to have a much more abrupt range-edge with a abrupt decline in the number of species surveyed on the KH compared to the FA, and two of the only three range-edge EDF species found in the KH were limited to the southern half of the area. Soil composition and depth and presence of the Canadian Shield appear to play a role in this abrupt changeover. Tree ring analysis of three eastern deciduous species at their northern most limits on the Frontenac Arch (Quercus alba, Carya cordiformis, and Carya ovata,) showed that the poorest growth occurred during hot, dry growing seasons. This relationship is likely due to the thin soils characteristic of the FA.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2016-02-14 18:16:23.159</description>
   <description>The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction is broadly defined as a palladium or nickel catalyzed C-C bond forming reaction occurring between a halide or pseudo-halide electrophile and an organoboron nucleophile.  The extreme importance and power of the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction was recognized in 2010 when its discoverer and prolific developer, Professor Akira Suzuki, was awarded one-third of the Nobel Prize âfor palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings in organic synthesisâ.  This decision was widely applauded by the scientific community, both in industry and academia, which had long recognized the value and impact of this discovery.&#xd;
Despite its discovery in 1979 the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction has, until recently, remained confined to the realm of assembling âflatâ molecules.  It is extremely efficient and reliable in its construction of Csp2- Csp2 bonds namely in the synthesis of stereodefined polyenes, vinylarenes, and biaryl motifs, but much less so when a Csp3 partner is involved.  The poor performance of Csp3 coupling partners is particularly acute in secondary aliphatic compounds; these are the compounds required to engage in cross-coupling to synthesize stereodefined C-C bonds.&#xd;
However, since the turn of the century, solutions have begun to emerge to this persistent problem.  The Crudden group contributed significantly to leading this charge when, in 2009, the first report of an enantiospecific cross-coupling of secondary benzylic pinacol boronates was published.  This helped to ignite a renewed interest in developing an asymmetric variant for this Nobel Prize winning reaction.&#xd;
Described herein is the application of this innovative achievement to the successful development of an intriguing methodology.  We have successfully exploited the difference in reactivity of B-Csp2 and B-Csp3 bonds towards an iterative cross-coupling strategy that is devoid of protecting groups.  Furthermore, where stereodefined B-C bonds are subjected to the reaction, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is good to excellent.  The applicability of this methodology to a known active pharmaceutical ingredient was also achieved.</description>

   <title>Seasonal Controls on Litter and Soil Carbon and Nutrient Cycling in Arctic Tundra Ecosystems and Potential Impacts of Climate Change</title>

   <description>Climate change is leading to warmer temperatures and greater snowfall in Arctic regions. Microbial decomposition activities are strongly regulated by temperature, and therefore climate warming is projected to enhance decay of the vast tundra soil organic matter pool, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere and nutrients into the soil solution. By contrast, increased soil nutrient availability promotes plant growth and changes in vegetation, both of which may enhance plant uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. Consequently, depending on the net balance between these increases in CO2 release and uptake, tundra ecosystems may end up contributing globally significant feedbacks to a changing climate, further exacerbating environmental change. In this thesis, I modelled the effects of changes in seasonal climate on litter decay rates and ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient pools in a variety of tundra vegetation-types. Specifically, I investigated how short- (one year) and longer-term (up to 9 years) experimentally-deepened winter snow and summer warming impact microbial communities and biogeochemical dynamics using experimental plots located in distinct ecosystems across the Canadian, Greenlandic, and Norwegian Arctic. Summer warming reduced surface litter decomposition in both relatively dry and wet ecosystems, likely because of evaporation-induced desiccation. In contrast, deepened snow had negligible effects on litter decay rates. However, tall birch shrub vegetation significantly stimulated litter decomposition, presumably due to a positive feedback from their greater litter inputs, enhancing soil nutrient pools and thereby microbial decomposition activities. Regarding plant and soil dynamics, the longer-term impacts of deepened snow included enhanced evergreen shrub growth and dominance over deciduous shrubs, but this increase in ecosystem C storage was dwarfed by 60 times greater soil C loss from the subsoil mineral layer. Soil bacterial community structure was much more strongly influenced by depth variation in edaphic properties down the thawing soil profile than by seasonal change from winter to autumn. However, despite greater diversity with depth, the seasonal thaw significantly affected community structure and biomass similarly throughout the soil profile. Altogether, this research suggests that summer warming may slow surface litter decomposition, but that deepened snow may result in substantial soil C losses that greatly exceed plant C uptake.</description>

   <description>By combining the joy of movement with digital games, exergames can encourage people to exercise. Unfortunately, current exergames may not inspire exertion levels that meet the exercise guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine, and may not encourage long-term participation. In this thesis, we present a novel exergame mechanic, Heart Rate Power-ups that can be used to increase player exertion in exergames. Heart Rate Power-ups provide a benefit in the game when players reach a target exertion level.&#xd;
We performed a user study to evaluate the efficacy of Heart Rate Power-ups at increasing playersâ exertion and to assess their impact on player experience. This study compared player exertion and enjoyment of three games with and without the presence of Heart Rate Power-ups. We found that player exertion increased for two of the three games and that players responded positively to the addition of Heart Rate Power-ups. Our experience allowed us to provide design principles and applicability guidelines for the implementation of Heart Rate Power-ups.&#xd;
Converting popular off-the-shelf games into exergames allows developers to provide content with less effort than creating games from scratch. Continually providing new content may renew player interest and positively influence playersâ long-term commitment to exergames. We converted two popular games, Valve Corporationâs Half-Life 2 and Bethesda Game Studiosâ Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, into cycling based exergames with Heart Rate Power-ups. The conversion was achieved via modding interfaces provided by the gamesâ publishers. We performed a user study on the converted games comparing the traditional games with a straight cycling version and a cycling version with Heart Rate Power-ups present. The results confirmed our hypothesis that a straight cycling conversion would generate low exertion levels and using an off-the-shelf games modding interface to implement Heart Rate Power-ups improved exertion levels.&#xd;
This thesis highlights the importance of designing exergames with exertion in mind and provides insight into a technique for those wishing to do so.</description>

   <description>Landslide-generated impulse waves are a risk to coastal areas near possible sources of large and rapid landslides. A better understanding of the generation of these waves is important for the prediction of the size of these waves. High quality experimental data of a range of different landslide parameters is essential for the development of empirical relationships between landslide and the resulting wave. The existing established relationships are based on physical models that feature pneumatically accelerated slide masses, either using solid blocks or granular material. These tests have short and dense landslides which may not represent all the landslide types. The present study adds to the existing data set using a large scale flume and high speed cameras, which can model very large, gravity accelerated landslides. These types of landslides may be more representative of certain types of large, rapid landslides. A total of twenty-two tests were performed in the large scale flume with eight different water depths. The landslide volume was constant between all tests, while the water depth varied, to change the relative size and velocity of the landslide compared to the water body. The effect of the landslide mass, length, and volume fraction were more pronounced than has been observed in previous studies featuring smaller and denser landslide types. The relative landslide parameters are compared to the maximum wave amplitudes and observed wave types. Although three different wave types were generated in the near-field to the impact site, these waves were observed to transition into solitary waves. The speed and shape of the waves closely matched solitary wave theory in the far-field. The run-up of the waves on a smooth impermeable slope closely matched predictions for run-up of solitary waves. The observed maximum wave amplitudes are also compared to existing empirical wave generation equations. An effective mass reduction factor is introduced to account for the large size and long length of the slides tested. Long, gravity accelerated granular landslides were found to behave significantly different during the wave generation phase than experiments conducted using both solid block landslides and granular block landslides reported in the literature.</description>

   <description>Diffusion of three contaminants of emerging concern: (1) polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), (2) multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and (3) bisphenol A (BPA) through high density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane (GMB) were investigated. Partitioning and diffusion coefficients, Sgf and Dg, and/or the permeation coefficient, Pg, were estimated depending on the contaminant behaviour. Laboratory experiments were performed at room temperature and a semi-analytical model was used to estimate the permeation parameters. Diffusion of BPA through a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) was also examined. The experimentally inferred coefficients were used to examine the transport of these contaminants through a typical composite liner of a hypothetical landfill.&#xd;
Due to specific characteristics of PBDE with respect to HDPE, the conventional method for obtaining partitioning and diffusion coefficients did not work and a new method was developed to obtain these parameters. The PBDE partitioning coefficient (Sgf ~ 1.8Ã106) was four orders of magnitude higher and the diffusion coefficient was two orders of magnitude lower (Dg ~ 3.7Ã10-15 m2/s) than partitioning and diffusion coefficients of contaminants such as benzene and toluene usually considered in landfill design. &#xd;
Diffusion experiments performed on MWCNTs dispersed in an aqueous media have been running for about two years with no measurable partitioning of MWCNTs to the GMB or diffusion through the GMB. An upper bound permeation coefficient of MWCNTs through GMB (Pg ~ 5.6Ã10-15 m2/s) was estimated using the detection limit of MWCNTs in the receptor. &#xd;
BPA diffusion through HDPE GMB was investigated by using both BPA alone and in a mixture of phenolic compounds. The two experiments with different HDPE GMBs gave similar results with no measurable partitioning to the HDPE in four years of testing. Based on the diffusion tests, an upper bound permeation coefficient of BPA for an HDPE GMB (Pg ~ 2.9Ã10-15 m2/s) was estimated using the detection limit of BPA in the receptor. The permeation parameters of other phenolic compounds were also estimated and the partitioning coefficients ranged from 0.61 for 2-methylphenol (2-MP) to 31 for 2,3,4,6-Tetrachlorophenol and the diffusion coefficients ranged from 9.3Ã10-15 m2/s for pentachlorophenol (PCP) to 9.3Ã10-14 m2/s for 2-methylphenol (2-MP).  The experimentally inferred BPA distribution and diffusion coefficients for a GCL at low stress (DGCL ~ 1.5Ã10-10 m2/s, Kd ~ 10-16 mL/g) are similar to reported values for other organic compounds in the literature.&#xd;
The GMB partitioning/diffusion/permeation coefficients of all three contaminants (PBDE, MWCNTs, and BPA) are all such that an HDPE GMB can be expected to be an excellent diffusive barrier for them in a municipal solid waste landfill. Modelling indicated that the impact for these contaminants of emerging concern will be controlled by holes on the geomembrane associated with wrinkles.</description>

   <description>Water management and treatment at closed mine sites have become primary concerns for mining companies due to their costly nature, potential commitment of decades of water treatment, and impact on the environment. The long-term objective of this research investigates methods of extracting metals from acid mine waste in order to minimize the environmental impact of the drainage and decrease the financial burden on mining companies. However, understanding the mechanism of element mobility in mine waste requires a comprehensive assessment of the composition of the water and co-existing minerals at studied mines El Indio, Lagunas Norte and Pierina, which is the primary goal of this thesis. No study has previously provided a detailed analysis of the secondary precipitates at these mines or their role in storing trace elements.&#xd;
Water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled mass spectrometry and inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry. Coexisting mineral samples were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and synchrotron-based microanalysis. The pH of waters is acidic with values of 2.24 to 4.5. Major elements in waters include Ca, Al, Fe and SO4; minor elements include Cu, Mg, Mn, Zn, K, Na and trace elements consisted of As, Co, Ni, Sr, Pb and Cd. This study has identified previously unreported phases that may be placed into 3 broad groups: 1) hydrous Na-, Mg-, Ca, Cu- and other metal-sulfates such as blodite group minerals, hexahydrite and gypsum 2) Fe-oxides, oxyhydroxides and oxyhydroxysulfates such as ferrihydrite, goethite, scorodite and jarosite 3) other metal-rich, poorly crystalline Al phases. Synchrotron microanalysis has shown that these minerals sequester Cu, Mn, Zn, Cd, As, Ni and other trace elements.&#xd;
This research has improved the understanding of the mobility of elements by identifying the trace elements associated with minerals and by characterizing the relationship between chemistry of precipitates and solution. The occurrence of secondary precipitates stands as evidence purporting that sulfide oxidation at these mine sites is ongoing. Barrick Gold Corporation can consider capturing the sulfate-rich secondary precipitates by mechanically enhanced pond-evaporation and precipitation of efflorescent salts, methods which may allow to efficiently capture elements of interest.</description>

   <description>This dissertation refocuses attention from a âclash of culturesâ to a âclash of environmental economiesâ within the eastern regions of the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire, particularly the province of Diyarbekir. An account of changing patterns of climate provides an alternative vantage point on the origins of inter-social relationships within this region. In the aftermath of intermittent climate-induced environmental crises, peasants and pastoralists confronted different challenges. Overall, crop-based economies could recover more quickly than herding-based economies. Given enough water and seed, and normal weather conditions, farmers could replant and expect good harvests the following season. However, pastoralists, who either lost or sold most of their animals as a result of lack of food and water needed many seasons of abundant grass and water to rebuild their herds to their former size. Examining episodes of severe climate in the Ottoman east in the 1840s and 1880s, this study presents evidence that the different timetables for recovery following episodes of environmental crisis were consequential for understanding changing relationships between people, land, and animals as well as relations between communities.</description>

   <description>3D printers are becoming an ever-cheaper way to prototype or reproduce objects. There are difficulties that arise when attempting to reproduce very large objects with a 3D printer. Printers have a limited volume that they can print, or struggle to plan their process for very large 3D models. A solution to this problem is to segment the larger mesh into smaller parts that can be printed separately, then reassembled. In this thesis we describe various approaches to mesh segmentation and present an approach that efficiently segments very large 3D models so that they can be printed. Finally we show the results of our approach on 4 objects of increasing size and complexity.</description>

   <description>Cloud computing provides on-demand resources and removes the boundaries of resources' physical locations. It allows vendors to save upfront infrastructure costs and focus on features that discriminate their&#xd;
businesses. Growing number of provided services makes manual selection of the most suitable service time consuming and very hard which requires expertise. The large number of features and properties that the services are characterized by makes automatic service selection challenging.&#xd;
In this thesis we present QuARAM Service Recommender, a self-adaptive Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) service selection system that recommends a list of suitable services for cloud application deployment based on an application's requirements and the customer's preferences. The process starts with automatic extraction of an application's features, requirements and preferences and ends with a list of  potential services for the application deployment. TOSCA provides a standard way of specifying the cloud application. Defined Normative Types in TOSCA do not cover defining all the requirements, features, and customer's preferences. In this thesis we propose an extension to the TOSCA Normative Types, so our system can extract all the information required for service selection automatically from the specification of the application. &#xd;
We use case-based reasoning to provide a  recommendation of suitable services for application deployment. This method can be beneficial for cloud customers in service selection even when lacking complete knowledge about their application or features offered by cloud services. It can efficiently handle heterogeneous attributes that characterize cloud services and the requirements of cloud applications and&#xd;
is able to integrate the customer's preferences through assigning weights to these attributes. The feedback from both customers and the monitoring system is used to automatically adapt the system behavior and enhance the quality of recommendations. We use MCDM method for cloud service selection when there are not sufficient cases in the system case base and we use clustering to handle the problem of a large search space. We further describe a service consolidation method to improve the resource utilization and reduce the total service price.  Our step-by-step case study demonstrates that an automatic IaaS service selection using a combination of all the proposed approaches is practical and achievable.</description>

   <description>In this work, melt-state peroxide mediated crosslinking of butyl rubber (IIR) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) was used to determine additive effects, as well as the effect of higher isoprene content on the extent of crosslinking. Grafting of vinyltriethoxysilane (VTEOS) to polymer and hydrocarbon substrate was used to determine the effects of unsaturation and additives on radical intermediates. &#xd;
&#xd;
Grafting of VTEOS to butyl rubber (melt-state) was sensitive to isoprene content. Higher isoprene improved the rate of combination relative to chain scission because of resonance stabilization of allylic macroradical intermediates. Graft yields for IIR were lower than those of poly(isobutylene) homopolymer, because unsaturation dramatically increased the relative rate of degradative chain transfer. &#xd;
&#xd;
Higher reactivity of high isoprene rubber was employed to graft acrylated radical traps that combine with polymer macroradicals and subsequently oligomerize. This occurred in appreciable quantities, giving a modest crosslinked network that was less prone to stress relaxation, compared to poly(isobutylene). &#xd;
&#xd;
The effects of several antioxidants on peroxide crosslinking of LLDPE and grafting of VTEOS to cyclohexane were assessed. All but the hindered amine 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMPH) were found to affect peroxide cures and graft addition. TEMPH survived grafting reactions, as well as DCP-only crosslinking reactions in cyclohexane in the absence of oxygen, while 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine (TEMPMe) did not. &#xd;
&#xd;
High molecular weight hindered amine suppressed oxidative degradation in LLDPE films for 16 days, quantitatively as well as BHT (industry standard). Thus, hindered amine 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMPH) was selected as an ideal latent antioxidant, and this was explained by the requirement of oxidative activation to form a reactive nitroxyl for radical scavenging. Activation mechanisms were reviewed, the most likely being the formation of a tetramethylpiperinyl radical intermediate before oxidation to generate nitroxyl.</description>

   <description>An understanding of the conventional nature of language entails a recognition that word meanings are shared widely within a group, but due to the arbitrary nature, vary across different groups and are limited to those individuals who use them. Within a linguistic group, many words are shared by all speakers; however, some word meanings are shared by a subset of speakers.. For example, in the U.K. trucks and elevators are referred to by different names. No work has examined whether children understand that word meanings are shared narrowly within their own linguistic group. To better understand childrenâs appreciation of the restricted scope of word meanings, and thus their conventional understanding of language, I examined whether children assumed that familiar and newly acquired labels would be shared by an English speaker who uses non-local conventions. Moreover, I asked whether a speakerâs accent might affect childrenâs judgment of oneâs conventional knowledge. A native accented experimenter trained children on two novel object labels. Children were then familiarized to a video of a speaker with either a native or non-native accent who spoke English but labeled familiar objects with either conventional or novel labels. Children then participated in a disambiguation task, in which they were presented with an object, which they had a previous label for, and an unnamed object. On certain test trials, the object pair was a familiar and a novel object, and on other trials, it was the training object pairs from earlier on. I found that when the speaker previously used non-local conventions, children did not assume that the speaker would have knowledge of the conventional names of the objects during test. In contrast, when the speaker previously used local conventional labels, children assumed that the speaker would have knowledge of the familiar objects during test. These findings suggest that children may recognize that word meanings can be shared narrowly within their own linguistic group, which provides evidence that children may understand that word meanings are arbitrary agreements shared by specific group. This finding supports the possibility that childrenâs understanding of language is consistent with the principles of conventionality.</description>

   <description>The natural and built environments of schools have a profound impact on our understanding of the world and our place within it. Their role in shaping how we feel, think, and act, however, is often underestimated. As a result, static design solutions continue to dominate the educational landscape. Knowledge regarding the ways in which we inhabit educational design informs the dynamic potential of school architecture as pedagogy.&#xd;
&#xd;
The broad purpose of this study was to explore the lived experience of educational design. Research questions included: (a) What can be learned from the experiences of architects and principals involved in the design of two exemplary public schools?, (b) How do students and teachers experience the design of these educational environments?, and (c) How can their experiences inform educational design? A qualitative, phenomenological, case study methodology was chosen to investigate educational design from the perspectives of 29 students, 10 teachers, 2 principals, and 3 architects at two comprehensive schools (Grades 1â9) in Helsinki, Finland. Students and teachers took over 1600 photographs and selected 400 for discussion at photo-elicitation interviews. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with principals and architects. Analysis identified the theme at the heart of the data as a lack of congruency between the intended purpose(s) and usersâ experiences of the design of their schools. This insight led to the development of the Educational Design Intentions (EDI) Model, which explores tensions within participant-identified design intentions and their implications for educational design.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study identified: (a) key insights regarding participantsâ experiences of inhabiting their schools, (b) the need for post-occupancy evaluations, especially from an educational and humanistic perspective, and (c) how educators and architects can more fully inhabit a shared vision of educational design. Knowledge regarding the interplay between educational stakeholders and the design and use of their schools has the potential to facilitate change at participant schools, increase knowledge in the field, diversify school design, and focus future research.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-02-19 11:08:58.182</description>
   <description>Large-eddy simulations of round forced impinging jets at laboratory scale are performed, as a simplified model of the helicopter rotor wake; the goals were to understand the dynamics of the vortices, and to help develop engineering correlation and models. First, I studied the flow over smooth surfaces, then the Reynolds number effects and the performance of lower-level models in this flow were explored. Finally, I investigated surface roughness effects. &#xd;
&#xd;
The interaction between the vortices and the wall resulted in the formation of secondary vorticity that was lifted up and rolled around the primary vortex. These large-scale vortices play an important role in &#xd;
determining the flow. The dynamics of the vortex evolution are initially dominated by an inviscid mechanism. As the interaction with the wall begins, however, the contribution of turbulent diffusion to the vorticity transport (TVD) becomes the leading term weakening the primary vortex. This phenomenon is extremely robust, leading to similar vortex decay rates regardless of the level of turbulence in the jet and the nature of the near-wall flow. The mean-flow three-dimensionality due to a short-wavelength azimuthal instability also plays a role in the evolution of the vortices. &#xd;
&#xd;
Surface roughness significantly modified the near-wall flow, including displacement of the velocity profile, increase of wall stress, and amplification of turbulence levels. The near-wall flow changes due to the roughness are advected to the outer layer during the separation of the secondary vorticity, rather than being confined in the vicinity of the roughness elements. The robust TVD mechanism, however, prevent the vortices from being strongly affected by these changes. &#xd;
&#xd;
This flow is particularly challenging for turbulence models. The tested RANS models exhibited poor performance. The error sources were first identified as their incapability in predicting both the shear-layer instability, and the local unsteady separation. Secondly, the well-known shortcomings of the eddy-viscosity assumption in wall jets were amplified here by the counter-gradient transport during the vortex evolution. Finally, since the TVD term depends on the second derivative of the shear stress, the RANS model errors were naturally amplified. The WMLES predicted vortex decay in good agreement with the resolved LES data.</description>

   <description>This thesis is focused on the water uptake and swelling properties of sub-micron thin ion conducting polymer (ionomer) films. One motivation for this work stems from the need to resolve the discrepancy between high water uptake and low proton conductivity properties observed in NafionÂ® thin films on SiO2 substrate. In addition, the effects of film thickness, substrate, ionomer equivalent weight (EW), and annealing on the intrinsic properties of ionomer thin films were studied. Ionomer thin films were characterized using the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and ellipsometry for their density, &#xd;
refractive index (RI), water uptake and swelling properties.  &#xd;
Water uptake studies showed that the effect of substrate on water uptake of NafionÂ® thin films were not as strong as expected. Meanwhile, a thickness-dependent water uptake was observed for NafionÂ® &#xd;
thin films. Similar trends were observed for the two low EW ionomers suggesting similar nano-structure in the thin film form. Interestingly, comparison of water uptake showed that low EW ionomers adsorb comparable or less water than Nafion in the thin film form.                       A combined QCM and ellipsometer setup was employed for the first time to simultaneously measure the water uptake and swelling, respectively as a function of humidity. All thin films appear to be affected by confinement effect as evident by the swelling dimension and volume of mixing. Thermally annealed (160 oC) NafionÂ® thin films experienced a significant decrease in water uptake and swelling properties.</description>

   <description>This project is a culmination of research for an Indigenous community known as Christian Island or Beausoleil First Nation (BFN).  Beausoleil First Nation initiated the project in response to concerns over post-secondary withdrawal rates.  Despite the injection of new, additional funds into the post-secondary sponsorship program, there remains retention issues, which were attributed by the leadership to deficiencies in life skills.  Therefore, funding was set aside to investigate approaches and provide recommendations to the community for a transition program that would increase the post-secondary retention rates.&#xd;
An educational technical term aligning to life skills referred to as self-regulation was used as the research term throughout this project.   Self-regulation is seen as a viable approach, since the focus is on increasing skill-building in the area of planning, focusing attention, adaptability, cognitive ability, and communication while decreasing emotional stress, impulsivity, and isolation.  The attributes of self-regulation and transition were studied and divided into quadrants using the medicine wheel as a holistic design framework for BFN.&#xd;
A series of workshops aimed at self-regulation (goal-oriented planning, communication, emotional regulation, increasing cognitive ability, etc.) is recommended as the first phase in a process to achieve student success for the short-term.  A long-term strategy is desired that would fully impact all levels of education at BFN and is presented as a framework to advance long-term planning and sustainability.   This transition model is developed from a literature review and the authorâs knowledge to provide future direction for a complete (holistic) framework.</description>

   <description>The control and regulation of all major intestinal functions are coordinated by neurons within the enteric nervous system (ENS).  While intestinal inflammation initially causes a profound loss of enteric neurons, the ENS demonstrates remarkable changes in neuronal structure and function to retain control of gastrointestinal functions.  Expression of the neurotrophin glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been implicated in promoting postnatal regenerative processes in the ENS. It has been proposed that intestinal smooth muscle cells (ISMC) express GDNF as a precursor molecule that requires proteolytic processing to achieve the mature form (15 kDa). The expression of mature GDNF is increased during intestinal inflammation, however, little is known about how inflammatory conditions affect the synthesis, processing, and biological activity of GDNF.&#xd;
	Analysis of a neonatal rat co-culture model confirmed that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± caused a 2-fold increase in both the expression of 15 kDa GDNF and in the axonal outgrowth of myenteric neurons, compared to control.  Evaluation of broad-spectrum protease inhibitors or inhibitors of metalloproteinases (MMP) showed that only inhibition of MMP-9 specifically blocked TNFÎ±-induced axonal proliferation.  The inhibition of MMP-9 in co-cultures also blocked the increase in 15 kDa GDNF expression, while the overall expression of GDNF was not affected. Assessment of MMP-9 expression in ISMC showed that TNF-Î± caused a greater than 2-fold increase in intracellular expression, compared to control.  Significantly, the addition of exogenous 15 kDa GDNF rescued axonal proliferation during MMP-9 inhibition, while transfection with full-length GDNF did not. Finally, a neuron survival bioassay showed that 15 kDa GDNF in conditioned media from a GDNF-expression system doubled enteric neuron survival over serum-free control, while addition of the MMP-9 inhibitor blocked the increase in survival.  These findings suggest that both the expression and subsequent intracellular processing of GDNF in the intestine are influenced by inflammatory factors, through the induction of MMP-9 activity.  Furthermore, this evidence indicates that GDNF processing to the mature form is required for GDNF-mediated neurotrophic outcomes in the co-culture model.</description>

   <description>Zirconium alloys, due to their good corrosion resistance and low neutron absorption&#xd;
cross section, are widely used in heavy and light water nuclear reactors. Irradiation&#xd;
induced defects and deformation lead to mechanical property degradation and potentially lead to accidents. In this study, molecular dynamics method, as a powerful&#xd;
atomic-level simulation tool, is applied to investigate and characterize the formation&#xd;
and evolution of point defects in irradiated alpha-zirconium by using a recent updated many-body interatomic potential. The effects of strain field on point defects,&#xd;
the formation of dislocation loops and the effects of niobium in zirconium-niobium&#xd;
system have been also explored. This dissertation has focused on understanding the&#xd;
atomic-level mechanism of irradiation damages and defect formation in zirconium.&#xd;
&#xd;
After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 is the literature review including topics of displacement cascade, irradiation induced deformation, importance of&#xd;
zirconium in nuclear reactors and possible simulation methods. Chapter 3 reports&#xd;
a comparison of previous potential and current potential in a displacement cascade&#xd;
simulation in alpha zirconium. In Chapter 4, the shape of irradiation cascades in alpha zirconium has been studied, and the threshold displacement energy in zirconium&#xd;
has been calculated. Chapter 5 studies the strain effects (up to 1%) on defects in&#xd;
zirconium. Chapter 6 extends the work in Chapter 5 with tensile strain up to 5%; a&#xd;
void has been found in the displacement cascades in alpha zirconium under the applied strain field. In Chapter 7, simulations have been conducted to study the effects&#xd;
of irradiation cascades in alpha zirconium within one vacancy type &lt; a > loop. In&#xd;
Chapter 8, other than most work in literature focused on alpha phase in zirconium alloy (hexagonal close-packed crystal structure), we have considered irradiation effects&#xd;
on beta phase (body centered cubic structure) using MD calculations. The impact of&#xd;
niobium in zirconium-niobium system is also studied. Chapter 9 contains a summary&#xd;
of present thesis and possible future work. Appendixes in the end contain the basic&#xd;
description of parallel programming, various methods of defect analysis, some related&#xd;
input files and programs.</description>

   <description>This thesis tries to fill some of the missing gaps in the study of zirconium hydrides with state-of-art experiments, cutting edge tomographical technique, and a novel numerical algorithm. A new hydriding procedure is proposed. The new anode material and solution combination overcomes many drawbacks of the AECL hydriding method and leads to superior hydriding result compared to the AECL hydriding procedure. The DHC crack growth velocity of as-received Excel alloy and Zr-2.5Nb alloy together with several different heat treated Excel alloy samples are measured. While it already known that the DHC crack growth velocity increases with the increase of base metal strength, the finding that the transverse plane is the weaker plane for fatigue crack growth despite having higher resistance to DHC crack growth was unexpected. The morphologies of hydrides in a coarse grained Zircally-2 sample have been studied using synchrotron x-rayâs at ESRF with a new technique called Diffraction Contrast Tomography that uses simultaneous collection of tomographic data and diffraction data to determine the crystallographic orientation of crystallites (grains) in 3D. It has been previously limited to light metals such as Al or Mg (due to the use of low energy x-rays). Here we show the first DCT measurements using high energy x-rays (60 keV), allowing measurements in zirconium. A new algorithm of a computationally efficient way to characterize distributions of hydrides - in particular their orientation and/or connectivity - has been proposed. It is a modification of the standard Hough transform, which is an extension of the Hough transform widely used in the line detection of EBSD patterns Finally, a basic model of hydrogen migration is built using ABAQUS, which is a mature finite element package with tested modeling modules of a variety of physical laws. The coupling of hydrogen diffusion, lattice expansion, matrix deformation and phase transformation is investigated under striation crack growth conditions. The result is a progress in applying diffusion of H and crack propagation within a commercial finite element package.</description>

   <description>The High Arctic is especially sensitive to climatic change, but typically direct long-term monitoring data are lacking.  Instead, paleolimnological approaches are now widely used to reconstruct past environmental changes. In particular, sub-fossil diatoms are well-established paleo-indicators of past limnological conditions.  My thesis research is focused on Cape Herschel, east-central Ellesmere Island, as the numerous ponds in this region are well-studied and encompass a spectrum of morphometry, microclimate, and vegetation.  This thesis has two separate but related chapters. The first chapter documents recent limnological changes and associated epilithic and surface sediment diatom assemblages from five well-studied Cape Herschel ponds, sampled on a semi-regular basis from 1987-2011. Diatom trends were reconstructed and compared to a suite of water-chemistry variables. Increased species diversity in both epilithic and surface sediments were observed, indicative of warming and associated longer ice-free growing seasons, allowing for the establishment of taxa with more complex lifestyles. These ponds also experienced increases in conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and pH over the sampling period. Trends in diatom assemblage were more pronounced in epilithic samples (representing year-to year changes), when compared to surface sediments (an integration of multiple years of diatom production). Diatom assemblages from the Cape Herschel ponds were then compared to previously studied and near-by (~10 km away) Pim Island ponds. The latter ponds had a more muted response to recent climate warming, likely due to their colder microclimates linked to their close proximity to near-shore sea ice. The second chapter focused on diatom assemblages from sediment cores recovered from two Pim Island ponds. Diatom assemblages in both sediment cores recorded a recent shift from low diversity benthic fragilarioids to more diverse assemblages dominated by epiphytic taxa, with more complex growth forms. This shift in taxa and diversity reflects a warming environment and longer growing season, but these long-term assemblage changes were more muted when compared to the warmer Cape Herschel ponds.  Taken together with previous studies, this research further demonstrates the sensitivity of diatoms to climatic changes.</description>

   <description>Recent environmental policies and higher needs of energy have led to the huge growth in renewable sources consumptions. Consuming renewable energies however, is not always free of challenges. Many studies have been done to have a reliable integration and localization of the distributed sources, which have evolved into microgrid concept. These studies are mainly focused on microgridâs occurrence prediction methods, control schemes and their undeniable part, grid synchronization techniques. The main goal of the studies is to help the microgrid and their distributed sources to ride through the short disturbances in grid-connected and islanded modes. Disturbances and unplanned changes that occur to a microgrid result in voltage and frequency fluctuations. These fluctuations could have destructive effects on power equipments. Therefore the existence of a robust and reliable controller and synchronizer is a must in microgrids. &#xd;
In this thesis, the focus is on synchronization techniques and control systems. Among different synchronization techniques including PLL-based methods and frequency adaptive methods, the Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) is selected to be studied in more details. A controller design consisting of an ANF is then proposed to fixate the voltage and frequency of the system while islanded and to ensure the power generation sufficiency. Another important and critical task of the proposed controller is to prepare the islanded microgrid for transitioning to the grid-connected mode. The Fast and accurate synchronization technique is selected and a fast responding control system is proposed to achieve a smooth transition between the two modes. &#xd;
The ANF synchronization technique along with the proposed PLL-less control design are modeled in Simulink/MATLAB, which their performances in a system with disturbances and occurrences are evaluated. Balanced and unbalanced loads are added to the system and the connection between the microgrid and the grid is established. In this thesis the accuracy of the proposed control system in different conditions is examined and simulation results are presented. The results show that balanced three phase voltages at a fixed frequency are achieved, which also ensures a smooth transition between two modes.</description>

   <description>The eastern Canadian Arctic is home to Canadaâs largest Indigenous population, which depends on local freshwater sources for drinking water. However, small watersheds have rarely been analyzed for long-term hydrologic response to changing climate. This study aims to address this issue by examining the Apex River, a small watershed with a long hydroclimatic record, near Iqaluit, Nunavut. Particular emphasis was placed on the long-term changes in climate and river discharge, and the seasonal variability of water sources between two snapshots in time, 1983 and 2013. Long-term hydrological data were obtained from gauge station 10UH002, operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada, and long-term meteorological data were acquired from Environment Canadaâoperated stations near Iqaluit Airport. Breakpoint analysis suggested that long-term mean annual surface air temperatures have increased since 1994. In contrast, no long-term total precipitation or annual discharge changes were observed. However, river flow initiation and cessation analyses of the Apex River flow season indicates that flow extended into the autumn since the 2000s. The 2013 flow season lasted 44 days longer than the 1983 flow season. Systematic river sampling was undertaken throughout the 2013 thaw season to determine contributing proportions of event (snowmelt or rainfall) and pre-event (baseflow) water to river runoff. Results from the stable isotope hydrograph separation for 2013 were compared to findings for 1983. Snow was the main source of water to the river during the snowmelt period in 1983 and 2013, however baseflow was still an important contributor. Although there was high similarity of water sources early in the season in 1983 and 2013, the two years differed during the autumn. In 2013 there was a high rainfall runoff response that was not present in 1983, suggesting high release of late-season sub-surface water storage and an increased sensitivity to late-season rainfall events in 2013. This research provides insights into the hydrologic response of the Apex River to long-term climatic change, and highlights the need for high-quality precipitation and discharge data for effective long-term hydrological assessment.</description>

   <description>The use of geosynthetics to contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in composite liner systems is evaluated through laboratory and field experiments. Diffusive parameters for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and PCBs through geomembranes are evaluated. Diffusion of BTEX is also evaluated through vapour barriers, as well as diffusion of PCBs through a compacted clay liner (CCL) and a GCL. &#xd;
The permeation coefficient (Pg) for BTEX diffusion was lowest for high density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane, followed by chlorosulphonated polyethylene (CSPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), two ethylene interpolymer alloy (EIA) coated polyester products, four different PE based vapour barriers, and then polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In applications such as landfill covers or under-slab vapour barriers to mitigate VOC migration into buildings, these differences in Pg between products may have a significant effect on performance. &#xd;
PCBs were found to have very high partitioning coefficients to HDPE geomembranes (Sgf = 150,000) and low Dg (1.0 Ã 10-14 m2/s), suggesting geomembranes can act as a sink to capture and store contaminants and not just as a diffusive barrier. In a typical municipal solid waste landfill (MSW) with good construction quality assurance (CQA), PCBs are unlikely to give rise to environmental concern. However, if CQA allows significant leakage, the environmental impacts from PCBs would need to be carefully evaluated on a case by case basis by modelling. &#xd;
Containment using geosynthetics in remote Arctic environments for PCB contaminants is also evaluated. Geosynthetics are found to not have performance issues specific to climate, but instead with respect to subsurface angularity of soil, suggesting that normal design precautions should be maintained in polar environments. Evaluation of core samples exhumed from pond liners after nine years showed that with respect to PCBs, EIA geomembranes were similar to HDPE, with low Dg, and high Sgf. &#xd;
Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to examine the hydration of GCL liners used to contain hydrocarbon-contaminated soil in Antarctica. Results indicate that hydration is achievable in Antarctica, but is heavily dependent on subsoil grain size and hydrology.</description>

   <description>In response to the recent surge in activism surrounding the missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada, the state has attempted to address colonial gender violence through strategies that involve the ongoing support and implementation of antiviolence services. While antiviolence agencies provide crucial short-term assistance to women in crises, indigenous women and two-spirited people have long questioned the ways in which these institutions exacerbate colonial gender violence by relying upon and strengthening apparatuses of state violence such as prisons, police and child protective services. In response to this problem I ask how white feminists invested in confronting colonial gender violence might begin to reform antiviolence service provision to help make indigenous womenâs lives more liveable on both an individual and systemic scale. Answering this, I highlight the meaningful ways that indigenous women are addressing and alleviating violence through approaches that recognize the interconnectedness between all forms of violence indigenous people face. Contrasting these thoughtful and diverse approaches with those of mainstream antiviolence shelters exposes the colonial logics that continue to permeate white feminist antiviolence agencies. Speaking to white feminist women working within these institutions, I argue that white feminists working within the antiviolence sector must recognize their obligation to stand in solidarity with indigenous communities in their struggle against colonization. Providing ongoing support to indigenous struggles for decolonization provides a framework through which white feminists can begin to self-reflexively confront and undo their investments in whiteness, recognize and reform the aspects of service provision that uphold colonial logics, and support decolonization struggles that seek to eradicate all forms of violence against indigenous people.</description>

   <description>This thesis reports on a qualitative methodological study that explored six principalsâ descriptions of their perceptions, beliefs, and practices of professional development as implemented through a process of collaborative inquiry. Collaborative inquiry is commonly referred to within the educational literature, and is one form of professional development for educators. While plentiful, the literature presents ambiguous descriptions of professional development, resulting in a range of models being implemented with limited findings representing what does and does not work.&#xd;
Participants were purposefully recruited and selected through a first-come first-serve approach using the elementary principal listserv of the participating school board located in Eastern Ontario. Two groups of principals were selected to participate; two who worked at Ontario Focused Intervention Partnership (OFIP) schools, identified by the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) as having exceptional student learning needs, and four who worked at non-OFIP schools. Individual interviews and principalsâ professional development documents provided the data explored in this research study. The data analysis incorporated the following strategies: (a) unique case orientation; (b) inductive analysis; (c) voice, perspective, and reflexivity; and (d) context sensitivity. The emerging themes from this analysis were: (1) building teacher motivation; (2) supporting teacher learning toward improved and consistent practices; and (3) promoting accountability amongst principals in promotion of collaborative inquiry. These themes were then connected to relevant research and OME literature and mapped onto Guskeyâs (2000) evaluation of effective professional development framework. Recommendations for the future implementation of collaborative inquiry as a model of professional development included bringing a more balanced approach to equally emphasize applied teacher learning to coincide with the focus on teacher motivation. This thesis study voices the perceptions, beliefs, and experiences of principals currently using a collaborative inquiry model in the delivery of professional development. In doing so, this research may provide principals, school boards, and provincial stakeholders with authentic descriptions of what works and does not work in an effort to improve the delivery and application of professional development within schools and school boards.</description>

   <description>The purpose of is study is to explore the role of static media in textbooks, defined as printed images and text (Mayer, 2001), and how these media are viewed and used by high school science teachers. Since textbooks appeared in the late 1800s, pictorial aids have been used in them to support the teacherâs work in the classroom (Giordano, 2003). The research on textbooks prior to the 1970s doesnât present relevant work related to their curricular role, quality, or instructional design (Woodward, Elliott, and Nagel, 1988/2013). Since then there has been abundant research on the use of visual images in textbooks that has been approached from: (a) the text/image ratio (Evans, Watson, &amp; Willows, 1987; Levin &amp; Mayer, 1993; Mayer, 1993; Woodward, 1993), and (b) the instructional effectiveness of images (Woodward, 1993). The theoretical framework for this study comes from multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001), information design (Pettersson, 2002), and visual literacy (Moore &amp; Dwyer, 1994). Data was collected through in-depth interviews of three high school science teachers and the graphic analyses of three textbooks used by them. The interview data were compared through an analytic model developed from the literature, and the graphic analyses were performed using Mayerâs multimedia learning principles (Mayer, 2001) and the Graphic Analysis Protocol (GAP) (Slough &amp; McTigue, 2013). The conclusions of this study are: (1) pictures are specially useful for teaching science because science is a difficult subject to teach, (2) due this difficulty, pictures are very important to make the class dynamic and avoid students distraction, (3) static and dynamic media when used together can be more effective, (4) some specific type of graphics were found in the science textbooks used by the participants, in this case naturalistic drawings, stylized drawings, scale diagram, flow chart â cycle, flow chart â sequence, and hybrids, no photographs were found, (5) graphics can be related not only to the general text but specifically to the captions, (6) the textbooks analyzed had a balanced proportion of text and graphics, and (7) to facilitate the text-graphics relationship the spatial contiguity of both elements is key to their semantic integration.</description>

   <description>Anatomy education is challenged to develop contemporary approaches to teaching and learning that move beyond factual recall to elicit from students meaningful and deep understandings of the discipline. Inquiry-based learning is one such pedagogy that involves studentsâ active and increasingly independent investigation of questions and problems that are of interest to them. Because inquiry-based learning aims to encourage learners to draw upon wider contexts for learning and emphasizes the development of skills that extend beyond the confines of the classroom, there is a potential that studentsâ experiences are authentic in nature. This study sought to explore undergraduate studentsâ experiences of an Inquiry Project for learning anatomy. The projectâs aims were twofold. First, to document, describe, and explain the essence of studentsâ experiences of engagement throughout the Inquiry Project, and second, to explore studentsâ experiences as potentially reflective of authentic learning. A hermeneutic phenomenology and case study methodology was used to explore studentsâ experiences of an Inquiry Project within a second-year undergraduate anatomy course at a mid-sized university in Ontario, Canada. Students (18) and facilitators (3) were observed during group work sessions and inquiry presentations, curricular documents and studentsâ work were analyzed, and interviews were conducted. Data analysis sought to describe studentsâ experiences and as a result, common meaningful themes of groupsâ and studentsâ engagement were characterized. These results were then further analyzed through a theoretical framework of authentic learning, informed mainly by the Theory of Authentic Learning. While confirmatory and novel connections between factors were found to reflect Authentic Learning, five qualities of Authentic Inquiry Learning emerged from analysis of the data to represent how studentsâ learning was neither solely authentic nor inquiry-based, but a hybrid of the two. Authentic Inquiry Learning in anatomy education is characterized as the construction of knowledge through a process of disciplined inquiry in a way that gets students engaged in authentic scientific inquiry that draws upon their identities as a way of making sense of and applying anatomical understandings.</description>

   <description>The use of bio-based resins in composites for construction is emerging as a way to reduce of embodied energy produced by a structural system. In this study, two types of bio-based resins were explored: an epoxidized pine oil resin blend (EP) and a furfuryl alcohol resin (FA) derived from corn cobs and sugar cane. Nine large-scale reinforced concrete beams strengthened using externally bonded carbon and glass fibre reinforced bio-based polymer (CFRP and GFRP) sheets were tested. The EP resin resulted in a comparable bond strength to conventional epoxy (E) when used in wet layup, with a 7% higher strength for CFRP. The FA resin, on the other hand, resulted in a very weak bond, likely due to concrete alkalinity affecting curing. However, when FA resin was used to produce prefabricated cured CFRP plates which were then bonded to concrete using conventional epoxy paste, it showed an excellent bond strength. The beams achieved an increase in peak load ranging from 18-54% and a 9-46% increase in yielding load, depending on the number of FRP layers and type of fibres and resin.&#xd;
Additionally, 137 concrete prisms with a mid-span half-depth saw cut were used to test CFRP bond durability, and 195 CFRP coupons were used to examine tensile strength durability. Specimens were conditioned in a 3.5% saline solution at 23, 40 or 50oC, for up to 240 days. Reductions in bond strength did not exceed 15%. Bond failure of EP was adhesive with traces of cement paste on CFRP, whereas that of FA was cohesive with a thicker layer of concrete on CFRP, suggesting that the bond between FA and epoxy paste is excellent. EP tension coupons had similar strength and modulus to E resin, whereas FA coupons had a 9% lower strength and 14% higher modulus. After 240 days of exposure, maximum reductions in tensile strength were 8, 19 and 10% for EP, FA and E resins, respectively. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also performed to&#xd;
iii&#xd;
assess the significance of the reductions observed. High degrees of variability in the test results may have skewed the results from this statistical analysis.</description>

   <description>Inexpensive connectivity and computing power have caused the number of communicating devices to explode in the last decade. New applications are emerging every day to take advantage of the proximity and abundance of these devices. Device-to-Device (D2D) communication using cellular spectrum to increase spectral efficiency of the network is a technology component of Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A). In D2D communication underlaying cellular networks, devices communicate with each other using a direct link using cellular resources without going through the evolved Node B (eNB) but remaining under the control of it. D2D communication&#xd;
is expected to be one of the prominent features supported by future cellular networks because of reusing the cellular spectrum to increase the system performance of cellular networks. However, due to the limitations of a licensed spectrum when these devices share a cellular spectrum to communicate directly among themselves, the same resource may need to be shared among cellular and D2D communicating pairs. This resource sharing introduces a new interference scenario, which needs to be coordinated through a new resource allocation scheme.&#xd;
We investigate this problem of interference coordination and explore three different perspectives from which this problem can be viewed, namely a) interference minimization; b) fair allocation while minimizing interference; c) Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction while maximizing total system sum rate of the cellular network. We show that the proposed schemes are suitable for the short LTE scheduling period of 1 ms as they are computationally tractable. Our schemes can allocate radio resources to D2D pairs underlaying a cellular network in a short time, ensuring fairness in allocation while minimizing interference, and increasing the total system sum rate&#xd;
of the network while maintaining a QoS target.</description>

   <description>Electromagnetic (EM) tracking assistance for ultrasound-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy has recently been introduced in order to enable prompt and uncomplicated reconstruction of catheter paths with respect to the prostate gland. However, EM tracking within a clinical setting is notorious for fluctuating measurement performance. In fact, measurements are prone to errors due to field distortions caused by magnetic and conductive objects and can compromise the outcome of the procedure. Enhancing these measurements is therefore paramount.&#xd;
&#xd;
The objective of this thesis is to enable robust and accurate reconstructions of HDR catheter paths on the ultrasound images of the prostate gland using EM tracking. To achieve this objective, the measurement uncertainty of an electromagnetic system was first characterized in various environments; this characterization enabled us to identify optimum setup configurations and model the measurement uncertainty. Second, we designed and implemented a specialized filtering method for catheter path reconstructions, combining the nonholonomic motion constraints which apply to the EM sensor, with both the position and orientation measurements of the sensor. Finally, ultrasound scan planes were robustly tracked with the help of a simultaneous localization and calibration algorithm; this method allows for dynamic tracking of the ultrasound probe while simultaneously mapping and compensating for the EM field distortions.&#xd;
&#xd;
We experimentally validated the performance of our advanced filter for catheter path reconstructions in a HDR brachytherapy suite; the EM sensor was threaded within paths of various curvatures at several insertion speeds. The simultaneous ultrasound probe tracking and EM field distortion compensation approach was also assessed in the brachytherapy suite. The performances of our approaches were compared to conventional error minimization methods. The advanced methods effectively increased the EM tracking accuracy of catheter paths and ultrasound probes. With the help of our proposed approaches, EM tracking can provide effective assistance for a plurality of clinical applications.</description>

   <description>Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) has been shown to be an effective removal technique for a variety of trace contaminants in wastewater, especially for low molecular weight organic contaminants. In MEUF, contaminants first partition into surfactant micelles prior to removal by ultrafiltration, where the contaminants are below the molecular weight cut-off of the ultrafiltration membrane but the micelles are above the cut-off. To predict the removal efficiency of MEUF, it is important to measure of extent to which a species will bind to a micelle as well as to develop an understanding of the dynamics of the binding interactions.  Herein, we report micellar binding constants for a series of sulfonamide antibiotics (sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfacetamide, sulfaguanidine, and sulfanilamide) with CTABr micelles, as determined using semi-equilibrium dialysis and 1H NMR methods. We also report the binding constant measurements for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including phenanthrene, naphthalene, pyrene and fluorene, to several micelle types. Unlike the antibiotics, where charge-charge interactions determined binding to CTABr micelles, the neutral PAHs show strong binding with micelles because of hydrophobic interactions. Our results enabled us to develop a relationship between binding constant (Log KB) and Log KOW for both charged and neutral compounds, which will be useful for predicting MEUF performance for removal of organic micro contaminants from wastewater.</description>

   <description>Healthcare is a high reliability industry designed to improve, preserve, and protect the health of citizens (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2000).  Events that affect patient safety have been reported with increasing regularity since the emphasis on patient safety in the early 2000âs (IOM).  Nursing care significantly affects patient outcomes.  The IOM mandated transformation of health education to incorporate patient safety concepts in the United States and this has gradually influenced health education globally (2003).  Nursing education programs are designed to increase studentsâ knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) and studentsâ confidence levels are indicators of their KSAs.  Gaining insight into what errors students are making will reveal where KSAs are weak and where educational transformation may be required.  Although teaching patient safety concepts is important, studies exploring this are limited.  Research exploring patient safety content in nursing curricula in Ontario could not be found in the existing literature.  &#xd;
 		This study found that the greatest number of nursing student errors reported in the literature are linked to medication administration followed by errors related to the environment, equipment, and devices (Raymond, Godfrey, &amp; Medves, 2016a).  Despite medication administration errors occurring the most often, students expressed the greatest confidence in this area and it seemed to be the most abundantly integrated in the written curriculum.  After reviewing three nursing curricula, it was noted that patient safety content was incorporated within each of the reviewed programs to a different degree (Raymond et al., 2016b).  Students are more confident on patient safety topics in the classroom than in the clinical settings and there were no educationally significant differences noted between baccalaureate and practical nursing studentsâ confidence levels.  Although both baccalaureate and practical nursing students fear repercussions when making an error, a greater percentage of practical nursing students expressed this concern (Raymond et al., 2016c; 2016d).  Higher percentages of practical than baccalaureate nursing students felt errors were addressed as individual mistakes instead of system issues (Raymond et al., 2016c, 2016d).  This research suggests that further initiatives aimed at reducing studentsâ fears while focusing on errors as system issues within both classroom and clinical settings are needed.</description>

   <title>Caribbean Immigrants in Relationship: Tracing the Transnational Connections between Austin Clarke and Samuel Selvon</title>

   <description>Austin Clarke and Samuel Selvon are similarly positioned in the literary field and offer overlapping perspectives in their depictions of Caribbean immigrants, yet for the most part, there has been no in-depth comparison of their careers. Moreover, their decades-long friendship and its documentationâarchived correspondence and Clarkeâs memoir dedicated to Selvonâs memoryâhave never garnered critical attention. My dissertation fills this gap in criticism through an investigation of the transnational relationships surrounding and explored within their literary production. In situating these two authors as simultaneously connected and isolated as they traverse different national boundaries, I foreground their emphasis on the interplay between the interpersonal relationships of Caribbean immigrants and the social structures within which they function. Drawing on the work of Pierre Bourdieu, I argue that both Clarke and Selvon investigate how social reality is encoded, inscribed, and naturalized while also suggesting the transformative potential of the social practices of Caribbean immigrants.&#xd;
Underlying this dissertation is a reflective reconsideration of the categories used to organize Caribbean writers and the interpretive frames applied to their literary production. Through reference to their archived correspondence, I explore the parodic strategies deployed by Clarke and Selvon as they conform to and undermine established boundaries, categories, and modes of behavior. My careful study of the privileges and pressures of macho performance in their correspondence guides my reading of their fiction and my refashioning of their critical reputations. Though critics have read their work as simply sociological descriptions of distinct social contexts and have misrepresented them as inept or reductive when it comes to issues of gender and sexuality, I demonstrate that both authors present remarkably nuanced depictions of gender construction as informed by and informing racial tensions, economic realities, and sociopolitical contexts. Clarke and Selvon demystify naturalized systems of domination, and careful analysis of the relationships that shape the lives of their characters uncovers how their practices and perceptions are tied to their manufactured feelings of loneliness and vulnerability as they desperately seek control of or become resigned to their constrained circumstances.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2016-03-29 22:08:13.093</description>
   <description>Though our everyday life is made up of contacts with the world through conscious experiences, our understanding of this basic fact is limited. Consciousness and the âhard problemâ have been one of the most controversial subjects in contemporary philosophy of mind. &#xd;
This thesis argues for a physicalist approach to conscious experience, accepting the idea, widely accepted in contemporary philosophy of mind, that phenomenal consciousness and its qualitative aspects resist functionalization. They are not explainable and knowable merely through functional explanation, giving rise to an explanatory and epistemic gap between phenomenal and scientific knowledge. While affirming the existence of an epistemic gap, this thesis attempts to explain it and to deny its presumed ontological implications. &#xd;
I discuss here two major physicalist theories (the Phenomenal Concept Strategy and Higher-Order Theories), as well as two main anti-physicalists arguments (Jacksonâs knowledge argument and Chalmersâ zombie argument). I argue that the consciousness property, being an emergent as opposed to a supervenient property, is an ontologically physical property. I also argue that the unique feature of consciousness, i.e. its subjectivity, is an epistemological relation between a subject, as an experiencer, and her own physical phenomenal properties. I show how the subjectivity of consciousness is compatible with physicalism.</description>

   <description>The Luby Transform (LT) codes are the first practical realization of fountain codes. LT codes were designed for efficient use over erasure channels. However, the degree distributions designed for the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC), such as the Robust Soliton Distribution (RSD) which are asymptotically and universally optimal over the BEC, are not optimal over noisy channels.&#xd;
&#xd;
Research has been done to improve performance over noisy channels and in finite length codes by changing the degree distribution or information sampling method. Many distributions that performed better than the RSD still shared some of its properties. These distributions fit under the umbrella of soliton-like distributions.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, we consider using non-binary LT codes to improve the Bit Error Rate (BER) and realized rate of the system with an acceptable increase in complexity.  While testing different degree distributions on 4-ary and 8-ary LT code, the RSD was not performing well. This led to the design of the fundamental degree distribution (FDD), which falls under the category of soliton-like distributions. The parameters for this distribution are found through Monte Carlo numerical optimization.  This new degree distribution was able to show improvements when moving to higher order fields in terms of BER and realized rate. &#xd;
&#xd;
It is clear that there is added complexity when moving to higher order fields. Some of this complexity is removed in this work by performing no multiplications over the field at intermediate nodes, as it was shown to provide negligible gains. &#xd;
&#xd;
As well, we look at shaping the left degree distribution (LDD) to further increase the improvements in the non-binary applications. We show that by strategically connecting the encoded symbols to the input symbols with the lowest degree, we can see improvements in the BER and realized rate of 4-ary LT codes. The realized rate increases from around 0.75 to 0.85 at an SNR per bit of 16 dB, simply by shaping the LDD for our non-systematic short length codes, with k = 100 at a negligible added complexity.</description>

   <description>This thesis focuses on the implementation of a human energy harvesterâs resistance control scheme for a full capacitance boost converter, low capacitance boost converter, and a voltage controlled attenuator. The boost converter control schemes utilize an adapted PFC ACMC boost converter topology with input resistance as a controlled feedback variable for the current loop, while disregarding the output voltage resistance. The electronic moduleâs power draw affects the applied resistance felt by the user. The prototype outputs a nominal 10W of power for the emulated 2.5â¦ full load. Previous research has enabled constant resistance, threshold resistance, and variable resistance control implementations on a boost converter coded in Code Composer Studioâs C/C++ environment.&#xd;
The first goal of this thesis sought to eliminate or minimize the necessary C/C++ coding required for resistive control. This was achieved through the implementation of MATLAB Simulinkâs Embedded Coderâs C2000 Library coding environment, using a block diagram control scheme with integrated MATLAB coding.&#xd;
Three control schemes are proposed: Ramp and Hold, Optimized Resistance, and Power Regulation control algorithms.  The Ramp and Hold scheme targets the decoupling point between the motor and the input encoder. The control method increases from light to full load peaking and holding the full load condition at this decoupling point to target the energy harvesterâs negative work period.  The Optimized Resistance algorithm averages the userâs average voltage at light load, and then increments the resistance until this voltage begins to drop, indicating a change in the userâs kinematics.  The Power Regulation control scheme programs a required average output power per step for the user, and dynamically alters the resistance felt by the user to achieve this goal.  &#xd;
The final boost converter had a peak efficiency DC of 93.4% for 25W input power at Vin=20V and Rin=15â¦. The linear regulator voltage controlled attenuator acts as a simple resistive load to dissipate the entire 10W input power, using the low side MOSFET for power dissipation. The three control schemes were implemented and tested on a boost converter with a 2200ÂµF, 940ÂµF, and 47ÂµF output capacitor. Integrated improvements to the system and future work are then proposed.</description>

   <description>A model free control technique (extremum seeking) is employed to address problems of large-scale systems involving multi-agents in real-time. This thesis focuses on the use of extremum seeking control in a distributed, coordinated and a cooperative fashion to solve distributed control and optimization problems.&#xd;
First, the problem of maximizing the power produced in a wind farm is considered. To tackle this problem, a distributed time-varying extremum seeking control (TVESC) technique is employed to overcome the need to provide accurate models of aerodynamic wake interactions among the wind turbines. Solutions in continuous-time and discrete-time are presented. &#xd;
Secondly, precise knowledge of the structure of network connectivity has been utilized in solving cooperative optimization problems of multi-agent systems to achieve global objectives. In this thesis, a distributed proportional-integral extremum seeking control technique is designed to tackle such problems over unknown networks.</description>

   <description>The main focus of this thesis is the investigation of the nonlinear response of unbiased and biased bilayer graphene to incident radiation at terahertz frequencies. We present a tight-binding model of biased and unbiased bilayer graphene that is used to calculate the nonlinear terahertz response. Dynamic equations are developed for the electron density matrix within the length gauge. These equations facilitate the calculation of interband and intraband carrier dynamics. We then obtain nonlinear transmitted and reflected terahertz fields using the calculated nonlinear interband and intraband current densities. &#xd;
&#xd;
We examine the nonlinear response of unbiased bilayer graphene as a function of the incident field amplitude. In this case the sample is taken to be undoped. In the reflected field, we find the maximum third harmonic amplitude to be approximately 30\% of the fundamental frequency for an incident field of 1.5 kV cm$^{-1}$, which is greater than that found in undoped monolayer graphene at the same field amplitude. &#xd;
&#xd;
To examine the nonlinear response of biased bilayer graphene, we investigate two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider an undoped sample at fixed temperature. We find that when the external bias has a value of 2 meV, the generated third harmonic in the reflected field is approximately 45\% of the fundamental for an incident field amplitude of 2 kV cm$^{-1}$. When we increase the external bias further to 8 meV, we find the generated third harmonic field is approximately 38\% of the fundamental for an incident field amplitude of 1 kV cm$^{-1}$. For both of these bias values, the generated third harmonic is greater than that found in undoped monolayer graphene. In that system, the generated third harmonic field is approximately 32\% of the fundamental for an incident field amplitude of 200 V cm$^{-1}$&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second scenario, we consider doped biased bilayer graphene. We fix the carrier density at 2$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, the incident field amplitude at 50 kV cm$^{-1}$, and examine the response as a function of the external bias. We find the largest third harmonic amplitude is approximately 8\% of the fundamental for a bias of 0 meV (zero bias).</description>

   <description>Microfluidic devices are extremely popular in the area of analytical research as they reduce sample input requirements, have low operational cost, fast analysis time, high separation resolution and low detection limits.  A multitude of analytical techniques has been adapted to the microdevice format, including pre-treatment, separation, and detection. Depending on how the fluid is addressed and manipulated, microfluidics can be sub-divided into the âcontinuous-flowâ and digital microfluidics (DMF) approaches. This thesis aims to demonstrate the versatility of microfluidic field of research, where a number of actuation approaches, fabrication methods and materials, on-chip operations and applications were explored.&#xd;
âContinuous-flowâ microfluidics allows manipulating the bulk of the sample through the narrow channels under the applied force. Fabrication techniques unique to thermoplastics were utilized to fabricate a âcontinuous-flowâ device capable of separating small drugs and large biological molecules, where a microstructured fibre served as an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) emitter. &#xd;
Interest in DMF, where discrete droplets are addressed and manipulated independently, has grown rapidly due to the versatility that arises from non-linear control of fluids. The most common approaches to droplet manipulation are based on either electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) or magnetic interactions. EWOD devices were fabricated with standard photolithography procedures, where coatings with varying degrees of hydrophobicity were explored for EWOD actuation â natural leaf surface, TeflonÂ® AF, and a series of fluorinated silica nanoparticle-based materials. &#xd;
The magnetic actuation approach is based on the interaction of an external magnetic field and magnetically susceptible material inside the droplet, which can be transported over a low-friction surface. Natural superhydrophobic leaf, hydrophobic Teflon, and a commercial superhydrophobic surface were compared for their suitability for the particle-based magnetic actuation. We demonstrated that a commercial coating has excellent compatibility with magnetic actuation, where high actuation speed was reproducibly achieved.  &#xd;
We also developed a novel âparticle-freeâ method of magnetic manipulation, where instead of magnetic particles, droplets contained paramagnetic salts with high magnetic susceptibilities were used. Droplets of five paramagnetic salts were efficiently actuated over the commercial superhydrophobic surface, where salts with higher magnetic susceptibility required lower concentrations and achieved higher actuation speed.  The âparticle-freeâ approach was used with online fluorescence detection of an anti-cancer drug.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-08 13:02:01.041</description>
   <description>A rigid body spring model was used to simulate wrist motions. The carpal bones were constructed based on a computed tomography of a cadaver wrist. Bony structures were assembled as a wrist model in the simulation software, RecurDyn. Articulations between wrist joint bones were modeled using gliding surfaces, each was attached to its bone surface and this articulation was controlled by contact forces in the simulation software. Wrist ligaments were modeled by either one or two spring elements for each ligament or major component. Muscles of the wrist were represented by axial force elements. The force exerted by each tendon in each wrist movement was computed using either exponential function or sigmoid function in two different models. Each of these force functions were proportional to the distance between the simulation capitate and the capitate in the desired position. Capitate was chosen as tracking marker because the common center of rotation of wrist is within the capitate head. &#xd;
Each of these approaches were simulated alone or with addition of a time factor. Eight wrist models were created. Each model simulated 34Â° extension, 57Â° extension, 30Â° flexion, 65Â° flexion, radial deviation and ulnar deviation. The root mean square error was calculated for linear and angular position for each carpal bone, each wrist movement, and for each model. The combined overall RMS errors for each model were calculated. The double spring ligament model with sigmoid force function considering time factor showed the least overall RMS error and most joint stability. The single spring ligament model with exponential force function without the time factor showed the highest RMS error and joint instability in some wrist motion simulations. The different modeling approaches used in this study helped in understanding the kinematics of the wrist joint and the wrist ligaments and tendons.&#xd;
The results of this work encourage using these models for further kinematic studies in tandem with in vivo or in vitro studies for further validation. These models can be helpful in simulating non-physiological conditions of the wrist. Further work related to result validation using data from multiple wrists, further enhancements of ligaments and muscles modeling will improve the accuracy of these wrist models.</description>

   <title>Decision Criterion for Observation-Based Relays in LTE Networks</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2016-04-08 10:47:17.31</description>
   <description>Relay technology has the potential to dramatically improve throughput for Long Term Evolution (LTE) network users. However, the existing 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard for relaying, the Type 1 relay, is best suited to cell extension. An alternative design, Type 2, was considered for increasing throughput within the existing coverage region. It has not been standardized, but has been cited as in need of further study. In this thesis, we augment the Type 2 relay design and achieve the following:&#xd;
1. Improve throughput for relay-supported users.&#xd;
2. Empower the relays to make decisions as to which users they support.&#xd;
3. Introduce as few new protocols as possible to implement the relay.&#xd;
To achieve these objectives, the proposed relay has a decision criterion to compare its own achievable throughput against the throughput of any candidate users it detects. Depending on the relative quality of its connections, the relay may opt to provide two-hop Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) support or retransmission support. Once it reaches its decision, the relay informs the evolved Node B (eNB) of its intent to support the user and the mode by which it will do so. The eNB adjusts its behaviour accordingly and continues to perform all downlink control functions. Unlike standard relay systems, the proposed approach requires no approval from the eNB and no user handoff.&#xd;
Simulations were conducted using Network Simulator 3.21 (ns-3.21) and data was processed in MATLAB R2012a. For a relay with transmit power characteristics equivalent to users in the cell, 35% to 38% of users within its observation region are eligible for some form of support. The majority of supported users received retransmission support, rather than two-hop TDM. Additionally, if optimized relay placement can achieve a 5 dB improvement to the relay-eNB channel, the percentage of supported users increases to between 49% and 55%. With the 5 dB improvement, the number of users eligible for two-hop TDM increased substantially, particularly at larger bandwidths. Network configuration parameters had a considerable impact on results. In particular, the Control Format Indicator (CFI) and channel bandwidth (W) had the greatest impact on results.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we develop a coherent framework for&#xd;
studying time-varying vector fields of different regularity classes and their flows. This setting has the benefit of unifying all classes of regularity. In particular, it includes the real analytic regularity and provides us with tools and techniques for studying holomorphic extensions of real analytic vector fields. We show that under suitable integrability conditions, a time-varying real analytic vector field on a manifold&#xd;
can be extended to a time-varying holomorphic vector field on a neighbourhood of that manifold. Moreover, in this setting, the nonlinear differential equation governing the flow of a&#xd;
time-varying vector field can be considered as a linear&#xd;
differential equation on an infinite dimensional locally convex vector space.  We show that, in the real analytic case, the integrability of the time-varying vector field ensures convergence of the sequence of Picard iterations for this linear differential equation, giving us a series representation for the flow of a time-varying real analytic vector field.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using the framework we develop in this thesis, we study a parametization-independent model in &#xd;
control theory called tautological control system. In the&#xd;
tautological control system setting, instead of defining a&#xd;
control system as a parametrized family of vector fields on a&#xd;
manifold, it is considered as a subpresheaf of the sheaf of vector fields on that manifold. This removes the explicit dependence of the systems on the control parameter and gives us a suitable framework for studying regularity&#xd;
of control systems. We also study the relationship between tautological control systems and classical control systems. Moreover, we introduce a suitable notion of&#xd;
trajectory for tautological control systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we generalize the orbit theorem of Sussmann and Stefan to the tautological framework. In particular, we show that orbits of a tautological control system are immersed submanifolds of the state manifold. It turns out that the presheaf structure on the family of vector fields of a system plays an important role in characterizing the tangent space to the orbits of the system. In particular, we prove that, for globally defined real analytic tautological control systems, every tangent space to the orbits of the system is generated by the Lie brackets of the vector fields of the system.</description>

   <description>Spinal fusion is an effective and one of the most commonly used surgeries to treat intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) related low back pain. However, non-fusion still occurs in about 10-15% of the clinical cases. The global objective of this project is to develop a synthetic bone graft for the spinal fusion, combined with bone growth enhancing factors named bone and cartilage stimulating peptides (BCSPÂ®). The focus of this present study is to assess BCSPsâ performance in various concentrations with respect to their effects on osteoprogenitor proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, cell culture mineralization and cell migration. BCSPs appeared to enhance the bone growth in the previous study using an animal model; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of BCSPs performance remain unclear. In this study, we examined three BCSPs in vitro with respect to their ability to enhance proliferation, to induce early osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, and to simulate the migration of osteoprogenitor cells. The proliferation, early differentiation, mineralization and migration assessments were carried out with a double-stranded DNA quantification, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP, early osteogenic differentiation marker) expression assay, an Alizarin Red S stainingÂ assay and a Boyden Chamber assay, respectively. Osteoprogenitor cells examined included MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs), human periosteum-derived stem cells (hPDSCs), and rabbit periosteum-derived stem cells (rPDSCs). Both hBM-MSCs and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts exhibited a significant increase of ALP expression after the exposure to BCSP1 and BCSP7, and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts also exhibited a significant increase of ALP expression after the exposure to BCSP11. However, no significant difference was observed in proliferation, migration or mineralization assessments for any of the examined osteoprogenitor cells after exposure to BCSPs. The present work showed that BCSPs have a stimulating effect on the early differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosoteblast and human BM-MSCs. However, BCSPs did not show any stimulating effects on the proliferation, mineralization and migration of osteoprogenitors listed, indicating that promoting early differentiation of osteoprogenitors might be one of the mechanisms of BCSPsâ in vivo bone growth stimulating effect.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the over-representation of indigenous women in Canadian federal prisons. I situate the prison as a site of modernity to draw attention to the ways that the prison is underpinned by the logics of white supremacy. I posit that the prison is a complicated geography wherein the differential and overlapping colonial histories of slavery and indigenous genocide are intricately linked and also bifurcated. The prison enables racial violence and at the same time, erases this violence against indigenous women from public purview. This is to say, that the prison upholds the project of modernity through the sequestering and dispossession of indigenous communities, and this spatial act must be considered alongside other geographies of removal, such as the plantation and the reserve. Colonial carceral logics also operate beyond the space of the prison, which leads me to consider the staggering numbers of murdered and missing indigenous women as part of the colonial project that is deeply invested in the maintenance of white supremacy. In addition to reviewing key theories in black and indigenous prison studies, I discuss reports released from the Correctional Investigatorâs Office to clarify how reportage narratives of âchangeâ are unable to rectify the disproportionate rates of federally incarcerated indigenous women. I also explore maps of Canadian prisons to think through how colonial and carceral geographies conceal racial violence. Throughout this project, I centralize that within colonial spaces there are always decolonial narratives. I posit that prison abolition must be accompanied by decolonial projects invested in dismantling the logics of white supremacy. Specifically, turning to creative texts, such as storytelling, illuminates how practices of human relationality are subversive acts wherein articulations of a better future emerge.</description>

   <description>Background: Existing homelessness research focuses on psychological and social aspects of this experience. There is limited literature focusing on the daily occupations of those who are chronically homeless, and particularly during the transition to becoming housed. Purpose: This research was carried out in 3 Phases. Phase I aimed to synthesize the current literature contributing to an understanding of occupational transition during the process of becoming housed among homeless persons. Phase II aimed to develop an understanding of the experience of occupational engagement of chronically homeless persons in a medium-sized city in Ontario, Canada. Phase III aimed to develop an enhanced understanding of the experience of occupational engagement of chronically homeless persons as they made the transition to becoming housed. Method: Phase I used a scoping review methodology (Arksey &amp; OâMalley, 2005) to explore existing literature contributing to an understanding of occupational transition during an exit from homelessness. Interpretive phenomenology guided Phases II and III, which involved gathering data through semi-structured interviews with 12 participants who were chronically homeless (Phase II), and 11 participants with a history of chronic homelessness who had recently become housed (Phase III). Data collected in Phases II &amp; III were analyzed using a modified version of the method suggested by Colaizzi (1978). Results: Phase I uncovered the relative paucity of literature focusing on the occupations of homeless persons as they exit homelessness. Phase II identified the unique occupational experiences of chronically homeless persons in a medium-sized city. Chronically homeless persons experienced occupational alienation caused by a lack of participation in mainstream society, and a deep and pervasive boredom that adversely influenced their mental health and drove substance misuse. Phase III identified that as participants transitioned to becoming housed, slow changes in their occupational repertoire positively influenced their mental health and well-being. Implications: Taking a broad view of the occupations of chronically homeless persons reveals several unique aspects of their experiences that can inform interventions designed to support this population as they exit homelessness. Incorporating an occupational approach in concert with a housing first philosophy may lead to a more comprehensive strategy to addressing chronic homelessness.</description>

   <description>As a result of human activities, rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are causing climate change.  One method to sequester CO2 involves the production of synthetic limestone (CaCO3) from calcium silicate minerals and CO2 via mineral carbonation.  Certain grades of CaCO3, including Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC), are sold as a filler and pigment to several industries.  Therefore, if marketable as PCC, the production of CaCO3 via mineral carbonation may be an economical method to help mitigate climate change.  The global market for PCC offers the potential to utilize several million tonnes of CO2 per year.  Waste cement is a suitable source material for PCC production via mineral carbonation and can be recovered from waste concrete as a byproduct of aggregate recycling practices.  &#xd;
The objective of this research was to investigate the possibility of sequestering CO2 by producing PCC via the recovery and carbonation of waste cement calcium.  An acid (HCl) was used to allow the complete leaching of calcium, and so the dissolved calcium could be separated from the residual material via filtration to enable PCC recovery.  A purification step via pH adjustment preferentially precipitated co-leached impurities such as iron and silicon.  CaCO3 precipitation was later induced by adding Na2CO3 that can be produced by the absorption of CO2 from flue gases or the atmosphere (air capture) using NaOH.  HCl and NaOH can be recycled via bipolar membrane electrodialysis.  Although this method may require over twice the energy of the conventional PCC manufacturing process, low carbon electricity can be used and negative process emissions are currently feasible in multiple Canadian provinces.  Lower energy carbonation methods could be used where stationary sources of concentrated CO2 are located, however air capture is possible and the use of HCl and a purification step allows for the complete carbonation and utilization of waste cement calcium.  This minimizes emissions from hauling residues and may ensure that significantly more CO2 is absorbed by the waste cement than would otherwise be passively absorbed by the material over several decades of atmospheric exposure.</description>

   <description>In order to maintain homeostasis, the central nervous system (CNS) must monitor and integrate  signaling molecules such as peptides and hormones that convey information regarding reproductive, metabolic, and cardiovascular status (to name a few) of the organism. Many of these signals are located in circulation and are incapable of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB), the protective structure surrounding the CNS. Circumventricular organs (CVOs) are specialized structures that lack a BBB and therefore provide a route through which these peripheral signals may access the CNS. This study focuses on the subfornical organ (SFO), a forebrain sensory CVO, and its ability to respond to three different signals, prolactin (PRL), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are involved in the regulation of reproductive, metabolic, and cardiovascular status, respectively. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings, all three peptides were found to influence the excitability of dissociated SFO neurons. Of the 9 neurons that responded to 1 ÂµM PRL, 55% depolarized (mean: 13.6 Â± 5.0 mV, n=5) and 45% hyperpolarized (mean:-8.4 Â± 2.1 mV, n=4). Similar to this, 10 of the neurons perfused with 250 nM Î±-MSH responded by either depolarizing (50%, mean: 14.9 Â± 5.6 mV, n=5) or hyperpolarizing (50%, mean: -11.0 Â± 0.7 mV, n=5). Both response types were also observed in response to 1 nM BDNF as 69% of the 16 responders depolarized (mean: 15.4 Â± 2.4 mV, n=11) and 31% hyperpolarized (mean: -12.1 Â± 2.0 mV, n=5). A non-selective cation channel potentially mediates the depolarizing response of all three peptides, as suggested by comparing extrapolated reversal potentials for each (PRL: -61.7 mV, Î±-MSH â55.4 mV, BDNF: -53.3 mV). Additionally, some SFO neurons (12%) were capable of responding to both BDNF and Î±-MSH. This study is the first to demonstrate electrophysiological consequences of PRL, Î±-MSH, and BDNF on the excitability of SFO neurons, effects which provide a point at which these peptides could potentially access the CNS from the circulation. Given its numerous efferent projections to autonomic control centers of the CNS involved in reproductive, metabolic, and cardiovascular function, our data suggest the SFO is an important site of integration and information relay for these peptides.</description>

   <description>As a contemporary communications medium, the museum has undergone significant reinvention and reorientation of purpose within the past several decades. While the late twentieth century saw the rise of a fundamental reimagining of the museum as a visitor-oriented space where questions of representation, ownership, and voice were of paramount concern, the early twenty-first century has seen a repositioning of museums as market actors with a role to play in the economic aspects of social life. This dissertation probes the growing disconnect between the rhetoric and practices enacted under the auspices of new museology and the ascendancy of corporatized values, interests, and operational forms in museum praxis. It is specifically concerned with working class history museums located in postindustrial urban environments, and seeks to explore and consider some of the inherent tensions in representing labour struggles and working class heritage in gentrifying, capitalist cities. The dissertation reveals that working class history museums face immense challenges in trying to reconcile being socially progressive and class-oriented while also maintaining relevance and success in gentrifying areas. It argues that these museums are embedded within political economic structures of power, and thus face considerable limitations in their efforts to act as meaningful sites of political or ideological contestation. Furthermore, by subscribing to the supposition that heritage resources can be used to spur gentrification and economic development, museums may unwittingly reinforce elite reimaginings of the urban environment. Three case studies are examined: the Peopleâs Palace, a public museum in Glasgow, Scotland; New York Cityâs Lower East Side Tenement Museum; and finally, the ÃcomusÃ©e du Fier Monde, a small community museum located in the Centre-Sud neighbourhood of MontrÃ©al, Canada.</description>

   <description>The standard for estimating roughness for the purposes of underground mine ventilation planning is to choose values found in a variety of textbooks that attempt to match the excavation type. These values are then used in the Atkinson equation made popular in 1935 by McElroy to determine pressure drops and energy requirements. The Darcy-Weisbach equation, developed in the 1950s, has been accepted by most other engineering disciplines but lacks critical information for widespread use in underground mines, namely, the friction factor. As the mining ventilation field moves towards the use of simulations and more refined models, a simple and efficient method for extracting the friction factor is needed. This thesis proposes new LiDAR-based methods for estimating this factor in underground mining tunnels. By using a mobile LiDAR platform low density point clouds are collected then analysed to estimate the friction factor and are compared to those calculated from ventilation data gathered at Barrick Gold Corporation - Hemlo. The two original methods described, in addition to four previously published methods, are shown to be applicable to this 3D point cloud data. The original methods and the IBA method, put forward by RÃ¸nn and Skog in 1997, are consistent with both the friction factors already in use at the mine and with the ventilation data collected. Ideas for further improving this approach for friction factor estimation are also suggested.</description>

   <description>Flow, recharge and transport dynamics in fractured rock aquifers with low lying rock outcrops is a largely unexplored area of study in hydrogeology. The purpose of this thesis is to examine these topics in an agricultural area in Eastern Ontario. The study consists of a regional scale groundwater quality study, an infiltration experiment that considers bacteria transport from the ground surface to a well, and a numerical modelling study that tests the parameters that affect surface infiltration of a tracer from a rock outcrop to a deeper horizontal fracture. In the water quality study, approximately 65% of the samples contained total coliform, 16% contained E. coli, and 1% contained nitrate-N at greater than 5 mg/L. Occurrence of E. coli increased when considering seasonality, where wells were drilled on rock outcrops, and for shallow well intervals. Nitrate-N did not occur above the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (Health Canada, 2012) of 10 mg/L. Rapid arrival times were observed in the infiltration study for both the microspheres (30 minutes) and a dye tracer (45 minutes) in a well approximately 6.0 m in horizontal and 2.8 m in vertical distance from the tracer source. Transport velocities were approximately 38.9 m/day for the dye tracer and 115.2 m/day for the colloidal tracer. Results of the model runs indicate that overburden can provide an effective protective layer to transport in fractures, that high groundwater velocities occur in larger fracture apertures and higher gradients dilute tracer concentrations, and that lower groundwater velocities occur with smaller fracture apertures and lower gradients result in elevated tracer concentrations. Lower rainfall rates, larger fracture apertures, early tracer time, larger gradients, and lower water levels maintained unsaturated conditions for longer time periods such that tracer transport was delayed until saturated conditions were attained. The overall heterogeneity of this aquifer environment creates a source water protection conundrum where the water quality is generally good, while transport can occur very quickly in proximity to rock outcrops and in areas with limited overburden.</description>
