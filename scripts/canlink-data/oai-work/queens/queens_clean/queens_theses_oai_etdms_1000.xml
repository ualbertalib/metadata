   <description>The products of vanadium metal atom reactions with propene and some propene isotopomers (propene-d6 and propene-3,3,3-d3) are investigated using FT-IR matrix isolation. The major product from the condensation of V atoms with propene at elevated mole ratios is found to be propane (C3H8), the production of which is seen to increase as concentration of propene increases. Additionally a matrix isolated product formed after metal atom insertion into the C-H bond of propene at low propene mole ratios is isolated and identified. &#xd;
The location of the insertion site is identified as one of the methyl hydrogen carbon bonds. The structure of the product is identified as an allyl vanadium hydride complex, through a FT-IR matrix isolation study of propene isotopomers. It is also shown that this primary product acts as an intermediate in the formation of propane.  A full mechanism for the proposed formation of propane from sacrificial hydrogenation is proposed and compared with the reported mechanism for the similar reaction involving ethene. The mechanistic identification of the hydrogenation of propene is shown as a generalization of the previous reaction involving ethene.&#xd;
Photochemistry of reactants and intermediates trapped in the matrix are investigated. Irradiation of matrices with several different UV-visible wavelength ranges indicate that no further chemistry occurs after formation of the matrix and further irradiation has no effect on intermediates or reactants.  Additionally the reactivity of water with vanadium and propene under low propene concentration conditions is also studied. Results from this study show that under all conditions studied no incorporation of water into the propene molecule is found.</description>

   <description>We present the results of a new and high sensitivity study of the neutral hydrogen (HI) gas in three early type edge-on spiral galaxies, NGC 4157, NGC 3600 and NGC 2683. All three galaxies reveal HI disks that extend nearly or more than twice the length of the optical disk, which ubiquitously reveal asymmetries and warps. We model each galaxy using a three-dimensional kinematic model to derive the empirical parameters of the density distribution functions and rotation curves. A Gaussian function is unanimously found to best represent the density distribution in the plane of the galaxies. We also find that there is in fact a thick HI disk extending into the halo of two of three of these galaxies with scale heights on kpc. scales. This gas suggests the existence of two separate widespread components: a thin, high intensity disk component, normally rotating, and a vast, low intensity halo component, rotating at slower velocities with respect to the disk. This vertical velocity gradient is perhaps our most significant finding in addition to the discovery of the two new HI halos. We also find an unevenly distributed small-scale component of the gas in the form of shell-like and filamentary structures that extend from the disk into the halo. In all three systems we find unique kinematic and structural peculiarities including an HI disk extending four times the optical disk, a declining rotation curve, a companion, expanding bubbles, disk warps, etc. Several physical parameters are derived such as neutral hydrogen and dynamic masses, systemic velocities, HI radii, HI halo masses, etc.  All of our findings are investigated and discussed in depth for each of the three galaxies.</description>

   <description>This research aims to improve our understanding of multiobjective optimization, by comparing the performance of five multiobjective optimization algorithms, and by proposing a new formulation to consider input uncertainty in multiobjective optimization problems. Four deterministic multiobjective optimization algorithms and one probabilistic algorithm were compared: the Weighted Sum, the Adaptive Weighted Sum, the Normal Constraint, the Normal Boundary Intersection methods, and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II).&#xd;
The algorithms were compared using six test problems, which included a wide range of optimization problem types (bounded vs. unbounded, constrained vs. unconstrained). Performance metrics used for quantitative comparison were the total run (CPU) time, number of function evaluations, variance in solution distribution, and numbers of dominated and non-optimal solutions. Graphical representations of the resulting Pareto fronts were also presented.&#xd;
No single method outperformed the others for all performance metrics, and the two different classes of algorithms were effective for different types of problems. NSGA-II did not effectively solve problems involving unbounded design variables or equality constraints. On the other hand, the deterministic algorithms could not solve a problem with a non-continuous objective function. &#xd;
In the second phase of this research, design under uncertainty was considered in multiobjective optimization. The effects of input uncertainty on a Pareto front were quantitatively investigated by developing a multiobjective robust optimization framework. Two possible effects on a Pareto front were identified: a shift away from the Utopia point, and a shrinking of the Pareto curve. A set of Pareto fronts were obtained in which the optimum solutions have different levels of insensitivity or robustness. &#xd;
Four test problems were used to examine the Pareto front change. Increasing the insensitivity requirement of the objective function with regard to input variations moved the Pareto front away from the Utopia point or reduced the length of the Pareto front. These changes were quantified, and the effects of changing robustness requirements were discussed. The approach would provide designers with not only the choice of optimal solutions on a Pareto front in traditional multiobjective optimization, but also an additional choice of a suitable Pareto front according to the acceptable level of performance variation.</description>

   <title>Feasibility Assessment of Compliant Polymers in TKR</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-11 14:59:50.801</description>
   <description>Total knee joint replacements (TKRs) are a commonly used treatment when joint pain becomes a major issue and the function of activities of daily living is impaired.  TKRs may last for up to 20 years; however, younger and physically more active patients are receiving TKRs, necessitating increased prosthesis life-time.  There has been considerable interest in more cartilage-like materials for the tibial inlay of a TKR.  Compliant, rubbery polymers may be a first step towards such a material.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, finite element analysis (FEA) was utilized to assess the feasibility of polycarbonate urethane (PCU) in a TKR application.  Mechanical characterisation of PCU55D and PCU80A was performed in order to better understand the deformation behaviour of these materials.  Mechanical test data was then used to tune and validate a hyperelastic material model.  In a last step, the material model was applied to a static FE knee model which was used to simulate five discrete loading cases: three gait cycle events, stair climbing and squatting.  Contact pressure, contact area and von Mises stress of the PCU inlay were compared to literature and to a standard ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) inlay.&#xd;
&#xd;
The contact area of the articulating implant surfaces was on average 345% greater in PCU than in UHMWPE and contact pressure was on average 77% lower in PCU than in UHMWPE.  The difference between TKRs simulated with a PCU tibial inlay and those simulated with a UHMWPE inlay increased with increasing flexion angle.  The contact pressures measured in TKRs simulated with a PCU tibial inlay were well below values that are expected to cause damage to the polymer, possibly reducing the risk of wear. The contact areas found in TKRs simulated with a PCU tibial inlay were close to what has been reported for the natural knee.&#xd;
&#xd;
Considering the low contact pressures even at high flexion angles, where initial congruency is limited, it may be feasible to design less conforming knee prostheses that still exhibit low contact pressures, allowing for a greater range of motion.  The reported results strongly indicate that compliant polymers may offer an opportunity to improve current TKRs.</description>

   <description>This qualitative study investigated Chinese ESL students’ use of host mass media and how such use enabled them to acquire host communication competence and acculturation from their perspective. It was grounded on Kim’s theory of communication and cross-cultural adaptation and the uses and gratifications theory, and employed a phenomenography approach. Nine participants at a university in Ontario were involved in this study. Data obtained from media use logs, think-aloud protocols, and follow-up interviews provided a fairly far-reaching and detailed description of the participants’ uses, reasoning, and effects of using host mass media.&#xd;
The analysis of data illustrated that these students used a variety of media as sources of information, language acquisition, culture learning, entertainment, and communication. Findings suggest that host mass media were the major influence on these students’ acquisition of host communication competence, perceptions of and acculturation to Canada. Their reliance on mass communication went into the later years of their acculturation process, and complemented their language and culture learning, which was somewhat limited through insufficient or reluctant participation in host interpersonal communication. Host communication competence was a primary factor that influenced their selection and use of host mass media, but it was not the only decisive factor relevant to their degree of acculturation. Individual characteristics, the social and cultural environment in Canada were also found to have significant impact on their acculturation process and outcomes. It is expected that the findings can assist colleges and universities in designing effective programs based on these students’ needs and characteristics, thus enabling them to achieve their academic and professional goals.</description>

   <description>Processing information in the nervous system is energetically expensive, constraining the ability of the system to survive disturbances caused by stress. While some organisms compensate for extreme changes in the abiotic features of their environment, the mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood. We used the locust Descending Contralateral Movement Detector (DCMD) neuron to study how the propagation characteristics of action potentials (APs) change following an acute energy stress in control and heat shock (HS) pre-treated animals. We also attempted to determine if Ca2+ is involved in the DCMD AP and the possible changes indicated above. Conduction velocity decreased over an hour of recording in all groups, except those with minimal dissections, and we observed an increase in AP half-width and a decrease in the slope of the rising phase of the AP over time. After HS pre-treatment the response to a standard looming stimulus was delayed, showed significantly fewer APs and a lower peak frequency compared to controls. Brief application of sodium azide (NaN3) as an acute metabolic inhibitor did not subsequently affect DCMD’s conduction velocity or ability to fire at high frequencies during the recording period. There were no significant differences from control animals with extracellular Ca2+ manipulations; however we cannot conclude that Ca2+ does not contribute to DCMD’s AP because Na+ could have flowed through Ca2+ channels in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, examination of possible performance impairments with decreased Ca2+ currents, to indicate if Ca2+ current manipulation may account for the performance impairment, could not be conducted because no differences in AP characteristics were observed with Ca2+ manipulations. We suggest that the slowing of propagation in all groups represents a response to energetic stress and that HS modifies neuronal properties in ways that can be interpreted as saving energy in case of future stressors.</description>

   <title>Exploring Factors Associated With ESL/ELD Students’ Performance on the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test</title>

   <description>The study explored factors associated with English as Second Language (ESL) and English Literacy Development (ELD) students’ performance on the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) from three different yet interrelated aspects. These aspects were the relationship between test performance and the characteristics of ESL/ELD students; the relationship between ESL/ELD students’ aggregated school performance and their school-level socio-economic status; and a comparison of ESL/ELD and non-ESL/ELD students’ performance on three test formats in the reading component of the OSSLT (multiple-choice questions, constructed-response questions, and constructed-response questions with explanations). The study was conducted based on 4,311 ESL/ELD students’ test data, their responses to the Educational Quality and Accountability Office’s (EQAO) Student Questionnaire, and the test results of 5,003 non-ESL/ELD students. School-level socio-economic status data from the Education Quality and Indicators Program (EQUIP) were merged with the OSSLT test data. These data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, multiple regression and discriminant analysis.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results indicated that e-literacy activities, literature literacy activities,&#xd;
non-fiction literacy activities, newspaper and magazine literacy activities, and literacy hours were positive predictors of ESL/ELD students’ performance on the OSSLT. Letter reading and writing, song and poetry literacy activities were two negative predictors. In terms of home language patterns, whether English was the first language of the test-takers, and what language(s) they spoke at home were both influential variables in differentiating ESL and ELD students’ literacy performance. The results also revealed that a higher parental education index positively predicted a school’s average OSSLT performance. In ii&#xd;
addition, ESL/ELD students demonstrated substantial performance gaps in all of the three test formats in reading as compared to non-ESL/ELD students. Only multiple-choice&#xd;
questions obtained a significant discriminant coefficient with a weak discriminating function. The results of this study offered some insights about identifying and understanding factors that were associated with ESL/ELD students’ OSSLT performance from the perspective of the test-takers and the test itself. The results also provide directions for future research and instructional support in relation to ESL/ ELD students in the context of the accountability framework in Ontario.</description>

   <description>The Snedden lab has been studying a family of Ca2+-binding proteins from Arabidopsis that are related to the prototypical Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) and are termed CMLs (CaM-like proteins). Previous work on CML42 demonstrated that it displays biochemical properties typical of Ca2+ sensors and interacts in vitro with KIC (KCBP-interacting Ca2+-binding protein), a protein known to function in trichome branching. In the present study, I investigated whether CML42 is also involved in trichome branching. I examined a CML42 T-DNA insertion knockout line (cml42) and found that it exhibits a mutant trichome phenotype with increased branch numbers compared to wildtype plants. All other aspects of cml42 growth and morphology, including root hairs, appeared normal relative to wildtype plants. kic knockout plants did not show any discernible trichome phenotype when compared to wildtype plants, nor did transgenic lines overexpressing CML42. Transgenic plants lacking both CML42 and KIC expression (cml42kic) displayed a cml42 mutant phenotype. The genetic studies suggest that CML42 is a negative regulator of trichome branching. Biochemical analysis on recombinant full-length CML42, C-terminal, and N-terminal fragments, using the fluorescent probe 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS), demonstrated that Ca2+-binding results in a conformational change in CML42 and the exposure of hydrophobic regions, particularly within the C-terminal lobe. Collectively, data from the Snedden Lab  support the important role of Ca2+ signalling in trichome branching and morphology.</description>

   <description>Game sketching is used to identify enjoyable designs for digital games without the expense of fully implementing them. This thesis presents Raptor, a novel tool for&#xd;
sketching games. Raptor shows how tabletop interaction can effectively support the&#xd;
ideation phase of interaction design by permitting small collocated groups to participate in the design and testing process together. Raptor relies heavily on efficient gesture-based interaction, mixed-reality interaction involving physical props and digital artifacts, Wizard-of-Oz demonstration gameplay sketching, and fluid change of roles between designer and tester. An evaluation of Raptor using seven groups of three people showed that a sketching tool based on a tabletop computer indeed supports ideation and collaboration among collocated groups better than a more traditional PC-based tool.</description>

   <description>Background: Respiratory illnesses can have a substantial impact on population health and burden hospitals in terms of patient load. Advance warnings of the spread of such illness could inform public health interventions and help hospitals manage patient services. Previous research showed that calls for respiratory complaints to Telehealth Ontario are correlated up to two weeks in advance with emergency department visits for respiratory illness at the provincial level.&#xd;
Objectives: This thesis examined whether Telehealth Ontario calls for respiratory complaints could be used to accurately forecast the daily and weekly number of emergency department visits for respiratory illness at the health unit level for each of the 36 health units in Ontario up to 14 days in advance in the context of a real-time syndromic surveillance system. The forecasting abilities of three different time series modeling techniques were compared.&#xd;
Methods: The thesis used hospital emergency department visit data from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System database and Telehealth Ontario call data and from June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006. Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI), Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS), and Numerical Methods for Subspace State Space System Identification (N4SID) algorithms were used to create prediction models for the daily number of emergency department visits using Telehealth call counts and holiday/weekends as predictors. Prediction models were constructed using the first year of the study data and their accuracy was measured over the second year of data. Factors associated with prediction accuracy were examined.&#xd;
Results: Forecast error varied widely across health units. Prediction error increased with lead time and lower call-to-visits ratio. Compared with N4SID, PCI and FOS had significantly lower forecast error. Forecasts of the weekly aggregate number of visits showed little evidence of ability to accurately flag corresponding actual increases. However, when visits were aggregated over a four day period, increases could be flagged more accurately than chance in six of the 36 health units accounting for approximately half of the Ontario population.&#xd;
Conclusions: This thesis suggests that Telehealth Ontario data collected by a real-time syndromic surveillance system could play a role in forecasting health services demand for respiratory illness.</description>

   <description>Remediation of DNAPL contaminated sites in fractured rock has proven to be very difficult. No current technology can be used to remediate such sites in a timely and economic manner due to the inherent heterogeneity of fractured rock and back diffusion of contaminants stored in the rock matrix. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the viability of biostimulation of native biofilm as a means to control flow and back diffusion at fractured rock sites. &#xd;
A field trial was conducted at an uncontaminated site in southern Ontario. The site is underlain by dolomites of the Lockport formation. Three major fracture zones have been identified in the study area. Two closely spaced (5.04 m) boreholes were used to isolate a fracture zone at a depth of 17 m with straddle packers. These boreholes were used to create an injection-withdrawal system with recirculation, which was used for tracer injection in order to load the rock matrix with a conservative dye tracer and to inject nutrients for 21 days in order to stimulate the growth of biofilm in the fracture.&#xd;
Evaluation of the ability of the biofilm to control flow through the fracture was conducted through pulse interference tests. Pulse interference tests were conducted before and after the injection of nutrients. The results from the pulse interference tests showed a maximum 65% reduction in transmissivity, which is equivalent to a 28% reduction in fracture aperture shortly after the cessation of biostimulation.&#xd;
	In order to investigate the effect of the biofilm stimulation on matrix diffusion the rock matrix was loaded with Lissamine, a conservative fluorescent dye tracer prior to biostimulation and its concentration was monitored at injection and withdrawal wells. The effect that biostimulation had on matrix diffusion was determined by comparing field concentration measurements with a model that simulates a system unaffected by biofilm stimulation. The biostimulation lowered the concentration of tracer attributable to back diffusion at the withdrawal well by about 20% for approximately 30 days following the cessation of biostimulation. It is also thought that large amounts of tracer might have been trapped in the biofilm as it formed and was then released back into the fracture as the biofilm deteriorated.</description>

   <description>Oxidative stress and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been implicated as potential mechanisms in valproic acid (VPA) teratogenicity.  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can target DNA to cause oxidative DNA damage and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) which can be repaired through homologous recombination (HR).  HR is not an error free process and can result in detrimental genetic changes.    In this present study we evaluated the role of HDAC inhibition in VPA-initiated HR.  HDAC inhibition may indirectly alter repair activity as a result of increased expression of genes involved in HR or indirectly by causing DNA damage which initiates repair.&#xd;
The first objective was to investigate the ability of VPA to cause HDAC inhibition in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 33 cell line. Using immunblotting, an increase in acetylated histone H3 and H4 protein levels was observed throughout 24 hr exposure to 5 mM VPA.  &#xd;
Secondly, to investigate whether VPA affects the activity of DNA DSB repair,  CHO 33 cells were transfected with either the endonuclease I-SceI plasmid to induce a site specific DSB or the empty plasmid, pGem.   However, no increase in the difference in HR between VPA and media exposed I-Sce1 transfected cells compared to cells transfected with pGem was observed, which suggests that VPA does not affect DNA repair activity.  &#xd;
Thirdly, to determine if VPA-induced HDAC inhibition increases susceptibility to DNA damage, immunocytochemistry revealed an increase in the number of γ-H2AX foci throughout 24 hr exposure to 5 mM VPA.  To determine if oxidative stress may play a role in mediating VPA-induced DNA DSBs, another recombination study was carried out in which cells were pretreated with 400 U/ml of PEG-catalase prior to VPA treatment.  The observed protective effect of PEG-catalase against VPA-induced HR and the generation of intracellular ROS by VPA suggest ROS may also play a role in VPA-initiated HR. However, in our DNA oxidation study, no increase in the oxidized nucleosides, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 5-hydroxycytosine was observed after VPA treatment.  These studies suggest that HDAC inhibition and ROS signalling may play other roles in DNA maintenance and cell cycle arrest in initiating DNA DSBs and HR repair.</description>

   <description>Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a human plasma-derived zymogen that is activated through proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin, or plasmin. Active TAFI attenuates fibrinolysis by removing carboxyl-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin, thereby inhibiting a potent positive feedback loop in the fibrinolytic cascade. In addition to the plasma pool of TAFI arising from expression in the liver, a distinct pool of TAFI has been reported to be present in platelets. While the antifibrinolytic effect of plasma-derived TAFI has been well-documented by in vitro and in vivo clot lysis assays, characterization of the platelet-derived form has been limited. Here, we not only confirm the presence of TAFI in the medium of washed, thrombin-stimulated platelets, but also that platelet-derived TAFI is capable of attenuating platelet-rich thrombus lysis in vitro independently of plasma TAFI using a novel thrombus lysis assay. Fluorescent thrombi were generated by suspending washed human platelets in plasma immunodepleted of TAFI containing fluorescently-labeled human fibrinogen such that the only TAFI present in the system was of platelet origin. Following platelet activation and clot retraction induced by thrombin, t-PA-dependent platelet-rich thrombus lysis was observed by removal of timed aliquots from the medium of retracted thrombi followed by measurement of fluorescence. When supplementary thrombomodulin was added to the thrombus medium, a 2.3-fold reduction in lysis rate was observed, indicating platelet-derived TAFI could attenuate the fibrinolytic cascade in vitro. Furthermore, when supplementary recombinant TAFI (rTAFI) was included in the medium, platelet-derived TAFI and rTAFI were observed to combine for greater inhibition of fibrinolysis. Taken together, these observations indicate that the secretion of platelet-derived TAFI can augment concentrations of TAFI already present in plasma to enhance attenuation of the fibrinolytic cascade. This could be significant at sites of vascular damage or regions of pathological thrombosis, where activated platelets are known to accumulate and secrete the contents of their granules. Finally, we have purified platelet-derived TAFI from platelet releasates for future characterization studies and mass spectrometry.</description>

   <description>Based on previous research on cultural differences in analytic and holistic reasoning, I hypothesized that when explaining events, North Americans would be more likely than East Asians to expect causes to resemble events with respect to magnitude (i.e., big events stem from big causes and small events stem from small causes). In addition, I hypothesized that these differences would be explained by cultural differences in the tendency to reason analytically or holistically. In a series of studies, Canadian and Chinese participants judged the likelihood that high or low magnitude events were caused by high or low magnitude causes. Events included a disease outbreak, a delay in a business negotiation, and damage caused by a tornado moving through a city. In two studies, participants from both cultural groups expected events and their causes to correspond in magnitude. More importantly, as hypothesized, Canadians expected events and their causes to correspond in magnitude to a greater degree than did Chinese. In a third study, I ruled out a potential alternative explanation that Chinese may have simply been exhibiting a response bias. In a fourth study, in support of my hypothesis that these cultural differences were due to differences in the reasoning styles of Canadians and Chinese, I found that Canadians primed to reason holistically expected less cause-effect magnitude correspondence than did those primed to reason analytically. These findings have important theoretical implications for the research literature on attributions and on cultural and social cognition, as well as practical implications in the context of judgment and decision making.</description>

   <description>Laser transmission welding of polymers is a relatively new joining technique. It is based on the fact that the majority of thermoplastics are transparent to infrared radiation. A laser beam passes through the transparent part, and is then absorbed by a part rendered absorbent by additives such as carbon black. Absorbed laser energy is transformed into heat that melts the polymer at the interface between two parts, thus forming a weld. &#xd;
	Many industrial applications have quite a complex geometry. This may often make it impossible to irradiate small elements of the joint interface directly. One of the possible solutions for this problem is to employ an oblique mirror to redirect a laser beam to the desired direction. In present work, transparent nylon tubes were welded to absorbing nylon plaques using a conical mirror inserted in the tube. The effects of the laser power, the angular motion speed, and the number of cycles on the joint shear strength were examined. Additionally, a two–dimensional axi-symmetric transient finite element heat transfer model was developed and evaluated. It simulated the temperature developed in the specimen during the welding cycle; the model was validated with the welding and mechanical testing results. &#xd;
The experimental results demonstrated good joint strength, confirming the feasibility of this technique. It was also found that welding at a lower laser beam power and a higher rotational speed allowed higher maximum weld strengths to be achieved at the expense of longer cycle time and higher energy consumption. Simulation of the temperature demonstrated that varying of the rotational speed at constant laser power does not change the overall temperature rise trend.</description>

   <description>This dissertation addresses the causes of&#xd;
and policy responses to the 1990s current account crises. The first chapter explores the relative importance of external shocks as key determinants of the significant increase of foreign reserves accumulated in many emerging market economies, and provides a comprehensive framework to assess the adequacy of reserve holdings. Using the case of Mexico, I find that more than two thirds of the increase in international reserves can be replicated by a linear combination of external shocks, without an abrupt regime shift after the Tequila crisis. I also find that Mexico has historically adopted an appropriate reserves policy, with 1994 being an exception. However, under the current reserves policy, there is a positive probability of a current account crisis in the near future. In chapter Two, I investigate the optimal reserves policy. The analysis predicts an optimal level of&#xd;
reserves in Mexico that is considerably higher than the actual level. When I account for the possibility of a bailout by the outside world in case of a crisis, Mexico's current reserves policy is in the range of my&#xd;
model's predictions.&#xd;
&#xd;
The final chapter proposes a new explanation for the existence and nature of sudden stops. In my model, a sudden stop forms a necessary solution to the moral hazard problem in investment and can be rationalized as part of an optimal lending strategy in the face of asymmetric&#xd;
information.</description>

   <description>A testing framework was developed to address system spatial and temporal performance characteristics in a two-dimensional (2D) human motion analysis system using commercially available digital video capture.  &#xd;
The first testing protocol involved developing a method to evaluate system spatial performance characteristics with respect to accuracy, precision, and resolution. A physical model comprising a calibration frame was constructed with phantom postures selected to represent joint angles and off-plane movement typical of the activities of interest.  This provided reference angles to which angles measured from digitally captured images were compared using the Bland and Altman method. Validation experiments confirmed that the principal sources of error were due to off-plane motion and pixel resolution in the video capture and analysis systems.  In these analyses, it was verified that simulated experimental conditions could be corrected using the direct linear transform (DLT); however, the removal of parallax still resulted in 2 degrees of error in measured joint angles.  The main source of error was resolution of the data acquisition system verified through Monte Carlo simulations.  &#xd;
The second testing protocol involved developing a simple method to determine the temporal accuracy of motion analysis systems incorporating digital video cameras and a pendulum.  A planar column pendulum with a natural frequency of 0.872 Hz was used to analyse five systems incorporating commercially available cameras and a single codec.  The frame rate for each camera was measured to be within 3% of the US National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) broadcasting digital video standard of 29.97 fps.; however some cameras produced a frame duplication artefact.  Least squares curve-fitting using a sinusoidal function revealed RMS differences between 3-5% for angular position and 5-15% for angular speed compared to the captured motion data.  It was shown that some digital-video cameras and computer playback software contain data compression technology that may produce substantial temporal frame inaccuracies in recovered video sequences and that temporal accuracy should be evaluated in digital-based human motion analysis systems prior to their use in experimentation.</description>

   <title>Effect of Texture on Anisotropic Thermal Creep of Pressurized Zr-2.5Nb Tubes</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-14 11:16:08.67</description>
   <description>Zr-2.5Nb is used as pressure-tube material in CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) reactors.  Under reactor operating conditions, pressure tubes undergo anisotropic dimensional changes, and thermal creep contributes to this deformation.  In a previous study, the limited textures available to Zr-2.5Nb significantly restricted the understanding of the relationship between texture and creep anisotropy.  Moreover, there has been no research performed to investigate textures and stress states simultaneously for this material, which would provide a valuable resource for developing creep anisotropy models and optimizing textures to improve creep resistance.&#xd;
&#xd;
Cold-worked Zr-2.5Nb fuel sheathing (FS) and micro pressure tubes (MPT) with various textures and microstructures were used as experimental materials.  The tubes were machined as thin-wall standard (ratio of axial to transverse stress  0.5) and end-loaded (ratio of axial to transverse stress = 0.25~0.75) capsules and were internally pressurized and sealed.  Stress and temperature dependence tests were performed on standard capsules under transverse stresses of 100~325MPa at 300~400°C to establish a regime in which dislocation glide is the likely strain producing mechanism.  An average stress exponent vaule of 6.4 was obtained, indicating that dislcation creep is the likely dominant mechanism.  Texture and stress state dependence tests were performed on standard and end-loaded capsules under a nominal transverse stress of 300MPa at 350°C.  It was evident that creep anisotropy strongly correlates with textures under different stress states.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A self-consistent polycrystalline model SELFPOLY7 based only upon crystallographic texture was employed to simulate the creep anisotropy of the tubes.  However, the model cannot fit all the experimental data well by using a uniform critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) ratio of the operating slip systems.  A modification was made, by taking into account the pre-existing dislocation distributions generated during cold work, and an improvement was achieved.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work provides a valuable resource for understanding the effect of texture, stress states and microstructure on anisotropic creep of cold-worked Zr-2.5Nb tubes.  The current research also provides a strategic direction to improve creep anisotropy predictions.  The large sets of experimental data supply a database to evaluate and develop improved models.</description>

   <title>Trunk Lean in Control and Osteoarthritic Gait</title>

   <description>Trunk lean over the stance limb during gait has been linked to a reduction in the knee adduction moment, which is associated with joint loading. Differences were examined in knee adduction moments and frontal plane trunk lean during gait between subjects with knee osteoarthritis and a control group of healthy adults. Additionally, subject variability in human motion data presents a challenge to researchers when trying to detect differences between subject groups. The individual differences in neutral posture between subjects is a source of variation in joint angles. A method was developed using principal component analysis (PCA) to objectively reduce this inter subject variability.&#xd;
Gait analysis was performed on 80 subjects (40 osteoarthritis). Models were developed to define lateral thoracic tilt, as well as pelvic tilt. The trunk and pelvis frontal plane angles were used to describe trunk lean and pelvic tilt. Angles were calculated across the stance phase of gait. We analyzed the data, (i) by extracting discrete parameters (mean and peak) waveform values, and (ii) using principal component analysis (PCA) to extract shape and magnitude differences between the waveforms.&#xd;
Osteoarthritis (OA) subjects had a higher knee adduction moment than the control group (α=0.05). Although the discrete parameters for trunk lean did not show differences between groups, PCA did detect characteristic waveform differences between the control and osteoarthritis groups. The data show that subjects display similar waveform shapes, however waveforms vary in magnitude, suggesting a variation in posture between subjects. The results from the PCA reveal that the first PC, which captures the most variation in the data, represents this variation in magnitude. The second PC describes a significant difference in range of motion between the subject groups.&#xd;
Subjects with knee OA were found to have a different range of motion of their pelvis and trunk than control subjects. These changes are consistent with a strategy to lower the knee adduction moment. As an alternative to conventional subjective methods, PCA should be employed to reduce inter subject variability in order to ensure objective analysis in human motion waveform data.</description>

   <description>This thesis analyses the function of the detective in Alfred Döblin’s Berlin Alexanderplatz. I argue that the modernist metropolis Berlin challenges the way in which crimes are solved by complicating the process of identifying those responsible for them.  The ambivalence of life makes it impossible to get to the truth of crime. This ambivalence, partly created by the urban context, leads to the reinvention of the role of the detective. No longer located in the individual, the function of the detective is shared among author, narrator, protagonist, reader, and the city, whereby the protagonist Franz Biberkopf (on the intra-textual level) and the reader (on the extra-textual level) are the major players. However, neither Biberkopf nor the reader succeeds in this process, but are forced to accept the solution suggested by the text.  The thesis adopts a narratological approach in analysing the narrative processes of veiling and unveiling facts and circumstances. It demonstrates how Biberkopf’s specific perception of urban space and his attempt to give it a particular shape in his imagination, as well as the complex relationship of story and discourse in the novel, contribute to the obfuscation of fact and fiction.</description>

   <description>Image-guided interventions using intraoperative three-dimensional (3D) imaging can be&#xd;
less cumbersome than systems dependent on preoperative images, especially by needing&#xd;
neither image-to-patient registration nor a lengthy process of segmenting and generating&#xd;
a 3D model. In this dissertation, a method for computer-assisted surgery using direct&#xd;
navigation on intraoperative images is presented. In this system the registration step of&#xd;
a navigated procedure was divided into two stages: preoperative calibration of images to&#xd;
a ceiling-mounted optical tracking system, and intraoperative tracking during acquisition&#xd;
of the 3D image. The preoperative stage used a custom-made multi-modal calibrator that&#xd;
could be optically tracked and also contained fiducial spheres for radiological detection; a&#xd;
robust registration algorithm was used to compensate for the high false-detection rate that&#xd;
arose from the optical light-emitting diodes. Intraoperatively, a tracking device was at-&#xd;
tached to bone models that were also instrumented with radio-opaque spheres; a calibrated&#xd;
pointer was used to contact the latter spheres as a validation. The fiducial registration error&#xd;
of the calibration stage was approximately 0.1 mm with the Innova 3D X-ray fluoroscope&#xd;
and 0.7 mm with the mobile-gantry CT scanner. The target registration error in the valida-&#xd;
tion stage was approximately 1.2 mm with the Innova 3D X-ray fluoroscope and 1.8 mm&#xd;
with the mobile-gantry CT scanner. These findings suggest that direct registration can be a&#xd;
highly accurate means of performing image-guided interventions in a fast, simple manner.</description>

   <description>A series of phenanthrene and oxidized phenanthrene derivatives with typical substitution patterns, 1.31, 1.32, 2.30a-f, 3.1a,b and (-)-4.1 have been synthesized as liquid crystal cores by a combined Directed ortho Metalation (DoM), cross coupling and Directed Remote Metalation (DreM) strategy. The synthetic methodology employed allowed variation of the tail and core structures, for the preparation of a new smectic liquid crystal compound (1.32), a homologous series of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-9,10-diones (2.30a-f), a diastereomeric trans-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-9,10-diol (1.31), two enantiomeric 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-9,10-diones (R)-3.1a-b) and an enantiomeric 9,10-dihydro-9,10-dimethylphenanthrene-9,10-diol ((-)-4.1). &#xd;
Polarized microscopic and differential scanning calorimetric measurements suggest that 1.31 forms a large range of SmC phase, ca. 100 ºC, followed by a small range of nematic phase, ca. 10 ºC; the 2.30a-f series show similar mesogenic properties, but with the extension of the length of a side chain from six carbons to eleven carbons, the nematic phase has disappeared (in the cases of 2.30a-c).&#xd;
Although (R)-3.1a-b and (-)-4.1 are not liquid crystals, they show ferroelectric induction by doping, in the amount of ca. 5 mol%, into unchiral liquid crystal hosts PhB, DFT, PhP1, NCB76 and 2.30f. However, due to the detection limit of the instrument, i.e., ca. 0.5 nC/cm2, the spontaneous polarizations (Ps) induced could not be measured.</description>

   <description>Little is known regarding the neurophysiological mechanisms by which the neuropeptide prokineticin 2 (PK2) regulates circadian rhythms. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, we have investigated a potential role for regulation of neuronal excitability by PK2 on neurons of the area postrema (AP), a medullary structure known to influence autonomic processes in the central nervous system. &#xd;
&#xd;
In current-clamp recordings, focal application of 1µM PK2 reversibly influenced the excitability of the majority of dissociated AP cells tested, producing both depolarizations (38%) and hyperpolarizations (28%) in a concentration-dependent manner. Slow voltage ramps and ion substitution experiments revealed a PK2-induced Cl- current was responsible for membrane depolarization, while hyperpolarizations were the result of inhibition of an inwardly rectifying non-selective cation current. In contrast to these differential effects on membrane potential, nearly all neurons that displayed spontaneous activity responded to PK2 with a decrease in spike frequency. These observations are in accordance with voltage-clamp experiments showing that PK2 caused a leftward shift in Na+ channel activation and inactivation gating. &#xd;
&#xd;
Lastly, using post hoc single cell RT-PCR technology, we have shown that 7 out of 10 AP neurons depolarized by PK2 were enkephalin-expressing cells. The observed actions on enkephalin neurons indicate PK2 may have specific inhibitory actions on this population of neurons in the AP acting to reduce their sensitivity to incoming signals. These data suggest that PK2 regulates the level of AP neuronal excitability and may impart a circadian influence on AP autonomic control.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research program was to examine how attachment anxiety and rejection interact to influence intentions and attitudes toward having unprotected sexual intercourse. I hypothesized that women who were high in attachment anxiety would hold weaker intentions to use a condom and would have more negative attitudes toward condoms than would women who were low in attachment anxiety. Moreover, I predicted that these expected main effects of anxiety on intentions and attitudes would interact with rejection, such that the association between high anxiety and both weak intentions and negative attitudes would be exacerbated among women that were exposed to a rejection-salient condition. I explored the interaction of interest in the context of specific romantic partner rejection (Study One) as well as general social rejection from peers (Study Two). In Study One, I manipulated potential partner rejection and found that attachment anxiety and rejection condition interacted to influence intentions to engage in unprotected sex. In the rejection condition, attachment anxiety was marginally positively related to intentions whereas in the non-rejection condition, attachment anxiety was marginally negatively related to intentions. Upon further investigation of this same interaction, I found that among women who were high in attachment anxiety, rejection condition did not significantly impact intention ratings. However, among women who were low in attachment anxiety, those who were rejected reported significantly weaker intentions to engage in unprotected sex than those who were not rejected. Attitudes toward condoms were not influenced by the interaction between attachment anxiety and rejection condition. In Study Two, I manipulated general social rejection and found that the intentions results from Study One were not replicated, as general social rejection and attachment anxiety did not interact to influence intentions to engage in unprotected sex. Once again, attitudes toward condoms were not influenced by this interaction. Explanations for the findings of Study One and Study Two are explored and implications of both studies’ findings for the literature on condom use and for sexual health promotion are discussed.</description>

   <title>The mexCD-oprJ multidrug efflux operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: regulation by the NfxB-like novel regulator PA4596 and envelope stress</title>

   <description>Expression of the mexCD-oprJ multidrug efflux operon is enhanced by the presence of membrane damaging agents [e.g., the biocide chlorhexidine (Chx)] or mutations in the nfxB gene encoding a repressor of efflux gene expression, both dependent on the AlgU envelope stress response sigma factor. Details of mexCD-oprJ regulation are, however, lacking. In examining the mexCD-oprJ locus, a gene, PA4596, encoding a homologue of NfxB (61% identity) was identified downstream of oprJ, a location conserved in all sequenced Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in Pseudomonas putida. Opposite to mexCD-oprJ, PA4596 expression was reduced by Chx exposure, as assessed using RT-PCR; although like mexCD-oprJ, this was AlgU-dependent (i.e., lost in a ΔalgU strain). Deletion of PA4596 had no impact on Chx resistance indicating that it is not required for Chx-inducible mexCD-oprJ expression/ MexCD-OprJ-dependent Chx resistance. In contrast, mexCD-oprJ expression and the attendant multidrug resistance of nfxB deletion mutants were compromised upon deletion of PA4596, indicating that PA4596 plays a positive role in mexCD-oprJ expression in such mutants. Consistent with this, PA4596 expression increased in nfxB deletion and missense mutants in parallel with mexCD-oprJ. Intriguingly, mexCD-oprJ expression and multidrug resistance were observed in a mutant lacking an nfxB mutation (demonstrating an NfxB-like phenotype) and in an nfxB missense mutant and these were not compromised upon deletion of PA4596. Thus, mexCD-oprJ hyperexpression can be both PA4596-dependent and -independent. A bacterial 2-hybrid assay revealed a PA4596-PA4596 interaction, consistent with the protein forming dimers as NfxB has been shown to do. Two-hybrid assays also demonstrated that NfxB and PA4596 interact. While the functional significance of this remains to be elucidated, it is consistent with their common role in regulating mexCD-oprJ expression and is suggestive of a complex and possibly novel regulatory mechanism. These data highlight the complexity of mexCD-oprJ regulation and the apparently multiple pathways to efflux gene expression, suggestive of multiple roles for this efflux system in P. aeruginosa independent of antimicrobial efflux.</description>

   <description>Few research studies have examined female sexual offending. Furthermore, most of what we know about sexual offending is based on male perpetrators. Our conceptions of female criminals who act outside their designated sexual scripts are formed by prevailing stereotypes of femininity. This research expands the available literature in the field of sexual offending, while examining how women are constituted when it comes to female child sexual offending. I conduct a critical discourse analysis of court transcripts and electronic news articles of cases involving women as child sexual perpetrators. Three criminal cases are examined from Wisconsin, U.S. &#xd;
&#xd;
The goal is to examine whether, and through what processes, traditional sexual scripts are discursively reproduced in court proceedings and media reporting of female sexual offending. Two cases reveal that women who adhere to their expected sexual scripts despite having committed a sexual offense receive sympathetic responses from legal officials and news journalists. The legal and media responses also ensure these women are able to continue their expected roles as women during and following sentencing. On the other hand, one case reveals that women who overtly contravene their expected gender scripts are legally and morally condemned. The call for strict punishment centred upon removing the female offender’s ability to participate in motherhood, because of the offender’s contravention of expected gender scripts by sexually offending against her own children. Furthermore, the male co-offender in this latter case was not deemed to have contravened his sexual scripts, resulting in less social condemnation. Overall, this thesis demonstrates discursive maneuvering that occurs in female sexual offender cases, in which legal officials and news journalists justify offenses based on prevailing notions of femininity.</description>

   <description>This thesis examined the biological treatment of gas streams containing benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene (BTEX) using solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioscrubbers (SL-TPPBs).  SL-TPPBs consist of a cell containing aqueous phase and a polymeric solid phase that sequesters poorly water soluble and/or toxic substrates, mitigating substrate toxicity in the aqueous phase and improving the gas mass transfer during treatment of VOC contaminated gases.  &#xd;
An initial investigation of oxygen transport determined that the polymers in a stirred-tank SL-TPPB enhance gas-liquid mass transfer.  In addition, a study on biodegradation kinetics of BTEX by a bacterial consortium identified and quantified substrate interactions such as inhibition, enhancement and cometabolism.  The stirred-tank SL-TPPB was then experimentally investigated for treatment of BTEX gas streams during steady-state and dynamic step-change operation to determine performance of the system relative to other biotreatment methods.  A mathematical model was developed to predict system performance, which included the microbial kinetic model structure and parameters estimated during kinetic and oxygen mass transfer studies. &#xd;
As a less energy intensive alternative, an airlift SL-TPPB was operated and characterized.  The airlift SL-TPPB was compared to an airlift liquid-liquid TPPB (silicone oil as sequestering phase) and a single phase airlift over dynamic step-change loadings, which showed that the airlift SL-TPPB outperformed the single phase airlift by >30% and had similar performance to the liquid-liquid airlift.  However, the airlift SL-TPPB performance was lower relative to the stirred-tank SL-TPPB by >15%.  Steady-state operation of the airlift SL-TPPB identified a range of operating conditions that provided maximum performance and conditions that were not oxygen limited.  This prompted a study of oxygen mass transfer and hydrodynamics in the airlift system, which identified that the addition of polymers to an airlift does not cause physical enhancement of the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient, but improves aqueous phase mixing and enhances overall oxygen transfer rate.  A tanks-in-series mathematical model was formulated to predict performance of the airlift SL-TPPB, wherein the number of tanks-in-series to describe mixing in the airlift was obtained from a residence time distribution analysis of the airlift system completed during the hydrodynamic investigation.  This thesis contributes a low-energy solution for the effective treatment of gases contaminated with BTEX.</description>

   <description>Biological beliefs posit that biological predispositions can sufficiently explain and predict human characteristics, behaviors, or other phenomena (e.g., Paul carries a gene for athletic abilities; he will become good at sports when he grows up.) In two studies consisting scenarios on a variety of developmental domains, participants from Canada and China evaluated the likelihood that a specific trait would develop in a character after reading about the genetic background of that individual. Results showed that, compared to Chinese, Canadians were more likely to rely on biological information in their developmental predictions. Some correlational evidence was found between participants’ biological beliefs and their scores on the Belief in Genetic Determinism Scale. These findings were consistent with past cultural research on causal attributions, perception of change, and beliefs in effort and persistence.</description>

   <description>Determining if an athlete, who has had Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery, is ready to return to sport is a difficult clinical decision, partially due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. Since there is a risk of re-injury post-surgery, medical teams need to be cautious. However, athletes who are perceived to be ready to return to sport do not necessarily do so. Some leave sport altogether while others return to a lower competition level. As psychological thoughts and emotions are relevant to athletes’ injury experiences, a psychological component, such as sport confidence, needs to be thoughtfully considered during the return to sport process. Our objectives were to develop the relationship between drop vertical jump (DVJ) performance and physical attributes in young healthy adults and to then apply this relationship to ACL participants. Another objective was to see if the relationship is improved by including confidence (determined from a survey). It was hypothesized that including confidence will predict the ACL participants’ DVJ performance more precisely.&#xd;
Thirty-five participants were in the control group with thirteen participants in the ACL group. All were recreationally active and all had the following anthropometric and performance measurements recorded: height, weight, calf and thigh girth, knee angle, leg dominance, percent body fat, skeletal muscle mass, anaerobic power, balance, and drop vertical jump height. The ACL group also completed a confidence survey. Regression analyses were performed.&#xd;
The results showed that anaerobic power and relative skeletal muscle mass were significant predictors of DVJ performance; however, DVJ performance could not be predicted precisely. The analysis was also carried out by gender. No significant predictors for male’s DVJ performance were found while the significant predictors for female’s DVJ performance were weight, power and knee extension angle. Once again, DVJ performance could not be precisely predicted. On the other hand, results showed that power could be more precisely predicted by body weight than could DVJ performance.</description>

   <description>Introduction:  Soft Tissue Injuries (STIs) of the shoulder are common presentations to the Emergency Department but very little is known about the natural history, long-term disability or prognostic factors associated with these injuries.  The goals of this pilot study are to describe the three-month outcome of these injuries, to begin to identify prognostic factors associated with poor outcome and to determine the feasibility of a future study aimed at predicting poor outcome.&#xd;
Methods:  A cohort of 117 working-age adults presenting to the Emergency Department with acute STIs of the shoulder were prospectively recruited.  Patients were interviewed by phone at one week, one month and three months.  During the calls, patients completed the Disabilities of the Arm and Shoulder (DASH) questionnaire and provided information about treatments and follow-up that had occurred.&#xd;
Results:  Of the 117 subjects, 72.3% had pain and disability above the population norm at one month and that number only decreased to 38.7% at three months.  A substantial effect was also seen on Work and Leisure activities.  The following prognostic factors were identified as having some association with poor three-month outcome: age, mechanism of injury, ability to rotate arm and abduct arm in ED, pain at one week, whether the injury was work-related, visit with family physician in first week and DASH score (disability) at one week.&#xd;
Conclusions:  At the present time, the emergency physician must treat patients with STIs of the shoulder without any substantial knowledge of the morbidity that these injuries cause, which patients are at high risk of poor outcome or what would constitute optimum management.  This study has determined that poor outcome is common and it has begun to identify factors that can help predict which patients will have a more complicated course.  As it is now felt that the transition from acute to chronic pain begins well before three months, it will be important for future studies to develop a method of early identification of patients at high risk of poor outcome and to determine effective management in an attempt to prevent that transition.</description>

   <title>Role of hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in tumour immune escape</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-19 21:09:13.707</description>
   <description>Previous studies revealed that, upon exposure to hypoxia, tumour cells acquire resistance to the cytolytic activity of IL-2-activated lymphocytes. The MHC class I chain-related (MIC) molecules – comprised of MICA and MICB – are ligands for the activating NKG2D receptor on Natural Killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. MIC-NKG2D interactions lead to the activation of NK and CD8+ T cells and the subsequent lysis of the tumour cells. The study also showed that the mechanism of the hypoxia-mediated immune escape involves the shedding of MIC, specifically MICA, from the tumour cell surface. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the shedding of MICA requires the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that regulates cellular adaptations to hypoxia. Exposure to hypoxia (0.5% O2 vs. 20% O2) led to the shedding of MIC from the surface of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and DU-145 human prostate cancer cells as determined by flow cytometry. Knockdown of HIF-1α mRNA using siRNA technology resulted in inhibition of HIF-1α accumulation under hypoxic conditions as determined by Western blot analysis. Parallel study revealed that knockdown of HIF-1α also blocked the shedding of MICA from the surface of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia. These results indicate that HIF-1 is required for the hypoxia-mediated shedding of MICA and, consequently, that HIF-1 may play an important role in tumour immune escape. Ongoing studies aim to determine the HIF-1 target genes involved in the shedding of MICA under hypoxia.</description>

   <description>This dissertation uses psychoanalytic theory to examine the similar portrayals of monstrous femininity in two Middle English poems, Robert Henryson’s the Testament of Cresseid and the Awntyrs off Arthure. In the Testament, Cresseid’s leprosy is interpreted through Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection, suggesting that Cresseid experiences the abject to create a new identity as a leper. Rather than view Cresseid’s dream as an assembly of very real divinities who pass judgment over her sleeping body, I interpret the dream in a strictly physiological sense, arguing that Cresseid not only creates the judgment from her own conflicted psychology, but actively shapes her own destiny. Cresseid’s disease does not annihilate her identity, but gives her a significant position in society, because her status as a leper facilitates the economy of salvation. I continue with Kristeva’s theory to understand the characterization of the grotesque corpse of Gaynour’s mother in the Awntyrs off Arthure. Her rotting body is doubly abject, both as a corpse and a mother. While abjection provides a useful opening for discussing the portraits of Gaynour and her mother, Kristeva’s theory does not consider all women in the text, and only confirms misogynist stereotypes. To supplement Kristeva, I use Slavoj Žižek’s interpretation of Jacques Lacan’s theory of desire to illuminate the text as a whole, and explain the role of the corpse in shaping the narrative.</description>

   <description>Malaria poses a serious threat to much of the developing world and an enormous effort is under way to design vaccines and other novel interventions. Nevertheless, we understand very little about the ecology and evolution of malaria parasites. For instance, while scientists have had considerable success identifying factors involved in regulating parasite growth within hosts, it is extremely hard to disentangle the relative inﬂuences of host immunity and other within-host factors on infection dynamics. Many mathematical models have been directed at understanding the dynamics of malaria infections, and these have provided valuable insights. However, these models have also been criticized, most notably for lacking any statistical analysis of the goodness of ﬁt of model predictions to data. Here, we develop a new modeling approach that improves on previous work, and apply it &#xd;
to a novel data set from a simpliﬁed rodent malaria system. We ﬁnd that resource availability and competition are important drivers of dynamics, and we identify a number of parasite traits that may underlie differences in virulence between parasite strains. These include the number of progeny parasites produced per infected cell (burst size) and the invasion rates of target cells. We test these predictions with further experiments and ﬁnd broad support for the role of burst sizes in determining virulence, but the role of invasion rates is less certain. We also ﬁnd evidence of potential plasticity in these parasite traits in response to within-host environmental factors. These within-host interactions between parasites and hosts have effects that will scale up to between-host processes; we discuss the growing body of theory that seeks to combine these levels (‘embedded models’). Using between-host and embedded models, we test the plausibility of various hypotheses to explain why there are so few transmissible malaria parasite forms, yet vast numbers of host-damaging asexual forms are produced. We show that a speciﬁc form of density-dependent transmission-blocking immunity and the occurrence of multiple infections can each generate selection for this pattern. Overall, this thesis contributes to a better under- &#xd;
standing of malaria parasites, while providing a framework for addressing unanswered questions in disease biology, and offering interesting paths for future empirical work.</description>

   <description>Urban spaces are an increasingly common indigenous reality, and while urban spaces often&#xd;
involve great social and geographic distances from traditional communities, many urban&#xd;
populations have built vibrant communities in cities. This thesis will examine the creation of&#xd;
Métis cultural spaces in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as a community building strategy. It is situated in&#xd;
thirteen in-depth interviews with Métis community builders conducted in Winnipeg over the&#xd;
Summer of 2008. The Winnipeg Metis community is rhizomatic in makeup, situated not in&#xd;
geographic locations, but in the networks of instantaneous and spontaneous social interaction of&#xd;
community members and institutions—elders, political organizations and governance structures.&#xd;
Rhizomatic space is a form of social organization, which emerges out of everyday social life, and&#xd;
because it is only observable during the brief instances of human interaction, it is nearly invisible&#xd;
to outsiders and thus difficult to colonize. It is also a primary means by which Métis people are&#xd;
reclaiming space in their traditional homeland on the Red River. This paper theorizes an&#xd;
alternative tactic to resistance through a decentered form of political organization, grounded in&#xd;
the community and its organic institutions. It proposes that the everyday creation of social and&#xd;
cultural spaces in urban centres is an effective way to build urban indigenous communities with&#xd;
minimal interference or involvement of the State, and that this develops more or less organically&#xd;
without the need for bureaucratic oversight. The paper concludes that the everyday creation of&#xd;
rhizomatic space is a highly effective means of community building and resistance.</description>

   <description>After over 20 years of excavation at Humayma, ancient Hawara, in southern Jordan, an immense spectrum of occupation has become evident, particularly from the Nabataean period in the first century BCE to the early Islamic period in the eighth century CE.  This study of Field E121 focuses on three structures uncovered in the Roman period vicus, the civilian settlement adjacent to the Roman fort: a built platform, a stone structure and an animal pen.  These structures suggest occupation from the second to fourth century CE, north of the known vicus center and west of the Roman fort.  &#xd;
Prior to this study, E121 had not been published although excavation was conducted on it in 1995.  As a result, this study is the presentation and interpretation of all material relating to the previous excavation as well as the recently conducted 2008 excavation season.  This thesis is a discussion of the excavation, phasing and possible functions of each structure and of how they fit into the greater local vicus context.  E121 was chosen for excavation after a 13 year hiatus because numismatic and ceramic evidence all pointed to a later construction in this northern sector of the vicus, which made it unique among the known vicus structures.  The fourth century CE has been largely unrepresented in the vicus’ archaeological record making E121 important for gathering data concerning civilian and military interactions during the Early Byzantine period.  &#xd;
	Excavations at E121, despite heavy deterioration, reuse and robbing of its structures, have produced a wide array of cultural material relating to fourth century CE as well as the earlier vicus occupation.  This evidence partially fills in the gap of fourth century CE occupation at the site and has provided new direction for future fourth century CE vicus excavation efforts.  More specifically, E121 produced evidence for Roman construction in the vicus through the platform, stone architecture through the adjacent structure and a possible first indication of site orientation related to the Nabataean period.</description>

   <description>Current copper deposits contain significant amounts of secondary non-sulphide minerals and newly discovered deposits are increasingly complex.  As a result, research into the improvement of sulphide-oxide copper ores processing through the use of mixed collector systems has surged. The flotation of a natural porphyry copper ore with bornite and malachite was investigated via fundamental work with pure minerals and a bench-scale testing regime. The processing of the test ore was problematic due to a mineral assemblage that caused prevalent slime generation. &#xd;
Fundamental adsorption, micro-flotation and Eh-pH tests were conducted on pure minerals to investigate mineral-collector behaviours. PAX and hydroxamate form multiple collector layers on malachite and bornite, with malachite and hydroxamate exhibiting the highest adsorption density. The effective pH range of the collectors was pH 8-10 where the collector species, according to equilibrium species distribution diagrams, were Cu(HXM)2 (aq) and CuEX (s) for hydroxamate and xanthate respectively. &#xd;
 A Box-Behnken response surface design was used to determine collector dosages that provide an optimum flotation response for the natural ore. The collectors were: potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), Cytec Promoter 6494 hydroxamate and DETA. The copper recovery, malachite recovery, minor copper recovery and copper grade responses were optimized using JMP statistical software. Indicators of model inadequacies were noted but since the models predicted sensible solutions, inaccurate test ratios and un-modeled effects were hypothesized to be the source of the inadequacies. The model predicted 98 % copper recovery using 202.7g/t PAX, 674.99 g/t hydroxamate and 61.9 g/t DETA. The copper grade model predicted an the overall copper grade of 19% using  with 0 g/t PAX, 167 g/t hydroxamate and 101 g/t DETA.</description>

   <description>Background: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in all segments of our society. While research exists on the physical consequences of obesity, the social implications of childhood obesity require study. Those who are obese are visibly different from their peers and are more likely to experience physical and verbal abuse when compared with their normal weight peers.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The objectives of the two studies comprising this thesis were to examine, 1) the temporal sequence between adiposity class and bullying involvement, and, 2) to determine whether the relationship between adiposity class and weapon carrying is mediated by bullying.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Objective 1. Participants were administered the Health Behaviour in School-Age Children Survey (HBSC) in 2006 and 2007. Study outcomes were self reports of: 1) physical bullying victimization and perpetration, and 2) relational bullying victimization and perpetration. Relationships between adiposity and the four forms of bullying were investigated in separate analyses using a repeated measures design. Objective 2. A cross-sectional analysis of the health experiences of 7877 Canadian children (11-15 years) using the 2006 HBSC survey was conducted. Relationships between adiposity status and weapon carrying were evaluated using multi-level logistic regression. Mediation by bullying involvement was assessed using standard methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Objective 1. Adiposity class was shown to precede bullying involvement, with obese males reporting 2-fold increases in both physical and relational victimization, while obese females reported 3-fold increases in perpetration of relational bullying. Objective 2. Results suggest that overweight and obese males report increased odds of weapon carrying compared to their normal weight peers. Among obese males, partial mediation of this relationship was observed by acts of: physical victimization, relational victimization and physical perpetration. No such relationships were observed among female students. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Objective 1. Our study demonstrates the importance of adiposity status as a determinant of poor interpersonal relationships. These findings are congruent with previous cross-sectional studies, and confirm that obese youths are at increased risk of social consequences attributable to their appearance. Objective 2. Overweight and obese male students appear to be more likely to carry weapons for defensive and offensive purposes, a behavior mediated in part by bullying involvement.</description>

   <description>Professional development has been recognized as one of the most promising and powerful routes to teachers’ professional growth and job satisfaction, yet current research challenges many of the traditional approaches widely used today. As an alternative, research has advocated for contextually anchored and collaborative models of professional development. Before any judgments on the relative power and usefulness of these approaches can be made, descriptions of how and where these models might work are necessary. In this thesis I describe a study that examines the viability of peer observation as a form of job-embedded professional learning for secondary teachers. &#xd;
A qualitative design was employed to capture and communicate the experiences of five teachers as they participated in peer observation of teaching. Data collection techniques included: (a) individual interviews before and after participation in the study, (b) group interviews during the peer observation cycles (pre- and post-observation meetings and debriefing sessions), and (c) written artifacts in the form of participant observation records and a researcher log. &#xd;
Most of the previous research investigating the effectiveness of peer observation as a form of professional development has been conducted at the post-secondary level. The experiences of the teachers in this study support those findings and extend them to the secondary level. Although the approach taken by the two groups were significantly different, peer observation was found to promote professional growth by promoting: (a) pedagogical knowledge; (b) professional dialogue; (c) skill development, specifically inquiry skills and reflective practice; (d) contextualized learning; and (e) collegiality and collaboration.&#xd;
This study contributes to our understanding of the potential for professional growth resulting from participation in peer observation. It also contributes to the body of Canadian educational research on professional development while providing empirical research relating to the effectiveness of peer observation at the secondary level. Finally, this study makes recommendations for future research addressing the role of the facilitator and some of the challenges and barriers teachers may experience during the peer observation process.</description>

   <description>This work describes the research conducted in the quest for designing better software for discrete-event system (DES) control. The think-aloud data from an exploratory observational study of solving DES control problems contributed to the formulation of a list of recommendations on how to design and improve DES software. These observations, together with other relevant research, led to the proposal of a novel approach to DES problem solving, namely, the template design methodology. This methodology does not require the introduction of new control theory; it is rather an reinterpretation of the existing modelling framework. Software supporting this methodology was implemented and subsequently evaluated using twelve subjects. Significant improvements in the speed of problem solving as well as positive evaluations by the subjects were observed. The usability data do not show any drawbacks to applying the methodology.</description>

   <title>A Speech Enhancement System Based on Statistical and Acoustic-Phonetic Knowledge</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-24 21:32:48.966</description>
   <description>Noise reduction aims to improve the quality of noisy speech by suppressing the background noise in the signal. However, there is always a tradeoff between noise reduction and signal distortion--more noise reduction is always accompanied by more signal distortion. An evaluation of the intelligibility of speech processed by several noise reduction algorithms in [23] showed that most noise reduction algorithms were not successful in improving the intelligibility of noisy speech. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we aim to utilize acoustic-phonetic knowledge to enhance the intelligibility of noise-reduced speech. Acoustic-phonetics studies the characteristics of speech and the acoustic cues that are important for speech intelligibility. We considered the following questions: what is the noise reduction algorithm that we should use, what are the acoustic cues that should be targeted, and how to incorporate this information into the design of the noise reduction system.&#xd;
&#xd;
A Bayesian noise reduction method similar to the one proposed by Ephraim and Malah in [16] is employed. We first evaluate the goodness-of-fit of several parametric PDF models to the empirical speech data. For classified speech, we find that the Rayleigh and Gamma. with a fixed shape parameter of 5, model the speech spectral amplitude equally well. The Gamma-MAP and Gamma-MMSE estimators are derived. The subjective and objective performances of these estimators are then compared.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also propose to apply a class-based cue-enhancement, similar to those performed in [21]. The processing directly manipulates the acoustic cues known to be important for speech intelligibility. We assume that the system has the sound class information of the input speech. The scheme aims to enhance the interclass and intraclass distinction of speech sounds. The intelligibility of speech processed by the proposed system is then compared to the intelligibility of speech processed by the Rayleigh-MMSE estimator [16]&#xd;
&#xd;
The intelligibility evaluation shows that the proposed scheme enhances the detection of plosive and fricative sounds. However, it does not help in the intraclass discrimination of plosive sounds, and more tests need to be done to evaluate whether intraclass discrimination of fricatives is improved. The proposed scheme deteriorates the detection of nasal and affricate sounds.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, three low-noise active mixing circuits are presented in CMOS technology. Mixers can be found at the front-end of almost every communication systems. However, despite many advantages the active mixers have, one drawback is their poor noise performance. One mixer that has been widely used in integrated circuit is the Gilbert cell. This thesis demonstrated that by merging the low-noise amplifier (LNA) with the Gilbert cell, a low-noise active mixer can be realized. This kind of mixer relaxes the front-end design, allows higher circuit integration, and reduces power consumption. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first circuit is a narrowband low-noise mixer that operates at 5.4 GHz in 0.18 um CMOS. An inductive degenerated LNA is used as the transconductor. Together with a current bleeding circuit, a gain of 13.1 dB and a low 7.8 dB single-sideband noise figure are achieved. The circuit was fabricated and measured. Simulation and measurement results are compared and discussed.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second circuit is a broadband low-noise mixer that operates between 1 and 5.5 GHz in 0.13 um CMOS. The noise-cancelling technique is used to design the transconductors. This technique does not require the use of inductors while able to achieve a sub 3 dB noise figure and input matching over a large bandwidth. To further extend the mixer bandwidth, the series inductive peaking was used. Measured and simulated results showed great agreement. It has a high gain of 17.5 dB, a bandwidth of 4.5 GHz, and a low average double-sideband noise figure of 3.9 dB. This mixer has the best broadband noise performance ever reported in CMOS.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, a double-balanced low-noise self-oscillating mixer (SOM) in 0.13 um CMOS is presented. This is a current-reuse, highly integrated circuit that combines an LNA, mixer, and oscillator seamlessly into a single component. The oscillator generates the required LO while serving as the mixer load simultaneously. Measured and simulated results showed excellent agreement. A low double-sideband noise figure of 4.4 dB and a gain of 11.6 dB were measured. This type of SOM and loading structure are the first ever reported.</description>

   <description>Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) have been shown to be important in regulating metabolism during hypoxia in mammals.  However, the role of MCTs in hypoxic survival in lower vertebrates is currently unclear.  The goal of this study was to investigate the coordination of MCTs along with other metabolic proteins during hypoxia.  Therefore, we subjected zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 1.5 mg L-1 O2 over 48 and 96-hr and measured tissue-specific transcriptional changes of MCTs (1, 2 and 4), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHa), citrate synthase (CS), and other metabolic proteins using real-time RT-PCR.  There were no changes in mRNA in muscle at 48 and 96-hr.  &#xd;
When data from both time points were pooled in brain, a significant increase was found in MCT4 (+102%) and LDHa (+28%) mRNA indicating a preference towards glycolysis.  In gills, there were increases in LDHa at 48-hr (+101%) and MCT1 (+24%) mRNA from pooled data suggesting that both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism is being utilized.  Heart had the greatest changes in transcriptional levels compared to other tissues. At 48-hr, increases were found in MCT1 (+117%), MCT4 (+86%), LDHa (+197%), and pooled data showed an increase in CS (+18%) mRNA.  These results indicate that the influx and efflux of lactate are both employed as strategies in cardiac tissue during hypoxia.  This study has shown that fish utilize tissue-specific regulation of MCTs along with other metabolic genes during hypoxia.</description>

   <description>Impulsivity and stress are two of the most important determinants of drug addiction in that both factors predict the initiation and maintenance of drug use, as well as relapse to drug taking following abstinence. Despite this combined influence, the interaction between stress and impulsivity has never been examined systematically in animal models of addiction. The objective of the current study is to examine the role of acute stress on two different measures of impulsivity in rats: the Go/No-go test measures motor impulsivity, and the Delayed Reinforcement Paradigm measures cognitive impulsivity.  To determine whether a 1 hr restraint stress is physiologically stressful, blood samples from rats in Experiment 1 were taken at 5 different sampling points: baseline (0 min), reactivity (15 and 60 min) and recovery (100 and 180 min). In Experiments 2 and 3, rats were tested in either the Go/No-go test or the Delayed Reinforcement test immediately following 1 hr of restraint stress. Results from Experiment 1 show that 1 hr of restraint stress increased plasma corticosterone concentrations at 15 min and 60 min; corticosterone concentrations returned to baseline levels by 100 min. Following stress, the percentage of Go interval responding was not altered during Go/No-go testing (Experiment 2), nor were there changes in the indifference point values during Delayed Reinforcement testing (Experiment 3). These results suggest that 1 hr of acute stress does not increase either motor or cognitive impulsivity, and stress may influence addiction via mechanisms that are independent of impulsivity.</description>

   <description>Experiments have demonstrated that DNA molecules can compute like a machine to&#xd;
solve mathematical problems, which is significant because of their parallel computation ability. However, due to the nature of biochemical reactions, DNA computation suffers from errors, which are its main limitation. The abstract and kinetic Tile Assembly Models are now commonly used to simulate real DNA computing experiments, and to look for new methods to advance the accuracy of DNA-based computation. One means of controlling errors is through proofreading tile sets. Several such tile sets have been proposed in the literature, such as Chen and Goel’s snaked proofreading tile sets, the 2-way and 3-way overlay tile sets of Reif et al., and Rothemund and Cook’s n-way overlay tile sets.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the first part of this thesis, we analyze the performance of the Rothemund-Cook&#xd;
n-way overlay tile sets. We prove that the n-way overlay tile set contains n^2+3n+4&#xd;
rule tiles. Simulation results show that these tile sets clearly perform better than&#xd;
tile sets without any error-control mechanism, and the performance improves as n&#xd;
increases. It is also proved that the error rates in assemblies formed by the 1-way and&#xd;
2-way tile sets are O(epsilon^2), where epsilon is the error rate in assemblies without any error correction.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second part of this thesis, we focus on a different error mechanism, namely,errors caused by imperfect or malformed tiles. We propose a model of malformed tiles, and consider the performance of various proofreading tile sets in the presence of malformed tiles. Our simulation results show that the Reif et al. 3-way overlay tile sets are able to best deal with malformed tiles. During the simulations, we observed that snaked proofreading tile sets always have trouble completing whole patterns when malformed tiles are present. We instead propose two modified snaked proofreading constructions, and verify through both simulations and analysis that the two modified constructions have much better performances.</description>

   <description>Municipal water distribution system (WDS) expansion is often focused on increasing system capacity with designs that best meet hydraulic requirements at the least cost.  Increasing public awareness regarding global warming and environmental degradation is making environmental impact an important factor in decision-making for municipalities.  There is thus a growing need to consider environmental impacts alongside cost and hydraulic requirements in the expansion and design of WDSs.  As a result, the multiplicity of environmental impacts to consider in WDS expansion can complicate the decisions faced by water utilities.  For example, a water utility may wish to consider environmental policy issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, non-renewable resource use, and releases to land, water, and air in WDS expansion planning. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis outlines a multi-objective optimization approach for WDS design and expansion that balances the objectives of capital cost, annual pumping energy use, and environmental impact minimization, while meeting hydraulic constraints.  An environmental impact index that aggregates multiple environmental measures was incorporated as an environmental impact objective function in the multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm.  The environmental impact index was developed to reflect stakeholder prioritization of specific environmental policy issues.  The evaluation of the environmental impact index and its application to the WDS expansion problem was demonstrated with a water transmission system example.  The environmental impact index and multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm were applied to the “Anytown” network expansion problem.  Preliminary results suggest that solutions obtained with the triple-objective capital cost/energy/EI index optimization minimize a number of environmental impact measures while producing results that are comparable in pumping energy use and, in some instances, slightly higher in capital cost when compared to solutions obtained with a double cost/energy optimization in which environmental impact was not considered.</description>

   <description>Using a combination of optical and near-infrared photometry, we have studied both the resolved and integrated stellar populations for a sample of Virgo cluster galaxies spanning the full range of galaxian parameters. The derived stellar population properties are compared against galaxy structural and environmental measures to gauge the importance of these factors in establishing galaxy star formation histories and chemical evolution.&#xd;
Although galaxy colours do not uniquely probe a galaxy's star formation history, meaningful results may be obtained if considered in a relative sense. We find that colour profiles reflect variations in both stellar age and metallicity within galaxies. We also uncover systematic variations in colour gradients, and thus age/metallicity gradients, along the Hubble sequence, such that age and metallicity gradients become increasingly negative toward later Hubble types. However, only weak correlations exist between galaxies' stellar populations and their structure and environment. The correlations we find suggest that the star formation histories of gas-rich galaxies are strongly influenced by gas removal within the cluster, while their chemical evolution is due to a combination of stellar mass-dependent enrichment and outflow retention.&#xd;
The assembly of gas-poor giant galaxies is consistent with a hierarchical scenario wherein gas-rich mergers dominate by number. Gas-poor dwarfs differ from the giants, however, appearing as the product of environmentally-driven evolution. Spiral galaxies bridge the dwarf-giant gap, whereby merging and gas-stripping signatures are imprinted in their stars. Early-type spirals seem to have fallen into the cluster sooner than the later types, thereby ceasing star formation in their disks at earlier epochs. The bulges of both types, however, appear to have grown via merging. The nature of this merging (minor versus major) remains unknown. Irregular galaxies exhibit signs of a recent gravitational encounter that has redistributed both their stars and gas, the latter of which caused recent star formation.</description>

   <description>Background: Sagittal plane external flexion moment in early stance has been reported to be both higher and lower in people with medial knee OA compared to control subjects. Purpose: Sagittal plane knee joint kinetics and kinematics were compared between people with medial compartment OA and healthy subjects. Subjects with OA and low pain scores were also compared to those with OA and moderate pain scores. Subjects: Forty people with medial knee OA and 40 age and sex matched control subjects. Method: Knee alignment and OA severity were measured from radiographs. Frontal and sagittal plane moments and knee flexion angle during gait were measured using a three dimensional motion analysis system and force plates. The Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to measure pain; this score was used to divide the OA group into low pain and moderate pain OA groups. The relationship between knee flexion moment in early stance and gait speed, knee flexion angle and pain was also determined. Results: Subjects with OA had lower gait speed and cadence, and higher double limb support time. Peak knee adduction moment (first 50% of the gait cycle) was higher in the OA group. The knee flexion moment in early stance did not differ between groups; however the knee extension moment in late stance was lower in the knee OA group. The moderate pain group walked more slowly than the low pain group. The knee adduction moment, sagittal plane moments and knee flexion angle in stance did not differ between OA groups. A positive correlation was found between knee flexion moment and knee flexion angle in early stance in the knee OA group; the correlations between knee flexion moment and pain and gait speed were not significant. Conclusion: No differences were found in the knee flexion moment or stance phase knee flexion angle between the groups compared in this study, and therefore the results do not contribute to resolution of the controversy in the literature. Participants with knee OA in this study had relatively mild to moderate disease severity, which may have contributed to the non-significant findings.</description>

   <description>Background:	Though numerous studies have compared overground and treadmill walking there still exists a significant debate about whether the two modes of walking are equivalent. The present study provides a comprehensive evaluation of overground and treadmill walking at matched speeds and increasing treadmill speeds. Walking performance was compared in healthy adults, in people with stroke and between the groups. This is important to know because any differences may have implications for gait training in both groups. Methods: Ten healthy adults (50-73 years) and ten subjects with stroke (54-80 years) walked at their self-selected speed overground which was matched on a treadmill. Temporal parameters, angular kinematics and vertical ground reaction forces were recorded during walking once subjects were in steady state as determined from their heart rate and oxygen uptake, both of which were also recorded. Belt speed was then increased 10% and 20% above matched speed and steady state recordings obtained. Speed related adjustments were also evaluated and compared between the two groups of subjects.  Results: For healthy adults, step, stride, and joint angular kinematics were similar for both modes of walking. Small reductions in double support time and decreased push-off force were evident on the treadmill. For subjects with stroke, step, stride, and stance times were longer when walking overground but the degree of symmetry was comparable for both surfaces. Kinematic data revealed interlimb asymmetry was more pronounced for all lower limb joint excursions during overground walking and vertical forces were higher. In comparison to healthy adults, stroke subjects walked with lower cadence, shorter strides, lower stance time, and smaller lower limb joint excursions than their healthy counterparts. When compared with overground walking the metabolic requirements of treadmill walking for healthy adults and subjects with stroke however were about higher by 23% and 15% respectively. All temporal-distance parameters, hip joint excursion, F1 and F2 forces and metabolic costs showed main effects of speed. An interaction between speed and group indicated that oxygen consumption increased at a greater rate in stroke than healthy subjects. Conclusions: The findings suggest that, although overground and treadmill gait patterns are similar for each group of subjects, people with stroke adopt a more symmetrical kinematic walking pattern on the treadmill that is maintained at faster belt speeds. Although there are differences in gait patterns between healthy and stroke subjects, both groups respond to the challenge of increased walking speed in the same way. One important difference is the abnormal elevation of energy demands associated with treadmill walking at faster speeds in stroke. Clinically, this warrants consideration as it may lead to premature fatigue and undesirable cardiorespiratory challenge in this group of individuals.</description>

   <description>Female sexual arousal refers to one’s feelings of sexual excitement and pleasure and has both physiological (i.e., objective) and psychological (i.e., subjective) components. It is an important, yet difficult phenomenon to investigate. As a result, many instruments have been used in an attempt to accurately measure female arousal; however, there are problems associated with each. Furthermore, the relationship between the subjective and physiological indicators of sexual arousal appears to be influenced by the instrument used to measure physiological sexual arousal. Specifically, instruments measuring physiological arousal internally (i.e., vaginal photoplethysmography) typically yield lower correlations between measures of physiological and subjective sexual arousal than instruments examining the external genitals (i.e., labial thermistor, thermal imager), which indirectly measure blood flow. Alternatively, laser Doppler imaging (LDI) is a direct measure of external genital blood flow but has only been used in one previous study that did not assess the relationship between physiological and subjective sexual arousal. The aims of the current study were to investigate the usefulness of LDI for assessing genital blood flow in women in response to erotic visual stimuli, and to explore the relationship between physiological and subjective indicators of sexual arousal. In addition, the role of psychosocial variables in predicting physiological and subjective sexual arousal was also examined. Eighty sexually healthy women completed a psychosocial interview and questionnaires. Participants also watched three 15-minute films during LDI scanning: two nature films (measuring acclimatization and baseline blood flow levels) and one randomly assigned experimental film (erotic, anxiety, humor, or neutral). They were asked to rate their level of subjective sexual arousal throughout and following the third film. Results indicated that LDI was able to differentiate the erotic condition from the three non-erotic conditions, and that physiological and subjective sexual arousal were significantly correlated. Although the psychosocial variables did not significantly predict either component of sexual arousal, specific variables moderated the association. Psychological, sexual, and social variables, along with genital sensations, played significant roles in the relationship between subjective and physiological sexual arousal. These findings suggest that LDI is a useful instrument for measuring female sexual arousal, and that sexual arousal is a complex process that requires further empirical investigation.</description>

   <description>Building on Message Framing Theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this study examined how message frame impacts viewer attention to and cognitive processing of osteoporosis prevention print ads. Attention was measured with eye tracking technology, which calculated participants’ number of fixations and dwell time. Cognitive processing was assessed through a textual masked-recall exercise. Sixty women, with a mean age of 21.25+/-2.61 years, viewed the same 36 ads; however, the message frame changed on a randomized, rotating basis, resulting in each group viewing 12 gain-, 12 loss-, and 12 neutrally-framed ads. One-way repeated measures analyses of variance revealed that message frame significantly impacted viewers’ number of fixations, F(2,118)=8.18, p&lt;.01, η2= .12 dwell time, F(2,118)=9.84, p&lt;.01, η2= .14 and  masked-recall results, F(2,118)=22.28, p&lt;.01, η2 = .27. Viewers’ number of fixations, dwell time and recall of gain-framed osteoporosis prevention ads was significantly higher than to loss- or neutrally-framed ads, p&lt;.01. Message frame was also positively correlated with number of fixations, r=.29, p&lt;.02 and dwell time, r=.42, p&lt;.01. Findings may help expand theory related to message framing and the ELM, while contributing to advancements in eye tracking literature and health communications practice.</description>

   <description>Environmental temperature is arguably one of the most important abiotic physical factors&#xd;
affecting insect behaviour. Temperature affects virtually all physiological processes&#xd;
including those that regulate nervous system function. It is therefore not surprising that&#xd;
animals have evolved adaptations that confer tolerance to heat stress and allow for&#xd;
continued behaviour as ambient temperature fluctuates. Most animals have central&#xd;
nervous system (CNS) responses to heat shock (HS) preconditioning which extend the&#xd;
thermal operating range of neural circuits during exposure to extreme heat. It is unclear how HS preconditioning confers CNS thermotolerance. I used the migratory locust&#xd;
(Locusta migratoria), an animal that inhabits environments that can have large&#xd;
fluctuations in ambient temperature daily, to examine how neuronal circuits cope with&#xd;
temperatures stress. Using the ventilatory central pattern generator (vCPG) as a model&#xd;
circuit I was able to address how the CNS switches on adaptations which provide&#xd;
protection against heat stress. vCPG thermotolerance was manifested as an increase in the thermal operating range and a decrease in the length of time required to recover vCPG activity when temperature stress was removed. I investigated the octopaminergic (OA/cAMP/PKA) and nitrergic (NO/cGMP/PKG) signalling pathways and tested their involvement in conferring thermotolerance to the vCPG during heat stress. I found that long applications of octopamine, or increased adenylate cyclase activity generated vCPG thermotolerance and was dependent upon transcription and translation. In addition I found that HS-treated locust had significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) production during heat stress, and when I pharmacologically reduced PKG activity vCPG thermotolerance was generated. However, unlike octopamine treatment thermotolerance could be observed within minutes following PKG inhibition. Thus I conclude that the octopaminergic and nitrergic pathways coordinate long- and short-term protective modulation of the locust CNS.</description>

   <description>From previous research, it has been proven that rock roughness and closure are two important factors for stability of backfilled stope and exposed backfill.&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to estimate the important parameters of roughness, several investigations have been conducted in other scientific fields to study roughness. The results showed that the important roughness parameters are application-dependent.&#xd;
&#xd;
In geology and rock mechanics the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) is a critical factor that incorporates the roughness in stability problems. Although JRC is widely used, it is very subjective and highly depends on the experience of the individual conducting the analysis. During the last several decades there were attempts to use different methods such as fractal geometry, Fourier analysis, analytical methods, etc. to convert a random surface profile into a JRC.&#xd;
&#xd;
The goal of the current research is to estimate with greater accuracy the contribution of roughness to the shear strength of the interface at the paste-rock contact when backfilling. Four hundred and fifty backfill samples were constructed and tested in a shear box. The variables of the tests are three: binder percentage, roughness and cure time. From the test results the importance of each of those parameters to the final shear strength of the paste-rock interface was estimated. The normal stress that acts on the samples is also a critical factor. From the tests that were tried, it was concluded that there are limits in normal stress for which roughness is important.</description>

   <description>It is widely accepted within the software engineering community that the support&#xd;
for integration is necessary for requirement models. Several methodologies, such as&#xd;
the role-based software development, that have appeared in the literature are relying&#xd;
on some kind of integration. However, current integration techniques and their tools&#xd;
support are insufficient. In this research, we discuss our solution to the problem.&#xd;
More precisely, we present a general integration approach for scenario-based models, particularly for UML Sequence Diagrams, based on the colimit construction known from category theory.&#xd;
&#xd;
In our approach, Sequence Diagrams are represented by SD-graphs, a special kind&#xd;
of typed graphs. The merge algorithm for SD-graphs is an extension of existing merge&#xd;
operations on sets and graphs. On the one hand, the merge algorithm ensures traceability and guarantees key theoretical properties (e.g., “everything is represented and nothing extra is acquired” during the merge). On the other hand, our formalization&#xd;
of Sequence Diagrams as SD-graphs retains the graphical nature of Sequence Diagrams,&#xd;
yet is amenable to algebraic manipulations. Another important property of our process is that our approach is applicable to other kinds of models as long as they can be represented by typed graphs.&#xd;
&#xd;
A prototype Sequence Diagram integration tool following the approach has been implemented. The tool is not only a fully functional integration tool, but also served&#xd;
as a test bed for our theory and provided feedback for our theoretical framework. To&#xd;
support the discovery and specification of model relationships, we also present a list&#xd;
of high-level merge patterns in this dissertation.&#xd;
&#xd;
We believe our theory and tool are beneficial to both academia and industry, as the initial evaluation has shown that the ideas presented in this dissertation represent promising steps towards the more rigorous management of requirement models.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also present an approach connecting model transformation with source transformation&#xd;
and allowing an existing source transformation language (TXL) to be used&#xd;
for model transformation. Our approach leverages grammar generators to ease the&#xd;
task of creating model transformations and inherits many of the strengths of the&#xd;
underlying transformation language (e.g., efficiency and maturity).</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-28 14:26:16.084</description>
   <description>Rationale: Previous studies have reported low employment rates for adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The challenges to finding and maintaining work have been attributed to their social, communication, behavioural and sensory processing difficulties. Numerous studies report that children with ASD experience abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, whereas estimates for adults remain unclear. Furthermore, little is known about how sensory processing patterns affect employment. &#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The purposes of this study were a) to describe the self-reported sensory processing patterns in high-ability adults with ASD and compare them to adults without ASD; and b) to explore the role that sensory processing patterns play in the workplace for high-ability adults with ASD.                            &#xd;
                                                                                                    &#xd;
Methods: A sequential mixed methods approach was used. In Phase I, 20 participants with and 20 without ASD completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) and employment details. In Phase II, 10 of the 20 participants with ASD described their work experiences during phone interviews. Participants with ASD were recruited from autism societies in Ontario and Québec.                        &#xd;
                                                                                        	             &#xd;
Results: Significant differences were found in all four subscales of the AASP between the high-ability adults with ASD and those without ASD. The adults with ASD obtained significantly higher scores on the Low Registration, Sensation Avoiding and Sensory Sensitivity subscales than the comparison group, and significantly lower scores on Sensation Seeking. Approximately half of the adults with ASD were employed, but few were experiencing sustained employment. Participants described using avoidant, replacement and preventative coping strategies to overcome overwhelming sensations at work. Enhanced sensory processing had the potential to improve work performance. Participants chose alternative work environments based on their sensory preferences and challenges. Disclosing their ASD diagnosis proved to be a delicate process, resulting in differential consequences on accommodations and workplace relationships.             &#xd;
  &#xd;
Conclusions: High-ability adults with ASD displayed different sensory processing patterns compared to individuals without ASD. Most of these adults showed an awareness of their sensory needs. Sensory processing patterns impacted on work choice, performance and satisfaction. Accommodations that modified the physical environment and occupational tasks promoted an optimal work fit for individuals with sensory issues. Self-employment offered a means of self-accommodation.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-28 14:40:08.139</description>
   <description>Causal uncertainty refers to the lack of confidence in one’s ability to understand causal relations in the social world (Weary &amp; Edwards, 1994). Relative to people with low causal uncertainty, individuals with high causal uncertainty exhibit enhanced self-regulation performance following a social interaction (Jacobson, Papile, Passey, &amp; Boucher, 2006). The current studies investigated the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, and the role of self-esteem. &#xd;
Study 1 investigated whether the social or nonsocial nature of the depleting task and expectations about the need for future self-control could account for the relationship between causal uncertainty and self-regulation (N = 181). For the social task, high causally uncertain participants’ self-regulation performance was consistent across expectations for future self-control regardless of participant self-esteem. In contrast, low causally uncertain participants’ performance improved with increasing instructions to conserve energy for future tasks but only for participants with lower self-esteem. For low causally uncertain participants with higher self-esteem, self-regulation performance decreased with increased expectations for future self-control. &#xd;
In the nonsocial condition, the findings did not differ by self-esteem. Learning that the future task involved self-control and that the initial task was depleting were both associated with increases in self-regulation for high causally uncertain participants. In contrast, self-regulation abilities did not differ for low causally uncertain participants upon learning that the future task involved self-control and marginally decreased when they learned that the initial task was depleting. &#xd;
Study 2 examined whether or not self-presentation could account for the relationship between causal uncertainty and self-regulation abilities (N = 88). Higher causal uncertainty was associated with better self-regulation performance, but self-presentation goals did not moderate this relationship. Self-esteem did not influence self-regulation performance in this study.&#xd;
Study 3 investigated whether or not an accuracy goal could account for the relationship between causal uncertainty and self-regulation abilities (N = 112). For participants with lower self-esteem, high causally uncertain participants’ self-regulation performance was consistent regardless of the goal manipulation; whereas low causally uncertain participants’ performance improved with instructions to create accurate impressions of their partner. In contrast, for participants with higher self-esteem, self-regulation did not differ by causal uncertainty or goal conditions.</description>

   <description>This thesis discusses and documents the validation efforts related to Ontario’s LS-299 and LS-308 test methods which are two new test methods developed for the performance-based specification grading of asphalt cement. In addition, this report presents the field validation of a simple performance indicator, loss tangent, for specification grading of asphalt cement for thermal cracking. Furthermore, another objective of this study is to investigate and compare the low temperature fracture and rheological behavior of engineered asphalt materials from field and laboratory-aged test sections on Highway 655 in northern Ontario.&#xd;
Extracted asphalt cements from 20 contract sites in eastern and northeastern Ontario were tested according to Ontario’s LS-299 and LS-308 test methods. It was found that all good performing contracts that showed little or no distress showed low grade losses in LS-308 and retained high strain tolerances as measured in LS-299 compared to the poor performing contracts. &#xd;
Asphalt cements recovered from these 20 contract sites in eastern and northeastern Ontario were also tested in torsion bar geometry to determine their viscoelastic properties. It was decided to focus on the phase angle, as a more direct measure for low temperature performance. Phase angle is a very sensitive parameter to small changes in rheology as the phase angle is approximately equal to the derivative of the logarithm of the stiffness with respect to frequency.&#xd;
It was found that tan() was able to distinguish good from poor performers with 95% accuracy after only a short period of conditioning prior to testing. This is a considerable improvement over the current low temperature bending beam rheometer protocol. &#xd;
Black space diagrams, frequency sweeps, Cole-Cole plots, and master curves were generated for comparison of field and laboratory aged materials from the Highway 655 trial in northern Ontario. The findings show that chemical hardening occurs much faster in the field than through laboratory ageing methods. Also, reversible ageing of binders may occur at low temperatures and could be linked to field performance. Furthermore, a high low temperature phase angle appears to be a reasonable indicator for thermal cracking resistance.</description>

   <description>Recent proponents of non-Eurocentric approaches to the study of development in non-Western areas in the early modern period have seized on late imperial China (1368-1911) as an example of an indigenous trajectory of development that disputes the primacy of early modern Europe in some theories. The commercialization of Ming China (1368-1644) is sometimes appropriated in their arguments. But at times the term “commercialization” is not particularly well-defined in the case of sixteenth and seventeenth century China. In order to strengthen the arguments against Eurocentric assessments of non-Western development, this thesis covers some aspects of Ming commerce and society that are sometimes not captured by the term commercialization. In particular, it focuses on more ‘personal’ dimensions often neglected by references to the commercialization of China’s economy and society in the latter half of the Ming period. Aspects that will be discussed include: social change and social mobility, higher-ranking officials’ views of commerce and merchants, and the identity of merchants as seen in merchant manuals. The application of some recent research by other scholars of Ming China and my readings of some sources dating from the period, I hope, will add nuances to our understanding of Ming commerce and society and furthermore contribute to a detailed approach to the non-Eurocentric writing of a comparative history of development in the early modern world.</description>

   <description>Chronic pain affects approximately 16% to 36% of Canadian adults and is one of the most common reasons for physician visits in Canada. The effects of a self-referral community-based education/exercise program (Y-PEP) on physical function and well-being were initially evaluated in 20 individuals with chronic pain who had attended one of three Y-PEP sessions in 2007. The 10-week program incorporated chronic pain education/self-management and various exercise modalities to allow individuals with chronic pain to try different physical activities in a safe and supported environment. Questionnaires were administered pre-, post-program, and at 10-weeks follow-up and provided data on demographic information, physical activity levels, depression, pain perception, and pain catastrophizing. Maximal activity levels and adjusted activity levels increased 7% and 10% respectively at post-program, but only the adjusted activity levels remained elevated at the 10-week follow-up.  No significant changes occurred in any of the other outcome measures, however, the extent to which maximal and daily activity increased was significantly correlated with greater improvements in the extent to which pain interfered with one’s life (r=0.45) and with pain catastrophizing (r=0.45).  These latter two improvements were significantly associated with greater decreases in depression score (r=0.50). Overall, these findings suggest that a community-based program for individuals with chronic pain can improve physical function and psycho-social well-being. Further effort is required to establish such programs in communities for individuals with chronic pain.</description>

   <description>E2A-PBX1 is expressed as a consequence of a recurring chromosomal translocation seen in 5% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases.  We recently reported that substitution of a leucine residue (L20A) within the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (AD1) of E2A-PBX1 markedly impairs binding to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 and, importantly, leukemia induction in a mouse bone marrow transplantation model.  Since both the protein-protein interaction and consequent leukemogenesis rely on a focal contact point and might therefore be susceptible to antagonism by small molecules, we devised a cell-free assay based on fluorescence anisotropy (FA) to detect binding of a fluorescently labeled peptide derived from AD1 of E2A-PBX1 (FITC-E2A) with recombinantly expressed KIX domain. The optimized FA assay reveals a dissociation constant of 2 µM for the wild-type interaction and correctly detects disruption of the complex by naphthol AS-E phosphate, a compound previously shown to antagonize KIX binding. The optimized FA assay was used to screen the Prestwick, Spectrum and Chembridge libraries containing 12400 compounds in total. Of the initial 43 positive hits from the libraries, 10 caused a reproducible decrease in FA.  Since intrinsic small molecule fluorescence can produce false positive results in the FA-based screen, intrinsically fluorescent compounds were excluded from further analysis unless they could be shown to bind to KIX.  Two hits, L1 and C2, were intrinsically fluorescent but demonstrated KIX interactions and one hit, P9, was not intrinsically fluorescent.  These three compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of a larger portion of E2A (residues 1 to 483) to full length CBP in a pull down assay with only compound P9 demonstrating efficacy.  Further characterization of P9 by NMR showed no binding to KIX, however evaluation by FA showed binding to FITC-E2A with a 20 µM affinity.  A cell-based cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that compound P9 was slightly more toxic on leukemic cells that express E2A-PBX1, compared to leukemic cells lacking E2A-PBX1 expression.  Mammalian two-hybrid analysis did not provide details of the effects of P9 on the E2A:KIX interaction.  We expect the identification of a novel compound, P9, capable of disrupting the oncogenic E2A-PBX1:CBP interaction, to guide the development of effective, less toxic leukemia drugs and provide new tools for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of leukemia induction by E2A-PBX1.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation I study the labor market behavior of sciences and engineering (S&amp;E)&#xd;
doctorates trained and employed in the US. The first essay is an empirical study of task-to-task transitions based on the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (1973-2001). It first assesses&#xd;
the relevance of the careers of doctorates to S&amp;E in general, and research and development&#xd;
(R&amp;D) in particular. Second, it evaluates the participation rates and mobility patterns of&#xd;
doctorates in careers of different types using a transition model with independent competing&#xd;
risks. The second essay extends the empirical framework described above and specifies&#xd;
a dynamic model of occupational choices with symmetric learning about one of the task-&#xd;
specific abilities and dependence on past performance to explain the empirical career patterns&#xd;
described in the first essay. The predictions of the model are used to evaluate the effects&#xd;
of two counterfactual experiments on the supply of research skill. The third essay studies&#xd;
geographic choices for first employment of doctorates using the Survey of Earned Doctorates&#xd;
(SED) 1957-2005. Decisions of Americans, Canadians, and third country nationals to stay&#xd;
in the US after their PhD versus moving to Canada are compared. Individual characteristics&#xd;
and differences in political and economic conditions and career opportunities in the US versus&#xd;
Canada are evaluated to explain the observed differences in the choice of location.</description>

   <title>An Analysis of the Relationship Between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Scientific Literacy in Canada and Australia</title>

   <description>Despite the lack of substantial evidence for improvement in the quality of teaching and learning with information and communication technology (ICT), governmental organizations, including those of Canada and Australia, have made large investments into ICT. This investment has been largely predicated on the hypothesized relationship between ICT and science achievement, and the need for ICT as a means of providing broad-scale training to meet the demand for a skilled workforce.&#xd;
To better understand this possible relationship, this study used data from the 2006 administration of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA 2006) to determine the extent to which scientific literacy is predicted by student- and school-level variables related to ICT, after adjusting for student demographic characteristics and school characteristics.&#xd;
The findings suggest that, once student demographic characteristics and school characteristics have been accounted for, students with prior experience with ICT, who browse the Internet more frequently, and who are confident with basic ICT tasks earned higher scientific literacy scores. Gender differences existed with respect to types of productivity and entertainment software used; this difference may be attributed to personal choice and initiative to learn ICT. Finally, differences in ICT use between Canada and Australia, particularly with school use, may be due to initiatives in Australia (e.g., National Goals of Schooling for the Twenty-first Century) that promote the increased use of ICT in classrooms.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-07 08:48:03.896</description>
   <description>Background: Physical inactivity has been consistently associated with numerous negative health outcomes that track from childhood into adulthood, making physical activity a special concern in the pediatric population.  Dose-response studies are particularly useful when trying to understand the minimal and optimal amounts of physical activity needed to reduce the risk of negative health outcomes.  Unfortunately, previous work within youth has relied on self-reported measures of physical activity, and this research does not provide a clear picture of the true relation between physical activity and health.&#xd;
Objectives: Manuscript 1. Describe the dose-response relation between dyslipidemia and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in youth.  Manuscript 2. Quantify the difference between self-reported and objectively measured MVPA in youth.  Taken together, the overall objective of this thesis was to examine the dose-response relation between objectively measured MVPA and dyslipidemia in youth and determine how this may affect current Canadian physical activity guidelines.    &#xd;
Methods: Both manuscripts used data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  Fractional polynomial regression modeling was used to fit the dose-response curves between MVPA and lipid/lipoprotein measurements.  Regression analysis as well as a Bland-Altman plot was used to explain the discrepancy between self-reported and objective measures of MVPA.  All analyses were completed using SAS statistical software.  &#xd;
Results: Manuscript 1. Risks for high-risk HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride values decreased in a curvilinear manner with increasing minutes of MVPA.  The greatest reduction in risk occurred within the first 30 min/d of MVPA.  The relation between level of MVPA and LDL-cholesterol was unclear.  Manuscript 2. The average youth over-reported their MVPA by ~30 min/d.  The over-reporting was not mediated by basic demographic factors; however, the difference in reporting was systematic in nature such that inactive youth over-reported to the greatest extent.&#xd;
Conclusions: Manuscript 1. Youth need to accumulate 30 min/d of MVPA to greatly reduce their risk for dyslipidemia.  Manuscript 2.  Youth tend to over-report their daily MVPA by approximately 30 min/d.  Combined, the results from this thesis suggest that physical activity recommendations for cardiovascular health in youth should suggest a minimum of 30 min/d of MVPA and preferred level of 60 min/d.</description>

   <description>This thesis uses the Canadian Drugs and Alcohol survey conducted in 1994 by Statistics Canada to explore how Agnew’s (1992, 2001, 2006) general strain theory can help to understand drug and alcohol use in Canada. Agnew argues that experiences of strain, which include an array of negative life events, produce a negative emotional response which creates pressure for corrective action. In postulating why certain individuals are more likely to react to strain with deviant behaviour, Agnew (1992, 2001, 2006) emphasizes the importance of variables that condition the effects of strain on deviance. It is argued that people are less likely to respond to strain with deviant coping strategies depending upon their levels of social control, constraint, social support and deviant peers and values (Agnew 1992; Broidy and Agnew 1997; Agnew 2006). &#xd;
&#xd;
Results are very supportive of GST as measures of objective and subjective strains as well measures of the conditioning variables are consistently associated with drug and alcohol use in hypothesized directions; strain measures also tended to interact with conditioning variables in associations with substance use. Hypotheses surrounding gender differences were also supported as females generally scored higher than males on measures argued to protect against the effects of strain and lower on measures argued to encourage deviant coping. Additionally, objective financial strain tended to have a stronger effect on male substance use while subjective strains tended to be more important in the prediction of female substance use. Avenues for further research are discussed including ways to ameliorate the adaptation of GST to gendered substance use patterns.</description>

   <description>Problem determination is the identification of problems and performance issues that occur in an observed system and the discovery of solutions to resolve them. Top-k analysis is common task in problem determination in database management systems. It involves the identification of the set of most frequently occurring objects according to some criteria, such as the top-k most frequently used tables or most frequent queries, or the top-k queries with respect to CPU usage or amount of I/O. &#xd;
Effective problem determination requires sufficient monitoring and rapid analysis of the collected monitoring statistics. System monitoring often incurs a great deal of overhead and can interfere with the performance of the observed system.  Processing vast amounts of data may require several passes through the analysis system and thus be very time consuming.&#xd;
In this thesis, we present our lightweight top-k analysis framework in which lightweight monitoring tools are used to continuously poll system statistics producing several continuous data streams which are then processed by stream mining techniques. The results produced by our tool are the “top-k” values for the observed statistics.  This information can be valuable to an administrator in determining the source of a problem.&#xd;
We implement the framework as a prototype system called Tempo.  Tempo uses IBM DB2’s snapshot API and a lightweight monitoring tool called DB2PD to generate the data streams. The system reports the top-k executed SQL statements and the top-k most frequently accessed tables in an on-line fashion. Several experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach achieves low system overhead.</description>

   <description>Software clones are considered harmful in software maintenance and evolution. However, despite a decade of active research, there is a marked lack of work in the detection and analysis of near-miss software clones, those where minor to extensive modifications have been made to the copied fragments. In this thesis, we advance the state-of-the-art in clone detection and analysis in several ways. First, we develop a hybrid clone detection method, called NICAD, that can detect both exact and near-miss clones with high precision and recall and with reasonable performance. Second, in order to address the decade of vagueness in clone definition, we propose an editing taxonomy for clone creation that models developers' editing activities in the copy/pasted code in a top-down fashion. NICAD is designed to address the different types of clones in the editing taxonomy. Third, we have conducted a scenario-based qualitative comparison and evaluation of all of the currently available clone detection techniques and tools in the context of a unified conceptual framework. Using the results of this study one can more easily choose the right tools to meet the requirements and constraints of any particular application, and can identify opportunities for hybridizing different techniques. The hybrid architecture of NICAD was derived from this study. Fourth, in order to evaluate and compare the available tools in a realistic setting and to avoid the challenges and huge manual effort in validating candidate clones, we have developed a mutation-based framework that automatically and efficiently measures (and compares) the recall and precision of clone detection tools for different fine-grained clone types of the proposed editing taxonomy. We have evaluated NICAD using this framework and found that it is capable of detecting different types of clones with high precision and recall. Finally, we have conducted a large scale empirical study of cloning in open source systems, both to evaluate NICAD and to study the cloning characteristics of these systems in several different dimensions. The study has demonstrated that NICAD is capable of accurately finding both exact and near-miss function clones even in large systems and different languages, and that there seem to be a large number of clones in those systems.</description>

   <description>Acid phosphatases (APases; E.C. 3.1.3.2) catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate (Pi) from Pi monoesters and anhydrides within the acidic pH range. Induction of intracellular and secreted purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) is a widespread plant response to nutritional Pi-deficiency. The probable function of intracellular APases is to recycle Pi from expendable intracellular organophosphate pools, whereas secreted APases likely scavenge Pi from the organically bound Pi that is prevalent in most soils. Although the catalytic function and regulation of plant PAPs have been described, their physiological function in plants has not been fully established. Recent biochemical and proteomic studies indicated that AtPAP26 is the predominant intracellular (vacuolar) and a major secreted purple APase isozyme upregulated by Pi-starved (-Pi) Arabidopsis thaliana. The in planta function of AtPAP26 was assessed by molecular, biochemical, and phenotypic characterization of a homozygous Salk T-DNA insertion mutant. Loss of AtPAP26 expression resulted in the elimination of AtPAP26 transcripts and 55-kDa immunoreactive AtPAP26 polypeptides, correlated with a 9- and 5-fold decrease in extractable shoot and root APase activity, respectively, as well as a 40% reduction in secreted APase activity of –Pi seedlings. The results corroborate previous findings implying that AtPAP26 is: (i) the principal contributor to Pi starvation inducible APase activity in Arabidopsis, and (ii) controlled post-transcriptionally mainly at the level of protein accumulation. Total shoot free Pi level was about 40% lower in –Pi atpap26 mutants relative to wild-type controls, but unaffected under Pi-sufficient conditions. Moreover, shoot, root, inflorescence, and silique development of the atpap26 mutant was impaired during Pi deprivation, but unaffected under Pi-replete conditions, or during nitrogen or potassium-limited growth, or oxidative stress. The results suggest that the hydrolysis of Pi from organic-phosphate esters by AtPAP26 makes an important contribution to Pi-recycling and scavenging in –Pi Arabidopsis.</description>

   <description>The moral distress experiences of Registered Nurses who work in non-acute, continuing care settings were examined using qualitative methods.  Previous research suggests that in general, nurses experience moral distress when they are not able to pursue actions in accordance with their moral conscience. Moral distress in nurses is expressed negatively in both the nurses’ professional and personal lives. However, most research on moral distress among nurses has focused on acute care settings.&#xd;
&#xd;
     Registered Nurse participants were recruited from non-acute continuing care settings and described their experiences of moral conflict and distress. Particular attention was placed on the nurses’ experiences and reactions to their experience. The findings from this study indicated that as in other settings, moral distress is present in Registered Nurses practicing in non-acute continuing care. The nurses’ practicing in non-acute continuing care settings experienced moral distress after facing a barrier to their moral conscience involving organizational functioning, end of life decisions, patient advocacy, and resource utilization. Nurses experienced feelings including powerlessness, concern, regret, disappointment, suspicion of others, and feeling devalued. Future studies may focus further on the subspecialties in the non-acute continuing care sector. Research on strategies to resolve moral distress and research on the effectiveness of current interventions to combat moral distress among Registered Nurses in this setting should be pursued.</description>

   <description>The unscheduled formation of gas hydrate plugs in oil and gas pipelines, which can lead to serious mechanical and personnel damage, is a problematic issue in the petroleum industry. Traditionally, thermodynamic inhibitors such as methanol have been used to control the formation of gas hydrates, but due to the large expenses and ecological risks associated with its use there is increased interest in the use of alternative hydrate inhibitors. They include kinetic inhibitors (KIs) and antiagglomerants (AAs) and as their names imply, function by interfering with the kinetics of hydrate formation and hydrate agglomeration. &#xd;
Recently, antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have shown to inhibit hydrates and have been proposed as hydrate inhibitors.  Normally, AFPs function to protect the tissues of various organisms during freezing conditions. Initially they were found in polar fish, and were later recognized in insects, plants and microorganisms. AFPs are thought to function by lowering the freezing point of water through an adsorption-inhibition mechanism. &#xd;
This thesis has shown that antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are able to modify the crystal morphologies of structure II (sII) tetrahydrofuran (THF) similarly to the KI poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by adhering to the hydrate surface and inhibiting crystal growth. The AFPs were also tested on a high-pressure sII methane/ethane/propane hydrate and proved to have superior hydrate inhibition to PVP. Yet, the expense of purifying AFPs makes them impractical for industrial purposes, thus investigations into the use of cold-adapted bacteria as hydrate inhibitors proved that isolates capable of adsorbing to THF hydrate showed the most effective THF hydrate inhibition. These findings suggest a potential for the future development of biologically-based hydrate inhibitors.</description>

   <title>Self-realization in John Dewey and Confucius: its philosophical and educational features</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-01 10:34:58.687</description>
   <description>This thesis attempts to present John Dewey and Confucian views regarding self-realization and its implication for education. Although there is an increasing body of comparative literature examining the two schools of thought, the examination of the two philosophers’ theories from a perspective of self-realization is greatly lacking. Examining Deweyan notion of self as social, ethical and ever-growing, and the Confucian concept of self as Ren (Humane), He (Harmonious) and Cultivating, self-realization will be illustrated as the expansion, enhancement and enrichment of the individual resulting from a closed gap between oneself and one’s environment. Such unity of self as the feature of self- realization not only illustrates Deweyan and Confucian philosophical theories toward the development of an individual, it also reflects their notions of education as means and ends to realize unification at all levels.</description>

   <description>We formulate Local Shape Descriptor selection for model-based object recognition in range data as an optimization problem and offer a platform that facilitates a solution. The goal of object recognition is to identify and localize objects of interest in an image. Recognition is often performed in three phases: point matching, where correspondences are established between points on the 3-D surfaces of the models and the range image; hypothesis generation, where rough alignments are found between the image and the visible models; and pose refinement, where the accuracy of the initial alignments is improved. The overall efficiency and reliability of a recognition system is highly influenced by the effectiveness of the point matching phase. Local Shape Descriptors are used for establishing point correspondences by way of encapsulating local shape, such that similarity between two descriptors indicates geometric similarity between their respective neighbourhoods. &#xd;
We present a generalized platform for constructing local shape descriptors that subsumes a large class of existing methods and allows for tuning descriptors to the geometry of specific models and to sensor characteristics. Our descriptors, termed as Variable-Dimensional Local Shape Descriptors, are constructed as multivariate observations of several local properties and are represented as histograms. The optimal set of properties, which maximizes the performance of a recognition system, depend on the geometry of the objects of interest and the noise characteristics of range image acquisition devices and is selected through pre-processing the models and sample training images. Experimental analysis confirms the superiority of optimized descriptors over generic ones in recognition tasks in LIDAR and dense stereo range images.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to synthesize and examine the photophysical and structural properties of 3-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (P) and 3-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine (IQ) based cations and their potential use as DNA binding agents. The P ligand was aimed to compare with the IQ ligand as they have similar structures. Two series of compounds were synthesized; one series comprising organic cations, including PC2, PC3, PC4, IQC2 and IQC3. The other one contains ruthenium complexes Ru(bpy)2P, Ru(bpy)2IQ and Ru(P)3). Compounds were prepared as Cl-, Br- and/or PF6- salts. All compounds were characterized by NMR, UV-vis, luminescescence and electrochemistry, when applicable. The results show that P and IQ based organic cations have similar electrochemical properties, and may be candidates for guanine photo-oxidation. However, [Ru(bpy)2P](PF6)2, [Ru(bpy)2IQ](PF6)2 and [Ru(P)3](PF6)2 do not seem to have reduction potentials in the excited states that are appropriate for nucleic base photo-oxidation.</description>

   <description>Magnitudes of numbers influence numerical inequality judgments of people.  Do symbols representing numbers also affect numerical inequality judgments?  To answer the question, I manipulated digit similarity in two-digit number comparison tasks.  During the experiment, the participants took part in two comparison tasks – the judging-larger task and the judging-smaller task.  Given pairs of two-digit numbers, the participants were required to make numerical inequality judgments (judging larger or judging smaller).  To investigate the effect of digit similarity, two kinds of number pairs were used. Two-digit number pairs consisting of same-digits numbers (e.g., 21 – 12) and two-digit number pairs consisting of different-digits numbers (e.g., 21 – 30) were presented at random.  The participants needed more time to compare the same-digits number pairs than the different-digits pairs.  The result was independent of the findings in number comparison studies such as the numerical-distance effect (Moyer &amp; Landauer, 1967) and the unit-decade compatibility effect (Nuerk, Weger, &amp; Willmes, 2001).  The present study poses challenge to the current theories of two-digit number comparison.</description>

   <description>In this thesis is initiated a more systematic geometric exploration of energy shaping. Most of the previous results have been dealt wih particular cases and&#xd;
neither the existence nor the space of solutions has been discussed with any degree of generality. The geometric theory of partial differential equations originated by Goldschmidt and Spencer in late 1960s is utilized to analyze the partial differential equations in energy shaping. The energy shaping partial differential equations&#xd;
are described as a fibered submanifold of a $ k $-jet bundle of a fibered manifold. By revealing the nature of kinetic energy shaping, similarities are noticed between the problem of kinetic energy shaping and some well-known problems in Riemannian geometry. In particular, there is a strong similarity between kinetic energy shaping and the problem of finding a metric connection initiated by Eisenhart and Veblen. We notice that the necessary conditions for the set of so-called $ \lambda $-equation restricted to the control&#xd;
distribution are related to the Ricci identity, similarly to the Eisenhart and Veblen metric connection problem. Finally, the set of $ \lambda $-equations for kinetic energy shaping are coupled with the integrability results of potential energy shaping. The procedure shows how a poor design of closed-loop metric can make it impossible to achieve any flexibility in the character of the possible closed-loop&#xd;
potential function. The integrability results of this thesis have been used to answer some interesting questions about the energy shaping. In particular, a geometric proof is provided which shows that linear controllability is sufficient for energy shaping of linear simple mechanical systems. Furthermore, it is shown that all linearly controllable mechanical control systems with one degree of underactuation can be stabilized using energy shaping&#xd;
feedback. The result is geometric and completely characterizes the&#xd;
energy shaping problem for these systems. Using the geometric approach of this thesis, some new open problems in energy shaping&#xd;
are formulated. In particular, we give ideas for relating the kinetic energy shaping problem to a problem on holonomy groups.&#xd;
Moreover, we suggest that the so-called Fakras lemma might be used for investigating the stabilization condition of energy shaping.</description>

   <description>Professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs) process and present antigens on their cell surface in association with MHC class I molecules through two general pathways: direct or cross-presentation.  The process of antigen presentation by pAPCs to naïve T cells resulting in their proliferation and differentiation into activated cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) is called T cell priming.  In these studies, we examine the cross-presentation of antigens from two non-replicating viruses: inactivated Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and recombinant baculovirus encoding the LCMV nucleoprotein (NP). Since effective activation of pAPCs is essential for efficient priming of CD8+ T cells and CTL activation, and because infection with inactivated viruses generally induces an extremely poor level of CTL activation, we examined the activation state of pAPCs by measuring their cytokine profiles following infection to help further delineate their involvement in the CTL response to inactivated viruses.  Our results indicate a pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA upregulation in pAPCs in response to the inactivated virus, similar to the cytokine profiles subsequent to live LCMV infection, but to a lesser extent.  In these studies, we also examined CTL activation following infection with inactivated LCMV and bAc-NP.  We have demonstrated that the presentation of antigens from inactivated LCMV and bAC-NP results in a low level of CTL activation in vivo, though there is an undetectable level of CTL activation in vitro, in comparison to activation following infection with the live virus.  Ultimately, the characterization of the cytokine profiles of pAPCs and the CD8+ T cell profiles induced in response to inactivated LCMV or the baculovirus derived NP may lead to a better understanding of how cross-presentation of these viral antigens may occur.  This information may be applied to enhance the process of pAPC activation and T cell priming, for the induction of more effective cellular immune responses and the generation of stronger protective immunity.</description>

   <description>Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are bi-directional symporters that couple proton movement to a variety of glycolytic metabolites, including lactate and pyruvate.  As such, MCTs not only play a crucial role in pH regulation, but could also function in the distribution of substrates between organelles, cells and tissues. This function may be critically important during hypoxia, when tissues depend on glycolytic flux for energy. We have examined the role of MCTs during hypoxia in an estuarine teleost, the common killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that routinely encounters environmental hypoxia. We cloned and sequenced a killifish MCT that resembled the MCT-2 isoform of mammals, and examined its expression pattern and regulation during hypoxia using real-time quantitative PCR.   Killifish MCT mRNA levels were highest in the intestine (~2x) and lowest in the heart (~0.2x) as compared to the expression in the liver.  Exposure to hypoxia (0.5 mg L-1) resulted in a significant increase in plasma lactate and glucose within 4 hours.  However pyruvate and glycogen concentration in white muscle did not change significantly during this time. We observed no change in the mRNA levels of this MCT isoform in any tissue during 16h of hypoxia. This could indicate the regulation of this MCT at another level, a secondary role in hypoxia, or a role for this isoform unrelated to hypoxia tolerance.</description>

   <description>Background: Agriculture remains one of the most hazardous occupations in Canada.&#xd;
Approximately one-half of all agricultural injuries are due to machinery. The etiology of machinery-related injury remains poorly understood.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: (1) To evaluate the relative importance of two representative safety practices (i.e. safety device use and routine maintenance) and their relationship with machinery-related injury;(2) To evaluate the roles of situational factors and safety practices in the occurrence of entanglement injuries caused by machinery.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Objective 1. Participants were administered the Saskatchewan Farm Injury  Cohort Study baseline survey for a one-year period of recall (2006). Relationships between the machinery-related injury outcome and two safety practices were analyzed cross-sectionally using the farm as the unit of analysis; Objective 2. A descriptive case-series was analyzed for factors surrounding 41 machinery entanglements using data from the Case-Control Farm Machinery Injury Study (2000-2005).&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Objective 1. Limited use of safety devices on machinery during farm operations was associated with higher risks for injury (RR 1.94; 95% CI 1.13 to 3.33; ptrend=0.02). Lower routine maintenance scores were associated with significantly reduced risks for injury (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.98; ptrend=0.05). Objective 2. The majority of entanglements occurred during a few&#xd;
machinery-related tasks, namely (1) field adjustments of machinery; (2) product handling and conveyance; and (3) driveline attachments and servicing. Both expected and unanticipated hazards inherent to these tasks affected the behaviour of farmers, leading to entanglements. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Objective 1. The first finding implies that injury prevention programs require continued focus on the use of safety devices on machinery. The second finding could indicate that maintenance itself is a risk factor, or that more modern equipment that requires less maintenance places the operator at lower risk. These findings provide etiological data that confirm the&#xd;
practical importance of operational safety practices as components of injury control strategies on farms. Objective 2. Systemic changes are required to improve existing machinery safety practices through engineering, work methods and work practice modifications. In addition to design&#xd;
solutions, occupational health and safety strategies should consider activities associated with hazardous situations to inform the content of training and educational efforts.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-03 11:33:53.63</description>
   <description>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is subject to regulation by several neuronal networks, one of which is the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), most importantly Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic diseases of the GI tract that result in such functional symptoms as abdominal pain and diarrhea. These symptoms suggest an important role for dysregulation of the SNS in IBD, since this branch of the autonomic nervous system aids in regulation of blood flow, secretion and motility. Inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in the serum and tissue of IBD patients can have wide-ranging effects on neuronal function in vitro, and may be responsible for the functional alterations observed in vivo. With these neuronal alterations in mind, we hypothesized that interleukin-17, a novel cytokine with a central role in the pathogenesis of IBD, modulates the properties of sympathetic neurons innervating the gastrointestinal tract. Using electrophysiological techniques and Ca2+ imaging, we examined the effect of IL-17 on currents passing through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in neurons from the superior mesenteric ganglion, which innervates the gut, and found that IL-17 inhibited these currents. In parallel, we found that IL-17 enhances the growth of sympathetic neurites in vitro. These effects depend upon activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, and do not appear to require glial cells. Therefore, dysregulated neural function during IBD may be due to direct effects of IL-17 on sympathetic neurons.</description>

   <description>Photonic crystals are optical materials where patterning of dielectrics on sub-wavelength length scales creates unusual optical properties such as waveguides with propagation speeds much slower than the vacuum speed of light. In this thesis, I examine the classical and quantum optical properties of such structures, specifically the enhancement of photon emission rate from a single quantum dot embedded in the waveguide (the Purcell Effect) and extrinsic scattering from an injected waveguide mode due to fabrication imperfections. The photon emission rate is found to be significantly enhanced over a large bandwidth in slow light photonic crystal waveguides and I provide detailed results for optimizing the emission properties of a novel photonic crystal ridge waveguide to suite a given application. Using an incoherent scattering theory, I show how slow light propagation enhances extrinsic scattering from unavoidable manufacturing imperfections leading to back scattering and radiation loss that scale with the group velocity v_g, as v_g^{-2} and v_g^{-1} respectively. I then improve the modeling of scattering using a coherent, multiple scattering approach to explain the experimental observation of disordered resonances in slow light waveguide modes. The theoretical predictions show good agreement with experimental measurements. This document provides a thorough introduction to the properties and problems of slow light photonic crystal waveguides.</description>

   <description>Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising technique to treat ischemia by creating new blood vessels. The aim of this thesis was to develop and characterize biodegradable elastomers for localized delivery of growth factors and to investigate the ability of released growth factors to induce angiogenesis. An osmotic delivery mechanism using photo-cross-linked elastomers based on trimethylene carbonate (TMC) was used to deliver vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) alone or in combination at two different doses. It was hypothesized that elastomers made of TMC can provide an effective osmotic release using trehalose as a main osmotigen and that the use of TMC would eliminate the microenvironmental pH drop implicated in denaturing acid sensitive growth factors. To obtain an insight into the degrading zone in which growth factors will be released, the in vivo degradation mechanism and tissue response were investigated. The in vivo degradation of D,L-lactide/ε-caprolactone (DLLACL) elastomers that degrade by hydrolysis was investigated for comparison. Cross-link-density played a significant role in the degradation pattern of DLLACL elastomers. TMC and TMCCL elastomers degraded by surface erosion and oxidation played a significant role in their in vivo degradation. To obtain an efficient release, the mechanical properties of TMC elastomers were tailored by copolymerizing TMC with CL and DLLA and/or by controlling the cross-link density. The delivery device was able to provide a sustained release of growth factors for longer than two weeks with no initial burst. Cell based bioactivity assays indicated that released growth factors were highly bioactive over the entire release period.  Microenvironmental pH studies using FITC-BSA indicated no significant drop in pH in TMC elastomers that contained small amounts of DLLA. Using 125I-VEGF165, it was found that the osmotic delivery can provide a direct in vivo-in vitro release correlation. Released growth factors were able to induce angiogenesis in rats when tested by subcutaneous implantation.  Angiogenesis was dose dependent for both VEGF165 and HGF. Combined release of VEGF and HGF achieved the best results. The formed blood vessels were stable during the active release period, and they were normal looking and connected to the surrounding vasculature.</description>

   <description>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental disorder that will affect 12.2% of Canadians over the course of their lifetimes, and 4.8% annually (Patten, et al., 2006). One of the most robust findings in the MDD literature is that the gold-standard treatments – Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), and anti-depressant medications - are equal in their efficacy, and superior to placebo. However, it is unclear whether rates of remission for certain types of symptoms differ among treatments with theoretically different mechanisms. This study re-analyzed data from the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program, which included 158 adults with MDD randomized to CBT, IPT, imipramine or placebo. We statistically derived 4 factors from the baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. We hypothesized that the rate of remission of somatic factors (sleep and appetite) would be most rapid in the group receiving imipramine plus clinical management (IMI-CM), and that the rate of remission for cognitive-affective factors would be fastest in IPT and CBT. Hierarchical regression analyses predicted the sum of symptom scores corresponding to each factor using linear and quadratic time (measured in weeks). Treatment-by-time interactions were entered in a stepwise fashion. There were no significant interactions found in the appetite factor, suggesting that all therapies acted on these symptoms at similar rates. Consistent with hypotheses, IMI-CM produced more rapid remission in sleep symptoms compared to psychotherapy. Surprisingly, IMI-CM was also more rapid at relieving cognitive-affective symptoms. The results lend partial support to the idea that different treatments for MDD may target specific symptoms at different rates according to their underlying mechanisms of action. The findings present some exciting possibilities for elevating response rates through empirically-based “tailored treatments”.</description>

   <description>An ash monitoring system prototype that consists of a “clean” heat flux sensor and a “dirty” heat flux sensor was developed in this study. The “clean” heat flux sensor was studied numerically and experimentally while the “dirty” heat flux sensor was tested in the experiment. Two different measurement methods were applied on the “clean” sensor, one from the original study and one proposed in the present work. The new method required additional data processing procedures to be able to work in an on-line basis. Among the three data processing procedures developed in this study the central temperature difference procedure was found to be the most reliable one. Numerical results provided valuable information about the heat transfer pattern at the sensing element and also the performance of the sensor at high radiation heat flux levels. A rough calibration of both “clean” and “dirty” heat flux sensors was conducted experimentally. Nevertheless, the experimental results still served as a primary assessment for both sensors. Observed disagreements between the original study and the present one were probably caused by the modification of the sensor structure made in the present study. Sensitivity variation at high heat flux levels did not appear in the numerical results of either measurement method. Low overall sensor temperature change was believed to be the main reason as it meant less change in thermal properties of the sensing disc. Although the results of the study suggested that the proposed oscillation method was less attractive than the original one, it increased the possibility of resolving the surface characteristic variation problem that was considered crucial for the performances of the “clean” heat flux sensor regardless of the measurement method used.</description>

   <description>Phodopus campbelli is a naturally biparental dwarf hamster with males so paternal they will act as midwives during the birth of their litter.  The hormonal regulation of parental behaviour has been well established in many species.  However, to date, no causal mechanism for the extensive paternal behaviour displayed by male P. campbelli has been discovered.  Recently, activity at the progesterone receptor has been shown to inhibit infant-directed behaviour in male mice.  Therefore, the first study in this thesis was carried out to determine if antagonism of the progesterone receptor (PR) would enhance infant-directed care behaviour in naïve P. campbelli males.  Despite detectable serum progesterone concentration in males, PR antagonism did not alter progesterone concentration, nor did it alter infant-directed behaviour in males with antagonized PR in adulthood.  A slight increase in the latency to retrieve a pup seen in males with antagonized PR during adolescence suggests that there may be a developmental effect of PR activity on infant-directed behaviour in adulthood.  Neonatal male rats express high levels of PR in brain regions important for parental behaviour.  Since hormones can act very early in life to organize adult behaviour, the second study was carried out to determine if progesterone acting much earlier than adolescence is important in the regulation of paternal behaviour in P. campbelli adulthood.  Males were treated daily for the first week of life with transdermal progesterone, which increased neonatal serum progesterone concentration fivefold.  Despite the significant increase in progesterone (and therefore presumably activity at the PR), male behaviour in three different stages of adulthood (sexually naïve, during the birth of the male’s first litter, and in new fatherhood) towards pups was not altered.  Measures of paternal contribution such as pup weight throughout the lactational period were altered by progesterone treatment during the neonatal period, but litter quality was ultimately high in both groups.  Therefore, activity at the PR in adulthood, puberty, or during the neonatal period does not inhibit paternal behaviour in the naturally biparental hamster, P. campbelli.  Thus, progesterone and its receptor do not organizationally or activationally regulate paternal behaviour in P. campbelli.</description>

   <description>The Burdigalian Saumane-Venasque carbonate succession is located in the Rhodano-Provençal basin of southeastern France. These carbonates accumulated in a paleovalley that was flooded by marine waters.  This marine embayment was filled by carbonates composed of twelve different facies.  These sediments form two thick third-order sequences (S1 &amp; S2) and several, thinner higher-order sequences (S1a, S1b, S1c).  S1a is composed of quartzose grainstones with barnacles, echinoids, and bivalves derived from a rocky substrate paleocommunity in a high-energy, open-marine environment during the early phases of sea level rise.  Compound dunes of S1a and S1b are composed of bryozoans and echinoids that are mixed with bioclasts from seagrass facies.  Pervasive cross-bedded grainstones grade upward into low-energy mudstones and packstones of the S1 highstand.  Bryozoan thickets populated sequence 2 during the second sea level cycle.  &#xd;
	Seven different phases of cement, including cloudy epitaxial, fibrous, isopachous columnar, isopachous equant, clear epitaxial, blocky, and pendant types, can be distinguished in these limestones.  Marine hardgrounds are present throughout the area as steep, stepped margins in tidal channels.  Marine cements are interpreted to have precipitated in the upper portion of subaqueous dunes with their location controlled by sedimentation rate and tidal pumping.  Zoned epitaxial cements are interpreted to record shifts in the paleo-water table related to fluctuations in sea level throughout the Miocene in the Rhodano-Provençal basin.   Shallow burial pressure dissolution features are present throughout the deposit.  They are interpreted to result from extended exposure to fresh water, which produced grains that were particularly susceptible to compaction.  The Saumane-Venasque temperate carbonates are different in that they were lithified without significant burial diagenesis, a situation that resulted from multiple sources of cement from marine and meteoric waters.</description>

   <description>The mechanism and regulation of prothrombinase function in the activation of prothrombin and prethrombin-1 were studied. In addition, the kinetics of plasmin-mediated fibrin degredation were determined.&#xd;
First, the mechanism of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase was investigated using two models – a one-form model which posits a single form of prothrombinase and a two-form model which posits the existence of two, equilibrating forms of prothrombinase each specific for either activation cleavages. In summary, the two-form model fit the data better, as well as predict the initial rates of prothrombin activation better than the one-form model, and thus better represents the mechanism of prothrombinase on prothrombin activation.&#xd;
Second, the differences observed in the activation kinetics of prethrombin-1 by prothrombinase consisting of either human or bovine factor Va (FVa) was investigated. The difference was due to the species origin of the heavy chain. Because the conserved domains show high sequence homology, the carboxy-terminus was studied. The calculated pI of the ten carboxy-terminal residues are 12.5 for human and 4.26 in bovine, suggesting that with bovine FVa, the net negative charge of the ten residues augments the negative charge of DSDYQ, thus facilitating the FVa-prethrombin-1 interaction required for Arg320 cleavage.&#xd;
Third, the kinetics of activated protein C (aPC)-mediated inactivation of FVa in real-time, during prothrombin activation was investigated. A profound protection of FVa from aPC was observed (>100-fold), which was much greater than the individual protection with either factor Xa (3 to 10-fold) or prothrombin (10-fold) alone. The addition of protein S, the cofactor for aPC, resulted in a two-fold increase in the rate constant, but did not ameliorate the protection.&#xd;
Lastly, the kinetics of plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin clots was investigated. The clot lysis by plasmin showed a low Km (1 to 2uM) suggesting zero-order kinetics. In contrast, the clot formation showed first-order kinetics. These results suggest that as the concentration of fibrinogen increases, especially above the physiologic level, the balance between fibrinolysis and clotting shifts toward the latter, thus providing a biochemical rationale for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with elevated level of fibrinogen.</description>

   <description>The objective of this project is synthesizing bipyridine-derived ligands in order to study DNA conformational bending. The synthesis of bipyridine derivatives has been investigated. 6,6’-Dibromo-2,2’-bipyridine and small scale of 6,6’-diformyl-2,2’-bipyridine have been successfully synthesized in the laboratory. The ynthesis of large amount of a direct precursor to 6,6’-diformyl-2,2’-bipyridine in an multiple step way has been achieved. The synthesis of mono functionalized pyrene derivatives and of 1,6-dissymmetrically functionalized pyrene derivatives has been heavily studied. Successfully methods have been reported in this thesis.&#xd;
The complete assembly of bipyridine and pyrene units into the final ligands and their model has also been studied. Palladium borylation and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling have been used to successfully connect the bipyridine with pyrene units.&#xd;
In addition to Suzuki-Miyaura methodology, the direct coupling of N,N’-dioxide-2,2’-bipyridine with aromatic bromides under palladium catalysis has been investigated. This method could be an alternative way to access to mono-substituted 6-bipyridines, symmetrically or even asymmetrically 6,6’-disubstituted-2,2’-bipyridine derivatives.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines George Dawson’s efforts to traverse several of the significant blank spaces that pervaded the map of Western Canada in the two decades following Confederation in 1870-71 on behalf of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). By analyzing how Dawson went about making these vast, remote and hitherto poorly-known territories legible we can better understand how he and his GSC colleagues helped to transform the Canadian West into a settler space that miners, traders, loggers, ranchers and many more could inhabit and exploit. As Dawson’s survey work in British Columbia and the North-West Territories reveals, the GSC helped to transform the Canadian West into settler space in two important ways. First, his western reconnaissance surveys yielded a wealth of practical knowledge about travel routes, natural resources, soils, climates, existing Native populations, potential hazards and the overall suitability of particular districts for settlement and resource extraction. This information was widely distributed in published reports and maps and served to draw the lands, natural resources and Indigenous inhabitants of the West more fully into the administrative orbit of the Dominion government. Moreover, Dawson’s reports and maps often depicted colonization as both inevitable and imminent, giving scientific weight and tangible expression to a colonial imaginary that, in practice, was never as certain nor as swift to unfold as these depictions intimated. Second, the GSC’s scientific surveys signified Canada’s desire and capacity to assert its epistemological dominion over the West. In this context, the work of a publicly-funded scientific survey was a profound symbol of authority because a state’s power to explore and map its national territory signified its power to rule over that territory. By exploring and reporting on these lands, Dawson and the Survey helped to cement the Dominion’s authority over its recent territorial acquisitions and affirm their status as a Canadian West. By offering important practical and symbolic contributions to Canada’s colonization of the West in the decades following Confederation, the Geological Survey of Canada played a vital role in transforming this region into a Canadian settler space.</description>

   <description>Understanding factors that influence parenting practices is important, as parents play a critical role in the healthy development of children (Sanders, 1999). From an ecological perspective, both individual and contextual factors must be considered when examining predictors of parenting practices (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). There is limited research, however, that combines both individual and contextual factors within one model to predict parenting practices. The objective of the current research was to examine parents’ contextual sources of support as a buffer and as a mechanism of the relationship between the individual factors of parental stress, and beliefs and knowledge about parenting, and parenting practices. &#xd;
 	The two studies analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 3,008 Canadian parents who had at least one child under the age of five. In the first study, hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the availability of community support as a moderator. Our result indicated that having a high number of community resources available buffered the additive effect of high stress and negative beliefs and knowledge about parenting on parenting practices. In the second study, structural equation modeling was used to develop multiple mediator models to examine three levels of support. The results indicated that: Partner support was a mechanism through which stress affects negative discipline; partner support was a mechanism through which beliefs and knowledge about parenting affect positive and negative parental discipline; community support was a mechanism through which beliefs and knowledge about parenting affect positive parenting practices and positive parental discipline; and national support was a mechanism through which beliefs and knowledge about parenting affect positive parenting practices. Together, these findings emphasize the importance of the environment in shaping parenting practices and demonstrate that support within each environment differentially impacts parenting. Interventions that enhance the support that parents receive at the individual, community, and national levels have the potential to increase positive parenting and decrease negative parenting, and in doing so, promote the healthy development of children.</description>

   <description>In the decade from 1998 to 2008, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was witness to one of the most brutal violent conflicts in recent history. Crimes against humanity and large-scale violations of human rights occurred on a regular basis, resulting in the death and displacement of millions of people.  The international community responded to this crisis with humanitarian efforts such as the donation of billions of dollars in aid and engagement in diplomatic mediations.  However, despite the increasing viability of humanitarian intervention as a policy option for international actors, as well as the ‘groundbreaking’ formal adoption of the Responsibility to Protect at the 2005 United Nations World Summit, no intervention was undertaken.  This produces a puzzle: why, despite acknowledgement of the severity of the crisis, did the international community respond with humanitarianism, but stop short of intervening?&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The answer can be found in an examination of the international normative environment at the time of the conflict.  Using a three-stage normative life-cycle model developed by Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, this thesis posits that the reason the international community engaged in humanitarian actions was because the norm of humanitarianism is at stage 2 of its life cycle, making it well-entrenched enough to compel members of the international community to act.  However, the norm of humanitarian intervention is only at stage 1 of its life cycle, meaning that it is weak and underdeveloped.  Its weakness is exacerbated by the fact that humanitarian intervention often clashes with the highly entrenched stage 3 norms of realpolitik, and specifically the norm of self-interested engagement, which demands that a state only become engaged with another if it is in the first state’s interests to do so.  Thus, despite the brutality of the conflict, the norm of humanitarian intervention was not strong enough to provoke an intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</description>

   <description>As an anarchist and a Muslim, I have witnessed troubled times as a result of extreme divisions that exist between these two identities and communities. To minimize these divisions, I argue for an anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian Islam, an ‘anarca-Islam’, that disrupts two commonly held beliefs: one, that Islam is necessarily authoritarian and capitalist; two, that anarchism is necessarily anti-religious. From this position I offer ‘anarca-Islam’ which I believe can help open-minded (non-essentialist/non-dogmatic) Muslims and anarchists to better understand each other, and therefore to more effectively collaborate in the context of what Richard JF Day has called the ’newest’ social movements.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-08 13:01:54.941</description>
   <description>Automatic recognition of human emotion in speech aims at recognizing the underlying emotional state of a speaker from the speech signal. The area has received rapidly increasing research interest over the past few years. However, designing powerful spectral features for high-performance speech emotion recognition (SER) remains an open challenge. Most spectral features employed in current SER techniques convey short-term spectral properties only while omitting useful long-term temporal modulation information.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, modulation spectral features (MSFs) are proposed for SER, with support vector machines used for machine learning. By employing an auditory filterbank and a modulation filterbank for speech analysis, an auditory-inspired long-term spectro-temporal (ST) representation is obtained, which captures both acoustic frequency and temporal modulation frequency components. The MSFs are then extracted from the ST representation, thereby conveying information important for human speech perception but missing from conventional short-term spectral features (STSFs).&#xd;
&#xd;
Experiments show that the proposed features outperform features based on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and perceptual linear predictive coefficients, two commonly used STSFs. The MSFs further render a substantial improvement in recognition performance when used to augment the extensively used prosodic features, and recognition accuracy above 90% is accomplished for classifying seven emotion categories. Moreover, the proposed features in combination with prosodic features attain estimation performance comparable to human evaluation for recognizing continuous emotions.</description>

   <description>During the preschool years, children across all cultures that have been tested seem to come to an explicit understanding of the fact that mental states are related to but ultimately separate from the reality that they are meant to represent. This understanding is sometimes called a representational theory of mind (RTM). I hypothesized that the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) would be associated with RTM development in&#xd;
preschoolers. I selected DA because several lines of work now suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for RTM and its development. In both animals and &#xd;
humans DA has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of frontal regions. In the first study, I recorded the spontaneous eyeblink rates (EBR) of 60 preschool aged children (range: 48-62 months) who were also given tasks that assessed their RTM and response-conflict executive functioning (RC-EF) skill. In both animal and human models EBR increases with available DA, and thus EBR can be used as an indirect measure of&#xd;
DA functioning. Regression analyses showed that EBR predicted unique variance in RTM and one Stroop-like measure of RC-EF performance after controlling for the effects of age and language ability. In the second study, I also administered a battery of RTM and RC-EF tasks to 79 preschool aged children (range: 42- 54 months). I recorded their spontaneous EBR in addition to collecting genetic material which was processed for allelic variations of DA turnover, transport, and receptor genes. Polymorphisms of catechol-O-methyl transferase gene (COMT) and the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) were associated with children’s RTM performance. These findings provide preliminary evidence that DA functioning is associated with RTM development in the preschool years. Results suggest that there may be a selective effect of DA on RTM ability.</description>

   <description>Objective: Primarily, to determine the effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on sleep architecture, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), in the treatment of depression. Secondarily, to determine the effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on illness severity and cognitive function. Finally, to examine the correlation between sleep architecture, illness severity and cognition. Methods: Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.  Patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder currently experiencing a major depressive episode were included. Patients were on a stable medication regime for 4 weeks prior and throughout the study. Sleep architecture was measured by overnight, ambulatory, polysomnography. Illness severity was determined using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks. Polysomnographs, clinical measures and cognitive test were administered at baseline, after 2-4 days of treatment and after 28-31 days of treatment. Results: Twenty-five patients participated in the study. There was no significant difference between olanzapine and placebo treated groups on age, gender, diagnosis, education level, employment or marital status and number of children. Latency to SWS, duration of SWS, sleep efficiency, total sleep time, total wake time and sleep latency significantly improved in olanzapine treated participants over placebo treated participants. Latency to and duration of rapid eye movement sleep was not significantly different between olanzapine and placebo treated participants. HDRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine treated versus placebo treated participants. No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in MADRS, HARS, and subjective sleep quality scores. There was no significant difference between olanzapine and placebo treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks. Change in sleep architecture was not significantly correlated to clinical change or change in SWM, SSP or RTI. Clinical change was not significantly correlated to SWM or SSP. Clinical change, however, was significantly correlated to change in RTI, in the placebo treated group only. Conclusion: Olanzapine augmentation treatment improves SWS, sleep continuity and depressive symptoms.</description>

   <description>Women with chronic vulvar pain report reduced sexual function in comparison to non-affected women, including decreased sexual arousal. Experimentally induced sexual arousal has been examined in women with and without chronic vulvar pain, with contradictory results: some studies have found that only subjective arousal is affected in women with versus without vulvar pain, while other research has suggested that only genital responsiveness is affected in women with pain. As a result of these inconsistent findings, the role of arousal mechanisms in the causation and maintenance of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) remains unclear. Thirty women with (n = 15) and without PVD (n = 15) were recruited to examine the relationship among physiological and subjective arousal, pain sensitivity and psychological/sexual function. Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) directly measured blood flow to the external genitals in response to an erotic film, and pain sensitivity was assessed before and after imaging. The PVD group had significantly lower blood flow than the control group during the erotic film when baseline blood flow levels were controlled; there were, however, no group differences in ratings of subjective arousal during the erotic film. Vestibular pain thresholds were significantly lower in the PVD group before and after the erotic film compared to the control group. In contrast, pain intensity ratings were significantly higher pre-erotic film in the PVD group, but there was no group difference post-erotic film. Pain thresholds did not significantly change in either group following exposure to the erotic film. Lastly, the PVD group had significantly lower sexual and psychological function in comparison to the control group, and intercourse frequency and pain catastrophizing significantly predicted genital responsiveness in the PVD group. The results suggest that women with PVD show an attenuated physiological response to erotic stimuli in an experimental setting, in the absence of differences in subjective arousal. The findings thus support the role of arousal in the maintenance of PVD, potentially in interaction with other physical and psychological factors. The study also has implications for the assessment and treatment of PVD, whereby arousal processes should be explicitly and separately managed in women with this condition.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-16 15:56:28.195</description>
   <description>This thesis presents an independent analysis of the data from 3-He-filled proportional counters from the third phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) data. These counters were deployed in SNO's heavy water to independently detect neutrons produced by the neutral current interaction of 8-B solar neutrinos with deuterium. Previously published results from this phase were based on a spectral analysis of the energy deposited in the proportional counters. The work in this thesis introduces a new observable based on the time-profile of the ionization in the counters. The inclusion of this observable in a maximum-likelihood fit increases the potential to distinguish neutrons from backgrounds which are primarily due to alpha-decays. The combination of this new observable with the energy deposited in the counters results in a more accurate determination of the number of neutrons.&#xd;
&#xd;
 The analysis presented in this thesis was limited to one third of the data from the proportional counters, uniformly distributed in time. This limitation was imposed to reconcile different time-lines between the submission of this thesis, a thorough review of this work by the SNO Collaboration and results from an independent analysis that is still underway. Analysis of this reduced data set determined that 398 +/- 29 (stat.) +/- 9 (sys.) neutrons were detected in this reduced data-set. The number compares well to the previous analysis of the data, based only on a spectral analysis of the deposited energy, which determined that 410 +/- 44 (stat.) +/- 9 (sys.) were detected in the same time period. The analysis presented here has led to a substantial increase in the statistical accuracy. Assuming that the statistical accuracy will increase when the full data set is analyzed, the results from this thesis would bring the uncertainty in the 8-B solar neutrino flux to down 6.8% from 8.5% in the previously published results. The work from the thesis is intended to be included in a future analysis of the SNO data and will result in a more accurate measurement of the total flux of solar neutrinos from 8-B as well as reduce the uncertainty in the $\theta_{12}$ neutrino oscillation mixing angle.</description>

   <description>The current study developed a paleolimnological approach  to assess changes in diatom assemblages (class Bacillariophyceae) from present-day lake sediments in comparison to those deposited before significant human impact (ca. pre-1850) from 51 Halifax (Nova Scotia, Canada) region lakes in conjunction with a regional diatom-based transfer functions for pH and total phosphorus.  All 51 lakes showed changes in diatom assemblages between the present-day and pre-industrial assemblages that was greater than would be expected (i.e. similarity between ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ samples was much less than the similarities within triplicate ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ samples).  To help identify the most important environmental stressors impacting diatom assemblages in these lakes, diatom-based reconstructions of inferred changes in pH (DI-pH) and total phosphorus (DI-TP) that were greater than the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the respective inference models were reconstructed for each of the 51 lakes.  For example, a decrease in DI-pH greater than the RMSE of the pH model would be a strong indication of recent acidification, whereas an increase in DI-TP greater than the RMSE of the model indicates nutrient enrichment.  Based on this approach, 4% of the lakes are showing acidification-related trends occurring in lakes with low pre-industrial pH values and relatively undisturbed watersheds.  Almost 14% of the study lakes have been impacted by nutrients and characterized by watershed development and high concentrations of TP.  Approximately 4% of lakes showed oligotrophication and acidification.  Diatom assemblages from almost 20% of the study lakes that were relatively unimpacted by the afore-listed environmental stressors show trends consistent with climate warming.  These lakes show an increase in DI-pH greater than the RMSE of the inference model, and floristic changes typically showed a decrease in the relative abundance of Aulacoseira distans paralleled with increase in Cyclotella stelligera and other planktonic diatoms in the modern sediments.  In addition, Diatoma tenue and Diploneis parma, diatoms tolerant of high conductivity, increased in 45% of the study lakes suggesting road salt as an additional stressor.  This thesis provides a rapid paleolimnological-based technique to assess regional water-quality changes, and further demonstrates the complexity of ecological changes within freshwater resources.</description>

   <description>The third and final phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)&#xd;
experiment utilized a series of 3He proportional counters called&#xd;
Neutral Current Detectors (NCDs) to detect the neutrons produced by&#xd;
the neutral current interactions of solar neutrinos in the&#xd;
detector. The number of neutrons detected by the NCDs, and hence the&#xd;
total flux of 8B solar neutrinos, has been determined using two&#xd;
novel signal extraction techniques which were designed to be robust&#xd;
against potential unexpected behaviour in the NCD background. These&#xd;
techniques yield total 8B solar neutrino flux measurements of&#xd;
5.04(+0.42-0.40(stat))(+/-0.28(syst))x10E6/cm2/s&#xd;
and (4.40 - 6.43)x10E6/cm2/s, which are in good agreement&#xd;
with previous SNO results and with solar model&#xd;
predictions, and which confirm that previous NCD analyses were not&#xd;
unduly affected by unexpected background behaviour.&#xd;
&#xd;
The majority of the hardware from the now-completed SNO experiment&#xd;
will be reused to create a new liquid scintillator based neutrino&#xd;
experiment called SNO+. An important part of the SNO+ physics&#xd;
program will be a search for neutrinoless double beta decay, carried&#xd;
out by dissolving 150Nd into the scintillator. The sensitivity of&#xd;
the SNO+ experiment to neutrinoless double beta decay has been&#xd;
evaluated. If loaded at 0.1% (w/w) with natural neodymium, after&#xd;
1 kTa of data taking SNO+ would&#xd;
have a 90%C.L. sensitivity equivalent to a neutrinoless double beta decay half life of  8.0x10E24a or better 50%&#xd;
of the time; if the experiment were run with neodymium enriched to 50% in 150Nd this&#xd;
limit improves to 57x10E24a. Under a reasonable choice for the&#xd;
150Nd neutrinoless double beta decay matrix element, these half lives correspond&#xd;
to upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 112 meV and&#xd;
42 meV, respectively. These limits are competitive with those expected from all other&#xd;
near-term neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.</description>

   <description>Understanding the behaviour of molecules on a semiconductor surface is necessary if molecular self-assembly is going to be employed, with existing semiconductor technology, to create useful devices. Si(111)-7x7 is an invaluable surface upon which to study molecular adsorption. The surface reconstruction has been well characterized and it possesses seven symmetrically distinct dangling bonds that can serve as reaction sites. Aromatic molecules on Si(111)-7x7 have been investigated with a variety of techniques and have been shown to chemisorb at room temperature. However, it is not trivial to predict how an ensemble of aromatic molecules might distribute themselves amongst the available bonding sites on this surface. The work presented in this thesis begins with a joint STM and ab initio investigation of thiophene on 7x7 that demonstrates kinetics are necessary to describe the chemisorption sites occupied at various coverages. A kinetic Monte Carlo model, taking into account a mobile physisorbed state, is shown to accurately describe this site occupancy at room temperature. This model disregards molecule-molecule interaction because thiophene does not sterically hinder chemisorption to a neighbouring dangling bond. A larger molecule, mesitylene, was then studied on Si(111)-7x7, and shown to form an ordered molecular lattice on the Si(111)-7x7 surface. This is the first demonstration of a porous molecular lattice grown on Si(111)-7x7 at room temperature. Finally, molecular chemisorption on the related 5x5 reconstruction, grown by depositing Ge on 7x7, is studied. It is found that the presence of Ge hinders molecular chemisorption, preventing formation of the mesitylene lattice.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-09-11 10:35:17.525</description>
   <description>The Creighton Mine is a structurally complex and seismically active mining environment.  Microseismic activity occurs daily and increases with depth, complicating downward mine expansion.  Larger magnitude events occur less frequently but can damage mine infrastructure, interrupt operations and threaten worker safety.  This thesis explores the relationships between geological structure and mining-induced seismicity through geological, seismological and numerical modelling investigations in an area known as the Creighton Deep, with concentration on the 7400 Level (2255 m).  &#xd;
&#xd;
Geological features within the Creighton Deep have a reported association with seismic activity. Four families of shear zones were identified during field investigations, the most prominent striking SW and steeply dipping NW. &#xd;
&#xd;
Seismicity from 2006-2007 is analyzed.  Spatial and temporal trends and seismic event parameters show little correlation to shear zone geometry.  Instead, seismic event parameters correlate to spatial clusters of events.  A remote cluster of events to the southwest of the excavation exhibits anomalously high seismic parameter values.  This area of the mine continues to be a source of elevated seismicity.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Fault plane solutions are utilized to compare shear zone geometry with active slip surfaces.  Solutions for macroseismic events are inconsistent, while microseismic event focal mechanisms have similar pressure, tension and null axes.  The resulting solutions do not align with shear-zone orientations.  A stress inversion using microseismic focal mechanism information yields a stress tensor that is comparable to the regional stress tensor.  &#xd;

Universal Distinct Element Code numerical models demonstrate that a yield zone exists immediately surrounding the excavation.  SW-striking shear zones modify the stress field, resulting in increased stress to the southeast of the excavation.   These high-stress zones are areas of preferred seismic activity.  Slip is induced on select SW-striking shear zones to the south of the excavation as well as localized yielding. &#xd;
&#xd;
The characteristics of mining-induced seismicity do not correlate to shear zones.  Seismicity does compare to modelled stress:  the yielded rock mass adjacent to the excavation has little seismicity; areas of high stress are areas of rock mass damage and dense seismic activity.  It is thus proposed that seismicity in the Creighton Deep results from stress-induced rock mass degradation rather than fault-slip.</description>

   <description>My study investigated the evolution of oxidative metabolism in fishes. While intense selection for, or against, non-synonymous point mutations in coding sequence drives the evolution of mitochondrial OXPHOS genes, genome-specific mechanisms such as gene duplication events can play major roles in the evolution of nuclear OXPHOS genes. My thesis focused on the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX), principally in fish because of their evolutionary origins and functional diversity in terms of energy metabolism. In the first part of my thesis, I examined a highly aerobic group of fishes (billfishes and tunas) to study the evolution of mitochondrial COX genes. Though the study began as a structure-function analysis of COX, my approach changed when my preliminary results called into question the accepted phylogenetic relationships of my species of interest. We generated a robust multigene phylogeny of this group to interpret data in a phylogenetically informative context. Phylogenetic analyses in this group provided us with a framework to study the evolution of mitochondrial OXPHOS genes, but unexpectedly revealed that: 1) billfishes are only distantly related to tunas, and share greater evolutionary affinities with flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) and jacks (Carangidae), and 2) regional endothermy has evolved in a non-scombroid suborder in teleosts. These results collectively imply that regional endothermy has evolved independently at least twice within teleost fish. The second part of my thesis explored the evolution of the nuclear COX subunits, focusing on their origins in fish. Isoform transcription profiles coupled with phylogenetic analyses for each subunit show that vertebrate isoforms arose from a combination of early whole-genome duplications in basal vertebrates or specific lineages (e.g. teleosts), and more recent single gene duplication events. While there is evidence for retained function of some COX orthologues across fishes and mammals, others appear to have diverged in function since their earlier radiation, possibly contributing novel evolutionary functions. Together these two studies provide insight into the evolutionary forces facilitating adaptive change in mitochondrial and nuclear OXPHOS genes.</description>
