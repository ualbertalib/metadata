   <description>This thesis is an exploration of strain, its sources, its manifestation, and how individuals cope with it.  The particular scenario under investigation is that of Christian university students in a secular academic environment.  Using Agnew’s general strain theory, Goffman’s theory of discreditable stigma, subcultural theory, and recent advances in the study of social capital, the strain experienced by Christian students in a secular university atmosphere was explored.  Ethnographic content analysis of on-campus Christian groups, participant observation and semi-structured interviews of 43 Christian university students were used to investigate four postulates: &#xd;
1.	Christian students experience strain as a result of their religiosity on a secular campus;&#xd;
2.	This strain manifests as a discreditable stigma;&#xd;
3.	This strain results in Christian students becoming members of on-campus Christian groups (seeking a subculture); and&#xd;
4.	Memberships in Christian groups provide access to support through social capital.&#xd;
There was evidence to support postulates 1, 2, and 4, while postulate 3 was not supported by the data collected. &#xd;
Strain theory proved to be a useful concept for understanding how Christian students interacted with their secular environment.  The data suggest that the university atmosphere was challenging to their beliefs both inside and outside the classroom.  Christian students also indicated that they often censored themselves in front of their colleagues and peers and did not feel comfortable disclosing their Christian beliefs to new friends.  The reason given for this was more time was needed in order to quell certain negative assumptions and stereotypes that non-Christians may have about Christians.  This description is suggestive of Goffman’s concept of discreditable stigma, in that stigmatized persons attempt to “pass” so that their stigma (Christianity in this case) will not prejudice current and future encounters.  Students did not join Christian groups as a way to cope with the strain they felt within academia, as many students joined these groups upon entry into university (rather than joining after encountering strain).  It was found that students experienced benefits from membership within Christian groups, demonstrating the utility of social capital (i.e., network of support) as a conceptual framework.</description>

   <description>Over-expression of both hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor Met frequently occurs in invasive human breast cancer, suggesting that the establishment of an HGF “autocrine loop” may be linked to breast tumour progression. We have recently shown a novel activating function of two signaling molecules, Src tyrosine kinase and the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 factor (Stat3), on HGF expression in breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, Stat3 is also important in normal breast development,but this function does not require Src. In addition, β1-integrin adhesion occurs minimally in differentiated breast epithelium, but is upregulated during oncogenic progression and is required for transformation by Src. We therefore hypothesize that β1-integrin engagement is necessary for Src/Stat3-dependent activation of HGF transcription and breast tumourigensis. Using specific inhibitors of Src (Dasatinib) and Stat3 (CPA7) we demonstrated that autocrine HGF expression is linked to activation of Src/Stat3 in a malignant breast cell line. Phenotypic reversion (e.g., cell rounding and loss of filopodial extensions) and inhibition of pY705Stat3, HGF and pYMet expression as determined by immunofluorescence was achieved with both inhibitor treatments separately, and a synergistic effect was observed with combined treatment. Furthermore, β-catenin localization was nuclear in malignant cells, but shifted to cortical cytoplasmic following inhibitor treatment, similar to non-malignant mouse breast epithelial cells (EPH4). We are currently extrapolating these findings to a 3D Matrigel culture model in which EPH4 cells form acini-like spheroids with hollow lumen surrounded by a well-polarized outer layer of cells. Under these conditions, Stat3 levels are decreased followed by a reduction in cyclin D1 expression, while Src activation remains at a low baseline level. Interestingly,expression of Stat5, which has a reciprocal relationship with Stat3 in breast development and involution, is increased concomitant with elevated β-casein expression. Moreover, Fibronectin and HGF in combination stimulate tubular outgrowths with lumen filling.&#xd;
&#xd;
These findings suggest that aberrant changes in extracellular matrix milieu may stimulate integrin cross talk resulting in a switch of HGF/Met signaling to a transformation phenotype. Information from this study may lead to novel cancer therapies through targeting the HGF/Met and integrin signaling cascades.</description>

   <description>Environmental Education (EE) can play an important role in broadening learners’ understanding of their environment. This is of particular importance due to the major adverse impact we as humans are having on the environment, including the loss of biodiversity and global warming. However, many Canadian teachers are not offered EE content in their teacher education programs (Lin, 2002). Therefore, this study investigates, (a) what knowledge and abilities are important for teaching EE, (b) experiences that have influenced educators’ interest and willingness to teach EE, and (c) the preparation educators could receive to better integrate EE into their teaching practices.  Data were collected using an electronic survey (n=148) and semi-structured interviews (n=11). Results showed that among 12 major themes to emerge from the interviews, recognizing the importance of outdoor experiences and having the ability to engage learners were viewed as very important by participants. Interviewees’ recommendations for improving the preparation of educators included introducing mandatory EE components in teacher education programs and promoting mentorship experiences.  However, there was no consensus among participants regarding the impact or value of implementing a professional EE certification program. Implications of this study include facilitating the sharing of environmental educators’ perspectives. Suggestions are made for further research on preparing educators who are willing and able to instruct EE, so that more students are given an opportunity to learn about their environment and make informed choices about their impact on the earth.</description>

   <description>The E2A-PBX1 fusion gene results from the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation that is found in 25% of pre-B-cell cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  The resulting encoded product contains the transactivation domains of E2A, a Class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and most of PBX1.  PBX1 is a major cofactor for most members of the HOX family of homeodomain proteins and is necessary for regulating the essential role that HOX proteins play in development and tissue homeostasis.  We have identified an interaction between the E2A-encoded portion of E2A-PBX1 and the CREB-binding domain (KIX) of the transcriptional coactivator CBP and demonstrated a requirement for this interaction in leukemia induction.  Others have shown that HOX proteins and CBP also interact directly, with resulting inhibitory effects on the DNA-binding ability of HOX proteins and on the acetylation of substrate proteins by CBP.  Several publications have also identified the interaction of HOX proteins with the PBX1 portion of E2A-PBX1 and the result is a potent transcriptional activator at PBX1/HOX target sequences.  In an attempt to develop a molecular model for the induction of ALL by E2A-PBX1, we hypothesize that the addition of CBP interactive peptide elements encoded by E2A to PBX1 allows E2A-PBX1 to stabilize a ternary complex involving E2A-PBX1, HOX, and CBP resulting in the deregulated expression of critical PBX1 or HOX target genes.  I demonstrate using in vitro protein-protein interactions that this ternary complex involving E2A-PBX1, HOXB4 (chosen as a representative member of the HOX family), and CBP does form.  This direct interaction appears to reduce transcriptional activation by E2A-PBX1/HOXB4 heterodimers from PBX1/HOX enhancer elements.  I also show that this suppression of transactivation appears to involve CBP antagonism of DNA binding by E2A-PBX1/HOXB4 heterodimers.  My results are consistent with the idea that E2A-PBX1 contributes to ALL induction by promoting the redistribution of CBP away from DNA sites bound by E2A-PBX1/HOXB4 heterodimers and in favour of those sites bound by E2A-PBX1 homodimers.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-21 17:31:31.419</description>
   <description>Migratory birds spend most of the year on the over-wintering grounds or traveling between breeding and wintering areas, but research has focused on the relatively short breeding period. As a consequence, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how life histories of long-distance migrants are shaped by events and selective pressures interacting throughout the annual cycle. In this thesis, I examine the association between plumage traits and performance, both during the over-wintering and breeding phases of the annual cycle and how events during one season carry-over to influence behavioural and evolutionary processes in subsequent seasons in a migratory warbler, the American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). &#xd;
	First, I demonstrate that tail feather brightness is correlated with winter habitat quality in Jamaica, suggesting that plumage may act as a status signal during the non-breeding season. Stable-carbon isotopes analyzed from claws of redstarts arriving on the breeding grounds confirm the association between ornamentation and winter territory quality. Second, I demonstrate that redstarts arriving to breed in southern Ontario from high-quality winter habitats arrive earlier, resulting in a lower probability of paternity loss, a higher probability of achieving polygyny, and higher genetic fledging success. Third, I demonstrate that tail feather brightness, associated with winter territory quality, predicts the likelihood of polygyny during the breeding season, indicating that tail brightness is associated with performance during two phases of the annual cycle. Paternity is predicted by both tail and flank colouration. Finally, I demonstrate that reported trade-offs between reproductive effort and plumage ornamentation as manifested by moult-migration in redstarts is likely an artifact of high variation in local stable-hydrogen isotope signatures (δD) and occasional feather loss and re-growth during the over-wintering period. Thus, moult-migration does not appear to be an important carry-over effect in redstarts. This work demonstrates that plumage may be under selection during both stationary phases of the annual cycle. Furthermore, it suggests that carry-over effects from the non-breeding season can influence evolutionary processes such as sexual selection and highlights the importance of considering selective pressures and events occurring throughout the annual cycle in studying the behaviour and ecology of migratory animals.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-22 14:36:47.279</description>
   <description>Rationale: Consumers of the mental health system with serious mental illness have been deprived of meaningful occupations since de-institutionalization began in the late 20th century.Community mental health policy has failed to focus on the meaningful occupational lives of this group of service users. Given the disparity in activity and meaningful time use for people with serious mental illness when compared to the general population, it is clear that a treatment that draws attention to occupational balance and engagement is needed. As balanced time use has been shown to increase community adjustment and life satisfaction, it is an important area of focus. &#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to pilot test the efficacy of a new occupational time use intervention, provisionally titled “Action over Inertia,” designed to increase occupational balance and engagement in the lives of people with serious mental illness living in the community. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: A prospective, multi-centre randomized controlled trial of the intervention, involving 5 Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams in southeastern Ontario,ran in Fall 2007/Winter 2008. 18 ACT clients took part in the 12 week intervention, which was delivered by the ACT team occupational therapists. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Time use, used as a measure of occupational balance, shifted away from sleep to increased general activity in the treatment group(p=0.05). Treatment and control groups did not differ on occupational engagement measures after the completion of the trial. Feedback on the clinical utility of the intervention was very positive from both therapists and treatment participants. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: This pilot test revealed initially positive data on the efficacy and clinical utility of the intervention.Further study of the “Action over Inertia” intervention is needed on a larger scale, potentially with a longer treatment timeline to further investigate its usefulness.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-22 16:42:01.272</description>
   <description>The use of microorganisms notably bacteria in mineral processing industry is presently one of the leading emerging pre-treatment techniques being employed for the processing of double refractory gold ores and concentrates. Currently numerous studies are in progress to further improve upon the efficiency of the bacterial process and to investigate the potential of other microorganisms.&#xd;
In this study, microbial pre-treatment of double refractory gold ore (sample A) and concentrate (sample B) was investigated using a white-rot fungus, Tramestes versicolor (ATTC 20869). Pulp density, temperature, pH and retention times were the process variables considered. &#xd;
Preliminary studies investigated the amenability of selected pure sulfide sulfur minerals, various types of coal and ore sample A to fungal degradation. Various pre-treatment scenarios were also studied to optimize gold extraction. These were single stage, a two-step and two stage processes involving the well known chemolithotrophic bacteria Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (ATTC 15494), Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (ATTC 19859) and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans (ATTC 53992), the bacterium, Streptomyces setonii (ATTC 39116) and the white-rot fungus, Tramestes versicolor.&#xd;
Preliminary results for sample A indicated that T. versicolor did not degrade sulfides significantly at its optimum growth conditions (pH range of 4.5 – 5.0)  and carbonaceous matter was not degraded but rather passivated as preg-robbing decreased significantly. Lignite was inert to passivation by T. versicolor unlike bituminous coal and to lower extent anthracite. Stimulated alkaline conditions (pH range of 9.5 – 10.5) recorded the overall best sulfur oxidation.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results of both the single stage and two-step processes confirmed that carbonaceous matter was passivated by T. versicolor; as preg-robbing decreased significantly from 18.1% to ≤ 1.0%. Gold extraction by cyanidation of the pre-treated sample A was 82.5% for the two-step as against 80.5 % for the single stage and 15.0% for the untreated sample. Application of the two-step and single stage process conditions to sample B resulted in 93.3% and 89.9% gold extraction respectively as against untreated concentrate of 30.5%. For the various two stage pre-treatment processes investigated, the abiotic - S. setonii process recorded the best gold extraction of 81.5% for sample A.&#xd;
&#xd;
S. Setonii degraded carbonaceous matter unlike T. versicolor which passivated it. However, it takes only 3 - 7 days for T. versicolor to effect passivation and eliminate preg-robbing while 14 - 56 days is required for S. setonii to degrade carbonaceous matter significantly.&#xd;
&#xd;
The result of the novel microbial pre-treatment process indicated that sulfide sulfur was degraded under alkaline conditions and carbonaceous matter passivated by T. versicolor at its optimum growth conditions. This led to a significant improvement in gold extraction from the double refractory gold ore and concentrate investigated.</description>

   <description>This paper takes as its starting point the fact of reasonable pluralism and defends political liberalism as the best means of accommodating diversity and a plurality of different conceptions of the good. I then ask what is needed for a social order characterized by diversity and a multiplicity of different ways of life to come into existence and perpetuate itself over time. First, I defend political liberalism and argue that the creation of a society that is accommodating of diversity requires that the state be mindful of the spillover effects between public institutions and the private lives of citizens. Second, I argue that the individuals living in such a society must adopt certain virtues, both publicly as well as privately. I achieve this by presenting an account of the virtues of citizens in a political liberal society. Third, I draw out the implications of having a society characterized by reasonable pluralism and many different conceptions of the good, by arguing that such a society should avoid adopting too expansive a role, since an overly ambitious conception of social justice risks stifling the diversity a political liberal society is trying to protect. I conclude with some general remarks about the current state of liberal theorizing and the need for liberal theorists to provide an account of liberalism that includes more than one’s conception of distributive justice and legitimate state coercion.</description>

   <description>Background: There is currently no standard method of diagnosing the presence or severity of concussion in acute primary care settings.  This pilot project is part of a larger study to develop a Computerized Concussion Assessment Tool (CCAT).&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: A prospective observational clinical study was conducted to explore the validity of the CCAT among patients presenting to the Emergency Department at Kingston General Hospital and at Hotel Dieu Hospital (Kingston, Ontario) with minor head injury.  Twenty-two patients with concussion and eighteen patients with head injury (but not diagnosed with concussion) were recruited to the study.  All participants completed a background questionnaire, several neurocognitive tests and the CCAT assessment.  Performance on the CCAT was compared between these two groups.  Data collected during the development phase of the CCAT from a Normal Volunteers group (n=68) were used in an additional comparison.  CCAT Scores for Selective Attention, Divided Attention and Memory were compared with standard neurocognitive tests through correlational analyses.  In addition, the validity and clinical yield of the CCAT were investigated relative to gold standard measures.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: After adjustment for covariates, no statistically significant differences were found between the three participant groups for any of the three primary CCAT Scores (Selective Attention, Divided Attention and Memory).  Correlational analyses showed that the CCAT Selective Attention Score and the CCAT Memory Score are moderately correlated with standard neurocognitive tests.  There was no correlation observed for the CCAT Divided Attention Score and its associated neurocognitive test.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: The CCAT was unable to discriminate between concussed patients and non-concussed individuals.  However, moderate correlations observed between the CCAT Scores for Memory and Selective Attention and their respective neurocognitive tests support a view that there should be optimism for the future development of the CCAT.  Issues related to the feasibility of the study and its administration in the emergency department setting are discussed.</description>

   <description>Mental disorders are among the most prevalent of chronic diseases, and high rates of these disorders have been consistently found in jails and prisons. This study was a retrospective case series that described the population of adults charged with a criminal offense who were court ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment within the Medical Legal Service in Santiago, Chile from 2005-2006. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in the distribution of variables by sex and by criminal responsibility. Exploratory analyses using polytomous logistic regression were conducted in order to assess variables that might be predictive of the outcome of criminal responsibility as recommended by the psychiatrist. Of the evaluated offenders, approximately 84% were considered by a psychiatrist to be criminally responsible for their crime, 7% were regarded as having diminished criminal responsibility, 4% were considered to be not criminally responsible for their crime, and 4% were cases where criminal responsibility was not applicable. The following variables were found to be significant in the exploratory model: sex, age, occupational status, psychiatric pathology, recommendation of treatment, and recommendation of hospitalization. An offender determined by the psychiatrist to have a psychiatric pathology had the highest increase in odds of being considered to have diminished criminal responsibility or of being considered not criminally responsible. Results from this investigation will contribute to international knowledge about forensic psychiatry and mental health in Latin America.</description>

   <description>Sedimentological analyses of sediment traps and 289 years (1717-2006) of varved sediments from Shadow Bay (60.01°N, 159.18°W), Lake Chauekuktuli were compared to available hydrometeorological data in order to investigate basin response to hydroclimatic variability in southwest Alaska. On a subannual timescale, the characteristics of the coarse basal unit typical of clastic varves were controlled by spring snowmelt and runoff, while the fine-grained cap was shaped by fall and winter conditions. Coarse subannual laminations within the clay cap were associated with autumn storm activity and winter warming events brought about by the interplay between regional maritime and continental air masses. Biogenic silica (BSi) profiles show two annual peaks in siliceous algal deposition; the first occurred at the end of the spring freshet, the second in the late summer. &#xd;
&#xd;
On an annual timescale, varve thickness was dependent on total annual discharge (r2=0.75, n=43, p&lt;0.0001), while maximum annual grain size was determined to be dependent on both maximum spring discharge (r2=0.63, n=43, p&lt;0.0001) and total annual discharge (r2=0.61, n=43, p&lt;0.0001). On interannual timescales, relationships between climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) and both regional discharge and varve thickness were insignificant. When the same data sets were analyzed on multidecadal timescales, regime shifts in varve thickness and total annual discharge coherent with shifts in NP and PDO indices were identified. Periods of increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low. &#xd;
&#xd;
The 289-year varve record was used to reconstruct PDO dynamics prior to 1900. Multidecadal shifts were apparent throughout the 19th century, but were absent in the 18th century. This study provides insight into the linkages between regional climate, physical and biological deposition, and can be used to improve the interpretation of seasonal and annual-scale paleoclimate reconstructions for basins similar to Shadow Bay. This study also sheds light on the nature of multidecadal climate variability in the Pacific Northwest region prior to the instrumental record.</description>

   <description>MOB (Mps One Binder) is a conserved gene family found in all major kingdoms. The MOB genes are essential components acting in mitotic exit and cytokinesis in both budding and fission yeasts. They are further identified as tumor suppressors in Drosophila (D.) melanogaster. Recently, they are found to be involved in the emerging Drosophila Hippo-LATS tumor suppressor pathway. Seven human homologs of yeast MOB (hMOB1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3, 4, 5) have been discovered. The hMOB1B is the gene that has been extensively studied and is reported to be required for the activation of LATS (Large Tumor Suppressor)/NDR (Nuclear Dbf2-related) protein kinase family, however, the functional significance of the gene remains unknown. This study is the first to elucidate the biological and biochemical functions of all seven human MOBs. By examining hMOB mRNA expression in various human tissues, we found that the hMOBs have exhibited different expression patterns. We also investigated the subcellular localization of hMOBs during interphase through immunofluorescent analysis. While hMOB2A is localized in the cytoplasm, hMOB4 is exclusively found in the nucleus. All of the other hMOBs are localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, we identified hMOB1A and hMOB1B as the main binding partners of LATS and NDR in vitro. Additionally, we successfully identified a region on hMOB1B for the interaction with LATS or NDR and determined the crucial residue that is responsible for the binding of LATS2 with hMOB1B. Most significantly, we found that over-expression of hMOB1B in human cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell death. Moreover, hMOB1B when targeted to the plasma membrane dramatically enhances the phenotype. Conversely, small interfering (si) RNA-mediated suppression of either endogenous hMOB1A or hMOB1B causes increased cell proliferation, whereas suppression of both hMOB1A and hMOB1B demonstrates a more significant enhancement in tumor cell growth. Moreover, co-expression of both LATS and hMOB1B targeted to the plasma membrane completely abolishes cell proliferation. Our findings provide convincing evidence that hMOB1A and hMOB1B function as negative regulators of cell proliferation and as pro-apoptotic proteins. Understanding hMOBs functions in the cell and their possible role in tumorigenesis can provide important information for the diagnosis and treatment of human cancers.</description>

   <description>With the focus of the automotive industry on decreasing vehicle weight and improving fuel efficiency, aluminum is being used for structural components in automobiles.  Given the high strain rates associated with vehicle impact, it is necessary to understand the rate sensitivity of any potential alloy (eg. AA5754) in order to accurately predict deformation behaviour.  Furthermore, the magnitude and strain path associated with the residual strains remaining after forming of the component also play a major role in how the material will behave. &#xd;
It has been found that AA5754 sheet exhibits negative rate sensitivity up to a strain rate of 0.1/s, and positive strain rate sensitivity at strain rates between 0.1/s and 1500/s.  Increasing the strain rate also has the effect of increasing the yield stress as well as the ductility.  When a strain path change is involved between the prestrain stage and subsequent uniaxial loading, it has the effect of reducing the rate sensitivity of the material as well as reducing the overall flow stress.  A rate-sensitive adaptation of the Voce material model was successfully implemented in LS-DYNA and used to predict the response of AA5754 sheet in bending for applied strain rates of 0.001/s and 0.1/s.</description>

   <description>Polymer light emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are solid-state devices containing an active layer blend of luminescent polymer, ion transport material and salt sandwiched between two electrodes. They operate on the principal of in situ electrochemical doping. Doping entails the injection of electronic charge from the electrodes, causing the reduction/oxidization of the luminescent polymer, and accompanied by charge compensation through the redistribution of salt counter-ions. Due to the high conductivity of the doped polymer, a fully turned on LEC has a dramatically reduced contact and bulk resistance. This gives the LEC certain intrinsic advantages such as balanced charge injection, low operating voltage and high quantum efficiencies, even when stable metal or symmetric electrodes are used. These properties have led to the popular assumption that the electrode work function is not a critical device parameter for LEC operation.&#xd;
In this thesis, I describe my original research to determine how the electrode composition influences LEC performance. A series of sandwich and planar configuration LECs with various electrodes on identical MEH-PPV (poly[5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2-methoxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene]):PEO (poly ethylene oxide):LiTr (Lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate) based films are constructed. I demonstrate that the doping profile, doping propagation speed, emission zone shape, emission zone location, electro-luminescence (EL) turn-on, and EL efficiency are all strongly affected by the choice of electrode materials. LECs with asymmetrical electrodes optimized for both electron and hole injection result in the best overall performance.&#xd;
Using an optimized electrode configuration, I am able to realize extremely large crown ether based planar LECs. MEH-PPV: dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DCH18Cr6): LiTr and 108GE:DCH18Cr6:LiTr devices with various symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations were constructed, where 108GE is the fluorene copolymer poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-divinylene-fluorenylene)-alt-co-(2-methoxy-5-(ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)]. I demonstrate&#xd;
ii i&#xd;
and image the first ever crown ether-based planar LECs with millimeter inter-electrode spacing. Due to minimal phase separation, crown ether-based LECs display highly uniform doping propagation and very smooth emission zones. Junction relaxation, de-doping and reverse bias operation experiments are also presented, and results compared to behavior in PEO based LECs. Additionally, I demonstrate that crown ether-based LECs do not exhibit frozen junction behavior at room temperature.</description>

   <description>Plant growth and development is largely controlled in regions of totipotential cells around the plant body called meristems. The well characterized shoot and root apical meristems are responsible for vertical growth, in which many key players have been well studied.  Lateral (secondary) growth is controlled by the vascular and cork cambiums, which are much less understood. A rapid growth of interest in a new model angiosperm tree, poplar, has facilitated the study of the two cambiums, specifically into their regulation at the genomic and proteomic levels. This study describes recent work carried out to explore the genetic regulation of secondary growth in poplar. Two genes have been identified that were previously not associated with the process of secondary growth. The first, a gene lacking annotation (FM#2), was identified through the investigation of a mutant from an activation-tagged population of poplar. This mutant showed aberrant secondary growth, with an increase in the phloem:xylem ratio. It also developed a thick, rough bark, and was subsequently named corky. Constructs to recapitulate this phenotype have been produced to allow the link between the gene FM#2 and the corky phenotype to be firmly established. The second gene was identified through a reverse genetics strategy to test if the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem regulator, CLAVATA1 also played a role in the regulation of the vascular cambium. When it was downregulated in Arabidopsis, a significant increase in secondary growth was observed. Antisense and hairpin-RNAi constructs were produced to attempt downregulation of the gene in poplar using both traditional Agrobacterium-mediated transformations, and the recently developed strategy of induced somatic sector analysis.</description>

   <description>Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803-1863) set out on his only trip to Greece and Turkey in 1828 to return to France and produce visual images of the Orient at a time when no major European artist had traveled to the Near East and at a time when the Orient had yet to be experienced, understood, and interpreted. Decamps’ highly original and personal interpretation of the Orient in painting has been studied by present-day scholars exclusively within the context of Romantic Orientalist genre painting. Studying criticism written on his work throughout the 19th century and working closely with his paintings, certain issues in his Orientalist paintings question the longstanding categorization of his work as solely Romantic Orientalist genre paintings. The fact that the artist never returned to the Orient; the fact that he invested his Orientalist landscapes with a Rembrandesque rather than Oriental light; his constant inclusion of contrasting opposites in the ostensibly subdued compositions he produced; the striking differences between his Oriental visual expressions and those of his Romantic contemporaries; and his own sentiment of being a failed artist, reveal alternative, less settled, readings of his work.  Studying Decamps’ Orientalist oeuvre in its social and political contexts and taking into account the artist’s personal ambitions demonstrates the lasting resonance of this work, of the artist’s highly original working methods, and of his innovative technique.  This study provides an assessment of Decamps’ Oriental work; it also delineates its relevance and influence in movements beyond Romanticism and into trends that developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Urban &amp; Regional Planning) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-23 19:11:37.053</description>
   <description>The Fort Albany First Nation (FAFN) in Ontario’s western James Bay region is interested in undertaking a community-based process of land use planning for its traditional territory, in order to respond to increasing resource development pressure within the area.  To construct a framework for such a process, semi-structured interviews were held with 12 members of the FAFN and two staff members of the Mushkegowuk Council, which represents the FAFN at the regional level.  Interviews focused on the substantive values that community members see as worthy of protection or management through the land use plan, and on the procedural values that ought to guide the process.  In addition, three group discussions on valued ecosystem components were observed, to supplement interview data on substantive values.&#xd;
	The results indicate that the community is concerned with preserving their way of life in the face of resource development pressure and social change, by protecting subsistence resources and strengthening the transmission of culture.  Substantively, this means that the land use plan needs to protect wildlife and its habitat, navigable waterways, and water quality.  Procedurally, this means that the planning process should engage the entire community in discussions of its cultural identity and connection to the land, in order to build a genuine consensus on appropriate land uses.  It was felt that the process should be grassroots-based, that the FAFN should initiate the process autonomously, and that the planning process should pursue the twin goals of community self-determination and cultural continuity.  It was also felt that neighbouring first nations should be invited to participate in the process or to conduct separate planning activities streamlined with those of the FAFN, because of overlap in traditional territories.&#xd;
	At the conclusion of this thesis, a set of recommendations outlines a planning process that is appropriate to the needs and values expressed by participants.  This framework draws upon the principles of empowerment, advocacy, and collaborative planning, applying them to the local cultural context.  It relies upon social learning as a vehicle by which to develop a community-wide vision for the traditional territory of the FAFN.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we describe how the balancing of the $\operatorname{Tor}$ functor can be used to compute the minimal free resolution of a graded module $M$ over the polynomial ring $B=\mathbb{K}[X_0,\dots,X_m]$ ($\mathbb{K}$ a field $X_i$'s indeterminates).  Using a correspondence due to R. Stanley and M. Hochster, we explicitly show how this approach can be used in the case when $M=\mathbb{K}[S]$,&#xd;
the semigroup ring of a subsemigroup $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}^l$ (containing $0$) over $\mathbb{K}$ and when $M$ is a monomial ideal of $B$.&#xd;
   &#xd;
We also study the class of affine semigroup rings for which $\mathbb{K}[S]\cong B/\mathfrak{p}$ is the homogeneous coordinate ring of a monomial curve in $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{K}}$.  We use easily computable combinatorial and arithmetic properties of $S$ to define a notion which we call stabilization. We provide a direct proof showing how stabilization gives a bound on the $\mathbb{N}$-graded degree of minimal generators of $\mathfrak{p}$ and also show that it is related to the regularity of $\mathfrak{p}$.   Moreover, we partition the above mentioned class into three cases and show that this partitioning is reflected in how the regularity is attained.   An interesting consequence is that the regularity of $\mathfrak{p}$ can be effectively computed by elementary means.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-24 14:00:39.679</description>
   <description>One of the major challenges associated with cancer therapy is the acquisition of chemoresistance by tumour cells.  Many novel therapeutic approaches to overcome chemoresistance have involved targeting specific signalling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, a stress response pathway known to be involved in the regulation of cell survival, apoptosis and growth.  The present study sought to determine the effect of PI3K inhibition on the resistance of human cancer cells to various chemotherapeutic agents.  Treatment with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or Compound 15e resulted in resistance to doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine in breast (MDA-MB-231) carcinoma cells as determined by clonogenic assays.  Increased survival following PI3K inhibition was also observed in prostate (DU-145), colon (HCT-116) and lung (A-549) carcinoma cell lines exposed to doxorubicin. Drug resistance mediated by LY294002 was correlated with a decrease in cell proliferation, which was linked to an increase in the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.  Inhibition of PI3K signalling also resulted in higher levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1.  Knockdown of p21Waf1/Cip1 expression with siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in LY294002-induced resistance.  However, the effect of p27Kip1 knockdown on LY294002-induced resistance was inconclusive because of high inter-experimental variability.  Furthermore, knockdown of either p21waf1/cip1 or p27Kip1 did not overtly prevent LY294002-induced cell cycle delay.  Incubation in the presence of LY294002 after exposure to doxorubicin resulted in decreased cell survival.  These findings provide evidence that PI3K inhibition leads to chemoresistance in human cancer cells by causing a delay in cell cycle.  However, the timing of PI3K inhibition (either before or after exposure to anti-cancer agents) is a critical determinant of chemosensitivity.  Since the efficiency of most chemotherapeutic agents depends on the rate of cell proliferation, delays in cell cycle progression may be an important mechanism of chemoresistance.</description>

   <description>Engineering education serves to provide society with competent engineering graduates, capable of making a difference to their profession and the world around them. Since the Grinter Report of the 1950s in the United States, engineering education has focused its approach upon improving the technical and analytical competencies of engineering students.  Many practicing engineers find that recent graduates are adequately developing their technical skills but are lacking in a deep-knowledge of engineering’s core creative process: design.&#xd;
Although there has been an increase in design instruction in some engineering programs, there is typically a lack of focus on related assessment, which forms a key part of the educational process. Students focus their efforts upon that which is being graded, resulting in students focusing on achieving deliverable requirements rather then on deeply learning the process and techniques of engineering design. The research question asked was: will students be more likely to achieve core course objectives and learning goals in an intensive, multidisciplinary course by using a well tailored rubric-based assessment process, in comparison to a more “traditional” course assessment scheme?  Traditional course assessments often focus upon the success of a final deliverable for students to achieve a good mark, and in design courses can focus on the success of the final product. Student opinion towards its implementation and value in helping them reach learning goals was surveyed to determine the usefulness of the rubric in helping to reach course objectives and learning goals. These surveys indicated: strong student support for the use of a rubric system; a positive student response to the feedback being provided to them through weekly rubric-based advice; the rubric provided a suitable level of detail to be helpful to students in achieving course objectives; students were capable of internalizing the learning goals and using the assessment system to evaluate their peers; and finally that the assessment system was a viable alternative to traditional course assessments.</description>

   <description>Automated summarization is a difficult task.  World-class summarizers can provide only "best guesses" of which sentences encapsulate the important content from within a set of documents.  As automated systems continue to improve, users are still not given the means to observe complex relationships between seemingly independent concepts.  In this research we used singular value decompositions to organize concepts and determine the best candidate sentences for an automated summary.  The results from this straightforward attempt were comparable to world-class summarizers.  We then included a clustered tag cloud, using a singular value decomposition to measure term "interestingness" with respect to the set of documents. The combination of best candidate sentences and tag clouds provided a more inclusive summary than a traditionally-developed summarizer alone.</description>

   <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies performed to date have focused on brain structures rostral to the thalamus, although the first level of sensory information and pain transmission occurs at the spinal cord (SC).  The primary goal of this project is to map activity using fMRI, from the entire cervical SC and brainstem following innocuous and noxious stimuli before and after peripheral sensitization in normal human volunteers.  This study is unique in that it determines functional activity throughout the lower neural axis in response to mechanical stimuli that are perceived as painful only after sensitization.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Functional MRI studies of the SC were carried out in 18 healthy individuals in a 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio.  Innocuous touch and brush (n=8), and noxious touch (n=10) stimuli were applied before and after peripheral sensitization.  Peripheral sensitization was induced by topical application of capsaicin.  Functional image data spanned from the C7/T1 disc to the superior edge of the thalamus and analyzed using a general linear model to discriminate signal intensity changes from physiological motion.  Normalized results were combined to demonstrate the number of volunteers showing activity at each location on a voxel-by-voxel basis.  Areas of activity were superimposed onto anatomical transverse drawings and identified visually with comparison to several stereotaxic atlases. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results from this study confirm previous reports that a non-noxious stimulus translates into a pain response after peripheral sensitization.  The brush stimulus, before sensitization activated areas in the ipsilateral dorsal horn (DH), gracile and cuneate nuclei in the medulla and areas surrounding the dorsal column medial lemniscal pathway.  Peripheral sensitization produced activity in the contralateral ventral horn (VH), typical of a pain response.  The innocuous von Frey stimulus produced activity in typical sensory centres in the DH and brainstem before sensitization, and areas more consistent with a noxious response after sensitization.  When examining equi-nociceptive stimuli in a control versus sensitized state, the noxious touch stimuli showed similar activation patterns even though the force of the filaments were different.  In all experiments there was indication of descending modulation as activity was observed in the periaqueductal gray, midbrain red nuclei and pontine reticular formation.  This study demonstrates how non-painful and pain information is transmitted from the dorsal spinal horn to the brain in healthy individuals and how peripheral sensitization induces changes in non-noxious stimuli that correlate with pain sensory transmission.</description>

   <description>The Oak Ridges Moraine, located in south-central Ontario, is recognized for its ecological importance in providing “clean and abundant water resources, healthy and diverse plant and animal habitat, an attractive and distinct landscape, prime agricultural land, and sand and gravel resources” (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2002). It is protected by the&#xd;
Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan (2002). A number of initiatives are ongoing to develop monitoring capabilities across the Oak Ridges Moraine (Monitoring the Moraine&#xd;
Project, 2008; Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs, 2008). The purpose of this thesis is to develop and test a multi-party policy monitoring framework to determine if infrastructure environmental assessments on the Oak Ridges Moraine comply with the policies of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan (ORMCP) and meet best practices of environmental assessment identified in the literature. The multi-party policy monitoring framework&#xd;
developed for this research has two dimensions:&#xd;
1. A moraine-wide survey and map of infrastructure environmental assessments&#xd;
contributing to a “governance watch” (Francis, 2006a; Francis, 2006b) perspective of infrastructure; and&#xd;
2. An evaluation of an infrastructure environmental assessment case study (York&#xd;
Region’s Lower Leslie Street Trunk Sewer and 19th Avenue Interceptor Sewer) against a set of criteria to determine if it complies with the ORMCP and environmental assessment best practices.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results of the environmental assessment map show a distinctive pattern of infrastructure development, concentrated in the eastern half of the moraine, and within&#xd;
designated settlement areas. That being said, infrastructure networks are expanding to connect settlement areas outside the Greater Toronto Area. The environmental assessment map shows the importance of thinking of infrastructure as a networked system, rather than as discrete projects.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results of the case study evaluation showed that the Lower Leslie Street Trunk Sewer and 19th Avenue Interceptor Sewer Environmental Assessment complied with the minimal requirements of Section 41 of the ORMCP, and in some cases went above and beyond the requirements of the ORMCP. The results suggest, however, that some criteria drawn from the literature, would be better addressed by strategic environmental assessment of infrastructure master plans.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-24 23:24:01.907</description>
   <description>The scaling of VLSI technology has allowed extensive integration of processing resources&#xd;
on a single chip. Consequently, programmable chips is able to have a high logic and memory&#xd;
capacity for implementation of complex systems. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with their embedded memory and other specialized functionality have become viable&#xd;
alternatives in many cases to costly application-specific integrated circuits as a system-on-chip (SoC) substrate. However, on-chip bus-based interconnects are no longer suitable for complex SoC design because of its limited scalability. The network-on-chip (NoC)paradigm has therefore emerged as a scalable approach for addressing this challenge.&#xd;
&#xd;
FPGAs can also adopt the NoC paradigm in order to support more complex SoC implementations. The elements for NoC support can be implemented in conventional programmable logic within an FPGA, however, a dedicated approach for these NoC elements&#xd;
can lead to better performance and more efficient utilization of on-chip FPGA resources. A fixed network topology can be a disadvantage in NoC platforms due to misalignment with application requirements. It is therefore desirable to incorporate a certain level of configurability even for embedded NoC support within an FPGA.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents the design and implementation of a configurable router intended as a dedicated embedded module for NoC support in an FPGA. The goal is to provide a general NoC infrastructure for the FPGA platform that balances trade-offs with regard to logic complexity, resource utilization, and flexibility. The configurable router provides flexibility in implementing a variety of network topologies with the convenience of a 3-bit input to the router for configuration. All of the necessary routing functionality for each topology is implemented in logic for performance and area efficiency. The overall&#xd;
router design provides general NoC support with reduced complexity, thereby achieving&#xd;
area efficiency and an adequate clock frequency for typical operation in conjunction with embedded soft processors.&#xd;
&#xd;
Synthesis results are presented at the router level in order to characterize the hardware overhead for implementations in programmable logic as well as standard-cell technology, and at the system-level in order to evaluate overall system resource utilization. Operational results are shown at router level to demonstrate correctness and at system level to demonstrate&#xd;
functionality of the multiprocessor systems that utilizes the configurable router.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-24 23:40:45.915</description>
   <description>Thomas Pogge has famously argued that the present arrangement of international institutions that allows for human rights violations to occur on an ongoing basis is unjust, and further, that powerful states that create and maintain these institutions are responsible for the resulting human rights violations.  By setting the rules of economic and political interaction in the global forum, the world’s rich and powerful stack the deck against the global poor, making sustainable development difficult and making extreme poverty, malnutrition, and premature death common outcomes.  Pogge concludes that this implication of responsibility creates a moral requirement for powerful nations to take immediate steps to reform the global institutional order in such a way as to minimize the number of foreseeable human rights violations that occur within it.&#xd;
	I believe that Pogge is only partly correct in his analysis.  In this paper, I argue that the global institutional order, which is comprised of a complex web of global and regional organizations with both political and economic aims, is not unjust as Pogge suggests.  However, even if the maintenance of these institutions does not constitute an injustice, I believe that there remains an important sense in which powerful states that support the present arrangement of international institutions are responsible for ongoing subsistence rights violations.  Establishing this responsibility means that states that continue to support present institutions are then also morally responsible for ensuring these human rights violations are remedied as a matter of justice.&#xd;
	In his 2007 book National Responsibility and Global Justice, David Miller provides the sort of account of responsibility that I believe is lacking in Pogge’s work.  Differentiating between moral responsibility, outcome responsibility, and causal responsibility, Miller shows that what we mean when we determine a party is “responsible” for a particular outcome can depend on several factors, viz., the foreseeability and the justification for harm.  I argue that the sorts of remedies that are required in cases of moral responsibility, outcome responsibility, and causal responsibility turn out to be quite different from one another.</description>

   <description>This study is an examination of Gerrit Dou’s Violin Player (1653, Liechtenstein, Vaduz Castle, Princely Collection). The painting is a visual testimony to Dou’s manual skills and trompe l’oeil manner of painting in his own innovative fijnschilder painting style. The composition incorporates and reinvents devices from a variety of sources from portraiture, genre painting, and emblem literature, such as the arched niche window framing the violinist. The work demonstrates the connection between music and painting in the relationship between the violinist and the background setting of an artist’s workshop. Through an iconographic analysis of works depicting the artist in the studio by Dou and his contemporaries the correlation between music playing and painting becomes evident. In this context, this relationship acts as an important device in fashioning the painter’s image as an elevated and scholarly artist and brings to light the power of music as a mode of inspiration for the painter in the studio. Additionally, tobacco smoking, which appears in many seventeenth-century Dutch self-portraits, in the context of the studio, was also perceived as an inspirational tool for the artist, thus contrasting with smoking in genre scenes of the lower classes as a symbol of waste and idleness. The work, similarly to other Dutch seventeenth-century paintings, is not a realistic representation but a cleverly constructed image that acts as an allegorical master deception for the amusement and entertainment of an educated, upper-class clientele.</description>

   <description>The progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), the most common cause of physical disability in older adults, is influenced by muscular and biomechanical factors.  Reliability of muscular and biomechanical measures, including knee muscle strength and limb alignment, is critical.  Furthermore, conservative interventions that slow the course of OA disease progression and prevent disability are urgently needed.  The objectives of this thesis were to:  1) investigate the reliability of measures of knee muscle strength and alignment in persons with knee OA, and 2) determine the influence of an exercise intervention targeting hip muscles on knee joint loading in those with medial knee OA.  &#xd;
	In the first study reliability of knee muscle strength measures was evaluated within one testing session in 40 persons with knee OA.  Isometric and isokinetic peak torque values for the quadriceps and hamstring muscles demonstrated high degrees of intra-session reliability.  &#xd;
	Reliability of lower limb alignment measures was determined following a bone landmark-based approach with use of a computer program.  Excellent reliability coefficients were found which compared favorably with reliability of manual measures from schematics of limb deformities drawn with AutoCAD® software.  When the computer method was applied to 100 full-limb radiographs of persons with or at risk for knee OA, alignment measures demonstrated high inter- and intra-reader reliability.&#xd;
	Hip muscle weakness may influence loading of the medial knee compartment.  Hip abductor strength was evaluated in 40 individuals with medial compartment knee OA in comparison to a control group of 40 healthy older adults. The effect of an 8-week home-based hip abductor strengthening program on the knee adduction moment was also assessed in this group with knee OA, compared with the control group which received no intervention.  Following the exercise program the OA group demonstrated improvements in hip abductor strength and functional performance on a sit-to-stand task.  There were no changes in the knee adduction moment.  Thus, hip muscle strengthening did not influence joint loading, but may improve function in persons with knee OA.&#xd;
	Results from this thesis provide increased understanding of knee OA, from muscular and biomechanical perspectives, in the areas of measurement reliability and exercise intervention.</description>

   <description>The development of controls for the execution of concurrent code is non-trivial. This work shows how existing discrete-event system (DES) theory can be successfully applied to this problem. From code without concurrency controls and a specification of desired behaviours, a DES representation of the problem is obtained, and then used to generate concurrency control code. By applying rigorously proven DES theory, the resulting code comes with guarantees not present in similar works.  All control schemes generated in DES are nonblocking, yielding code that is free of both livelock and deadlock. Additionally, the generated control scheme is minimally restrictive, meaning only problematic behaviours are prevented.&#xd;
&#xd;
If the specifications cannot be enforced as presented, the largest controllable subset is instead enforced.  The result, which requires no further interaction to generate, is the best possible control scheme given the interaction between the specifications and the original code. Existing methods encounter difficulties when faced with multiple specifications that interact to form deadlocks.  Modular DES theory is successfully applied, allowing resolution of these conflicts without requiring the user to introduce new specifications. Moreover, the approach is independent of specific programming or specification languages. A Java implementation is given, along with two problems showing the process in action.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to examine the photophysical and structural properties of Cu(I) complexes of 2-(2’-pyridyl)benzimidazolyl based ligands and Cu(I), Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes of 2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl based ligands, for possible use as phosphorescent emitters in OLEDs.  The discovery of the atropisomeric 3,3’-bis(2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl based ligands led to the examination of C-C coupling reactions and the investigation of the new chiral ligands with transition metal ions.&#xd;
     Cu(I) complexes of 2-(2’pyridyl)benzimidazolyl-benzene with varying phosphine ligands were prepared.  The structures were studied with X-ray crystallography and NMR.  Experimental and computational results established that steric and electronic properties of the phosphine ligands influence the photophysical properties of the Cu(I) complexes. Polynuclear Cu(I) complexes with 2-(2’-pyridyl)benzimidazolyl based ligands and two PPh3 ancillary ligands were synthesized, the photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties were examined.&#xd;
    A series of 2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl based ligands; 2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl-benzene (pib), 1,4-bis[2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl]benzene (bib) and 1,3,5-tris[2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl]benzene) (tib) and the corresponding C-C coupled dimers bis[3,3’(2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl-benzene)] (bpib), bis[3,3’(1,4-bis[2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl]benzene (bbib) and bis[3,3’(1,3,5-tris[2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl]benzene)] (btib) were synthesized in a one-pot reaction with the formation of both C-N and C-C bonds.  The photophysical properties of these new molecules were investigated.  The dimers display intramolecular exciplex formation.  The rotation barrier around the C-C bond in the 3 position of the bis-indole was calculated using DFT which support that bpib is an atropisomeric ligand.&#xd;
     Cu(I), Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes were synthesized with pib and bpib.  [Cu(pib)(PPh3)2]+ contains a three-coordinate Cu(I) ion and doesn’t display MLCT but rather 3π-1π phosphorescence.  In Pd(pib)(acac) and Pt(pib)(DMSO)Cl the pib ligand forms C,N chelated neutral complexes that display red emission in frozen solution and in solid state.  The X-ray crystal structure for [Cu(bpib)2]+ revealed a homo-chiral crystal and for Pd(bpib)Cl2 and Pt(bpib)Cl¬2 show a trans-chelating geometry around the metal centre.  Frozen solutions of [Cu(bpib)2]+ and Pd(bpib)Cl2 display MCLT phosphorescence.&#xd;
     Finally the atropisomeric ligands bpib and bbib were examined as sensors to determine the enantiomeric excess of Zn(2-bromo-3-methylbutyrate)2 by CD spectroscopy.  CD and fluorescent titration experiments verified that these ligands have selective interactions with different Zn(II) carboxylates.  DFT computations showed that diastereomeric excess caused by chiral discrimination leads to the CD spectral-response of the atropisomeric ligands toward chiral Zn(II) carboxylates.</description>

   <description>Chip temperature is increasing with continued technology scaling due to increased power density and decreased device feature sizes. Since temperature has significant impact on performance and reliability, accurate thermal and circuit analysis are of great importance. Due to the shrinking device feature size, effects occurring at the nanometre scale, such as ballistic transport of energy carriers and electron tunneling, have become increasingly important and must be considered. However, many existing thermal and circuit analysis methods are not able to consider these effects efficiently, if at all. This thesis presents methods for accurate and efficient multi-scale thermal and circuit analysis. For circuit analysis, the simulation of single-electron device circuits is specifically studied.&#xd;
&#xd;
To target thermal analysis, in this work, ThermalScope, a multi-scale thermal analysis method for nanometre-scale IC design is developed. It unifies microscopic and macroscopic thermal physics modeling methods, i.e., the Boltzmann transport and Fourier modeling methods. Moreover, it supports adaptive multi-resolution modeling. Together, these ideas enable efficient and accurate characterization of nanometre-scale heat transport as well as chip-package level heat flow. ThermalScope is designed for full chip thermal analysis of billion-transistor nanometre-scale IC designs, with accuracy at the scale of individual devices. ThermalScope has been implemented in software and used for full chip thermal analysis and temperature-dependent leakage analysis of an IC design with more than 150 million transistors.&#xd;
&#xd;
To target circuit analysis, in this work, SEMSIM, a multi-scale single-electron device simulator is developed with an adaptive simulation technique based on the Monte Carlo method. This technique significantly improves the time efficiency while maintaining accuracy for single-electron device and circuit simulation. It is shown that it is possible to reduce simulation time up to nearly 40 times and maintain an average propagation delay error of under 5% compared to a non-adaptive Monte Carlo method. This simulator has been used to handle large circuit benchmarks with more than 6000 junctions, showing efficiency comparable to SPICE, with much better accuracy. In addition, the simulator can characterize important secondary effects including cotunneling and Cooper pair tunneling, which are critical for device research.</description>

   <title>Training-induced plasticity in the visual cortex of adult rats following visual discrimination learning</title>

   <description>Synaptic plasticity plays a key role in processes of learning and memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a relatively stable enhancement of synaptic transmission following specific patterns of electrical stimulation. Some types of learning (e.g. motor learning, fear conditioning) result in&#xd;
LTP-like changes at synapses. However, no studies have examined LTP-like plasticity in the visual cortex as a result of visual discrimination learning.&#xd;
A visual discrimination task was used to examine changes in LTP in the primary visual&#xd;
cortex (V1) of adult rats. Rats were placed in a Y-shaped water maze and required to swim to one choice arm containing a hidden platform. Distinct visual cues indicated the presence (CS+) and absence (CS-) of the platform. Rats learned to reliably discriminate the visual cues to successfully&#xd;
navigate the maze. Control rats received the same procedure, but the visual cues did not have a predictive relation with the platform. Following training, trained, control, and task-naïve rats were&#xd;
anesthetized and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in V1 were recorded in response to CS+, CS-, and novel stimuli.&#xd;
Results indicate that, in both task-naïve and control animals, all visual stimuli elicit VEPs of similar (p > 0.05) amplitude. In contrast, trained animals show significantly larger amplitude VEPs to stimuli encountered during training relative to novel stimuli, regardless of whether&#xd;
stimuli act as CS+ or CS-. In addition, trained animals show 71% and controls 47% potentiation (p &lt; .05) that was induced by electrical (theta-burst) stimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) indicating greater plasticity of thalamocortical synapses following training. There were no&#xd;
differences between controls and task-naïve animals. This facilitation of LTP was shown to allow past visual experience to influence the efficiency of encoding novel visual features.&#xd;
These experiments demonstrate that visual discrimination learning might involve&#xd;
stimulus-selective facilitation of neuronal responses at early stages of visual processing (LGN, V1). The effect requires that stimuli carry some significance to the animal, while exposure to stimuli with no significance does not result in the same level of neuronal enhancement. Further,&#xd;
visual experience alters the plasticity properties of V1 (metaplasticity) by facilitating LTP along thalamocortical sensory fibers.</description>

   <description>A novel method is presented for analyzing fMRI data, which relies on probabilistic estimates of microanatomically defined regions in individual fMRI volunteers. Postmortem structural and cytoarchitectonic information from the Julich/Dusseldorf group in Germany is aligned to the high-resolution structural MR images of functional MRI volunteers. This is achieved using nonlinear registration, which is applied only to the region of interest. The registered postmortem datasets are then combined into probability maps for microanatomically defined regions that are tailored to the anatomy of individual fMRI volunteers. These are then used as weighted spatial filters on functional MR data. In this thesis, three regions of the primary auditory cortex (located on Heschl's gyrus) have been targeted, and the analysis method is used to explore how these three areas respond to different kinds of sound. Regions Te1.0 and Te1.2 both demonstrate pitch sensitivity, consistent with published observations of the functional response of homologous regions in nonhuman primates. Area Te1.1 displayed sensitivity to both noise and pitch, consistent with the theory that it is homologous with the microanatomically similar area CM in nonhuman primates. Furthermore, the custom probability maps are much less diffuse and anatomically more precise than previous versions generated using the same postmortem data, and therefore permit a more sensitive and anatomically precise analysis of functional activity. This method could be applied to any other microanatomically defined region that has been characterized in the Julich postmortem dataset.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
     This study begins by examining the interconnections between print and nationalism in John Milton’s prose works in order to demonstrate that Milton’s interest in print—including print-related activities like reading, writing, and publishing—is not simply a byproduct of his vocation.  Instead, I argue that Milton consciously registered his reliance on and use of print in writing the nation. Further, I argue that Milton’s writing of the nation is in keeping with a modern definition of nationalism as a unifying cultural construct that wields considerable emotional poignancy despite its lack of ideological specificity.  In making this argument, I am adapting a modern definition of nationalism and arguing against scholars who see nationalism as a product of modernity. &#xd;
     I organize my dissertation into two sections: the first section, chapters 2 and 3, discusses the confluence of print and nationalism while the second section, chapters 4 and 5, examines Milton’s poems, Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes, as nation-building texts.  As chapters 2 and 3 demonstrate, Milton had an acute awareness of the role of print in the public life of the nation, and he shaped his own identity as an author based on his contribution to England’s print culture.  In chapters 4 and 5, I look at the ways Milton’s poems suggest a continuation of his commitment to nation-building although the poems were written during the Restoration: a period of time when Milton would have doubted the critical capabilities of his fellow countrymen.  Paradise Lost continues the recuperative work undertaken in prose pieces like Eikonoklastes by helping to educate the reader in political reading.  In Samson Agonistes, Milton explores the way that the individual and nation are vulnerable to the same sort of corruption which emphasizes the degree to which inward and outward servitude is linked.  Yet, neither poem gives up on “nationalism” as a source of individual liberty and positive form of community.  Instead, both poems offer an examination of nationalism that balances the nation’s potential with a consideration of the limits and possible abuses of this potential.</description>

   <description>Rigid-body registration is an important research area with major applications in computer-assisted and image-guided surgery. In these surgeries, often the relationship between the preoperative and intraoperative images taken from a patient must be established. This relationship is computed through a registration process, which finds a set of transformation parameters that maps&#xd;
some point fiducials measured on a patient anatomy to a preoperative model. Due to point measurement error caused by medical measurement instruments, the estimated registration parameters are imperfect and this reduces the accuracy of the performed registrations. Medical measurement instruments often perturb the collected points from the patient anatomy by heterogeneous noise. If the noise characteristics are known, they&#xd;
can be incorporated in the registration algorithm in order to more reliably and accurately estimate the registration parameters and their variances.&#xd;
&#xd;
Current techniques employed in rigid-body registration are primarily based on the well-known Iterative Closest Points (ICP)&#xd;
algorithm. Such techniques are susceptible to the existence of noise in the data sets, and are also very sensitive to the initial&#xd;
alignment errors. Also, the literature offers no analytical solution on how to estimate the accuracy of the performed registrations in the presence of heterogenous noise.&#xd;
&#xd;
In an effort to alleviate these problems, we propose and validate various novel registration techniques based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm. This filter is generally employed for analyzing nonlinear systems corrupted by additive heterogenous Gaussian noise. First, we propose a new registration algorithm to&#xd;
fit two data sets in the presence of arbitrary Gaussian noise,&#xd;
when the corresponding points between the two data sets are assumed to be known. Next, we extend this algorithm to perform&#xd;
surface-based registration, where point correspondences are not available, but the data sets are roughly aligned. A solution to&#xd;
multi-body point and surface-based registration problem is then&#xd;
proposed based on the UKF algorithm.&#xd;
&#xd;
The outputs of the proposed UKF registration algorithms are then utilized to estimate the&#xd;
accuracy of the performed registration. For the first time, novel derivations are presented that can estimate the distribution of registration error at a target in the presence of an arbitrary Gaussian noise.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-25 17:11:10.365</description>
   <description>Background: Osteoarthritis of the hip joint causes difficulties to the elderly because it impacts their ability to conduct their normal activities of daily living, such as walking, cooking, bathing, dressing, using the toilet, and performing household chores. Moreover, the joints can become painful, stiff, and swollen. The resulting pain causes limited motion, restriction of social activities, and compromised work capacity. The interaction of these factors can affect both functional and physiological status. The normal course of action for these subjects is to be referred to an orthopedic surgeon; however, the functional and physiological impact of waiting times for hip replacement consultation or surgery on subject’s function has not been properly assessed with objective outcome measures. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in objective outcome measures of functional and physiological status between subjects with hip OA who were preoperative candidates for hip surgery and those who were diagnosed with hip OA at the time of referral and time of consultation. Methods: Subjects with hip osteoarthritis were selected based on their position in the continuum of care once they had been referred to a surgeon. These groups were: referral (REF) (n=7), consultation (CON) (n=7) and pre-operatively (PREOP) (n=7). Individuals with hip OA were evaluated using functional (6MWT and TUG) and physiological (hip muscle isokinetic strength - Biodex and VO2peak) outcome measures. Results: The 6 minutes walk test (6MWT), timed up and go (TUG) and VO2peak were significantly different between the three groups (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.005 and p = 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in hip flexion and extension muscle strength between groups. Post Hoc analysis revealed that the REF group walked significantly greater distances (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to the PREOP group during the 6MWT. Both REF and CON groups showed significantly shorter times in the TUG test (p &lt; 0.009 and p &lt; 0.02 respectively) when compared to the PREOP group and finally the VO2peak in the REF group was significantly higher than the predicted VO2peak of the CON (p = 0.002) and the PREOP (p = 0.002) groups, respectively. Conclusion: Subjects with hip osteoarthritis who are within four weeks of surgery generally walked shorter distances, demonstrate worse mobility and balance control and a lower aerobic capacity than individuals with hip OA at the time of referral to a surgeon and at the time of consultation with the surgeon. Contrary to expectation, this study did not find differences in hip muscle strength, between those with hip osteoarthritis at the time of referral; at the time of consultation and within four weeks prior to surgery.</description>

   <description>Cancer cells have the ability to survive when oxygen is limiting, and upregulate&#xd;
the pathway of fatty acid synthesis, owing in part to alterations in their metabolism. I&#xd;
compared the metabolic phenotypes of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145, and&#xd;
PC3 assessing energy metabolism, and metabolic gene expression. I also explored the&#xd;
plasticity of the metabolic phenotype following passage, selection and in vivo growth.&#xd;
Finally, I explored the sensitivity of the fatty acid synthesis pathway to low oxygen.&#xd;
LNCaP cells had a more oxidative phenotype based on oxygen consumption,&#xd;
lactate production, enzyme assays, and mRNA levels. While DU145 and PC3 cells were&#xd;
more glycolytic, they were unresponsive to dichloroacetate (DCA), and dinitrophenol&#xd;
(DNP), stimulators of oxygen consumption. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the PC3 and&#xd;
DU145 cells may explain this phenomenon, for they possessed normal cardiolipin levels&#xd;
but lower mitochondrial enzyme activities (cytochrome oxidase (COX), citrate synthase&#xd;
(CS)).&#xd;
When LNCaP cells were subjected to high passage, with and without clonal&#xd;
selection, the derived lines acquired a dysfunctional oxidative phenotype, becoming more&#xd;
glycolytic. Clonal selection appeared to have the most dramatic effect on cellular&#xd;
metabolism. This finding is supported by decreased oxygen consumption, increased&#xd;
lactate production, and a reduction in the activity of the oxidative enzymes CS and COX&#xd;
in the clonally selected LNCaP-luc cell line. Similar to the DU145 and PC3 cells, NAO&#xd;
fluorescence indicates that the oxidative impairment in these LNCaP-derived lines may&#xd;
be due to a reduction in mitochondrial activity. The pattern of metabolic gene expression&#xd;
iii&#xd;
seen in vitro was unaffected when LNCaP cells were grown as subcaspular and muscle&#xd;
xenografts in immunodeficient mice, though xenografts did exhibit indications of an&#xd;
hypoxic response (elevated VEGF mRNA).&#xd;
Oxygen deprivation in vitro increased mRNA for HIF and responsive genes but&#xd;
not SREBP responsive genes. Similarly, oxygen deprivation had no influence on&#xd;
triglyceride levels in any of the lines suggesting that the SREBP axis may not be directly&#xd;
modulated by oxygen levels.&#xd;
Collectively these studies demonstrate differences in the metabolism of these&#xd;
prostate cancer models, with important ramifications of therapeutic strategies involving&#xd;
metabolic targets.</description>

   <description>This study examined mathematics anxiety among elementary teacher candidates, and to what extent it interacted with the modality principle under various degrees of learner-control.  The experiment involved a sample of 186 elementary teacher candidates learning from eight versions of a computer program on division with fractions.  The eight versions varied in modality of presentation (diagrams with narration, or diagrams with written text), control of pacing (pacing was controlled by either the learner or the system), and control of sequence (sequence was controlled by either the learner or the system).  A pre-test, post-test, demographic questionnaire, subjective measure of mental effort, and the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Survey were also administered.    This study revealed that mathematics anxiety was significantly positively correlated with mental effort, and significantly negatively correlated with engagement, pre-test and post-test scores.  Additionally, a modality x pacing interaction was observed for both high prior knowledge and low mathematics-anxious students.  Under system-pacing, the modality effect was observed, and these students achieved higher far transfer scores when learning from the diagrams and narration modality condition.  However, under learner-pacing, the modality effect reversed, and high prior knowledge and low mathematics-anxious students performed better on far transfer scores when learning from the diagrams and written text modality condition.  Low prior knowledge, and highly mathematics-anxious students performed poorly in all treatment conditions.  Additional interactions involving sequence-control, and a four-way interaction involving prior knowledge, modality, sequence-control, and pacing were also uncovered.  The results from this study demonstrate that prior knowledge and mathematics anxiety have a complex relationship with the effectiveness of the format of instruction, and the design of instructional materials needs to take into account these individual differences.</description>

   <description>Exposure to environmental toxins is a major contributing factor to the expected increase in chronic disease within developing countries in the next 20 years.  Due to its ubiquitous distribution and persistent nature, mercury (Hg) is an example of a toxic substance that has garnered global concern because of its known detrimental effects on human and ecosystem health.  Although fish consumption is the predominant source of Hg exposure to humans in developed nations, studies in developing countries have shown that high Hg concentrations in humans cannot be explained by fish consumption alone.  The estimated daily intake (EDI) and the relative contribution of various sources of Hg to humans differ significantly between individuals, ethnic groups, and across continents.  Health Canada is currently attempting to regulate the anthropogenic release and exposure dose of Hg to its citizens based on known EDIs, however the greatest sources of Hg exposure across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are still unknown, thus impeding the regulatory process.  This thesis focuses on four major sources of Hg exposure in SSA: skin-lightening cosmetics, soil geophagy, small-scale gold mining, and fish consumption.  An exposure assessment model has been developed to identify the sources of greatest concern for various age groups in Ghana and Uganda and is presented using published and unpublished data, as well as experimental Hg bioaccessibility data.  The results indicate that occupational exposure and lifestyle choices (mining and use of skin-lightening cosmetics) have the greatest contribution to overall increases in Hg toxicity in adults.  The health of infants, however, is most likely to be compromised before birth and in the first few days of life due to maternal consumption of fish with elevated Hg concentrations and the use of Hg-containing cosmetics.  It is imperative that further research of these sources be carried out to prevent the possible long-term negative social and economic consequences of chronic illness in SSA.</description>

   <description>The purpose of the present study were to (a) explore the relationship between the frequency of use of Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) by hospital staff nurses and the support received from RRTs; (b) to investigate staff nurses’ perceptions of their individual level, group level and organizational level learning as a result of single or multiple exposures to the RRT; (c) to identify predictors of learning outcomes and (d) to identify overall impressions and advantages and disadvantages of the RRT. A mail survey was used to collect data. The response responses rate was 33%, 131 registered nurses responded to the survey (pre-test = 12, study = 119). The results of Pearson r correlation suggest that a high frequency of access of RRTs was positively related to process support (r = .25, p &lt; .01). Also, perceived content and process support from RRTs was positively related to maintenance and building of staff nurses’ mental models regarding patient deterioration pertaining to self, group and organization. Multiple regression analyses show that sociodemographic and independent variables predict organizational learning outcomes (mental model maintenance and building). Overall impressions of the RRTs were high. A content analysis of nurses’ comments indicated that there were more advantages to having the RRTs than disadvantages. This study suggests that RRTs are influential in changing nurses’ perceptions about managing patient deterioration. Training programs for RRTs should include both content and process support, which may enhance building and maintaining mental models.</description>

   <description>The effects of a twelve-week low-intensity exercise conditioning program on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), rate-pressure-product (RPP) and cardiac autonomic function were examined in menopausal and post menopausal women with hypertension. Eligible participants (n=50) were counterbalanced to either the exercise group or the control group. Using a pretest-posttest design, participants were tested at the beginning and the end of the 12-week study period, in which BP, HR, RPP, heart rate variability and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity were measured at rest and during standing and low intensity steady-state exercise. The exercise group participated in a 12-week, low-intensity walking program, 5 days/week, while the comparison group continued with usual activity. The exercise group adhered to 4 walking sessions per week while the control group averaged 0.6 walking sessions per week.  Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a reduction in systolic and diastolic BP and RPP in hypertensive women. Additionally, the low intensity exercise conditioning program attenuated the physiological response to stress (standing, exercise). This was evidenced by decreased systolic and diastolic BP and RPP in the exercise group and increased diastolic BP in the control group. Postmenopausal women demonstrated decreased log transformed high frequency power and total power in comparison to menopausal women. However, postmenopausal women also showed decreased low frequency power in comparison to menopausal women. It was concluded that a 12-week, low-intensity exercise conditioning program reduced systolic and diastolic BP and RPP in hypertensive women while attenuating their physiological responses to stress.</description>

   <description>A combined geological and rock mechanics approach to tunnel face behaviour prediction, based on improved understanding of brittle fracture processes during TBM excavation, was developed to complement empirical design and performance prediction for TBM tunnelling in hard rock geological conditions. A major challenge of this research was combining geological and engineering terminology, methods, and objectives to construct a unified Geomechanical Characterisation Scheme. The goal of this system is to describe the spalling sensitivity of hard, massive, highly stressed crystalline rock, often deformed by tectonic processes. Geological, lab strength testing and TBM machine data were used to quantify the impact of interrelated geological factors, such as mineralogy, grain size, fabric and the heterogeneity of all these factors at micro and macro scale, on spalling sensitivity and to combine these factors within a TBM advance framework. This was achieved by incorporating aspects of geology, tectonics, mineralogy, material strength theory, fracture process theory and induced stresses.&#xd;
Three main approaches were used to verify and calibrate the Geomechanical Characterisation Scheme: geological and TBM data collection from tunnels in massive, highly-stressed rock, interpretation of published mineral-specific investigations of rock yielding processes, and numerical modelling the rock yielding processes in simulated strength tests and the TBM cutting process.  The TBM performance investigation was used to identify the mechanism behind the chipping processes and quantify adverse conditions for chipping, including tough rock conditions and stress induced face instability.  The literature review was used to identify the critical geological parameters for rock yielding processes and obtain strength and stiffness values for mineral-specific constitutive models.  A texture-generating algorithm was developed to create realistic rock analogues and to provide user control over geological characteristics such as mineralogy, grain size and fabric.  &#xd;
This methodology was applied to investigate the TBM chipping process to calibrate the Geomechanical Characterisation Scheme.  A Chipping Resistance Factor was developed to combine the quantified geological characteristic factors and laboratory strength values to predict conditions with high risk of poor chipping performance arising from tough rock.  A Stress-Related Chip Potential Factor was developed to estimate conditions with high risk of advance rate reduction arising from stress-induced face instability.</description>

   <description>The goal of the present study is to examine the way in which Samuel Beckett, an artist whose work contributes also to philosophy, presents his metaphysical vision of the world through drama, where different plays represent different philosophical interpretations of the world.  Using Paul Ricœur’s Memory, History, Forgetting as a theoretical platform, this thesis will concentrate on the manner in which Krapp’s Last Tape presents identity as a phenomenological construction based on cumulative past experiences inserted into and spread throughout time.  Based on this assumption, to tamper with one’s conceptions of a memory-time continuum is to alter the identity which is a result of this dynamic.&#xd;
	The Beckettian vision of the world does not see identity – the ever-elusive self, as many authors would say – simply as a unique and separate phenomenon that, by staying constant through time, serves as the basis for one’s phenomenological experience ; rather, in Krapp’s Last Tape the self is the sum of mnemonic experiences lived through time, which in turn impacts the identity of the individual.  This philosophical perception of identity is further complicated by other phenomenological questions which must come into play if we are to study the way in which this identity is perceived not only by the reader-spectator, but also by the subject himself.  For example, how does the ideal image that Krapp constructs of himself impact his identity ?  Does he modify memory so as to conform to the idealistic vision he has created of himself, and does this image, perceived as the desired Other, foment in him a feeling of alterity when faced with himself as he is, as opposed to the fulfillment of the desired Other by which he measures his success ?</description>

   <description>This research analyzes Guatemala’s 1996 telecommunications reform, with an emphasis on how the introduction of private property rights in the electromagnetic spectrum has affected provision of, and access to, non-profit community radio, a critical media for the country’s indigenous Maya. The Guatemalan ‘experiment’ is the first applied test of Ronald Coase’s 1959 call for property rights in radio spectrum. To date, spectrum liberalization in most countries, including Canada, has upheld a model of resource stewardship in which the state retains ownership of the spectrum and a measure of control over frequency allocations. In Guatemala, by contrast, the state has ceded spectrum control to the private sector by auctioning off legal title to electromagnetic frequencies and allowing secondary markets in spectrum trading to develop. Formerly free under license to Guatemalan nationals only, FM frequencies sold with title under Guatemala’s revamped telecommunications law fetch as much as US$750,000 at auction. Broadcasting rights have disproportionately accrued to foreign nationals and commercial operators, while community broadcasters operating without title are accused of ‘stealing’ spectrum resources (causing interference on titled bandwidth), for which they face fines of between US$10,001 and $100,000 and up to six years in prison. Scholar-advocates and industry lobbyists credit Guatemala’s propertization regime with maximizing resource efficiency, institutionalizing justice, and offering rich and poor countries alike a practical model for spectrum reform. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and other critics, however, argue that the regime discriminates against those who lack the financial resources to purchase spectrum title and effectively bars non-profit community radio stations from legal access to the airwaves. This study traces the intellectual roots of (neo)liberal reform and examines parallels between geographies of inequality in Guatemala’s landscape and soundscape in order to demonstrate that the costs of enclosing and commodifying resources once held in common has consistently and disproportionately fallen on Guatemala’s indigenous population.</description>

   <description>RNA molecules isolated from FFPE samples are highly fragmented and modified, and generally deemed unsuitable for downstream gene expression profiling. With the development of molecular biology, there has been growing interest in profiling archival FFPE samples. Successful profiling of transcripts from FFPE samples would greatly expand tissue sources for large scale gene expression studies; also it would pave the way for future applications on the type of tissue readily available in the clinical setting. So far, there is a lack of systemic studies evaluating the quality of RNA isolated from routinely processed FFPE samples, and it has remained difficult to assess how well FFPE-derived RNA mirrors the status of RNA isolated before fixation. In this project, the similarity of miRNA and mRNA profiles between matched frozen and FFPE lymphoid hyperplasia tissues (N=7 for miRNA comparison, N=4 for mRNA comparison) were evaluated. We found consistently good correlation (mean of Pearson coefficient=0.939, mean of Spearman coefficient=0.905, mean of Kendall tau=0.744) between matched frozen and FFPE-derived miRNA profiles, suggesting FFPE samples may retain miRNA expression information quite well. This has major positive implications for research using FFPE samples, as miRNA profiling becomes more prominent in bioprofiling studies. On the contrary, mRNA isolated from FFPE samples showed less correlation (Spearman coefficient less than 0.75) with its frozen counterpart on the Agilent microarray platform. With a post extraction heat treatment aimed at reversing base modifications and cross linking structures, obvious global mRNA quality improvement was observed in cases where samples appeared to be heavily cross linked, but was less effective and even detrimental in cases where cross linking was less prominent.   This research suggests that the extent of cross linking may be critical in terms of determining whether a particular FFPE tissue will become a useful source of mRNA for global profiling studies</description>

   <description>Preeclampsia is associated with placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction.  Fetal growth restriction is associated with an increased risk for language deficits at 2-5 years of age.  However, fetal auditory processing in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia has not been examined and is the focus of this study.  Spontaneous and auditory elicited fetal behaviours were compared in 40 mother-fetal pairs (n=20 preclamptic and n=20 low-risk normotensive pregnancies) from 33 to 39 weeks gestational age (GA).  Spontaneous fetal heart rate, body and breathing movements and muscle tone were observed and an estimate of amniotic fluid was made.  To test if the fetuses could hear, six 2.5s trials (3, 110 dB pink noise; 3, no-sound control) were intermixed and randomly presented; fetal heart rate was recorded for 30 s following trial onset and body movements were observed for 5 s.   Finally, the mother’s voice recorded reading a children’s story was presented: 2 min of no sound, 2 min of mother’s voice (95 dB A) and 2 min of no sound.  Sounds were delivered through a speaker 10cm above the abdomen.  During the 6 min procedure, fetal heart rate was recorded continuously and body movements were video recorded.  Fetuses in the preeclamptic group were born earlier, t(37)=4.79, p&lt;0.000.  There were no differences in birth weight at delivery.  Testing showed no differences between groups for any measure of spontaneous behaviour.  There was increased heart rate, F(1,36)=37.47, p&lt;0.001, and number of body movements, F(1, 35)=54.04, p&lt;0.001, in response to the pink noise compared no-sound control trials, indicating that both groups could hear external sounds.   No differences in fetal heart rate or body movement responses to the playing of the mother’s voice were found between the two groups; although, there was a suggestion that gestational age affected responding.  There were no differences found in spontaneous behaviours or auditory processing behaviours in fetuses of pregnancies complicated by mild to moderate preeclampsia compared to those in low-risk, normotensive pregnancies.  It is suggested that future studies examining fetal auditory processing in preeclamptic pregnancies employ sufficient sample size for analyses by gestational age at time of testing.</description>

   <description>Vasomotion is the spontaneous oscillation of vascular tone, occurring due to synchronization of internal calcium fluctuations between multiple vascular smooth muscle cells by gap junction and electrical communication. Although altered vasomotion has been observed in a variety of pathological situations, characterization of these alterations has been lacking. Using a novel method of spectral quantification, and two experimental models known to have altered vascular structure, the present thesis was designed to evaluate whether vasomotion characteristics could be correlated with altered vascular structure.&#xd;
	Rats with perinatal iron deficiency (PID) have previously been shown to possess altered vascular structure. When phenylephrine-mediated contractile and acetylcholine-mediated dilatory responses were investigated in PID animals, they both displayed blunted relaxation as compared to control vessels. When vasomotion characteristics were quantified, vessels taken from PID animals exhibited a decreased power in the very low frequency window (VLF &lt;0.2 Hz). Changing vessel oxygenation to 10% O2 from 95% O2 did not result in significant alterations of vasomotion characteristics. The primary frequency of oscillation was investigated with a peak finder, and found to be significantly different compared to control in both the aorta and renal arteries obtained from PID animals.&#xd;
	To investigate the effect of antihypertensive treatment (enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide) on gap junction communication, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were subject to a 2-week intensive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment. This treatment resulted in significant vascular structural regression. All vessels (aorta, renal, mesenteric) from treated animals had greater proportions of power in the VLF window, with both the mesenteric and renal vessels exhibiting a primary peak of oscillation around 0.2 Hz; whereas the aorta had a primary peak at 0.12 Hz. Investigating altered gap junction communication with the gap junction blocker 18-α glycyrrhetinic acid, revealed that vascular bed location was the determining factor of vasomotion response. Immunoblotting did not indicate differences in connexin 43, a major gap junction protein in the vascular smooth muscle. &#xd;
	These studies suggest that vasomotion characteristics can be used as a method of vascular phenotype investigation; vasomotion characteristics were significantly different in vessels taken from PID and hypertensive animals as compared to control and antihypertensive-treated animals, respectively.</description>

   <description>Since soil and water were the most accessible building materials, humans used the mixture of soil and water to fabricate mud bricks or adobe. Iran, Syria, and Iraq have numerous mud brick buildings, and Arg-e Bam, located in Iran, was one of the most famous earthen monuments in the world; it was destroyed in a massive earthquake in 2003. In this research adobe samples were fabricated and different consolidants were applied to the samples. To determine the most effective consolidant, the tests were performed on the treated adobe. The soil for this research was supplied from Godfrey, a site near Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The soil was mixed with kaolin to achieve a similar grain size distribution to that of soil found in Bam. This research used four specific consolidant materials: a 5% (w/v) solution of Paraloid B-72 in toluene; a 50% (v/v) solution of methyl trimethoxy silane (MTMOS) in ethanol; a 50% (v/v) solution of ethyl silicate (TEOS) in ethanol; and Conservare H, which is the commercial brand of ethyl silicate. The research also studied the effects of Paraloid B-72 on surfaces previously treated with methyl trimethoxy silane and ethyl silicate. The chemicals were applied to the samples by brushing. After treatment, different physical properties were measured. The tests included study of density, porosity, water absorption, depth of penetration, abrasion resistance, hardness, compressive strength, bending strength and colour changes. Chemical analysis (X-ray diffraction) was used to study the chemical components of the soil and scanning electron microscopy showed changes to the treated surfaces after application of the chemicals. This research can be used as a guide in choosing the consolidants in adobe consolidation depending on the priorities defined in each building conservation project.  Also, by applying all the same tests to samples made from the actual soil from Bam, this research can be used to evaluate how grain size distribution can affect the physical properties of the consolidated samples. By considering only the grain size of the soil used for adobe fabrication, the results from this research produced the following conclusion of consolidation of adobe from Bam; if the colour change is important, then the recommended consolidant is MTMOS or TEOS; if the colour change is not important, then the recommended consolidant is Paraloid B-72. The comparison among all the consolidants and their results, except results from failure strength, leads to the conclusion that the best consolidant is TEOS followed by a second coat of Paraloid B-72.</description>

   <description>While protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) have been extensively characterized in eukaryotes, far less is known about their emerging counterparts in prokaryotes. Studies of close to 20 homologs of bacterial protein tyrosine (BY) kinases have inaugurated a blooming new field of research, all since just the end of the last decade. These kinases are key regulators in the polymerization and exportation of the virulence-determining polysaccharides which shield the bacterial from the non-specific defenses of the host. This research is aimed at furthering our understanding of the BY kinases through the use of X-ray crystallography and various in vitro and in vivo experiments. We reported the first crystal structure of a bacterial PTK, the C-terminal kinase domain of E. coli tyrosine kinase (Etk) at 2.5Å resolution. The fold of the Etk kinase domain differs markedly from that of eukaryotic PTKs. Based on the observed structure and supporting evidences, we proposed a unique activation mechanism for BY kinases in Gram-negative bacteria. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residue Y574 at the active site and the specific interaction of P-Y574 with a previously unidentified key arginine residue, R614, unblock the Etk active site and activate the kinase. Both in vitro kinase activity and in vivo antibiotics resistance studies utilizing structure-guided mutants further support the novel activation mechanism. In addition, the level of phosphorylation of their C-terminal Tyr cluster is known to regulate the translocation of extracellular polysaccharides. Our studies have significantly clarified our understanding of how the phosphorylation status on the C-terminal tyrosine cluster of BY kinases affects the oligomerization state of the protein, which is likely the machinery of polysaccharide export regulation. In summary, this research makes a substantial contribution to the rapidly progressing research of bacterial tyrosine kinases.</description>

   <description>Previous studies have suggested that protective responses in the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs), described in terms of hypertonicity and over-reactivity, are associated with and may worsen the symptoms of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD, i.e., chronic vulvar pain). A recent study reported that, upon manual palpation of the PFM, hypertonicity was consistently found in the superficial but not the deep PFM layers. The goals of this study were to compare superficial and deep PFM resting tone, protective response magnitude and onset timing to moderate perceived vulvar pain between women with and without PVD. Eleven women with PVD and eleven control women Tcompleted a gynecological examination and standardized PFM electromyography (EMG) testing. Three trials of sTurface EMG activity of the PFM were recorded while a pressure-pain stimulus (PPS) was applied to the vulvar vestibule. Increasing pressure was applied to achieve a perceived pain intensity rating of 6/10 using an 11-point numerical rating scale presented visually. The women with PVD had higher resting EMG activity in their superficial PFMs (p=0.04) as compared to the control group, while no difference was found at the level of the deep PFMs (p=0.12). Participants in both groups demonstrated contractile responses to the PPS in both the superficial and the deep PFM, and these responses were significantly higher (p=0.0001) in the superficial (50.06  vs 38.69 % maximal voluntary electrical activation [MVE]) as compared to the deep (24.88 vs 22.52 %MVE) PFM layers. Women with PVD had significantly higher PFM responses at the superficial layer as compared to the control women (p&lt;0.0005). The onset of the superficial and deep EMG PFM responses followed the PPS application in both groups. No differences were found between the deep and superficial PFM onset latency to the timing of the PPS application.The results of this study suggest that women with PVD have superficial PFMs that are more responsive to vulvar pain than those in non-affected women. The findings also suggest that superficial PFM over-reactivity, rather than deep PFM over-reactivity, is part of the PFM dysfunction reported in women with PVD.</description>

   <description>This dissertation investigates agency problems within risk transfer contracts.  We pay particular attention to the consequences of credit risk transfer in the context of banking.  The first two chapters provide an introduction and literature review. We then analyze the effect of counterparty risk on&#xd;
financial insurance contracts in the following two chapters, and uncover a new moral hazard problem on the part of the insurer. If the insurer believes it is unlikely that a claim will be made, it&#xd;
is advantageous for them to invest in assets which earn higher returns, but may not be readily available if needed. We find that&#xd;
counterparty risk can create an incentive for the insured to reveal superior information about the risk of their "investment".  In particular, a unique separating equilibrium&#xd;
may exist even in the absence of any signalling device.  This constitutes a first example in which the separation of types can&#xd;
be achieved without a costly signalling device.  Our research suggests that regulators should be wary of risk being offloaded to other, possibly unstable parties, especially in financial markets&#xd;
such as that of credit derivatives.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The fifth chapter models loan sales and loan insurance (e.g. credit default swaps) as two key instruments of risk transfer within the banking environment. Recent empirical evidence suggests that the asymmetric information problem is as relevant in loan&#xd;
insurance as it is in loan sales. Contrary to previous literature, this paper allows for informational asymmetries in both markets.&#xd;
Our results show that a well capitalized bank will tend to use loan insurance regardless of loan quality in the presence of moral&#xd;
hazard and relationship banking costs of loan sales. Finally, we show that a poorly capitalized bank may be forced into the loan&#xd;
sales market, even in the presence of possibly significant moral hazard and relationship banking costs that can depress the selling price.</description>

   <title>Development and Characterization of Polysiloxane Polymer Films for Use in Optical Sensor Technology</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-26 15:28:35.603</description>
   <description>A novel sensor using a polymer coated long-period grating (LPG) has been proposed for monitoring levels of organic contaminants in air or water systems.  The sensor operates by detecting refractive index changes in the polymer coating as analytes partition in.  Polymer coatings used must be able to reversibly and reproducibly absorb contaminants of interest from the sample and have a refractive index just below that of the fiber cladding.  &#xd;
The synthesis and characterization of several chemically selective polysiloxanes is described.  Pre-polymer materials are made through the catalyzed condensation of silane monomers.  Different functional groups are incorporated either through polymerizing functionalized monomers, or by post-functionalizing the polymer through a platinum-catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction.  The pre-polymer materials are crosslinked into elastomeric films using titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide.  The polymer refractive index is controlled through altering the ratios of functional groups within the polymer or changing the loading levels of titanium.  Four polymers were made, having different functional groups and optimized refractive indices for use on the proposed sensor.&#xd;
The partition coefficients for the polymers with a variety of solvents are calculated and compared.  Each polymer was found to have a slightly different chemical selectivity pattern, demonstrating that a set of polymers could be used to generate a sensor array.  Partition coefficient data was calculated from the gas phase by considering the change in polymer refractive index as the solvents partitioned into the polymer.  The Lorentz-Lorenz equation was used to model the relationship between the change in refractive index and the solvent concentration within the polymer.  &#xd;
Finally, polymers were applied to LPGs and used to successfully detect various solvents from the gas phase.  This was accomplished by monitoring the entire LPG spectrum, and also by considering loss at a single wavelength using fiber-loop ring-down spectroscopy.</description>

   <description>The sins of the flesh and the mortification of the flesh characterize the biography of the saint known as Mary Magdalen. The polychrome wooden sculpture by Donatello from c.1455 was described by Vasari as: “wasted away by her fastings and abstinence."  The extreme emaciation of the figure contrasts with the image of the beautiful and mournful Magdalen frequently seen at the foot of the cross in medieval crucifixion scenes.  With virtually no documentation concerning its commission, much of the scholarship on this particular piece focuses on dating and the intended installation site. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis aims to examine the relationship between the emaciated style and the manner of polychromy in Donatello’s Penitent Magdalen as an example of the redeeming power of penance.  On a figure known for a life of sin and prostitution but also redemption, the gilding juxtaposed with a haggard and ugly body creates a dynamic relationship between sanctity and beauty (or the lack thereof) and demonstrates the effect of penance on the sinner.  The extreme emaciation and rough finish of the piece, in tandem with the gilding of the hair, created an effect of light that was significant to the Renaissance understanding of the saint’s character but also to a larger discourse on female sexuality and spirituality.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The multifaceted character of Mary Magdalen and Donatello’s depiction of her was understood by Quattrocento Florentines on a variety of levels. Higher social classes would readily grasp the sculpture’s affinity with Petrarchan tropes and philosophical ideas, particularly in terms of light imagery and descriptions of love.  But the average viewer would also make more prosaic associations between the figure of the Magdalen and popular preaching and prostitution. &#xd;
&#xd;
Through an examination of the cultural climate of fifteenth century Florence, this investigation will situate Donatello’s uniquely emaciated and gilded sculpture in the visual tradition of Magdalen imagery, motifs of female spirituality in Donatello’s career, the literary tradition of describing female beauty, and societal concerns about prostitution and female sexuality.</description>

   <description>WiMax or the IEEE 802.16 standard is one of the most promising broadband wireless&#xd;
technologies nowadays. It is characterized by its high data rates, large coverage area,&#xd;
flexible design and QoS support. The standard defines two modes of operation: Point-to-&#xd;
Multi-Point (PMP) and the Mesh Mode. In the first mode, all nodes are connected&#xd;
directly to the base station and communication is not allowed amongst nodes. In the mesh mode, nodes are placed in an ad hoc manner communicating to neighbors and relaying the traffic of other nodes. The goal of this thesis is to design a partitioning scheme for the frame structure of the Mesh mode. Increasing the frame utilization would&#xd;
result in better support for QoS applications and optimized resource allocation, and&#xd;
thus revenue increase from the service provider’s perspective.&#xd;
The mesh frame is divided into control and data, which are further divided into&#xd;
centralized and distributed portions. We propose a novel and efficient scheme for partitioning the data subframe between the two schedulers. We use a Markovian model&#xd;
that studies the system behavior in the long run, and provides predictions based on&#xd;
analysis of previous window of frames. We further enhance the decision by tuning the&#xd;
partitioning through statistical analysis of smaller windows to accommodate demand&#xd;
changes. Our simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves high utilization&#xd;
under different network and traffic conditions and decreases the packet overflow.</description>

   <description>Although many in the contemporary academic world would avoid themes such as solitude, love, and, in the context of “francophone” literature, exile, I have decided to give these all the attention they deserve based on the importance they hold in the works themselves, and based on the depth they possess. It is thus from the perspective of the renewed light they bring on these topics that the following three works will be analysed: À vol d’ombre (1966) by Jacqueline Beaugé, Transparence en bleu d’oubli (1979) by Renée Marie-Ange Jolicœur, and La Fidélité non plus… (1986) by Yanick Jean. In order to contextualize these three works, I first provide a brief history of Haitian poetry in which particular attention is given to the contributions of women writers. This overview illustrates how Jean, Jolicœur and Beaugé use very general themes such as love and solitude, but also how they manage to set themselves apart.&#xd;
&#xd;
Indeed, their works are unparalleled in Haitian literature because they constantly play with the conventions of love poetry and redefine the notion of absence. In order to establish how every absence contains traces of presence, my analysis bases itself in part on the theories of Derrida. I also explore how, in each of the collections of poems under consideration (although for different reasons), absence stifles any possibility of contact with the other. In order to understand this problem and underscore its importance, I refer to Hegel’s conception of the relationship to the other. Based on these premises, I conclude by showing how exile is a space that is at once filled with absence and with presence, and how the staging of the act of writing, in all three works, makes poetry and absence inseparable.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biochemistry) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-26 15:49:17.317</description>
   <description>Calpains are a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases involved in intracellular signaling. They participate in many normal cellular processes such as cell motility and apoptosis but when over-activated they contribute to diseases ranging from ischemic injury to neurodegenerative disorders. &#xd;
The major calpain isoforms µ- and m- are large heterodimeric enzymes that are subject to autoproteolysis and aggregation when activated by Ca2+. To avoid these complications the protease core (domains I and II) has been used to screen inhibitors and design substrates. Using the protease core of µ-calpain, I showed that the superior calpain substrate, PLFMER, is cut at the intended scissile bond between F and M. Alanine substitutions at each position optimized the sequence to PLFAAR, which has a 2.3-fold higher turnover rate. The set of substrates derived from this study provided a tool for profiling the activity of calpain isoforms. One disadvantage of the protease core is that it is less active than the whole enzyme. This was even more apparent with the protease cores of the tissue-specific calpains 3, 8, 9 and 15 such that it prevented their use in substrate and inhibitor screening. &#xd;
The recently solved crystal structure of calcium-bound full-length m-calpain has revealed additional sites for the interaction of substrates and inhibitors in the unprimed side of the catalytic cleft provided by domain III. To sample these sites, it is necessary to prevent the full-length calpain from aggregating and precipitating upon calcium binding. I have developed a method here that uses portions of calpastatin (CAST), the natural endogenous inhibitor and stabilizer of calpain, to keep the enzyme soluble. By artificially connecting those portions of calpastatin that bind to calpain domains IV and VI, it is possible to stabilize the enzyme without blocking its active site. Of the three constructs made, 1C-2A, 2C-3A, and 3C-4A, the 3C-4A peptide was shown to completely inhibit aggregation of m-calpain at a 1:1 molar ratio, as monitored by turbidity. This mechanism of stabilization will permit the use of full-length calpains for the development of specific substrates and inhibitors.</description>

   <description>Podosomes are adhesive and invasive structures which may play an important role in numerous physiological and pathological conditions including angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis.  Recently, the cysteine protease m-calpain (m-Capn) has been shown to cleave cortactin, an integral component of the podosomal F-actin core, as well as various proteins found in the peripheral adhesive region leading to the disassembly of these dynamic structures.  In this study, I investigated whether Capn plays a role in the formation of podosomes downstream of c-Src.  I show that: 1) phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu) as well as c-Src-Y527F expression induces podosome formation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts; 2) PDBu- and constitutively active c-Src-induced podosome formation is inhibited by the knockout of the m- and µ-Capn small regulatory subunit Capn4 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts  (Capn4-/-), but is partially restored by re-expression of Capn4; 3) Capn4 localizes to podosomes; and 4) Inhibition of m- and µ-Capn proteolytic activity by the cell permeable calpain inhibitors has little effect on the formation of podosomes downstream of active c-Src.  I conclude that Capn4 may play a role in the assembly phase of podosomes independent of calpain proteolytic activity.  Work done in collaboration to determine a possible mechanism of action for the role of Capn4 in podosome assembly indicates that a possible binding partner of Capn4, β-PIX, co-localizes with, and shows in vivo association with Capn4.  Furthermore, β-PIX and Capn4 bind directly in vitro in the presence of Ca2+.  We conclude that Capn4 plays a role in podosome assembly, and this role may be through direct interaction with β-PIX in a calcium-dependent manner.</description>

   <description>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are naturally-forming nanostructures that have attracted&#xd;
considerable recent research interest due to their unique opto-electronic properties&#xd;
and comparative ease of fabrication. Two-thirds of nanotube species are semiconductors&#xd;
due to symmetry conditions imposed by their pseudo-one-dimensional tubular structure, and exhibit band-gap photoluminescence when isolated from their environment. Despite their elegant structural simplicity, fundamental properties of carbon nanotubes, such as their intrinsic quantum efficiency, non-linear excitonic recombination mechanisms, and the role of environmental effects, continue to be disputed in the literature.&#xd;
&#xd;
The design of an apparatus capable of observing nanotube photoluminescence is&#xd;
presented, along with conclusive proof of the observation of a single (9,8)-chirality&#xd;
nanotube in the form of spectral, spatial, and polarization-dependent measurements.&#xd;
&#xd;
The dependance of the excitation and emission spectra of a single nanotube on the&#xd;
excitation intensity is explored and the emission spectra found to be described by a&#xd;
Gaussian peak function, in contrast to previously-reported results.&#xd;
&#xd;
The unexpected ability to cause redshifts in the emission spectrum via the ambient&#xd;
humidity is discovered, which has consequences on experimental best practices.&#xd;
&#xd;
Photoluminescence quantum efficiencies are measured to be 4±2% and 13±6% for two different nanotubes. This is at the high end of the range for comparable literature&#xd;
results, and supports the validity of a recent literature value for the effective atomic absorption coefficient for carbon, AC=1.6×10^−3nm^2, which is ten times greater&#xd;
than previous literature values.&#xd;
&#xd;
Pulsed power dependence studies show that the PL emission undergoes ‘hard’&#xd;
saturation at an excitation intensity of 0.5×10^12photons/pulse/cm2, which is at&#xd;
least 100 times lower than previous reports and provides insight into non-linear decay&#xd;
dynamics. A novel theoretical model is developed to explain this saturation process,&#xd;
which yields an absorption co-efficient of AC=1.2±0.3×10^−3nm^2 as a fit parameter.&#xd;
&#xd;
Time-resolved photoluminescence dynamics are explored using femtosecond excitation&#xd;
correlation spectroscopy. Results suggest that the one-body decay processes&#xd;
are bi-exponential, with time constants of 31±4ps and 313±61ps, but also highlight the limitations of this technique in observing the expected very rapid (~1 ps) two-body Auger recombination process.</description>

   <description>Past research has indicated that Chinese culture is more past oriented; whereas North American culture is more future oriented. Such cultural differences in temporal orientation may affect how people value future and past events. I predicted that the typical temporal asymmetry effect among European North Americans - placing more value on future events than on past ones - would be reversed among Chinese due to the cultural differences in temporal orientation. &#xd;
I conducted four studies to examine how culture affects the values people attached to past and future events. Overall, the results supported my predictions. Across all four studies, I found that European Canadians attached more monetary value to an event in the future than to an identical event in the past with similar temporal distance; whereas Chinese people placed more monetary value on a past event than on an identical future event. In Study 3, I also investigated the underlying mechanisms that would account for such cultural differences. Among the three mediators believed to be affected by the past and future orientations, I found two that mediated the cultural influences on the temporal value asymmetry effect: (1) emotions associated with future and past events, and (2) mental simulations of future and past events. Specifically, European Canadians predicted stronger emotions for future events than what they recalled for past events, whereas Chinese showed an opposite trend. Emotions associated with future or past events, in turn, predicted the monetary values attached to the events. In addition, relative to Chinese Canadians, who showed clearer mental simulations for past than for future events, European Canadians had clearer mental simulations for future than for past events. Mental simulations, in turn, showed a positive association with the monetary value assigned to the events.</description>

   <description>Application layer protocols have become sophisticated to the level that they have become languages in their own right. Security testing of network applications is indisputably an essential task that must be carried out prior to the release of software to the market. Since factors such as time-to-market constraints limit the scope or depth of the testing performed, it is difficult to carry out exhaustive testing prior to the release of the software. As a consequence, flaws may be left undiscovered by the software vendor, which may be discovered by those of malicious intent.&#xd;
&#xd;
	We report the results of an empirical study of testing the Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA®) protocol as implemented by the IBM® DB2® Database for Linux®, Unix®, and Windows® product, using a security testing approach, and a framework which implements that approach, that emerged from the joint work of the Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University of Kingston. The previous version of the framework was used in the past to test the implementations of several network protocols. Compared to DRDA, these protocols are relatively simple, as they possess a much fewer number of structure types, messages and rules.&#xd;
&#xd;
	From our study of the DRDA protocol, several omissions in the framework were uncovered, and were implemented as part of this work. In addition, the framework was automated, a preliminary automated test planner was created and a primitive language was created to provide the ability to describe custom-made test plans. Testing revealed two faults in the DB2 server, one of which was unknown to the vendor, prior to the testing that was carried out as part of this thesis work.</description>

   <description>Many modern artists paint in oil or oil-modified alkyd paints over acrylic grounds. In some cases the oil based paints do not remain adhered to the ground. In a set of composite samples of oil or alkyd paints, over acrylic grounds, naturally aged for nine years, some of the samples delaminated. Samples were analyzed with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), Fourier transform infrared - attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),  pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (PY-GC/MS), laser desorption/ionization mass-spectrometry (LDI-MS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other methods, in order to find what the delaminating ones have in common. In addition, two examples of severely delaminating paintings were examined, to confirm the results from the laboratory-prepared samples. Results indicate the main cause of delamination is metal soaps in the oil paint and particularly zinc soaps. There is some evidence that metal soaps were more concentrated at the interface between the layers and this disrupted the adhesion. The ground is a minor consideration as well, rougher grounds providing better adhesion than smooth ones.</description>

   <description>Distributive equality can be valued in different ways, which can be rendered as definitions of ways to value distributive equality.  Those definitions can be used to investigate the value, if any, that distributive equality is held to have by particular principles which regulate distributive shares.  Distributive equality can be valued as a matter of justice in two different ways; it can be an intended consequence of a principle of justice and it can be among the grounds for a principle of justice.  The definitions of those two ways of valuing distributive equality can be used to investigate the value, if any, that distributive equality is held to have by Rawls’s interpretation of the second principle of justice.  Distributive equality can be valued for reasons relating to social relations rather than justice.  When distributive equality is valued for reasons relating to social relations, a definition of that way of valuing distributive equality can be specified by reference to the reasons provided.  When distributive equality is valued for reasons relating to social relations, the relevance and implications of that way of valuing distributive equality with regard to the prior question of how society should be organized can be investigated by reference to the reasons provided.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, French) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-26 17:50:07.53</description>
   <description>"L’art du maquillage" (1997), a novel by Sergio Kokis, a Quebec author originally from Brazil, not only illustrates the theme of exile but also the universal theme of self discovery, making it a true bildungsroman. This thesis undertakes an analysis of the role of the regard — a concept difficult to translate that includes the idea of the gaze, the look, the eye, as well as one’s perception or point of view — in order to examine its impact on the protagonist Max’s search for identity. This is accomplished in conjunction with a study of the role of the paratext of the novel and various other themes such as counterfeiting, the role of the female figure as “other” and the question of “reality” and “truth”. By way of his encounters with Marilyn de Rosemont, Caroline, Brenda, Annette and Vera, as well as the influence of the artists imitated (notably Marc-Aurèle Fortin, René Richard, Egon Schiele and Otto Dix), Max describes his evolution as an artist and as a counterfeiter. By exploring the role played by the regard in the act of creation (lending particular attention towards the end to "Les langages de la création", an essay by Kokis himself) and in the search for self, we discover the transformative power it engenders and the fact that it is a plurality of regards that orient us in the world, in our interactions with others and in our self conceptions. This plurality of the regard is well illustrated by the combination of the written word and visual art chosen as the form of expression in this novel, resulting in a captivating example of the implications of the power of representation. The narrator’s story and the accompanying illustrations, as well as the works of art described therein, allow the reader to grasp a new understanding of the importance an individual’s point of view exerts on “reality”, and the complexity of the role the regard plays in every aspect of creation.</description>

   <description>The development of a numerical model of a two-stroke engine is undertaken to study the scavenging characteristics of the engine. The engine design is unique in its use of 16 passive intake valves in the cylinder head which, along with the exhaust ports located at bottom centre (BC), give the engine a top-down uniflow-scavenged configuration. Each valve constitutes a small stainless steel platelet within a cavity in the cylinder head which reacts to the pressure difference across the cylinder head. The principle focus of this study is the transient simulation of the scavenging flow using dynamic meshing to model the piston motion and the response of the passive intake valves to the scavenging flow for varied engine speed and peak pressure. A flowbench study of the steady flow through the cylinder head into a duct is incorporated as a step in the development of the transient numerical model. Validation of the numerical predictions is undertaken by comparing results from an experimental flowbench for the steady case and using a cold-flow scavenging rig for the transient simulations. Both the steady flow through the cylinder head and the unsteady flow within the cylinder indicate the presence of a recirculation region on the cylinder axis. As a result, short-circuiting of scavenging gas becomes considerable and leads to scavenging characteristics comparable to Hopkinson’s perfect mixing one-dimensional scavenging model.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-26 21:06:15.185</description>
   <description>BACKGROUND: Evidence supports that an elevated level of total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) signifies a breakdown in the methionine-homocysteine cycle.  This may result in folate deficiency, DNA methylation and oxidative stress, all of which are potential mechanisms that may lead to cancer.  Few studies examined the effects of alcohol consumption on tHcy levels. No studies considered polymorphisms in alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (ADH1C), a gene that encodes for an enzyme that metabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde, a folate antagonist; ADH1C*1 encodes for an enzyme with a higher capacity to generate acetaldehyde than ADH1C*2.&#xd;
 &#xd;
PURPOSE: This study examined the association between alcohol intake and risk of elevated tHcy while exploring a potential gene-environment interaction with polymorphisms in ADH1C.&#xd;
&#xd;
METHOD: This was a case-control study nested in a larger cross-sectional study funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.  The target population was recruited from Kingston and Halifax from 2006 to 2008 and included 100 cases and 187 controls selected from healthy male and female subjects aged 20-50 years.  Cases were defined as subjects with tHcy ≥ 10 mol/L and controls &lt; 10 mol/L.  Alcohol consumption was categorized into three groups: ≤12.0 g/day, 12.1–24.0 g/day, and >24.0 g/day.  ADH1C was dichotomized by collapsing ADH1C*1/*2 and ADH1C*2/*2 into one group and examined against ADH1C*1/*1.&#xd;
&#xd;
RESULTS: Compared to ≤12.0 g/day, odds ratio (OR) for 12.1-24.0 g/day was 0.53 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.25-1.13] and for >24.0 g/day was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.60-2.24), suggesting a J-shaped trend with risk of elevated tHcy.  A reduced OR was observed for ADH1C*1/*1 (OR= 0.52, 95% CI, 0.27-1.03).  The alcohol-ADH1C interaction was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.21), though a stronger J-shape trend was suggested in ADH1C*1/*1.  Among consumers of ≤12.0 g/day, a reduced measure of effect was observed for ADH1C*1/*1 (OR= 0.44, 95% CI, 0.19-1.00).&#xd;
&#xd;
CONCLUSION: A J-shaped trend was suspected between risk of elevated tHcy and alcohol consumption. Additionally, a nonsignificant reduced effect of ADH1C*1/*1 on risk of elevated tHcy, with a more pronounced effect in the lowest group of alcohol consumption. This suggests that ADH1C may be associated to homocysteine through factors unrelated to alcohol intake.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-09-26 23:45:07.81</description>
   <description>We present a new sub-optimal near-maximum-likelihood (ML) detection&#xd;
method for the family of variable-rate space-time block codes&#xd;
(VRSTBC). The proposed detection method is based on the concept of&#xd;
symbol reliability and provides a wide range of&#xd;
performance-complexity trade-offs. The reliability measures are&#xd;
defined with the help of a recent generic ML metric expression.  The&#xd;
error performance and complexity analysis of the method via&#xd;
simulations show an achievable near-ML error performance with&#xd;
significant reduction in complexity. The performance of the proposed&#xd;
method is also compared with the group interference cancellation&#xd;
(GIC) method which was the detection method originally applied to&#xd;
VRSTBCs and the results show a significant improvement. The new&#xd;
method offers various levels of error protection via a simple&#xd;
parameter and hence can provide the users of a wireless network with&#xd;
different performance levels according to their cost allowance.&#xd;
Unequal error protection by VRSTBCs under the new detection method&#xd;
was explored. Several applications integrating data with different&#xd;
levels of sensitivity to error can benefit from the wide range of&#xd;
possibilities that the combination of the proposed detection method&#xd;
and VRSTBCs provides. To further explore these flexibilities, four&#xd;
practically interesting power allocation schemes were applied to the&#xd;
transmission and the behaviors were observed through case studies.</description>

   <description>Fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) are currently being used in new bridge construction as&#xd;
a feasible alternative material for corroded bridge deck replacements, footbridges, and emergency&#xd;
vehicle bridges. For both military and civilian applications, there exists a need for bridges that&#xd;
are lightweight and inexpensive, that can be readily transported and easily erected.&#xd;
The 10 m glass FRP deployable box beam presented in this thesis was developed to aid&#xd;
cross-country mobility in areas where infrastructure has been damaged by conflict or natural&#xd;
disasters. The box beam represents one trackway of a dual trackway system. The quasi-static&#xd;
and dynamic behaviour of the box beam was investigated under laboratory and field conditions.&#xd;
Quasi-static tests were conducted to ensure the strength of the steel hinge, the hinge connection to&#xd;
the base plate of the box beam, and the overall box beam would support the vehicle loads in field&#xd;
testing. Data from these tests were used to validate the finite element model. Field testing was&#xd;
conducted to investigate the natural frequencies of the box beam, calculate the dynamic increment&#xd;
of the structure, and confirm the validity of the finite element model created in Matlab. Three&#xd;
vehicles were used to evaluate the response of the box beam to different types of suspension,&#xd;
loads, and number of wheels per trackway.&#xd;
A finite element model was developed to predict the displacement of the bridge under&#xd;
various vehicle loads. The analysis resulted in displacement contours within a reasonable amount&#xd;
of error when compared to those measured in field testing. Recommendations for future research&#xd;
and development of the structure are provided based on this research.</description>

   <description>Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) production strongly influences the ecosystems, cultures and economies of the Northeast Pacific. Historical variability in population sizes is complex, reflecting natural and human drivers. The nature and extent of such ‘exogenous’ controls on salmon and their nursery ecosystems are poorly understood, a significant impediment to sustainable fisheries management.  Novel applications of paleolimnology demonstrate that past sockeye salmon abundances and nursery system ecology can be reconstructed from lake sediments.  This thesis focuses on employing these techniques to establish the forcing mechanisms underlying salmon population and ecosystem dynamics, and determine the effects and interactions of fisheries management.&#xd;
&#xd;
I provided the first reconstruction for a southern North American stock, which demonstrated the influences of both conspicuous (e.g. commercial fishery, main-stem damming) and uncertain human impacts (e.g. local damming) on endangered salmon declines.  By reconstructing ecological variability at multiple trophic levels, I established that rehabilitative management (e.g. fish stocking) may have permanently altered nursery lake rearing capacity, a change potentially reinforced by recent atmospheric changes.  This work highlights significant impediments to ongoing recovery efforts.&#xd;
&#xd;
I extended my analysis of salmon management by exploring the interactive impacts of exotic salmon stocking on a remote northern lake.  I demonstrated the utility of long-term data in pre-emptively understanding the complex impacts of stocking by documenting the long-term trajectories in limnological conditions.  Integrating modeling, limnological and paleolimnological analyses, I determined that climate change and salmon introductions compound to alter chemical, physical and biological lake variables, ultimately altering ecosystem structure and functioning.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally I reconstructed salmon abundances over the past six millennia, the longest record and the first Canadian example to date, demonstrating salmon production is cyclical and far more variable than observed in the monitoring record.  My analyses established that North Pacific salmon production is forced by ocean-atmospheric teleconnections ultimately linked to climatic variability in the tropical Pacific. Further analyses provided the first evidence for a possible solar forcing of Holocene salmon production on both orbital and higher frequency time scales.&#xd;
&#xd;
Cumulatively this research improves our understanding of the processes underlying variability in Pacific salmon and their natal ecosystems, important to ecologically-informed future management.</description>

   <description>Comparing protein structures based on their contact maps is an important problem in structural proteomics. Building a system for reconstructing protein tertiary structures from their contact maps is one of the motivations for devising novel contact map comparison algorithms. Several methods that address the contact map comparison problem have been designed which are briefly discussed in this thesis. However, they suggest scoring schemes that do not satisfy the two characteristics of “metricity” and “universality”. In this research we investigate the applicability of the Universal Similarity Metric (USM) to the contact map comparison problem. The USM is an information theoretical measure which is based on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity. The ultimate goal of this research is to use the USM in case-based reasoning system to predict protein structures from their predicted contact maps. The fact that the contact maps that will be used in such a system are the ones which are predicted from the protein sequences and are not noise-free, implies that we should investigate the noise-sensitivity of the USM. This is the first attempt to study the noise-tolerance of the USM. In this research, as the first implementation of the USM we converted the two-dimensional data structures (contact maps) to one-dimensional data structures (strings). The results of this implementation motivated us to circumvent the dimension reduction in our second attempt to implement the USM. Our suggested method in this thesis has the advantage of obtaining a measure which is noise tolerant. We assess the effectiveness of this noise tolerance by testing different USM implementation schemes against noise-contaminated versions of distinguished data-sets.</description>

   <description>Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men. The gold&#xd;
standard clinical diagnosis method for prostate cancer is histopathologic analysis of biopsy samples acquired under ultrasound&#xd;
guidance. However, most prostate tumors lack visually distinct appearances on medical images. Therefore, pathologically significant&#xd;
cases of cancer can be missed during biopsy, resulting in false negative or repeated trials. The goal of our research is to augment ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy by adding tissue typing information that can be used for targeted biopsies. As a new&#xd;
paradigm in tissue typing, we hypothesize and demonstrate that if a specific location in tissue undergoes sequential interactions with ultrasound, the time series of echoes, which we call radiofrequency (RF) time series, would carry ``tissue typing'' information. We provide a potential physical explanation for this phenomenon and&#xd;
justify it based on computer simulations of the ultrasound probe and scattering media. We also report laboratory and animal studies that illustrate the utility of the method. We rely on a set of seven spectral and fractal features extracted from RF time series for tissue typing.&#xd;
&#xd;
To show the clinical value of the proposed approach, we report an ex-vivo study involving 35 patients in which the utility of&#xd;
RF time series features for detection of prostate tumors is confirmed. The outcomes are validated using histopathologic disease&#xd;
distribution maps provided for the studied specimen. We show that the RF time series features are powerful tissue typing parameters that result in an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xd;
curve of 0.87 in 10-fold cross validation for diagnosis of prostate cancer. They are significantly more accurate and sensitive than spectral features extracted from single RF frames, and also B-scan texture features (area under ROC curve of 0.78 and 0.72,&#xd;
respectively). A combination of these three categories of features results in a feature vector that provides an area under ROC curve of 0.95 in 10-fold cross-validation and 0.82 in leave-one-patient-out cross validation for diagnosis of prostate cancer. Using this hybrid feature vector and support vector machines, we create cancer distribution probability maps that highlight areas of tissue with high risk of cancer.</description>

   <description>Prostate cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men. Brachytherapy has emerged as one of the definitive treatment options for early stage prostate cancer which entails permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate to eradicate the cancer with ionizing radiation. Successful brachytherapy requires the ability to perform dosimetry -which requires seed localization- during the procedure but such function is not available today. If dosimetry could be performed intraoperatively, physicians could implant additional seeds into the under-dosed portions of the prostate while the patient is still on the operating table. This thesis addresses the brachytherapy seed localization problem with introducing intensity based registration between transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) that shows only the prostate and a 3D seed model drawn from fluoroscopy that shows only the implanted seeds. The TRUS images are first filtered and compounded, and then registered to the seed model by using mutual information. A training phantom was implanted with 48 seeds and imaged. Various ultrasound filtering techniques were analyzed. The effect of false positives and false negatives in ultrasound was investigated by randomly masking seeds from the fluoroscopy volume or adding seeds to that in random locations. Furthermore, the effect of sparse and dense ultrasound data was analyzed by running the registration for ultrasound data with different spacing. The registration error remained consistently below clinical threshold and capture range was significantly larger than the initial guess guaranteed by the clinical workflow. This fully automated method provided excellent registration accuracy and robustness in phantom studies and promises to demonstrate clinically adequate performance on human data.</description>

   <description>A Stroke can affect different parts of the human body depending on the area of brain effected; our research focuses on upper limb motor dysfunction for stroke patients. In current practice, ordinal scale systems are used for conducting physical assessment of upper limb impairment. The reliability of these assessments is questionable, since their coarse ratings cannot reliably distinguish between the different levels of performance. This thesis describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel system to facilitate stroke diagnosis which relies on data collected with an innovative KINARM robotic tool. This robotic tool allows for an objective quantification of motor function and performance assessment for stroke patients. &#xd;
The main methodology for the research is Case Based Reasoning (CBR) - an effective paradigm of artificial intelligence that relies on the principle that a new problem is solved by observing similar, previously encountered problems and adapting their known solutions. A CBR system was designed and implemented for a repository of stroke subjects who had an explicit diagnosis and prognosis. For a new stroke patient, whose diagnosis was yet to be confirmed and who had an indefinite prognosis, the CBR model was effectively used to retrieve analogous cases of previous stroke patients. These similar cases provide useful information to the clinicians, facilitating them in reaching a potential solution for stroke diagnosis and also a means to validate other imaging tests and clinical assessments to confirm the diagnosis and prognosis.</description>

   <description>ABSTRACT&#xd;
Using a qualitative methodology, I conducted this study to identify the barriers to women’s post-secondary education in Bangladesh and to investigate the possible strategies to remove those barriers, from the perspectives of three Bangladeshi women who received post-secondary education in Bangladesh and who are currently living in Canada. To explore participants’ perceptions, I used open-ended structured interviews. I then analyzed data using the conceptual framework of subsystems within an open systems theory. &#xd;
The study revealed that the barriers Bangladeshi women encounter when pursuing a post-secondary education are vast and complex. The findings from this study indicated that Bangladeshi women face barriers from multi-level social subsystems such as family, financial, educational, socio-cultural, political, and governmental subsystems. Six broad themes of major barriers emerged from participants’ reports: (a) financial constraints; (b) socio-cultural practices and attitudes; (c) male domination; (d) inadequate education facilities; (e) student politics and unstable political situations; and (f) corrupt government and inconsistent implementation of law and punishment. Within these six themes, the study identified various factors that hamper women’s post-secondary education in Bangladesh.&#xd;
The participants suggested strategies that may help those who make and implement policy find ways to minimize barriers to women’s post-secondary education in Bangladesh and beyond. The results showed that since the barriers are multifaceted, positive collaboration between the various levels of social subsystems in Bangladesh can reduce the difficulties and may profoundly change the overall Bangladeshi attitude towards women and their education. The family or the government systems alone are not enough to remove the deeply-rooted barriers to Bangladeshi women’s higher learning. Future research might explore the perceptions of a larger sample of Bangladeshi women who are in Bangladesh but could not obtain post-secondary education.</description>

   <description>Over the recent years, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have gained world-wide attention due to their reputed potential in promoting spinal cord regeneration and repair.  In order to isolate, identify, and characterize OECs in vitro and following implantation, researchers have used three OEC markers: p75NTR, GFAP, and S100.  The downfall with using these specific proteins is that Schwann cells, which are located within the olfactory system, as well as migrate into the damaged spinal cord, also express these proteins.  It is therefore impossible to distinguish OECs from phenotypically similar Schwann cells using these molecular markers.  &#xd;
Recently proteomic analyses have revealed that OECs (derived from embryonic rat olfactory bulbs), but not Schwann cells (derived from adult rat sciatic nerves) express a variety of proteins.  The main aim of this project is to determine if heat shock protein-27 (Hsp27), carbonic anhydrase-III (CA-III), and annexin-A3 (Anx3) markers label OECs but not Schwann cells, both in vivo and in vitro.  Additional analyses were also done to determine if smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) and calponin (two smooth muscle-related markers previously shown to label mucosal OECs of adult rats) label bulbar OECs of adult rats and OECs of adult cats.   &#xd;
Using immunohistochemistry we found that SMA labeled olfactory mucosal and bulbar OECs of adult rats and adult cats, Hsp27 labeled olfactory mucosal and bulbar OECs of adult rats and olfactory mucosal OECs of adult cats, while calponin labeled only olfactory mucosal OECs of adult rats.  In addition, calponin and SMA did not label Schwann cells (in vivo and in vitro), while Hsp27 labeled this peripheral glial cell.  Finally, CA-III did not label OECs of adult rats or adult cats, in vivo or in vitro, and Anx3 did not label OECs in vivo, but showed immunopositive labeling of OECs and Schwann cells in vitro.  In conclusion, Hsp27, CA-III, and Anx3 cannot be used as OECs markers either because of their expression in both OECs and Schwann cells or their lack of expression in OECs.  Discovering new molecular markers expressed only by OECs is essential in order to determine the properties, fate, and overall potential of OECs in promoting spinal cord regeneration.</description>

   <description>Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has been identified as an emerging risk factor for the development of vascular diseases. The Lp(a) particle is assembled in a 2-step process upon secretion of the LDL and apo(a) components from hepatocytes. Work done by the Koschinsky group has identified an oxidase-like activity present in the conditioned medium (CM) harvested from human hepatoma (HepG2), as well as HEK 293 (human endothelian kidney) cells that catalyzes the rate of covalent Lp(a) formation.  We have taken a candidate enzyme approach to identifying this oxidase activity. Specifically, we have proposed that the QSOX (Quiescin/sulfhydryl oxidase) is responsible for catalysis of covalent Lp(a) assembly. An oxidase activity assay developed by Dr. Thorpe (University of Delaware) was used to detect QSOX1 in CM harvested from cultured cell lines that catalyze covalent Lp(a) assembly. In addition, the QSOX1 transcript was identified in each cell line and quantified with the use of Real-Time RT-PCR. Quantitative assays of covalent Lp(a) assembly were performed to study some characteristics of the unkwown oxidase activity. First, conditioned medium was dialyzed through a 5 kDa cutoff, as this has previously been shown to reduce the aforementioned oxidase activity.  Purified QSOX was then added back to the reaction and the rate of catalysis was observed. The addition of QSOX appeared to enhance the rate of covalent Lp(a) assembly in a dose-dependent manner. Additional covalent Lp(a) assembly assays were performed where various chemicals were added to determine whether Lp(a) assembly was affected. The addition of EDTA did not affect covalent assembly, suggesting that the oxidase activity may not be metallo-dependent. Moreover, dose-dependent addition of Calcium, DTT, Copper and glutathione to dialyzed medium also did not affect the rate of Lp(a) assembly. Taken together, these studies will aid in identifying the nature of the oxidase activity that catalyzes covalent Lp(a) assembly. This will provide us with valuable information on how Lp(a) particles are assembled, and may lead to the development of drugs inhibiting Lp(a) formation.</description>

   <description>During field observations of professional movers, it was noticed that some experienced movers carried loads posterior to their pelvis.  The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to assess the biomechanical differences between hand-held load carriage anterior (AC) and posterior (PC) to the pelvis; and, (2) to determine if an assistive load carriage device could reduce muscle effort while carrying loads either anterior or posterior to the pelvis.&#xd;
	In the first laboratory study, an electromyographic (EMG) analysis was conducted while participants carried a load on a treadmill using AC and PC techniques.    The subjects conducted three trials of AC and PC techniques while EMG data were being collected. All trial data were normalized to their respective iMVE values.  An amplitude probability distribution function (APDF) was used to compare EMG amplitudes between carrying techniques.&#xd;
	Results indicated that PC reduced EMG activity of the erector spinae (>50% reduction), trapezius, and anterior deltoid (p&lt;0.05) as well as increasing EMG activity in the posterior deltoid (p&lt;0.05).  Eighty percent of the subjects reported that the PC method felt awkward.  Due to its awkwardness, many individuals may not use the PC technique; thus, the second purpose of the study was to design an assistive movers’ pack to aid in AC and PC techniques and make the PC method easier to perform.  &#xd;
	In the second study, subjects were asked to walk unloaded while EMG was recorded.  The subjects then performed the AC and PC methods with and without the assistive device.  All EMG signals were normalized to unloaded gait followed by EMG APDF analyses.&#xd;
	Findings from the first study were confirmed, in that PC, compared to AC significantly reduced erector spinae activity (p&lt;0.05) and focused shoulder activity to the posterior deltoid.  Secondly, the assistive device effectively reduced flexor digitorum activity (>40% reduction, p&lt;0.03) and anterior deltoid activity (>75% reduction, p=0.5) in both AC and PC.  Erector spinae EMG remained similar to their respective unassisted conditions.  The assistive load carriage device may be an effective ergonomic tool in both AC and PC techniques.  Subjective surveys indicate that the assistive device decreased the awkwardness in performing the PC technique.</description>

   <description>A new name for an old problem, the “hard problem of consciousness” is perhaps the most controversial issue in the contemporary philosophy of mind. The problem, posed by non-reductivists like Chalmers, is: how do the phenomenal qualities of our conscious&#xd;
experience stand in relation to a physical world that seems logically compatible with their absence? But there is no agreement over what precisely this question is asking about (viz., “phenomenal qualities”), or whether the apparently non-physical explanandum is a real one. At the root of the intractability is the particular way that we have come to think about the question, presupposing i) that the conscious explanandum is an ontological one and thus ii) that the sense in which it exists (as an inner entity) should be straightforward.&#xd;
These assumptions are overturned in the following account in which I argue that the&#xd;
qualitative contents of our experience are in the world, not the ontological mind. I argue that neither the non-reductivist nor the eliminitivist, on analysis, need disagree about this. In Chapter Two, I argue that what the non-reductivist really wants to preserve are the qualities of the world that are invisible to an ontological picture made in terms of scientific unobservables, or trans-experiential physical structures and processes. The eliminitivist, on the other hand, is merely interested in denying the ontologization of these qualities as properties of the ontological mind. On this interpretation, non-reductivists and eliminitivists can be seen to mutually support a solution to the traditional mind-body problem in the form of the non-reductive, non-ontological account of consciousness that I will offer in this thesis: non-reductive, because the properties of our experience are not illegitimately denied (or reduced), and non-ontological because they are not thereby&#xd;
hypostatized (or ontologized). Rather, they are left in the “neutral” public realm where—from a Wittgensteinian perspective—the meanings of the problematic terms of mind-body discourse are fixed.</description>

   <description>The invasion of trophoblast cells into the uterine wall is an essential component of normal human pregnancy. These trophoblast cells transform the uterine spiral arterioles into high-flow, low-resistance vessels that supply the placenta to support fetal growth and development. Inadequate trophoblast invasion and spiral arteriole remodelling may result in excessive placental pathology leading to pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), which are major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. These pregnancy complications have also been linked to an increased presence of pro-inflammatory cytokine-secreting (activated) macrophages at the fetal-maternal interface. In particular, increased production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) by activated macrophages has been implicated as a causative factor mediating various pregnancy complications. Results from this thesis showed that macrophage-derived TNF decreased the invasiveness of trophoblast cells, primarily by affecting the urokinase system of plasminogen activators, a network of proteases that promotes cellular invasion. TNF also stimulated the production of macrophage chemoattractants by trophoblast cells, providing a putative mechanism for the aberrant recruitment and localization of macrophages in complicated pregnancies. Administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent stimulator of macrophage activation and TNF production, to pregnant rats resulted in IUGR and fetal death correlating with significant placental pathology, including displaced endovascular trophoblast cells and increased fibrinoid and macrophage accumulation at the fetal-maternal interface. The immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-10, which inhibited TNF production from macrophages after LPS-exposure, completely prevented the adverse effects of TNF in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that the aberrant presence and localization of TNF-secreting macrophages may be involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of various pregnancy-related complications.</description>

   <description>Anthropogenic and geogenic sources of arsenic (As) have been identified in mining-impacted soils from the Giant mine (1948-1999), NT and the North Brookfield mine (1886-1906), NS.  Both used roasting to extract gold from the arsenopyrite ore, decomposing it to As-bearing iron oxides (roaster oxides or RO) containing As, and releasing As3+-bearing arsenic trioxide (As2O3). Arsenic trioxide is considered highly soluble with the dissolved As3+ species being more mobile and toxic than other oxidation states.&#xd;
Soil profiles from the Giant mine show elevated As and antimony (Sb) at the surface (As=140-3300ppm) and decreasing concentrations with depth (As=22-600ppm).  Surface soils contain anthropogenically-derived As2O3 identified using synchrotron methods (µXRD, µXANES) and environmental SEM.  The persistence of As2O3 is attributed to Sb in As2O3 grains, dry climate and high organics in the soils. Anthropogenically-derived RO of maghemite (containing both As3+ and As5+) and natural arsenopyrite were observed.  Sequential selective extractions (SSE) from surface soils show between 20% and 75% of As extracted in the crystalline iron-oxide phase is attributed to As2O3 and RO, while at depth As is bound by organics in the weaker leaches.  &#xd;
North Brookfield mine soils show lower total As (2ppm to 45ppm) except near the roaster (4300ppm).  No As2O3 was identified, probably due to the smaller scale and age of the mine, lower organic content and the lack of Sb.  As-bearing phases include RO of hematite (As5+), As-rich rims on titanium-oxides, and As associated with clays and goethite.  Adjacent to the roaster, SSE show As was also in the amorphous iron-oxide phase, also shown by As in arsenopyrite weathering rims.&#xd;
&#xd;
There are many differences between the North Brookfield and Giant mine soils including roasting techniques which produced different RO mineralogy, the scale of mining, climate, soil type, and the presence of As2O3.  Currently, the Giant property is not publically accessible but may become so in the future while the North Brookfield property is accessible.  Understanding the form and distribution of As phases is critical because of the potential risk to human and ecosystem health associated with ingestion of soil particles and their control on the total dissolved As in surface and groundwater.</description>

   <description>Executive function, the cognitive processes that allow the voluntary control of goal-directed behaviour, can be studied through the examination of inhibition of action. The countermanding paradigm has been shown to be a powerful tool to examine a subject’s ability to withhold responses to a go stimulus when a stop signal is presented occasionally. Logan and Cowan (1984) developed a race model to account for countermanding performance in humans, proposing that independent go and stop process initiated by the go and stop signals respectively, race toward a finish line whereby the first process to cross its finish line determines the behavioural outcome. The model allows estimation of the stop signal response time, a variable that is not directly observable. The race model has yet to be validated for countermanding performance in rats. Using a new rodent countermanding task inspired directly from human studies, male Wistar rats were trained to respond to a visual stimulus (go signal) by pressing a lever below an illuminated light for food reward, but to countermand lever the press (25% of trials) subsequent to an auditory tone (stop signal) presented after a variable delay. The ability to cancel a response decreased as stop signal delay increased. The stop signal response time for rats was estimated to be 157 ms, a value within the range of human estimates. Predictions of countermanding performance made by the race model were generally respected. Response times of movements that escape inhibition: 1) were shorter than those of movements made in the absence of a stop signal; 2) gradually lengthened with increasing stop signal delay; and most importantly, 3) were predicted by the race model. These findings demonstrate that the countermanding performance of rodents can be accounted for by a simple race model, which has been applied successfully in human studies and nonhuman primate models. This new animal model will permit complementary invasive investigations of brain mechanisms underlying inhibitory control and refine the existing rodent models of neurological disease and impulsivity.</description>

   <description>The Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phase is widely used in liquid and supercritical chromatography for the separation of enantiomers. The enantioselective mechanism of the Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phase is the main focus of this thesis. Semi-flexible models are developed based on ab initio calculations for the Whelk-O1 selector and a series of chiral analytes. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations are then applied to study the solvation, selectivity and in silico optimization of the chiral stationary phase. &#xd;
          The solvation of the Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phase has been explored in a normal phase n-hexane/2-propanol solvent, a reversed phase water/methanol solvent, and a supercritical CO2/methanol solvent. We found that, in all three solvents, the Whelk-O1 selectors are open to the bulk, indicating readiness for docking of analyte. Significant solvent partitioning at the interfaces was noticed, which generates a polarity gradient between the stationary phase and the bulk, and may encourage a high analyte concentration at the interface. Hydrogen bonding activities on the amide hydrogen, amide oxygen, and nitro oxygen of the Whelk selector have also been analyzed.&#xd;
          The selectivity of the Whelk selector was studied by molecular dynamics simulations of analyte docking on the chiral stationary phase. The elution orders and the separation factors for a series of analytes were predicted successfully.  We found that hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions are essential for the enantioselectivity as they are strong and specific, and they hold analytes to the cleft region of the Whelk selector. Other interactions, both stabilizing interactions such as the CH-π interaction and the edge-to-face π-π interaction, and destabilizing interactions such as steric hindrance and unfavorable conformational changes also contribute to the enantioselectivity. &#xd;
          We identified a dominant docking arrangement for the most retained enantiomers. Other docking arrangements were found to be more frequent for the least retained enantiomers and these involve interactions with alternative selector sites. Based on the identified enantioselective mechanism obtained from the study, an optimization of the Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phase was undertaken and in silico evaluation of the modified chiral stationary phases was carried out. It was demonstrated that restriction of the alternative docking arrangements for the least retained enantiomers could possibly improve the enantioselectivity of the chiral stationary phase.</description>

   <description>Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a major groundwater contaminant and is a cause of serious health concern. Methanotrophic TCE degradation is very promising compared with other treatments.  Methanotrophs produce methane monooxygenases (MMOs) which catalyze methane oxidation and cometabolize chlorinated and aromatic compounds. High rate of TCE degradation is attributed to only soluble MMO (sMMO) expressed mainly by type II methanotrophs under copper-deficient conditions. To make methanotrophic TCE degradation practical, high density methanotrophic biomass with high sMMO activity is required. Methane is the primary substrate for methanotrophs and sufficient quantities must be supplied to support biomass growth. Because of the poor water solubility of methane, mass transfer limitation essentially restricts high biomass production. When methanol was used as the growth substrate, biomass concentration of 7.4 g l-1 Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was achieved in a 160-h fermentation using an exponential feeding strategy based on pre-determined . Even higher biomass density of 19 and 29 g l-1 biomass were obtained by a modified feeding strategy based on carbon dioxide production. It is concluded that methanol is a promising substrate for the production of large amounts of M. trichosporium OB3bbiomass. In addition, allylthiourea was applied to methanotrophs growth medium to circumvent the inhibitory effect of copper, which inhibits sMMO activity but not particulate MMO (pMMO). We successfully retained sMMO activity by supplementing allylthiourea.  Even when M. trichosporium OB3b was grown with 4.5 M copper, which would completely block sMMO expression, addition of 15 M allylthiourea preserved half of the sMMO activity.  It was also observed that switching the growth substrate from methane to methanol did not significantly affect sMMO activity. An immobilized soil bioreactor was developed to examine the efficiency of methanotrophic TCE degradation by combining the knowledge obtained on high biomass production and applying allylthiourea for sMMO expression. In a batch TCE degradation experiment, about 63% of TCE was removed in 5.75 h. The maximal TCE degradation rate of 1.40 mg l-1 h-1 was obtained in a continuous TCE degradation at a dilution rate of 0.15 h-1. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel bioreactor system for methanotrophic TCE degradation.</description>

   <description>The present study describes the development of an FE model of tooling during production of a transmission gear. Results of the simulation at the puck/die interface during ejection examine the behavior of friction. Machine component deflections under pressure and areas of wear/binding are also predicted. The tooling was developed and modeled in Abaqus, an FE pre- and post-processor. A metal PM (Powder Metallurgy) puck is simulated from the point at the end of compaction, and then at several positions during ejection. A test setup was designed and built. The apparatus will be used to create iron powder compacts, and experimental results will be used to evaluate future models. Experiments with the new design will enable future studies of friction at the puck/die interface. The current design is for a simple puck and an increase in part geometry complexity is proposed with preliminary design requirements.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-10-02 15:07:22.11</description>
   <description>The purpose of this work was to quantify the effect of the personal lift assist device (PLAD) on kinetic and kinematic variables commonly indentified as risk factors for low back pain (LBP).  As such, three investigations were undertaken to document adaptations that occur as a consequence of wearing the PLAD. &#xd;
The first study involved an investigation of the effects of the PLAD on intervertebral compression and shear, using an EMG-assisted biomechanical model across a range of trunk flexion.  Muscle activation (EMG), trunk posture, and PLAD support data were input into a biomechanical model that estimated L4/L5 joint loads.  Use of the PLAD significantly reduced joint compression across the range of trunk flexion.  Significant changes in shear were also found, although this was varied across conditions. &#xd;
The second study was conducted to quantify differences in lifting posture, lifting kinematics, and co-ordination attributable to use of the PLAD.  Over two testing sessions, subjects completed a repetitive lifting task with and without use of the PLAD.  Kinematic data describing lumbar spine, hip and knee motion were used to quantify lifting posture, lifting velocities, and co-ordination.  The results of the study suggest that the PLAD causes users to lift with significantly less lumbar flexion and greater hip flexion.  Significant changes in co-ordination were also observed, reflective of motor adaptation to the assistance provided by the PLAD.&#xd;
The final study was conducted to investigate the effect of the PLAD on active trunk stiffness.  Subjects were required to assume a series of static, symmetrical flexed postures.  Muscle activation (EMG), trunk posture, and PLAD stiffness data were input into a stability model that estimated active trunk stiffness.  Up to 15 degrees of flexion, the PLAD increased the overall stiffness of the trunk.  However, use of the PLAD significantly reduced the active stiffness of the trunk as flexion increased.  This effect was consistent across PLAD conditions. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and evaluate a potential redesign.  In general, the results of these studies illustrate the potential for the PLAD to be used as an ergonomic intervention for industrial tasks requiring lifting and/or flexed static postures.</description>

   <description>There exist at present a broad range of environmental challenges, and there are strong and varied movements seeking to take action on these issues in a range of ways. What is deeply contested, however, is how these environmental problems should be framed, and through what means solutions ought to be developed. At the heart of these questions is the need to critically evaluate dominant political framings that seek to contain and manage, rather than engage, these ecological challenges. What is required instead is the development of viable ecopolitical practices that are able to generate practicable solutions while retaining the capacity to grow, develop, and sustain life. &#xd;
In addressing the challenge of theorizing such a viable ecopolitics, I work to productively combine phenomenologically-informed understandings of place with an Arendtian formulation of the conditions of political life in a way that can help to create inhabited ecological spaces of appearance. Such spaces can offer the potential to respectfully include ecological considerations in political decision-making, to foster an acknowledgement and valuing of the situatedness of particular political actions, and to open up discursive and interpretive possibilities while maintaining this openness through sustained political negotiation.&#xd;
In order to explore the possibilities and potential implications of such an ecopolitical space, I begin by outlining what I understand to be the current ecopolitical challenge and its associated problematic inclusive and exclusive dynamics. I move on to offer a possible response to this ecopolitical challenge through an exploration of particular characteristics of place experience and the potential for phenomenological views of place to gather various elements of the more-than-human world into an arena of common engagement or appearance. Critically examining current state-centric political framings, and their inability to adequately meet this ecopolitical challenge, I appeal instead to a richer and more dynamic Arendtian formulation of political life. Finally I work to develop an understanding of how this expanded conception of the political can be combined with phenomenological understandings of place to begin to create vibrant and creative ecopolitical spaces in practice.</description>

   <description>Three different B-site additives, Mg1/3Nb2/3, Zr4+, and Cu1/2W1/2, were added to BNT ceramics in varying concentrations.  These were abbreviated as BNMN, BNZ, and BNCW, respectively.  The compositions were calcined to form a perovskite structure, ground to a fine powder, pressed into tablets and sintered to form dense ceramics.  XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the perovskite phase.  The electro-mechanical properties of the ceramics were evaluated. &#xd;
 &#xd;
There were improvements in the low-field room temperature dielectric constant of 30% with 25% BNMN, 13% with 10% BNZ, and 16% with 2% BNCW. Higher concentrations of the additives degraded the dielectric performance. &#xd;
 &#xd;
The conductivity of the BNT ceramics was reduced with very small concentrations (0.25 to 0.5%) of each of the additives. This reduction was maintained at the higher concentrations of the additives, which allowed for higher electric fields to be applied during both the poling process and the strain measurements.  Improvements of approximately 30% in the d33 values were found at concentrations of 0.5% of each of the additives, but higher concentrations of the additives degraded the d33 values.&#xd;
  &#xd;
The coercive field was affected by the additions to BNT.  Increasing concentrations of BNMN reduced the coercive field in bipolar strain measurements. This was accompanied by a reduction in the remanent strain.  Small additions (0.5 to 1.5%) of BNZ resulted in an increase in the coercive field by about 12%, followed by a 25% decrease at 5% BNZ.  The remanent strain followed the same pattern. All concentrations of BNCW studied reduced the coercive field by about 12%. The remanent strain increased by 25% at 0.5% BNCW, and decreased by 42% at 2.5% BNCW.&#xd;
&#xd;
The electro-mechanical results for the BNMN and BNZ additives were compared to the behaviours of their lead-based counterparts, PMN and PZ.  There was no consistent trend in the response of the electromechanical properties to the additions between the current lead-free and the lead-based systems.</description>

   <title>The Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 in Nitrate Tolerance</title>

   <description>Organic nitrates such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) are commonly used to treat myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure. GTN is proposed to act as a prodrug that requires bioactivation for pharmacological activity. However, continuous administration results in tolerance development, limiting its clinical usefulness. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) has been proposed to be the primary enzyme responsible for GTN bioactivation, and ALDH2 inactivation has been proposed as the sole basis of nitrate tolerance. In the present study, we utilized an in vivo GTN tolerance model to investigate the role of ALDH2 in GTN bioactivation and tolerance. We assessed changes in ALDH2 protein, mRNA and activity levels in rat blood vessels during chronic GTN exposure (0.4 mg/hr for 6, 12, 24 and 48 hr) in relation to changes in vasodilator responses to GTN. A time-dependent decrease in both ALDH2 expression and activity occurred (80% in tolerant veins and 30% in tolerant arteries after 48 hrs exposure to GTN), concomitant with decreased vasodilator responses to GTN. However, after a 24 hr drug-free period following 48 hr GTN exposure, the vasodilator responses to GTN had returned to control values, whereas ALDH2 expression and activity were still markedly depressed.  The dissociation between reduced ALDH2 activity and expression, and the duration of the impaired vasodilator responses to GTN in nitrate-tolerant blood vessels, suggest factors other than changes in ALDH2-mediated GTN bioactivation contribute to nitrate tolerance.</description>

   <description>The 2006 Clean Water Act requires each municipality to come up with science-based plans to protect the quality and quantity of their drinking water. A literature review concerning applicable processes in Lake Ontario along with previous modelling of the lake is presented.&#xd;
&#xd;
The three dimensional Estuary, Lake and Coastal Oceans Model (ELCOM) is used to model Lake Ontario on a 2×2km grid scale. The model is forced using meteorological data from the 2006 summer season, inflows and outflows. The lake-wide model is evaluated using field data from thermistor chains and ADCPs as well as historical water level data. Simulated and observed temperature profiles compared well. However, modelled temperature profiles were slightly cooler than observed. Current results were more variable than temperature profile results but compared better to observed data in the offshore regions. Simulating Lake Ontario water levels proved to be problematic because an accurate water balance is difficult to force with a large drainage basin.&#xd;
&#xd;
A 300×300m nearshore model of the eastern portion of Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River is also presented. The open boundary is forced using temperature data which is (A) varied with depth, (B) constant with depth and (C) spatially varied over the length of the open boundary and varied with depth. Both spatially varied and non-varied water level data forcing the open boundary is also compared. Spatially varied temperature and water level data is computed from the coarse grid lake-wide model. Lake-wide coarse grid model error appears to propagate through the open boundary negatively affecting nearshore modelled current when coupling the models. It was concluded that lake-wide model results should not be used to force the open boundary for the nearshore model. Nearshore model results using constant temperature with depth forcing files and non-spatially varied water level data agree well with observed temperature profiles, but further analysis is required for better confidence in the model's ability to properly reproduce currents at a 300×300m grid scale.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a comprehensive study on the thermal modelling aspects of laser transmission welding of thermoplastics (LTW), a technology for joining of plastic parts.  In the LTW technique, a laser beam passes through the laser-transmitting part and is absorbed within a thin layer in the laser-absorbing part.  The heat generated at the interface of the two parts melts a thin layer of the plastic and, with applying appropriate clamping pressure, joining occurs.  Transient thermal models for the LTW process were developed and solved by the finite element method (FEM).  Input to the models included temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties that were adopted from well-known sources, material suppliers, or obtained by conducting experiments.  In addition, experimental and theoretical studies were conducted to estimate the optical properties of the materials such as the absorption coefficient of the laser-absorbing part and light scattering by the laser-transmitting part.  Lap-joint geometry was modelled for semi crystalline (polyamide - PA6) and amorphous (polycarbonate - PC) materials.  &#xd;
The thermal models addressed the heating and cooling stages in a laser welding process with a stationary and moving laser beam.  An automated ANSYS® script and MATLAB® codes made it possible to input a three-dimensional (3D), time-varying volumetric heat-generation term to model the absorption of a moving diode-laser beam.  The result was a 3D time-transient, model of the laser transmission welding process implemented in the ANSYS® FEM environment.  &#xd;
In the thermal imaging experiments, a stationary or moving laser beam was located in the proximity of the side surface of the two parts being joined in a lap-joint configuration.  The side surface was then observed by the thermal imaging camera.  For the case of the stationary beam, the laser was activated for 10 s while operating at a low power setting.  For the case of the moving beam, the beam was translated parallel to the surface observed by the camera.  The temperature distribution of a lap joint geometry exposed to a stationary and moving diode-laser beam, obtained from 3D thermal modelling was then compared with the thermal imaging observations.  The predicted temperature distribution on the surface of the laser-absorbing part observed by the thermal camera agreed within 3C with that of the experimental results.  Predicted temperatures on the laser-transmitting part surface were generally higher by 15C  to 20C.  This was attributed to absorption coefficient being set too high in the model for this part.  Thermal imaging of the soot-coated laser-transmitting part surface indicated that significantly more scattering and less absorption takes place in this part than originally assumed.  For the moving laser beam, good model match with the experiments (peak temperatures predicted within 1C) was obtained for some of the process conditions modelled for PA6 parts.  In addition, a novel methodology was developed to extract the scattered laser beam power distribution from the thermal imaging observations of the moving laser beam.</description>

   <description>The Garry oak (Quercus garryana) is a species of oak tree native to North America’s Pacific coast. Its range in Canada is limited to the east coast of Vancouver Island, the southern Gulf Islands, and two isolated groves in the Fraser River valley. It is most widespread and conspicuous in Greater Victoria, the urban area centred around the city of Victoria, British Columbia. Garry oaks themselves and areas of relatively undisturbed land containing Garry oaks are threatened in Victoria by a number of factors including land development, the tree’s unpopularity as an ornamental species, and fire suppression. The Garry oak’s predicament provides rationale for the central goal of this thesis, which is to explore how people have known these trees in the 165 years since Fort Victoria was established. Using a range of print sources, I identify five prominent areas of knowledge about the tree, or Garry oak cultures. These are: Garry oaks as significant of Britishness, Garry oaks as known through science, Garry oaks as significant individual trees, Garry oaks as remnants of pre-colonial landscapes, and Garry oaks as advocated for by conservationists. From these, I draw three key themes. First, many people have found Victoria’s Garry oaks valuable or important and expressed that sense of value in a variety of ways. Second, people have used Garry oaks in narratives of national identity, though in divergent ways: for some Garry oaks have been symbolic of Britain and Victoria’s supposed connection with the mother country, and for others Garry oaks are to be regarded only as a native species. Third, scientific language and concepts have been used to understand Garry oaks with increasing popularity over the past few decades, especially as public awareness grows of the oaks’ ecological crisis. Following recent work in cultural geography, I contend that people negotiate connections to place through trees&#xd;
such as Garry oaks. Though these findings must be understood to be preliminary, they can help to explain the plight of the Garry oak by casting light on ambiguities and dissonances in the ways that Victoria’s diverse citizenry relates to the places they inhabit.</description>

   <description>Three studies were undertaken to examine the relationship between the Dark Triad (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism) and faking ability. Study 1 examined the relationship between psychopathy and the ability to fake good and fake bad on self-report personality inventories in a sample of 84 male federal offenders. Results showed that when faking good, successful fakers scored significantly higher than unsuccessful fakers on carefree nonplanfulness, and significantly lower on stress immunity. When faking bad, successful and unsuccessful fakers did not differ significantly on psychopathy total or subscale scores. Study 2 examined the effect of the Dark Triad on the ability to fake good and fake bad on self-report personality inventories in a sample of 166 undergraduates. Results indicated that when faking good, total psychopathy significantly predicted successful faking for 1 of 3 methods of evaluation, while Machiavellianism significantly predicted success at faking good for 2 of 3 methods of evaluation. Narcissism was unrelated to success at faking good. In addition, the Dark Triad constructs did not predict success at faking bad. Study 3 examined the relationship between the Dark Triad constructs and the ability to fake good interpersonally.  In this study, 32 undergraduates comprising four groups (i.e., controls, and individuals high in psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism) provided videotaped self-presentations. A separate group of 134 university students subsequently rated the veracity of these presentations. Results indicated that when faking good, psychopathy and narcissism groups were rated as more believable than the control group. Conversely, the Machiavellianism group was less successful at faking good than the control group. Contributions of this research to the fields of personality assessment and self-presentation are discussed.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-10-15 08:45:05.783</description>
   <description>Static liquefaction is a sudden decrease of soil shear strength due to the rapid development of pore pressures generated during the collapse of loose, saturated soil deposits. If this type of failure occurs in sloping soils, a flowslide can result. Viscous debris moving down a slope with high velocity could cover a vast area and cause significant loss of life and property.&#xd;
&#xd;
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the triggering factors of liquefaction in shallow slopes through the physical modeling technique of centrifuge testing. A flowslide simulator was developed to investigate the factors that lead to the liquefaction of soil slopes. This simulator was capable of replicating groundwater regimes and intense rainfalls with pore pressure transducers to monitor the pore pressure changes in the model slope and digital cameras to calculate the resultant slope deformation, velocity, and acceleration using the Particle Image Velocimetry method (PIV) of digital image correlation.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In the course of this research, four centrifuge tests have been performed to evaluate the triggering mechanisms of fast landslides in shallow slopes. A seepage induced failure was simulated in the first test. The second and third tests were conducted applying different groundwater regimes in combination with intense rainfall to bring the slope to failure. The last test was a rainfall induced failure in the absence of a pre-existing groundwater table. The results from these experiments illustrate that the initial groundwater level has a considerable effect on the mobility of flowslides.</description>

   <description>While much evidence suggests that ecosystem functioning is closely related to biodiversity, present rates of biodiversity loss are high. With the emergence of the metacommunity concept ecologists have become increasingly aware that both local processes (e.g. competition, predation), and regional processes (e.g. dispersal and regional heterogeneity) affect ecological communities at multiple spatial scales. I experimentally investigated the effects of habitat connectivity and regional heterogeneity on biodiversity, community composition, and ecosystem functioning of artificial pond metacommunities of freshwater invertebrates at the local (α), among-community (β), and regional (γ) spatial levels.&#xd;
	There was a significant effect of habitat connectivity on mean local richness, but mean local Simpson diversity, mean local functional diversity (FD), and all the three indices of ecosystem functioning investigated (regional abundance, invertebrate biomass, and chlorophyll a concentration) were unaffected by connectivity levels. Regional heterogeneity had no effect on local diversity, but enhanced both among-community richness and among-community Simpson diversity. Conversely, connectivity reduced among-community Simpson diversity. All indices of regional diversity were unaffected by either connectivity or heterogeneity. Despite expectations that there would be strong interactions between the effects of connectivity and heterogeneity on species richness, there were no interactions for any index of biodiversity at any spatial scale. Invertebrate community composition was unaffected by either connectivity or heterogeneity, though there was a significant effect of heterogeneity on its variance. Neither connectivity nor heterogeneity had significant effects on any index of ecosystem functioning, nor among-community coefficients of variation of ecosystem functioning. &#xd;
	Connectivity appears to act mainly as a force homogenizing habitat patches in a region, as opposed to having strong effects in and of itself on communities. Conversely, heterogeneity acts largely as a diversifying force, maintaining differences between communities within a region, but, similar to connectivity, it does not have clear effects on communities at the local scale. Despite the different processes expected to act in homogeneous and heterogeneous regions, it does not appear that connectivity and heterogeneity interact strongly.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2008-10-16 16:19:46.617</description>
   <description>Distributed systems, characterized by their ability to ensure the execution of multiple&#xd;
transactions across a myriad of applications, constitute a prime platform for&#xd;
building Web applications. However, Web application interactions raise issues pertaining to security and performance that make manual security management both&#xd;
time-consuming and challenging. This thesis is a testimony to the security and performance enhancements afforded by using the autonomic computing paradigm to design an adaptive cryptographic access control framework for dynamic data sharing environments. One of the methods of enforcing cryptographic access control in these environments is to classify users into one of several groups interconnected in the form of a partially ordered set. Each group is assigned a single cryptographic key that is used for encryption/decryption. Access to data is granted only if a user holds the "correct" key, or can derive the required key from the one in their possession. This approach to access control is a good example of one that provides good security but has the drawback of reacting to changes in group membership by replacing keys, and re-encrypting the associated data, throughout the entire hierarchy. Data re-encryption is time-consuming, so, rekeying creates delays that impede performance. In order to support our argument in favor of adaptive security, we begin by presenting two cryptographic key management (CKM) schemes in which key updates&#xd;
affect only the class concerned or those in its sub-poset. These extensions enhance&#xd;
performance, but handling scenarios that require adaptability remain a challenge.&#xd;
Our framework addresses this issue by allowing the CKM scheme to monitor the rate&#xd;
at which key updates occur and to adjust resource (keys and encrypted data versions) allocations to handle future changes by anticipation rather than on demand. Therefore, in comparison to quasi-static approaches, the adaptive CKM scheme minimizes the long-term cost of key updates. Finally, since self-protecting CKM requires a lesser degree of physical intervention by a human security administrator, we consider the case of "collusion attacks" and propose two algorithms to detect as well as prevent&#xd;
such attacks. A complexity and security analysis show the theoretical improvements&#xd;
our schemes offer. Each algorithm presented is supported by a proof of concept&#xd;
implementation, and experimental results to show the performance improvements.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2008-10-16 16:27:56.732</description>
   <description>The main objective of this thesis was to determine the metabolic and behavioural outcomes from hypoxia exposure to largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) yearlings when acclimated to either winter (5°C) or summer (20°C) temperatures.  This was achieved by exposing largemouth bass to varying levels of hypoxia and subsequently quantifying metabolites, in addition to observing behavioural patterns.  The critical partial pressure of oxygen was also determined for fish at both temperatures.&#xd;
	Hypoxia experiments revealed that metabolite concentrations increased or decreased significantly compared to control values as hypoxia levels intensified at 20°C, however there were minimal changes for fish at 5°C.  More specifically, end product concentrations of lactate increased, while substrate concentrations of ATP, PCr and  glycogen decreased and glucose concentrations did not change significantly at 20°C.  It was also found that the magnitude of change was greater for fish at 20°C, indicating the impact of hypoxia is greater at warmer temperatures.  In addition, it was noted that hypoxia experiments performed at either identical percent oxygen saturation (%) or identical dissolved oxygen (mg/L) resulted in very similar metabolite trends at both temperatures.  &#xd;
	In terms of behaviour, ventilation rates increased significantly and peaked at 2mg/L for largemouth bass at 20°C, however there was no change for fish at 5°C.  There were also more instances of aquatic surface respiration with increasing hypoxia for fish at 20°C, but nearly no attempts at 5°C. &#xd;
Critical partial pressure of oxygen (Pcrit) values were calculated to be 1.36 ± 0.02 mg/L (16% oxygen saturation) for 20°C and 0.77 ± 0.04 mg/L (5% oxygen saturation) for 5°C fish respectively.  The Pcrit levels corresponded to the hypoxia levels that initiated changes in metabolite concentrations at each temperature, thus indicating that largemouth bass undergo anaerobic metabolism.  &#xd;
	This study shows that the overall impact of hypoxia on largemouth bass yearlings was much greater in warmer water.  These results indicate that hypoxia may become a very important physiological stress on younger life stages of fish as water temperatures increase with climate change.</description>

   <description>The current research, across three studies, examined two social practices that involve processing and responding to others’ emotions, theory of mind (ToM) and empathy, and how they relate to dysphoria and the social impairments associated with dysphoria over time. &#xd;
Mildly depressed, or dysphoric, individuals, have been found to have heightened ToM when identifying others’ emotions, despite reporting widespread social impairments (Harkness et al., 2005). The first study (Chapter 2) examined if and how ToM is a mediator in the relationship between dysphoria and social functioning. Attribution style, specifically the internalizing attribution bias, was hypothesized to play a role. The interaction between ToM and internalizing attribution bias was independently associated with social functioning. For internalizing attributors, higher ToM was related to better social functioning, but no relationship was observed between ToM and social functioning among non-internalizing attributors.&#xd;
The second study (Chapter 3) examined the relationship between ToM and empathy, addressing the debate surrounding cognitive and affective aspects of ToM and empathy. Affective ToM and cognitive empathy both have been described as processes involving cognitive inferences about others’ emotions. Current results supported this link, showing that a specific component of empathy, perspective-taking, was related to ToM. Although ToM was associated with some aspects of empathy, empathy remained a separate construct that includes both cognitive and emotional responding to others’ emotions.&#xd;
Chapter 4 shifted focus to empathy to examine how this social practice relates to dysphoria and social functioning. The last study first examined how empathy relates to dysphoria. Results showed that only personal distress, one component of empathy, was associated with greater dysphoria. &#xd;
The final study also examined if the empathy x emotion regulation interaction mediates the relationship between dysphoria and social functioning. Different patterns were observed for different emotion regulation types. The interaction between maladaptive, but not adaptive, emotion regulation strategies and empathy was correlated directly with social functioning. For individuals with negative cognitive emotion regulation strategies, greater empathy was associated with better social functioning, a relationship not present for individuals who do not use negative cognitive emotion regulation. Finally maladaptive, but not adaptive, emotion regulation significantly predicted social functioning after controlling for dysphoria.</description>

   <description>Objectives: Determine the effect of contraction type and intensity, inertial loading, and visual feedback on various measures of hand tremor in subjects with essential tremor.  Methods: Study 1.   Twenty-three ET subjects and 22 controls held their hand in an outstretched position while supporting various submaximal loads (no-load, 5%, 15% and 25% 1-repetition maximum). Hand postural tremor and wrist extensor neuromuscular activity (EMG) were recorded.  Study 2. Twenty-one ET subjects and 22 controls applied isometric wrist extension contractions with and without visual feedback. Various submaximal contraction intensities were evaluated (5%, 10%, 20% and 30% MVC). Force production and EMG were recorded. Study 3. Twenty-one ET subjects and 22 healthy controls performed slow wrist extension-flexion movements while supporting various submaximal loads (no-load, 5%, 15% and 25% 1-repetition maximum). Angular displacement and EMG were recorded.  Results: Study 1. Inertial loading resulted in a reduction in postural tremor in ET subjects. The largest reduction in tremor amplitude occurred at the 15% load, which was associated with spectral separation of the mechanical reflex and central tremor component. Despite an increase in overall neuromuscular activity with inertial loading, EMG tremor power did not increase with loading.  Study 2. Higher contraction intensities were associated with larger amplitude force fluctuations and greater EMG amplitudes. Tremor spectral power of force and EMG remained constant at all target intensities, resulting in a reduction in relative tremor power at higher contraction intensities. Visual feedback affected subjects in the control and ET groups similarly. Study 3. Subjects with more pronounced tremor spectral peaks had larger amplitude kinetic tremor, which was reduced with inertial loading. Despite an increase in overall neuromuscular activity with inertial loading, EMG tremor spectral power was only slightly increased with loading, which resulted in a large reduction in relative EMG tremor power. Conclusions: The effect of inertial loading on postural and kinetic tremor amplitude appears to be mediated in large part by its effect on the interaction between the mechanical reflex and central tremor components. The level of motor unit entrainment remains relatively constant in subjects with ET despite increasing contraction intensities.</description>

   <description>Several genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis can influence longevity. Although observations in several different systems imply that apoptosis and aging are closely linked, the relationship between the two remains largely unknown. In this study, Drosophila melanogaster was used as a model organism to explore the relationship between aging and apoptosis regulation. Apoptosis was investigated using two apoptotic hallmarks: caspase activity and DNA fragmentation. The results showed that apoptosis occured in adult flies at all ages and the changes in apoptosis associated with aging were linked to physiological age and were tissue-specific. During normal fly aging, apoptosis increased gradually within the muscle and was activated in the fat of old flies. However, neither of the two apoptotic signs were shown in the nervous system. The analysis of the apoptotic response to starvation and oxidative stress suggested that the increased apoptosis in muscle resulted from the accumulation of oxidative damage associated with aging. Once the presence of apoptosis during Drosophila aging was confirmed, the expression of anti-apoptotic genes was manipulated in specific tissues to examine the impact of a localized alternation of apoptosis on aging. The overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes in muscle extended Drosophila mean and maximum life span up to 99% and 65%, respectively. This extension was mediated by apoptosis inhibition using the detection of caspase activity and DNA fragmentation. In addition, the long-lived animals exhibited increased resistance to oxidative stress and preserved flight ability. Overall this study establishes that muscle apoptosis limits life span and participates in sarcopenia. This finding may have applications in the development of interventions to improve the life quality of elderly human.</description>

   <description>A business application automates a collection of business processes. A business process describes how a set of logically related tasks are executed, ordered and managed by following business rules to achieve business objectives. An “online book purchase” business process contains several tasks such as buying a book, ordering a book, and sending out promotions. In this ever changing business environment, both of business applications and business processes are modified to accommodate changed business requirements and improve the performance of the organization. These continuous modifications introduce problems in the following two aspects: &#xd;
1) Business process definitions are rarely updated to reflect the current business processes deployed in business applications. 2) Business processes may be cloned (e.g., copied and slightly modified) to handle special circumstances or promotions. Identifying these clones and removing them help improve the efficiency of an organization. However, business processes are defined with textual languages that cannot be automatically understood. &#xd;
To maintain business process definitions up to date, we present our techniques that automatically recover business processes from UIs of business applications and identify clones in the recovered business processes. We leverage UI design patterns, which present the best practices of UI designs, to capture business processes from UIs. To refine the recovered business processes and mark the functionally equivalent tasks, we use existing code clone detection tools, such as CCFinder and CloneDR, to detect clones in business applications, and lift clones from code level to business process level. The effectiveness of our techniques is demonstrated through a case study on 15 large open source business applications.</description>

   <description>The pathophysiology of essential tremor (ET) is not clearly understood but is thought to involve multiple brain regions. The purpose of this study was to describe in greater detail head tremor in ET and to investigate the possible relationship between head and hand tremor.&#xd;
Ten ET subjects were recruited (1 male, 9 female) and compared to three control subjects (1 male, 2 female). Head and hand tremors were recorded simultaneously with surface electromyography (EMG) of the wrist extensors and various neck muscles, laser displacement sensors (hand tremor), a load cell (hand tremor) and an accelerometer (head tremor). While seated, subjects performed four tasks: 1) constant force (10% maximum) wrist extensions (with and without visual feedback);  maintenance of the hands in a horizontal posture against gravity while 2) seated upright in a chair, 3) seated in a reclined chair (20° backward, head not supported);  and 4) seated upright in a chair and producing steady submaximal hip adduction forces.  &#xd;
Head tremor spectral peaks were found between 3.5 and 7 Hz in neck muscle EMG and the accelerometer signal. Wrist tremor (EMG and kinematic data) was slightly higher in frequency with a range of 4 -10 Hz. Of the ten ET subjects recruited for this study, 60% (n = 6) demonstrated significant levels of coherence (p &lt; 0.05) in at least one neck-wrist muscle comparison at the fundamental frequency of their tremor. The results demonstrated an obvious bias of the trapezius descendens (TD) muscles over the more axial neck muscles to demonstrate significant coherence with the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles. Of the six neck muscles investigated, the SPLs and the SCMs were commonly driven at the same frequencies (change in frequency &lt; 0.5), although this seldom resulted in coherence. There is indication that the oscillatory activity driving more distal muscles is different from that in the SPL and the SCM. Due to the multifunctional nature of the TD, it may be the recipient of two descending neural commands. These commands may each be of a different oscillatory frequency originating from different central oscillators.</description>

   <description>Liberal-democratic theories of knowledge work suggest that labour and capital are no longer at odds in the information society.  This dissertation critiques such a position, proposing that knowledge worker professions, or ones it describes as involving forms of immaterial labour, are subject to new regimes of exploitation and emergent modes of resistance within post-Fordism.  The study begins by surveying competing theoretical perspectives on knowledge work, and moves on to consider the ethical questions, epistemological foundations, and methodological choices involved in carrying out engaged inquiries into collective organization by immaterial labourers.  The dissertation’s empirical contribution is comprised of three case studies of labour organization by knowledge workers.  The first is the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, an “open-source” union formed in 1998 by contract workers at Microsoft.  The second is the Aliant clerical/call-centre workers in Moncton, New Brunswick, who certified a bargaining unit through the Communication, Energy and Paperworkers Union in 2001.  The third is the Collettivo PrecariAtesia, a self-organized group of Roman workers formed at Atesia, Europe’s largest call centre, in 2004.  Drawing on these and other contemporary examples, the dissertation suggests that, in its most promising articulations, the organization of immaterial labour is occurring at the intersection of spontaneous struggles by workers and a process of union renewal underway within certain sectors of the established labour movement.  These cases also point to the potential of collective organizing occurring around precarity, or the increasing financial and existential insecurity arising from the flexibilization of labour.  Both of these processes, the dissertation concludes, involve a process of adaptation to post-Fordism, in which new forms of organization, new subjectivities, and new social demands are being produced.</description>
