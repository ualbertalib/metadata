   <description>In response to sulphur dioxide emission reductions in North America and Europe, there has been a recent shift in research focus towards understanding ecosystem recovery.  Evidence for reversibility in the effects of acidification on lake ecosystems within North America has been, for the most part, constrained to a single locality (Sudbury, Ontario).  Lakes in a fume-kill area near Wawa, Ontario, present a new and rare opportunity for studying potentially rapid chemical and biological recovery patterns from extreme acidification.  Several lakes acidified (pH ~3) during a period of local iron sintering from 1939 to 1998, and although minimal historical data are available, striking biological recovery has recently been observed.&#xd;
	This study used paleolimnological techniques to track diatom (class Bacillariophyceae) responses to historical water quality changes in five fume-kill lakes near Wawa.  Prior to the onset of iron sintering, the sediment-recorded diatom assemblages were dominated by species that are typically found in circumneutral or slightly alkaline lakes.  Following the known occurrence of lake acidification, there was a striking shift in the sediment record towards dominance by acid- and metal-tolerant species.  Water quality of the fume-kill lakes has since improved (i.e. pH has increased from ~3 to ~7 and metal concentrations have decreased).  In four of the five lake cores, this was reflected by a decrease in the relative abundance of acid-tolerant species.  Surprisingly, diatom communities were not progressing towards pre-disturbance species assemblages.  Factors impeding the return of native species might include metal enrichment in surface sediment and potentially altered lake thermal regimes.  &#xd;
	Documenting and understanding recovery trajectories is necessary to help lake managers evaluate policy decisions regarding the efficacy of emission reduction programs and mitigation measures.  This thesis provides evidence from one location in addition to Sudbury that the ecological effects of severe lake acidification can be reversed if SO2 emissions are sufficiently reduced.  It also further demonstrates the complexity of recovery patterns in acidified and metal-contaminated lakes.</description>

   <description>This research evaluated the use of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) as a potential barrier material to the migration of metals that are leached from mine waste. This thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, micro analytical methods including µXRD with synchrotron-generated µXRF elemental mapping and synchrotron-based µXRD (S-µXRD) were used to characterize the GCL bentonite and distinguish how mechanisms of metal attenuation could be identified. These analytical methods were of particular use for the clay material as they offer non-destructive, in situ investigation of various soil characteristics with microspatial resolution. The combination of the analytical methods allowed for identification of minerals such as gypsum and pyrite, not accessible by conventional methods. In particular, distinguishing accessory crystalline phases present in the “starting material” bentonite from those formed as a result of interaction with metal-bearing leachates is critical, as the development of metal-attenuating crystalline phases can have a significant long-term impact on metal mobility. &#xd;
In the second part of the thesis, the migration behaviour of metals (As, Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sr, and Zn) was investigated by means of diffusion tests and permeation experiments using four metal-containing waters: acidic rock drainage (ARD), lime-treated ARD, water from gold mine tailings, and landfill leachate with metal loading. Effective diffusion coefficients of the metals were calculated by modelling laboratory diffusion and sorption data. Water pre-hydrated GCLs were permeated with 15-21 pore volumes (PVs) of solution and their interaction with these solutions was examined in terms of both the hydraulic conductivity and the change in the geochemical characteristics of the permeant over time. The greatest increase in hydraulic conductivity occurred for the acidic rock drainage, where it increased from 1.6x10-11 m/s to 1.3x10-10 m/s following 21 PVs of permeation; still a very low value when compared to regulatory standards for clay barrier materials. Observed delayed breakthrough curves were indicative of the GCL’s strong attenuation capacity for a number of metals. An understanding of mechanisms of metal retention at both the micro and macro-scale levels will facilitate effective pollution prevention using GCLs.</description>

   <description>Recent advances in wireless and sensing technologies have enabled the deployment of large scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) which have a wide range of scientific and commercial applications. However, due to the limited energy supply of sensor nodes, extending the network lifetime has become crucial for WSNs to deliver their promised benefits. Several proposals have aimed at this objective by designing energy efficient protocols at the physical, medium access, and network layers. While the proposed protocols achieve significant energy savings for individual sensor nodes, they fail to solve topology-related problems. An example of such problems is the bottlenecks around the sink, which is a direct result of multi-hop relaying: sensor nodes around the sink relay data generated all over the network which makes them deplete their energy much faster than other nodes. &#xd;
&#xd;
A natural solution to this problem is to have multiple mobile data collectors so that the load is distributed evenly among all nodes. We investigate this promising direction for balancing the load and, hence, prolonging the lifetime of the network. We design optimization schemes for routing and placement of mobile data collectors in WSNs. We show, by theoretical analysis and simulations, that our approach has the potential to prolong the lifetime of the network significantly.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2009-04-27 11:29:04.43</description>
   <description>During the past four decades researchers note that educational institutions fail to “connect” with minority students (e.g. Clark, 1983; Coelho, 1998; Dei, 1994; Duffy, 2003; Ogbu, 1978, 1991). Carr and Klassen (1996) define this lack of “connection” primarily as teachers’ disregard for each student’s culture as it relates to race, and thus, his or her achievement potential. Hence, this disregard encourages minority students to question their ability to be successful. Dei (1994), furthermore, shows a tremendous disconnectedness from schools and education systems being felt by Black students. Few studies give voice to specific groups of Black female high school graduates who opt out of pursuing higher education.&#xd;
 I interviewed four Black Guyanese immigrant women to: (a) investigate their reasons and expectations when immigrating to Canada, (b) identify what influenced their decision not to pursue postsecondary education, (c) explore their definitions of success, and (d) investigate how/if their notions of success relate to obtaining postsecondary education in Canada.&#xd;
Critical Race Theory (CRT) was employed in this study to: (a) provide a better understanding of the participants’ classroom dynamics governed by relationships with their teachers, guidance counsellors and school administrators, (b) examine educational outcomes governed by personal and educational relationships and experiences, and (c) provide conceptual tools in the investigation of colour-blindness (Parker &amp; Roberts, 2005) that is disguised in Canadian education, immigration, and other government policies. To support my investigation, I used CRT to guide the research design, modes of documentation, and the process of analysis. &#xd;
It is hoped that my findings and analysis enriches the academy and society by communicating why there is a scarcity of Black Guyanese immigrant women in Canadian postsecondary institutions, making recommendations, to increase their participation in higher education. This study communicates the experiences of four Black Guyanese immigrant women in Canada. It does not intend to make generalizations about the experiences of all Black Guyanese immigrant women in Canada.</description>

   <description>Phytoremediation technologies offer an economical and practical alternative to traditional remediation technologies.  This study attempted to quantify and compare the ability of DN34 and NM1 varieties of hybrid poplars to phytovolatilize the organic contaminant 1,4-dioxane.  Research included laboratory experiments and those at an old industrial field site containing 1,4-dioxane and other organic contaminants.  Under laboratory conditions it was found that when DN34 was exposed to 36 ppm of 1,4-dioxane in hydroponic solution it had a significantly higher transpiration rate than NM1.  There were no toxic effects of the contaminant on the plants.  Additionally, the DN34 variety was able to remove 48.7 ± 11.6 % (mean ± standard error) of the dioxane from aqueous solution compared to 41.7 ± 10.0 % removed by NM1.  Water availability at the field site had a significant effect on growth rate whereas soil type and contaminant concentration did not appear to have any affect.  It was apparent that DN34 had a significantly higher transpiration rates than NM1 in a dry, 2007 season, while the opposite was true during a wet, 2008 season.  Interestingly, the DN34 variety had lower transpiration rates in the wet season than in the dry season.  The presence of the co-contaminant ethylene glycol affected transpiration rate in the NM1 variety but not the DN34 variety.  The NM1 variety had a decrease in transpiration rate of 42 and 30 % when growing in a mid-range concentration (≤ 1000 ppm) of ethylene glycol compared to a low concentration (≤ 100 ppm) of ethylene glycol in the wet and dry seasons, respectively.    Unfortunately, detection of 1,4-dioxane removal by trees at the field site was difficult to achieve.</description>

   <description>This thesis offers a defence of realism in mathematics, principally through an a priori re-construal of the indispensability argument as revelatory of the commitments of mathematical thought. Following the articulation and defence of that argument—called the ‘argument from constraint’—in the first chapter, I address semantic and metaphysical consequences and objections in turn. The second chapter broaches the value of Fregean semantics for arithmetical language, and the indispensability of semantic considerations in accounting for mathematical thought. The third chapter assesses and responds to objections from the fictionalist account of mathematical thought and meaning, and the final chapter articulates a programmatic proposal for mathematical epistemology.</description>

   <description>Purpose&#xd;
 The purpose of this study is to examine weight and lifestyle among persons with schizophrenia from their perspectives. Two specific research questions are addressed:&#xd;
1:  What are the perceptions of persons with schizophrenia related to their weight?&#xd;
2:  What are the experiences of persons with schizophrenia in maintaining a healthy lifestyle?&#xd;
Methods&#xd;
A qualitative, constructivist research design is used to guide the study. Unstructured interviews are the method of data collection and analysis is done using constant comparison.&#xd;
A purposive sample of 18 participants was obtained from an Outpatient Psychiatric Unit. &#xd;
Findings&#xd;
Three themes, Normal Life Thrown a Curve Ball, Weight Management as Complex, and Today’s Experiences Shape Tomorrow’s Outcomes, were identified by the participants. Weight management was seen as a complex and difficult phenomenon; however, participants were optimistic about their ability to achieve a healthy weight in the future. Individual strategies, support and education were identified as essential weight management components.&#xd;
Conclusions&#xd;
The perceptions identified in this study further our understanding of the complexity of weight management, and can be used to design future weight loss interventions better tailored to this population.</description>

   <description>Background: New genomic tests are being developed to predict an individual’s risk of cancer recurrence by analyzing the expression of multiple genes. However, it is unclear how to report the test results so that they would be most useful to clinicians. A mail-out questionnaire has the potential to help a) describe physicians’ attitudes towards the clinical use of new genomic tests, b) determine what information physicians prefer to have included in the test reports, and c) explore how physicians think the test results would impact their treatment recommendations.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: To design such a questionnaire that could be used in the eventual large-scale survey, and to ensure that the questionnaire a) is comprehensible, b) has face validity, c) appears interesting to, and d) does not place undue response burden on, the target population.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: The first draft, based on a specific genomic test for breast cancer recurrence (Oncotype DX) and on two case scenarios, was created. Cognitive interviews with practicing oncologists were conducted to identify problems in the questionnaire. The evaluation involved face-to-face interviews with Kingston oncologists who treat breast cancer, followed by telephone interviews with medical oncologists who treat breast cancer in other places in Ontario. Three-to-four oncologists were included in each round of interviewing after which the questionnaire was revised based on that round’s recommendations. Additional rounds of interviews were conducted until no new problems/issues were raised in one entire round.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: A medium-length questionnaire was drafted. Four rounds of interviews were conducted with no new problems/issues being raised in the fourth round. Most of the problems identified in the questionnaire related to comprehensibility, followed by logical issues which detected fundamental problems in the questionnaire design. There was no evidence of fatigue or disinterest in participants and they deemed the response burden reasonable.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: The results suggest that the proposed questionnaire is comprehensible and has face validity. Additionally, it appears to be an interesting questionnaire to, and would not place undue burden on, the target population. Thus, the questionnaire is now ready for the field administration.</description>

   <description>The study of long-term climatic change in the Arctic, a region both particularly sensitive to the effects of a warming climate and an important driver of global climate, is pertinent to understanding the rates and magnitude of current ecosystem changes.  Analyses on geological time frames provide insight into the variability of Arctic climate, allowing a contextualized understanding of recent ecosystem changes that have been documented across the Arctic.  Lake CF8, a mid-Arctic lake on Clyde Foreland, Baffin Island, contains a unique sedimentary archive of the present and last two interglacial periods, due to past non-erosive glaciation patterns, providing an opportunity to study interglacial climate trends.  Diatom assemblages were analyzed through the organic sediment record of the past three interglacials.  Trends in the ontogeny of this lake were revealed: the early, post-glacial environment was dominated by species of the colonial Fragilaria genera, which transitioned into high relative abundances of tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species.  Benthic/periphytic taxa, such as Psammothidium marginulatum, tended to increase in relative abundance in the mid- to late-interglacial periods.  The ecological interpretation of this pattern is examined in this study, and suggests that climate drives the succession of the diatom community primarily through indirect effects on lake ice and pH.  The extent of ice cover likely plays a large role in the biotic community of this lake; the diatom assemblages within the past ~ 50 years indicate increasing littoral habitat complexity with a peak in Eunotia species and a slightly acidic pH, which is discussed in relation to changing habitat availability associated with decreasing ice cover.  In-lake production was examined through the use of spectrally-inferred chlorophyll a trends, which also indicate elevated production in the past ~ 50 years.  As climate change becomes an increasingly significant threat to the stability of Arctic ecosystems, interest in paleoclimate records that extend into past, non-anthropogenically mediated warm periods, is increasing.  This sediment record extends our understanding of past environmental trends beyond the longest records in this part of the Arctic, the Greenland ice core records, and enhances our understanding of the variability of Arctic climate.</description>

   <description>The Barry gold deposit is an example of an Archean greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit located in the Urban-Barry greenstone belt in the Abitibi subprovince of Québec, Canada. Auriferous zones are spatially associated with NE-trending ductile shear zones with moderate south-easterly dip. Gold mineralization occurs within albite-carbonate-quartz veins that are straight N64ºE/64ºSE and folded N20ºE/60ºSE and within the surrounding carbonate-quartz-pyrite and locally biotite-carbonate alteration zones of the host mafic volcanic rocks. The deposit has gold resources indicated at 52,300 oz (385,000 mt at 4.23 g/t Au) and inferred at 126,600 oz (966,000 mt at 4.07 g/t Au). &#xd;
&#xd;
The host mafic volcanic rocks are part of the 2717 Ma Macho Formation that exhibit a geochemical signature transitional between mid-ocean and island arc. They are cut by pre-ore diorite, pre- and post-ore quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP), and quartz monzonite dikes and plugs interpreted to have formed in a volcanic arc to syn-collisional setting.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The auriferous veins comprise 5-15% volume of the mafic volcanic rocks, are 1-5cm wide, and locally pinch and swell or are boudinaged. Although the volcanic units strike N55-60ºE and dip 40ºSE, the ore envelope (>2 g/t Au) is constrained from surface to 30m depth in an antiformal shape. Free gold is found in albite-carbonate-quartz veins, syn-mineralization altered host rocks, and locally within quartz veins cutting early QFP dikes. &#xd;
The timing of gold mineralization at the Barry deposit is well constrained by U-Pb zircon dating of pre-mineralization diorite and post-mineralization QFP dikes. Analyses of single zircon grains by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) give concordant and overlapping data with indistinguishable ages, yielding an average age of 2697 ± 0.6 Ma that is interpreted as the age of gold mineralization at the Barry deposit. This date indicates that gold mineralization was coeval with regional deformation and magmatism, and is, to our knowledge, the most precise age yet established for Archean lode gold mineralization. This confirms that the Barry lode gold deposit formed during an earlier, pre-2686, deformational period in the late Archean, similar to what was documented in the Kiena, Norlartic and Siscoe (Main Zone) mines in the Southern Abitibi greenstone belt.</description>

   <title>The Other Cold War: Canadian Military Assistance in the Developing World</title>

   <description>This thesis explains how Canada, and the Canadian Forces, became involved with the delivery of military assistance to the developing world from the post-war period until the election of Pierre Trudeau as prime minister in 1968.   Military assistance, in effect the provision of equipment, advice or training to the armed forces of a recipient country, was an area in which Canada and the Canadian Forces became significantly, if somewhat haphazardly involved with, after 1945.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis argues that the number of military personnel deployed overseas for military assistance purposes was very small compared to Canada’s North Atlantic Treaty Organization and United Nations contributions.  Nevertheless, those Canadians involved in training and advising foreign militaries were highly trained senior officers and non-commissioned officers who provided invaluable advice and assistance.  Furthermore, and as requests from the developing world for military assistance increased, Ottawa had little choice but to create the Interdepartmental Military Assistance Committee in 1964 in an effort to coordinate Canada’s previously ad hoc military assistance efforts.  Lastly, while Prime Minister Diefenbaker and his successor, Lester Pearson, were willing to offer military assistance to Commonwealth countries in the post-colonial period, Prime Minister Trudeau was not.  Believing that any sort of military assistance was ill-advised, he would ultimately work towards ending all Canadian efforts in this regard soon after his election in 1968. &#xd;
 &#xd;
The thesis concludes that Canada became engaged in the business of military assistance on an ad hoc basis.  There was no master plan to offer military assistance to foreign countries as a means to boost domestic armaments production, spur on wider development activities in the receiving countries or to gain greater international political influence for Canada. Furthermore, when the Canadian government began sending military advisors around the globe in the 1960s, the need to check communist influence often determined which countries received Canadian military help.  Finally, Trudeau’s decision to end Canada’s military assistance efforts was a sound one given the domestic and international political situation at the time.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, a new method is proposed for monitoring the use of backrest and forearm support during computer work on a standard workstation and the same workstation with a Butterfly board attachment. The developed techniques measure the effect of using the Butterfly board on the resting duration and the pressure on the back and forearms while resting. Novel™ pressure sensor mats were used to measure pressure applied by resting against the chair back rest and the arm rests. To ensure that the back mat is not moving, a new technique of mapping the back points of contact with the backrest is used. A video camera, synchronized with the pressure measurement system, is used to identify the location where the forearms were resting (work surface or chair arm rests).</description>

   <description>Erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease share etiologies, and commonly&#xd;
coexist. One unifying concept is that the arterial insufficiency in hypertension is also the&#xd;
primary basis for blunted sexual responses. The objective of these studies was to&#xd;
characterize the age-related changes in the structure and function of the pudendal artery&#xd;
(the main resistance vessel) in young and old normotensive and hypertensive animals in&#xd;
relation to erectile function. In addition, we assessed the impact of antihypertensive&#xd;
treatments and lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and/or caloric restriction, on&#xd;
erectile responses and the structure and function of the pudendal artery.&#xd;
In 30 week old hypertensive rats or following re-challenges at 50 and 70 weeks,&#xd;
antihypertensive treatment (enalapril or hydralazine) did not prevent the age-related&#xd;
decline in erectile function. Experiments involving cross-over kidney transplantations&#xd;
between treated and untreated young hypertensive rats revealed that changes in penile&#xd;
vasculature and not the level of arterial pressure were important for normalizing erectile&#xd;
responses. In addition, intervention with exercise and caloric restriction showed that&#xd;
these treatments substantially improved erectile responses in normotensive and&#xd;
hypertensive rats.&#xd;
The pudendal artery in young normotensive rats was found to have a thick medial&#xd;
layer but a relatively small lumen. With age, the pudendal lumen didn’t change, but all&#xd;
components of the medial layer were markedly increased. Of interest, the smooth muscle&#xd;
cells within the pudendal medial layer became more disorganized with aging, although&#xd;
iii&#xd;
contractions were similar. In contrast, endothelium-dependent relaxation decreased with&#xd;
age.&#xd;
Young hypertensive rats also had an increased wall thickness, but not lumen&#xd;
diameter or extracellular matrix. Antihypertensive therapy significantly decreased the&#xd;
pudendal wall thickness. In aging hypertensive rats, the pudendal artery walls were even&#xd;
thicker, lumen decreased and extracellular matrix greatly enhanced compared to younger&#xd;
rats. In addition, there were numerous regions of intimal thickening associated with&#xd;
marked disruptions of the internal elastic lamina. Moreover, pudendal smooth muscle&#xd;
cells bordering the intima and in the neointima were round in shape, and electron&#xd;
microscopy confirmed their synthetic state.&#xd;
Taken together, these findings provide key evidence of the importance of the&#xd;
structure and function of the pudendal artery in facilitating erectile responses.</description>

   <description>A demand for methods that can be used in the numerical analysis of three dimensional air flow in large buildings has developed as more buildings are being designed with large atriums using a solar loading that leads to complex flow.  The flow in such buildings is almost always turbulent which means that turbulence models that are accurate but which do not require undue computer resources have to be selected.  As a result, a numerical study of natural convective heat transfer and turbulent flows in large atria, specifically part of the Atria in the EV building at Concordia University, has been completed.  Experimental work on turbulence modeling and atria design has been studied and compared with the numerical results obtained here to gain confidence in the modeling techniques used in the study.  The flow has been assumed to be steady, and the Boussinesq approximation has been used. The governing equations have been numerically solved using the CFD solver FLUENT.  &#xd;
	The three-dimensional air flow in the Concordia-like atria used the following parameters: forced flow vent inlet angle; forced flow vent velocity; date and time (for solar radiation purposes).  The case with adiabatic floor and ceiling conditions was examined and compared to the case with isothermal floor and ceiling conditions.  Several models were studied to compare the effect of turbulent modeling in the atria, including the following: (1) K-Epsilon; (2) K-Omega; (3) Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) model; (4) Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model.  Further study was completed after it was noted the flow was completely based on natural convection when the velocity of the inlet flow was set to zero.  &#xd;
	In addition, experimental results were available and this situation was modeled using similar parameters to the work explained above.  Comparing these results supported the accuracy of the work done on the Concordia Atrium.  Experimental work on the Annex 26 Atrium in Yokohama Japan was also compared to numerical results to gain confidence in techniques used in the present study and results were obtained that were in good agreement.</description>

   <description>Massive declines in the latter half of the 20th century left black rhinoceros populations perilously close to extinction with only approximately 3600 individuals remaining, in contrast to estimated census numbers of over 100,000 individuals in 1900. While Diceros bicornis bicornis is the second most abundant subspecies of black rhino, behind D. b. minor, relatively few genetic studies have focused on this taxon. I used polymorphic DNA microsatellite markers to describe population structure in this subspecies. Using these genetic markers, the goals of this study were: i) to characterize the genetic variability of D.b. bicornis individuals (n = 170) found in Etosha National Park, Namibia, using seven DNA microsatellite markers, ii) to determine if there is population structure within Etosha National Park, using both traditional Wright’s F-statistics and a Bayesian model that requires no a priori population assignment, iii) to determine relatedness amongst founding and newly introduced black rhinoceroses held in private game farms throughout Namibia, using moment estimators of relatedness; and iv) to determine parentage of game farm rhinos with partial or no pedigree data available, using likelihood-based methods. I found that: i) the levels of genetic diversity in D.b. bicornis from Etosha National Park are consistent with previously published studies using microsatellite markers, and are relatively high; ii) the population structure within Etosha National Park is ambiguous using traditional F-statistics, but can be subdivided into three diagnosable clusters (western, central and eastern) using a Bayesian approach; iii) a relatively high degree of relatedness exists among founding members of game farm rhinos; and iv) assignments of parentage had greater success when there were fewer candidate parents and support the notion that black rhinoceroses are polygynous.</description>

   <description>Mathematical modelling was utilized to evaluate trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone remediation in the subsurface environment.  Semi-analytical solutions were derived, tested, and employed to evaluate the benefits of source zone concentration reduction and solute degradation mechanisms on the evolution of plumes in porous media and fractured rock domains.  Simulations of treatment in complex DNAPL source zones using different remedial technologies were completed with a numerical model that was developed, tested, calibrated, and applied to nine idealized heterogeneous porous media sites.&#xd;
     Analytical modelling revealed that, in domains dominated by matrix diffusion, aggressive and moderate source zone concentration reduction may have similar effects on the leading edge of the plume.  The tailing (near source) edge of the plume may be more responsive to aggressive concentration reduction, particularly when diffusion processes are negligible.  Both the near-field (near-source) and far-field plume responses were strongly influenced by the matrix decay half-life for both transient and steady-state conditions.  The degradative capacity of the matrix largely dictated plume extent and life-span for the fractured bedrock site considered here.  &#xd;
     Numerical simulations of in situ source zone treatment with chemical oxidation (ISCO), enhanced bioremediation (ISEB), and surfactants (SEAR) were compared and contrasted.  Treatment efficacy was site specific, with benefits observed at some sites, and detrimental impacts observed at others.  Each technology demonstrated some degree of performance enhancement relative to dissolution only (no treatment).  The maximum DNAPL mass depletion enhancement factors for ISCO, ISEB and SEAR, were 1.44, 2.91, and 2.70 after 10 years, respectively.  Similarly, the maximum boundary mass flux enhancement factors for ISCO, ISEB and SEAR were 9.78, 3.32, and 3.97, respectively.  While notable enhancements were observed for many sites during active treatment, the long-term performance of pre-maturely terminated ISCO and ISEB, and to a lesser degree SEAR, was similar to dissolution.  Overall, the partial depletion of DNAPL mass from source zones produced on-going persistent boundary mass flux signatures.  Only the complete removal of DNAPL mass, which was attained for one site with SEAR, successfully eliminated downgradient boundary mass flux.</description>

   <description>While the Shakers are associated in North American with simplicity and communalism, an examination of Shaker history reveals a dynamic and complex society. Shaker life was structured by a powerful metanarrative: the Shakers were the ‘Chosen People of God,’ who lived in ‘His Promised Land.’ This narrative, which is profoundly geographical due to its intertwining of people with place, was not static in its interpretation. Nevertheless, it served as the basis for the discourses concerning the most appropriate means to live in the World, but not be of it. Few geographers have examined religiosity and spirituality systematically. This research highlights the interaction between religiosity, identity, place, and narrative as an essential element of the  human condition. Religiosity is expressed through narratives and rituals and buttresses a sense of identity and belonging in place. Particular expressions of the Shaker covenantal narrative were shaped by the places in which the Shakers existed. This work examines the Shaker experience at New Lebanon Shaker Village (New York) focusing on the antebellum period. It examines the context in which the Shakers existed, the shifts in the interpretations of the Shaker covenantal narratives, and the means by which the Shaker leadership disseminated their ideas.</description>

   <description>The criminalization of women is an area of study that has intrigued many researchers.  Using critical race theory, multiracial feminist theory, and radical feminist theory, this research attempts to explain this phenomenon.  Through the use of personal interviews with women who are currently reintegrating back into society after being incarcerated, I attempt to uncover the factors which influence female criminality, and analyze the experiences women encounter when confronted by the Canadian criminal justice system.  A key hypothesis that fuels this study is that discriminatory practices exist within the Canadian criminal justice system which negatively impact women of colour and Aboriginal women.  I argue that the criminalization of women of colour and Aboriginal women occurs as a result of failing to take into consideration the intersectionality of race, class and gender in women who commit criminal acts.  This phenomenon occurs due to patriarchal and classist biases that seek to maintain current power structures and relationships by continually oppressing those who do not fit within their group.  The findings that emerged from the interviews support my hypothesis and confirm that changes within the criminal justice system are imperative in order to ensure women are treated fairly.</description>

   <description>Racialized female faculty frequently experience discrimination in the academy.  However, few scholars have attempted to understand such experiences.  This study helps to fill this void by exploring the experiences of racialized female faculty within the university.  More specifically, in this study, I interviewed racialized female faculty from Queen's University and asked them to discuss their experiences with discrimination on campus.  I was interested in conducting this study at Queen's due to The Henry Report (2004) which examined the experiences of racialized faculty at Queen's and found that the university suffers from a 'culture of whiteness'.  Moreover, I also wished to conduct this study at Queen's with racialized female faculty specifically because of the difficulties the university has in retaining these women, due to their experiences with racism on campus.  From the interviews, I was able to conclude that racialized female faculty experience both racial and sexual discrimination at Queen's.  Moreover, I was also able to conlude that this university still suffers from a 'culture of whiteness' and racism, and needs to make greater efforts to confront these issues or continue to have difficulties retaining racialized female faculty.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2009-05-28 11:40:32.574</description>
   <description>The purpose of this thesis was to examine coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors and secondary complications in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In particular, this thesis was organized around the central theme of adiposity, which is a prevalent complication following SCI.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Study 1 focused on understanding the relationships between activities of daily living (ADL) and CHD risk factors including central adiposity, lipoproteins, and triglycerides. Using generalized linear models, while controlling for pertinent covariates such as sex, age, and leisure time physical activity (LTPA), it was found that Mobility ADL (wheeling and transferring) were negatively associated with total and LDL-cholesterol.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Study 2 examined whether individuals who considered themselves to be overweight subsequently had less favourable subjective well-being, and were more likely to report specific secondary complications than individuals who did not consider themselves to be overweight. Logistic regression analysis and partial correlations controlling for pertinent covariates such as sex, age, and injury severity, revealed that individuals who considered themselves to be overweight reported greater pain, depression, overuse injuries, and fatigue, and less satisfaction with life than individuals who did not consider themselves to be overweight. &#xd;
&#xd;
In summary, the findings suggest that a) participation in specific types of ADL (i.e. Mobility ADL) are associated with a lower CHD risk and should be further explored and that b) elevated perceived adiposity is associated with specific secondary complications and lower subjective well-being. Overall thesis findings support the overwhelming evidence of the benefits of daily physical activity and maintaining a healthy bodyweight in the SCI population.</description>

   <description>Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are solid state polymer devices operating through the formation of a light-emitting p-n&#xd;
junction by in situ electrochemical doping. The LEC film contains a luminescent polymer and a polymer electrolyte. A sufficiently high voltage bias initiates the electrochemical p-doping reaction at the anode interface and n-doping reaction at&#xd;
the cathode interface. With time the doped regions expand in volume until they make contact to form a light-emitting p-n junction.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, I present my original research on both the light-emitting and photovoltaic properties of LECs. I discovered&#xd;
that continued doping after p- and n-doped regions have made first contact accounts for most of LEC turn-on time. I showed that because the electronic charges must be injected from an external circuit for&#xd;
the electrochemical doping to occur, the LEC turn-on response is limited to no faster than milliseconds. I also demonstrated that the lifetime of LECs can be affected by various factors such as stress temperature, stress current, substrate thermal conductivity, and luminescent polymer end group. With the right combination of&#xd;
substrates and materials, LECs exhibit a remarkable half lifetime on the order of hundreds of hours when stressed at a current density of 1A/cm2. I also observed that an as-formed p-n junction can even relax into a p-i-n junction upon the removal of applied voltage bias. A p-i-n junction LEC exhibits more efficient electroluminescence due to less photoluminescence quenching in the&#xd;
quasi-intrinsic emission zone. Frozen p-i-n junction LECs also exhibit a much improved photovoltaic response. By carefully&#xd;
controlling the relaxation (dedoping) temperature and duration, I have demonstrated p-i-n junction photovoltaic cells with record-high open-circuit voltage of 2.25V and short-circuit current density in&#xd;
excess of 10mA/cm2 under simulated sunlight of ~300mW/cm2. By optimizing film thickness and electrolyte content, I have achieved a thirty-fold increase in power conversion efficiency of p-i-n junction photovoltaic cells. My results demonstrate that a&#xd;
polymer homojunction such a p-n or a p-i-n junction is a promising device concept that has potential application in high performance&#xd;
polymer-based photonic devices.</description>

   <description>We first study noninteracting electrons moving on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices, which represent the conduction path of LiAlyTi2−yO4. A uniform box distribution type of disorder for the on-site energies is assumed. Using the Dyson-Mehta Delta-3 statistics as a criterion for localization, we have determined the critical disorder (Wc/t = 14.5 ± 0.25) and the mobility-edge trajectories.&#xd;
&#xd;
Then we study the Anderson-Hubbard model, which includes both interactions and disorder, using a real-space self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory. We provide a partial assessment on how the Hartree-Fock theory approximates the ground states of the Anderson-Hubbard model, using small clusters which can be solved exactly. The Hartree-Fock theory works very well in reproducing the ground-state energies and local charge densities. However, it does not work as well in representing the spin-spin correlations. To find the ground state, one needs to allow maximum degree of freedom in spins. Evidence of screening of disorder by the interactions is provided.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have applied the Hartree-Fock theory to large-scale three-dimensional simple cubic lattices. For a disorder strength of W/t = 6, weak interactions (U/t ≤ 3) enhance the density of states at the Fermi level and the low-frequency conductivity. There are no local magnetic moments, and the AC conductivity is Drude-like. With stronger interactions (U/t ≥ 4), the density of states at the Fermi level and the low-frequency conductivity are both suppressed. These are accompanied by the presence of local magnetic moments, and the conductivity becomes non-Drude-like. A metal-to-insulator transition is likely to take place at a critical Uc/t ≈ 8 – 9. We find that (i) the formation of magnetic moments is essential to the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore essential to the metal-insulator transition; (ii) the form of magnetic moments does not matter; and (iii) these results do not depend on the type of lattice or the type of disorder.</description>

   <description>Starting with the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam and framed by Critical Theory, this paper investigates business faculty perspectives of social justice in Israel and Canada. Eight purposefully-selected participants were interviewed. Their narratives form the basis of this qualitative study. The research participants revealed that there were ideological and structural forces present in the business programmes investigated that appeared to prevent social justice motives from being realized in the culture of business schools. The participants suggested that the hegemonic forces driving business programs were: profit-driven business ideologies, the particular character of MBA programs, and business programs’ quantitative research bias. These forces were found to be affecting the way in which the participants made-meaning of social justice, and the way in which they could teach and research within their respective business schools.&#xd;
The results of this study illuminate the types of cultural and asymmetrical relations that are affecting business pedagogical constructs and the future for social justice within them. This is important as how university faculty make meaning of social justice within business paradigms will not only shape how curricula and ideological changes evolve in business schools, they will have a significant impact on how and what students learn (Fernandez &amp; Stiehl, 1995). The paper concludes with recommendations for Critical Communication and Critical Management Education to be employed within business schools as a process-oriented approach to social justice based on critical dialogue and communication: thus pursuing a Tikkun Olam in business pedagogy.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, French) -- Queen's University, 2009-05-26 16:29:41.609</description>
   <description>Jacques Ferron (1921-1985), one of the most influential Québécois writers of the 20th century, declared near the end of his life that he wrote his books not for the world but for an “unfinished country” like him, a country that would have liked to become sovereign, just as he would have liked to have become a truly accomplished writer. The author’s individual search for identity is thus inextricable from that of the Québécois nation. Strangely enough, however, Ferron’s polyvalent and prolific oeuvre abounds with references, both textual and paratextual, to English Canada, the English language, and literature in English. &#xd;
	This thesis shows how this English Canadian intertextuality in Ferron’s work plays an essential role in his representation of the search for the Québécois identity, both personal and collective. The different manifestations of this intertextuality as they appear in a representative sampling of texts published during the author’s most productive period (1960 to1970) are therefore analyzed with a view to assessing their role in the production of meaning. &#xd;
Given the strong autobiographical imprint of Ferron’s work, Chapter 2 examines the author’s formative encounters with English and English Canada. Chapters 3 and 4 then study the implications of his first two English Canadian dedicatees, Scott Symons (La tête du roi, 1963) and Peter Dwyer (Le salut de l’Irlande, 1970), exposing the complex relationship between these English Canadians and the works in which they appear. The bulk of the thesis, however, is devoted to the “Scot cycle”, a series of three novels (La nuit, La charrette, et Le ciel de Québec) that feature a protagonist whose model is the well-known English Canadian jurist and poet, Frank R. Scott.  After reviewing in Chapter 5 Ferron’s personal relationship with Scott and his representation in various polemical articles, Chapter 6 analyses the complexity and importance of the English Canadian literary code in La nuit. A study of the metamorphoses of the character inspired by Frank Scott throughout the “Scot cycle” (Chapters 7 through 9) further illustrates the extent to which the English Canadian is a necessary element for the depiction of the Québécois.</description>

   <description>The first decade of this century marked a moment of hypervisibility for lesbians and bisexual women on British television.  During this time, however, lesbian hypervisibility was coded repeatedly as hyperfemininity.  When the BBC and ITV adapted Sarah Waters’s novels for television, how, I ask, did the screen versions balance the demands of pop visual culture with the novels’ complex, unconventional – and in some cases subversive – representations of lesbianism?  I pursue this question with an interdisciplinary methodology drawn from queer and feminist theories, cultural and media studies, and film adaptation theory.  Chapter Two looks back to Jeanette Winterson’s Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (BBC 1990).  I examine this text – the first BBC television serial to feature a lesbian protagonist – to establish a vocabulary for discussing the page-to-screen adaptation of queer identities throughout this dissertation.  Chapter Three investigates Waters’s first novel Tipping the Velvet (1998) and its complex intertextual relationship with Andrew Davies’s serialized version (BBC 2002).  I also examine responses to the serial in the British press, tracing the ways in which dominant cultural forces seek to domesticate non-normative instances of gender and sexuality.  Chapter Four examines Waters’s novel Fingersmith (2002) in relation to Peter Ransley’s adaptation (BBC 2005) to situate adaptations of Waters’s retro-Victorian texts amid the genre of television and film adaptations of Jane Austen novels.  I argue that Ransley’s serial interrogates the notion of Austen as a “conservative icon” (Cartmell 24) and queers the Austen adaptation genre itself.  To conclude this study I address Davies’s television film (ITV 2008) of Waters’s second novel Affinity (1999).  In this chapter I examine how the adaptation depicts the disruptive lesbian at the centre of the text.  I argue in particular that by casting an actress who does not conform to dominant televisual norms of femininity, the adaptation is able to create a powerful audiovisual transgendered moment which adds to the novel’s destabilization of Victorian hierarchies of gender and class.  This chapter considers, finally, how Tipping the Velvet, Fingersmith and Affinity have contributed to lesbian visibility on British television.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I examine the factors associated with analysts’ voluntary practice of issuing cash flow forecasts and earnings forecasts on the same day. I draw on Hughes and Pae’s (2004) management partial disclosure equilibrium and predict how an analyst decides to issue a cash flow forecast revision along with and according to her bad news and good news earnings forecast revision. In particular, I predict that analysts strategically choose to supplement earnings forecasts with positive cash flow news when they deliver bad news earnings forecasts. Consistent with my prediction, I find that analysts are more likely to issue cash flow forecast revisions in the opposite direction to their earnings forecast revisions when they issue downward earnings forecast revisions than when they issue upward earnings forecast revisions. The results suggest that analysts may not make their decisions to issue cash flow forecasts as objectively as they ought to do in their role as independent information intermediaries. Rather, analyst decisions to issue cash flow forecasts are akin to managers’ strategic decisions to voluntarily disclose supplemental information to affect investors’ confidence in their primary news (earnings forecasts).</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2009-05-28 12:46:13.992</description>
   <description>The goal of this thesis is to design both liquid crystal hosts and photochromic dopants terminated with short siloxane oligomers in order to produce homogeneous liquid crystal mixtures containing a photochromic component for liquid crystal photoswitches.  Some of the liquid crystals terminated with short siloxane oligomers were also found to form 'de Vries'-type SmA phases, which minimize the formation of chevrons and zigzag defects that severely degrade the quality of electro-optic devices.&#xd;
In the first part of the thesis, siloxane-terminated phenylpyrimidine liquid crystals were synthesized and characterized.  They form SmC phases and, in some cases, SmA phases. Addition of a terminal halogen substituent on the alkoxy side-chain broadens the SmA temperature range. It was shown that combining a structural element that promotes the formation of a SmC phase with one that promotes the formation of a SmA phase in a mesogen with a 2-phenylpyrimidine core results in a maximum layer contraction of 1.6% for 2-(4-(11-(1,1,1,3,3,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxanyl)undecyloxy)phenyl)-5-(1-chlorooctyloxy)pyrimidine (33a), which may be considered a ‘de Vries’ material.&#xd;
As an extension of the result obtained in the first project, siloxane-terminated biphenyl benzoate and phenyl benzoate liquid crystals were synthesized and their phase behavior studied. They form SmC phases and, in some cases, SmA and SmI phases. Addition of a terminal chloro substituent on alkoxy side-chain results in a broader SmA temperature range and, in some cases, also affects the nature of the mesophase formed. The compound 4-[6-(1,1,1,3,3,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxanyl)hexanoyloxy]phenyl 4-(8-chlorooctyloxy)benzoate (40b) is characterized by a maximum layer shrinkage of only 1.7%, which may be considered to possess some ‘de Vries’ character.&#xd;
Finally, siloxane-terminated fulgide derivatives were designed as photochromic dopants for liquid crystal photoswitches. Compound 41 was designed and synthesized and proved to be an oil at room temperature. Solid fulgide precusors 42, 43a and 44b were then assessed as photochromic dopants in terms of fast switching and high quantum yield requirements of a photoswitch, and their photophysical properties were studied in solution. The isomer composition at the photostationary state suggests that the competition from E-Z isomerization is likely too high for compounds 42, 43a and 44b to be suitable as photochromic dopants for photoswitches.</description>

   <description>A recent hypothesis for explaining blue-green eggs in birds suggests that they may be a sexually selected signal of female (and thus nestling) quality that males use to make parental investment decisions. Although this hypothesis has found mixed correlational support in a few species, well-controlled experimental support has been lacking in non-cavity-nesting species with vivid blue eggs. In this study, we isolate the influence of egg colour on male behaviour by replacing natural American robin Turdus migratorius clutches with four artificial eggs (all of the same colour) representing extremes in natural colour intensity. After incubation, three unrelated nestlings were fostered into each experimental nest immediately after the normal incubation period and parental behaviour was monitored when nestlings were 3, 6, and 9 days old. For the youngest nestlings, male provisioning rate significantly increased in the dark egg treatment, but the effect of egg colour disappeared at the older nestling stages.  This result remains significant when controlling for variation in female behaviour. Male feeding rate at unmanipulated nests was also significantly related to natural egg colour. These results suggest that blue-green egg colour acts as post-mating signal of female quality in at least some cup-nesting species, but does not exclude the possibility that the blue-green pigment also serves other adaptive purposes.</description>

   <description>We present an interactive graphical user interface for textile displays. While electronic displays are emerging in a variety of domains their interfaces have not kept pace with their use. Our work has resulted in an intuitive interface on cloth, a common surface present in numerous user settings, including a wide variety of medical settings. In addition to using cloth as a display mechanism, our interface allows interaction with the interface, by direct manipulation of the cloth. Interaction gestures flow from the cloth metaphor, and include natural actions such as pinching and stretching the cloth surface, as well as more traditional interactions such as touch. We discuss the design and development process behind creating our prototype interface, and treat in significant detail the development of our gestured interactions. We go on to describe applications for our system, which include applications for every-day users, as well as expert users in the medical domain. Finally we include user feedback on our interface, and with this feedback we discuss our conclusions and examine areas for future work.</description>

   <description>By virtue of their presence, observers alter what they are observing. Yet, the international soldiers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) did much more than observe events. From August 1949 until the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force in November 1956, the Western military officers assigned to UNTSO were compelled to take seriously the task of supervising the Arab-Israeli armistice, despite the unwillingness of all parties to accept an actual peace settlement. To the extent that a particular peacekeeping mission was successful – i.e., that peace was “kept” – what actually happened on the ground is usually considered far less important than broader politics. However, as efforts to forge a peace settlement failed one after another, UNTSO operations themselves became the most important mechanism for regional stability, particularly by providing a means by which otherwise implacable enemies could communicate with each other, thus helping to moderate the conflict. &#xd;
	This communication played out against the backdrop of the dangerous early days of the Cold War, the crumbling of Western empires, and the emergence of the non-aligned movement. Analyses of the activities of the Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs), the committees created to oversee the separate General Armistice Agreements signed between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, particularly those during the 1954 to 1956 tenure as UNTSO chief of staff of Canadian Major-General E.L.M. Burns, best evaluate both UNTSO effectiveness and Arab-Israeli interaction.</description>

   <description>The objective of this work is to develop mathematical models to predict molecular weight distributions (MWDs) of ethylene copolymers produced in an industrial gas-phase reactor using a Ziegler-Natta (Z-N) catalyst. Because of the multi-site nature of Z-N catalysts, models of Z-N catalyzed copolymerization tend to be very large and have many parameters that need to be estimated. It is important that the data that are available for parameter estimation be used effectively, and that a suitable balance is achieved between modeling rigour and simplification.&#xd;
In the thesis, deconvolution analysis is used to gain an understanding of how the polymer produced by various types of active sites on the Z-N catalyst responds to changes in the reactor operating conditions. This analysis reveals which reactions are important in determining the MWD and also shows that some types of active sites share similar behavior and can therefore share some kinetic parameters. With this knowledge, a simplified model is developed to predict MWDs of ethylene/hexene copolymers produced at 90 °C. Estimates of the parameters in this isothermal model provide good initial guesses for parameter estimation in a subsequent more complex model.&#xd;
The isothermal model is extended to account for the effects of butene and temperature.&#xd;
Estimability analysis and cross-validation are used to determine which parameters should be estimated from the available industrial data set. Twenty model parameters are estimated so that the model provides good predictions of MWD and comonomer incorporation. Finally, D-, A-,and V-optimal experimental designs for improving the quality of the model predictions are&#xd;
determined. Difficulties with local minima are addressed and a comparison of the optimality criteria is presented.</description>

   <title>Structural and Functional Studies of Escherichia coli Kinases and Phosphatases</title>

   <description>Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is likely the most crucial chemical reaction taking place in all&#xd;
living organisms. It is the basis for the regulatory control of many diverse biological events&#xd;
triggered by extracellular effectors. Moreover, it is a ubiquitous element of intracellular signal&#xd;
transduction pathways that regulates a wide range of processes. While protein phosphorylation has&#xd;
been extensively characterized in eukaryotes, far less is known about its emerging counterparts&#xd;
in prokaryotes. This study involved determination of the crystal structures and functional&#xd;
characterization of two protein kinases, YihE and AceK (also a protein phosphatase), and two&#xd;
nucleotide pyrophosphatases, YjjX and YhdE. X-ray crystallographic structure determination&#xd;
combined with bioinformatics analyses, mutageneses and biochemical experiments, both in vitro&#xd;
and in vivo, were utilized for the functional characterization of each protein. YihE was found to&#xd;
be a previously unknown kinase component of a new type of bacterial phospho-relay mechanism,&#xd;
thus adding kinase activity as another response to the Cpx sensing system that functions to&#xd;
maintain cellular homeostasis. AceK, which possesses both kinase and phosphatase activities,&#xd;
modifies isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) to regulate the flux of isocitrate into the glyoxylate&#xd;
cycle. The structures of Acek alone and in complex with its substrate, ICDH, provided us with&#xd;
information to explain the mechanisms underlying its bifunctionality and its molecular switch.&#xd;
Through structural comparison and, particularly, functional characterization, we revealed that&#xd;
YjjX is a novel ITPase/XTPase responsible for the removal of non-canonical nucleotides from&#xd;
the cell during oxidative stress in Escherichia coli. YhdE, identified as a novel dTTPase, was&#xd;
observed to retard cell growth and form a filamentous phenotype when overexpressed in the cell,&#xd;
suggesting that YhdE is involved in the control of cell growth and division by regulating the cell&#xd;
nucleotide pool for DNA synthesis. In summary, this research has made a substantial&#xd;
ii&#xd;
contribution to the investigation of bacterial phosphorylation and dephophorylation systems that&#xd;
respond to various environmental conditions.</description>

   <description>Since the commencement of welfare state restructuring in the mid 1990’s under the Harris government in Ontario, significant cuts to social assistance, or what symbolically became ‘Ontario Works’, have fundamentally altered how assistance is managed and delivered. Accompanying these financial reforms was the increased surveillance of individuals and families receiving social assistance in the province of Ontario. The central focus of this project examines the technological, task force-oriented and community surveillance practices administered by Ontario Works. Based on primary research of policy documents, legislation, regulations and directives, the thesis argues that through the multitude of surveillance technologies, Ontario Works has made living on social assistance increasingly more demoralizing, in addition to the added difficulty of obtaining welfare benefits. Finally, since an overwhelming majority of recipients are single mothers, the thesis addresses the substantial gender and class dimensions attached to Ontario Works’ surveillance practices and further questions the neoliberal policies such as the ‘war on fraud’ which justified the increased surveillance of poor mothers.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-05-29 13:34:53.867</description>
   <description>The use of plastered straw bale walls in residential construction is growing as builders and owners seek environmentally friendly alternatives to typical timber construction practices.  Straw has excellent insulation properties and is an agricultural bi-product which is annually renewable, and is often considered a waste product of grain production.&#xd;
This thesis presents new models for predicting the compressive strength of plastered straw bale assemblies subjected to concentric and eccentric load.  A constitutive model for lime-cement plaster is adapted from a stress-strain model for concrete, available in the literature.  Twenty-two cylinder tests on plasters typically used for straw bale construction were used to verify the constitutive model.&#xd;
The models for plastered straw bale assemblies were verified by testing plastered straw bale assemblies under concentric and eccentric compressive loads.  An innovative steel frame test jig was designed to facilitate fabrication and testing of the specimens.  Using this jig, 18 specimens of height 0.33 m, 0.99 m, 1.05 m or 2.31 m were subjected to concentric or eccentric compressive load until failure.  The experimental strengths of the assemblies ranged from 23 kN/m to 61 kN/m, depending on the eccentricity of the load, the plaster strength, and the plaster thickness.  Results indicated that the specimen height did not significantly influence the strengths of the specimens.&#xd;
The models predicted the ultimate strength of the assemblies to be, on average, 6% less than the experimentally determined strengths, with a standard deviation of 13%.  The models were also used to predict the theoretical ultimate strengths for a number of plastered straw bale wall assemblies described in the literature.  The fabrication techniques for these specimens were more representative of conventional straw bale construction techniques, and it was found that the experimental results were 30% of the theoretical strengths for assemblies with plaster strength less than 10 MPa and 6% of the theoretical strengths for assemblies with plaster strength greater than 10 MPa.  Thus, to account for construction imperfections and potential alternative failure mechanisms, a reduction factor of no more than 0.3 for plaster less than 10 MPa is suggested in order to predict the strength of plastered straw bale walls constructed using conventional construction techniques.&#xd;
The results presented herein provide support for the use of plastered straw bale walls in residential construction and indicate the applicability of models based on the compressive behaviour of lime-cement plaster for modelling the behaviour of plastered straw bale walls under eccentric and concentric compression.</description>

   <title>Laboratory study of geosynthetic clay liner shrinkage when subjected to wet/dry cycles</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-05-31 22:58:36.59</description>
   <description>Geosynthetic Clay Liners (or GCLs) are often used in conjunction with a geomembrane for landfills and heap-leach pads, where their function is to minimize leakage that may occur through holes in the geomembrane.  GCLs are installed with overlapping panels and powdered bentonite placed between the overlaps to provide a better seal. &#xd;
Recent field exhumations of GCLs installed beneath a geomembrane left exposed to solar radiation have shown panel shrinkage; in some cases, this shrinkage was enough to leave exposed areas unprotected by the GCL.  One hypothesized cause of this shrinkage is cyclic wetting and drying of the GCL.&#xd;
To investigate the hypothesis that wet/dry cycles have the potential to cause irrevocable shrinkage of GCL panels, a total of 8 different products were tested under idealised conditions in the laboratory.  Shrinkage was measured using both hand measurements and digital image correlation techniques.  A number of variables were tested for their effects on panel shrinkage, including mass per unit area, size and aspect ratio, restraint, moisture content and wetting conditions, and GCL type.  Wet/dry cycles were found to cause sufficient shrinkage to explain the shrinkage observed in all but one field case.  The shrinkage of any particular product was found to be variable.  In particular the shrinkage was found to be sensitive to the distribution of the mass of bentonite within a specimen with the highest shrinkage being observed when there was the greatest variability in mass distribution.  It is shown that some GCL products are more prone to shrinkage than others.&#xd;
Consideration is also given to the potential effectiveness of heat-tacking of GCL seams to reduce panel shrinkage in the field.  Specimens of GCL which had been heat-tacked in the field were tested under similar cyclic conditions as used in the abovementioned laboratory tests, and the shrinkage response noted.  The results indicate that such a technique has promise as a method of inhibiting shrinkage of the two products found to exhibit loss of panel overlap in published field situations. However, more work is required to confirm that this does not create other problems.</description>

   <description>Formins are a family of proteins responsible for a vast array of cellular functions such as cell shape, adhesion, cytokinesis and morphogenesis.  Formin regulation of actin is a highly regulated process and is conserved from yeast to mammalian systems.  Previous studies have shown that formins alone are necessary and sufficient for proper recruitment, polymerization and nucleation of actin filaments in the cell.  The Chin-Sang lab is interested in studying development in C. elegans.  In particular, one area of our research focuses on trying to understand different pathways and their related genes that ultimately determine cell shape changes and cell movements.  This is an important area of research as many genes found in C. elegans have homologous counterparts in the human system.  Studying these simple nematode worms may provide us insight into how the much more complex human body functions.  Ultimately, research may provide clues or strategies for future treatments such as gene therapy. The focus of my research is on the fhod-2 gene.  fhod-2 (Formin HOmology Domain) is a member of the formin family.  Our lab has previously shown that this gene may be involved in early embryo development.  Through characterization of a fhod-2 deletion mutant, I have been able to further elaborate on this work.   Through the use of over-expressing lines, RNAi, protein expression and DIC microscopy I have identified defects caused by this mutation. fhod-2 is necessary for a variety of cellular functions both early in the embryo and later for proper development of the organism.  FHOD-2 in situ antibody staining revealed expression in the pharynx and leading/seam cells, western blots of FHOD-2 over-expressing lines also detect higher amounts of FHOD-2 protein in embryos suggesting an embryonic function. I have provided evidence that fhod-2 is a maternal effect lethal gene with defects seen in cytokinesis, gastrulation and elongation. DIC imaging of maternally rescued fhod-2 mutants reveal a plethora of defects affecting the head, gonad and excretory canal cell. Lastly through the use of florescence reporter constructs, fhod-2 mutants have neuronal defects displaying over-extension, early termination or branching of neurites.</description>

   <description>This thesis reports on a qualitative study of the assessment practices in an outdoor education program at an independent school in Ontario.  This thesis focuses on the experiences of students with assessment in the outdoor education context, including the range of assessment practices experienced by the students, the students’ perceptions of assessment, and the impacts of assessment on the students’ experiences in the outdoor education program.&#xd;
This study was conducted from October to December of 2008. Using a case study research design, data were collected through observations of class activities, interviews with teachers and students, and assessment documents and student journals.  The study found that a wide range of assessment practices were used by the teachers in the study, with an emphasis on student-centered assessment practices such as self assessment, peer assessment, group debriefing, and authentic assessment.  These assessment practices fostered a culture of assessment that students perceived to be fair and supportive of their learning. The findings of the study indicate that these types of assessments helped to create a community of learners within the classroom, encouraged the development of self-confidence among students, and promoted transfer of learning. The conclusions of the study suggest that the student-centered assessment practices used in this outdoor education program can provide a model for teachers aiming to develop a positive culture of assessment in their classrooms.</description>

   <description>This thesis ascertains the factors that are responsible for the phenomenon of organized crime in Canada and India and suggests necessary measures for combating the same. The thesis explores the concept of organized crime, its history, threat perception, experience of the two countries and analyzes the effectiveness and critique of the legislations adopted in the direction. The thesis also analyzes the whole scenario in Canada and India in order to determine the factors behind the phenomenon.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the process, available literature as well as statistical data and information available on the web addresses of concerned governmental departments and agencies is reviewed to arrive at an understanding of the scenario from perspective of a developed and a developing country.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis concludes that ineffective legislative measures coupled with corruption and the social reality that there is a market for illegal products is responsible for the phenomenon of organized crime in Canada and India. Moreover, overemphasis on legislative and enforcement measures has been ineffective as a solution for the problem. &#xd;
&#xd;
The factors responsible for the phenomenon in the two countries can be classified into legislative inadequacies, societal preferences and secondary factors such as lack of study of political corruption, criminalization of politics, lack of political will, lack of research initiative in the area and abuse of provisions. Apart from overcoming the shortcomings of legislative measures, it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach to fight the phenomenon. The measures in the said direction include emphasis on preventive measures, creating public awareness to obligate public policy, overhauling of criminal justice system, revising and improving enforcement agencies’ training manuals, and revising the pay scales of police personnel.</description>

   <title>Reciprocal Regulation of E-Cadherin and SHP2 by the Extracellular CA2+-Sensing Receptor in Colonic Epithelial Adenocarcinoma Cells</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2009-06-09 17:56:44.843</description>
   <description>Colon cancer is characterized by the progressive loss of E-cadherin, a Ca2+-dependent adherens junction component and epithelial marker.  Furthermore, inhibition of the phosphatase SHP2, essential in the cell survival signaling via the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, has been shown to upregulate E-cadherin in breast cancer cell lines.  This suggests that unregulated increases in SHP2 may promote a cancer cell phenotype.  The aim of this study was to define molecular mechanisms by which dietary Ca2+ is chemoprotective against colon cancer.  The extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been implicated in this process and we speculated that there was a relationship between CaSR activation and E-cadherin and SHP2 expression levels on colonic epithelia.  A colonic adenocarcinoma cell line which lacks endogenous E-cadherin expression, SW480, was used as a model cell.  CaSR levels were manipulated by transient transfection and E-cadherin and SHP2 expression levels were determined by Western blotting.  The E-cadherin expression pattern was also assessed with RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.  We found that after CaSR activation via Ca2+ or other known CaSR agonists (neomycin sulphate, spermine), E-cadherin expression was increased and SHP2 expression was decreased.  However, the E-cadherin expression pattern was altered in the presence of a dominant-negative CaSR (R185Q).  Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK inhibited CaSR-mediated increases of E-cadherin protein in SW480 cells.  Inhibition of p38 MAPK had no effect on CaSR-stimulation of E-cadherin transcript or promoter activity.  SHP2 decreases usually seen after Ca2+-treatment were reduced after pharmacological inhibition of JNK in the presence of high Ca2+.  CaSR activation also increased cell-cell adherence as assessed by electronic cell sizing and this adherence was lost when both CaSR-mediated changes in E-cadherin and SHP2 expression were inhibited.  We conclude that CaSR activation in colonic epithelial cancer cells stimulated E-cadherin increases, through a mechanism involving p38 MAPK, as well as inhibited SHP2 expression, through a JNK-mediated mechanism.  Further, these protein changes post-CaSR activation cause an increase in cell-cell adherence.  Our results suggest that the chemoprotective nature of dietary Ca2+ supplements may involve reciprocal regulation of E-cadherin and SHP2 via the CaSR.</description>

   <description>Prospective epidemiological studies indicate that regular exercise during the year prior to conception reduces preeclampsia risk, whereas exercise during affects pregnancy reduces preeclampsia risk only at specific dosages, or in specific subpopulations. The risk of severe preeclampsia is increased among women who exercise for more than 270 minutes/week in early pregnancy. Physiology studies are needed to identify mechanisms through which regular exercise may influence preeclampsia risk. This dissertation examined the effects of pregnancy (30-36 weeks gestation), and regular exercise participation, on two important pathophysiological features of preeclampsia; circulating anti-angiogenic markers, represented by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng), and endothelial dysfunction. The results demonstrate that regularly exercising, pregnant non-smoking women have higher levels of serum placental growth factor (PlGF), lower levels of serum sFlt-1 and sFlt-1:PlGF, and are less likely to experience high serum sEng levels, than sedentary women. The effects of exercise on PlGF and sFlt-1:PlGF are more pronounced among women exercising less than 270 minutes/week in pregnancy. Anti-angiogenic changes that could contribute to preeclampsia were not observed immediately after short-duration, moderate-intensity exercise in the third trimester. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and the shear stimulus for FMD are not affected by pregnancy, however the time to peak FMD was increased in pregnancy. Regular exercise did not affect FMD or its shear stimulus in healthy pregnant or non-pregnant women. FMD and its shear stimulus were positively correlated in active, but not inactive, pregnant and non-pregnant women. Pregnancy and physical activity do not affect radial artery low flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC). L-FMC is artery dependent, occurring in the radial, but not the brachial, artery of healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women. The positive correlation between L-FMC and FMD suggests that L-FMC and FMD are not independent measurements. The results of this thesis suggest that physical activity and exercise may reduce preeclampsia risk by reducing concentrations of angiogenic markers. Although exercise participation did not affect conduit artery vascular function in healthy pregnant women, future studies should investigate the effects of exercise on vascular function in women with endothelial dysfunction, or risk factors for preeclampsia.</description>

   <description>The backdrop for this research paper is the tunnelling that is currently nearing completion in the Epirus region of Northern Greece, as part of the Egnatia Odos Highway construction. Highly deformed and altered sediments and low grade rock masses dominate the near surface environment creating a variety of technical challenges for tunnelling. Accurate equivalent rock&#xd;
mass performance reductions for tunnels in these materials is complicated by geomorphologic peculiarities such as those found in Flysch materials. The mechanisms of rock-support interaction related to face or near-face reinforcement systems are poorly understood at this time. As well, the&#xd;
mechanics of weak rock materials in the complex deformation regime in advance of a tunnel face are not robustly integrated into current 2D design models. Design decisions are currently possible using empirical techniques and simplified models, but a true optimized and mechanicsbased design process for the various support technologies are not fully developed. This research addresses elements of such issues, such as: use of the Longitudinal Displacement Profile (LDP)&#xd;
of the Convergence-Confinement method of tunnel design, relating 2D numerical models to their distance from the face using the size of the plastic zone as an indicator, near face tunnel support analysis in weak rock masses, boundary condition assessment for numerical modelling of such weak rock masses, the influence of plasticity zones surrounding tunnel excavations, and&#xd;
modelling optimization techniques for weak rock tunnelling in order to optimize the design of such underground structures and better predict near-face deformation and yield development. This work involved the use of 2D and 3D numerical models of tunnel sequencing for numerical simulation of composite material behaviour and sequential tunnel deformation response.</description>

   <description>Textile dyes are molecules designed to impart a permanent colour to textile fabrics. They pose an environmental problem because they are toxic and they decrease the aesthetic value of rivers and lakes. Current technologies for dye removal cannot remove all classes of dyes and two or more technologies are usually combined to achieve statisfactory decolourization efficiencies. Lignin-degrading enzymes like laccases are potential technologies for dye decolourization and decolourization with immobilized laccase has been intensively investigated. The majority of those studies however have focused on dye disappearance and several reported that significant dye adsorption had occured during the dye removal, making the role of the enzyme unclear. Moreover, textile wastewaters contain auxiliary chemicals that can impact enzymatic dye decolourization and very few studies have evaluated the impact of those substances on laccase. This research evaluated the feasibility of treating dye-contaminated textile wastewaters with an immobilized laccase system.  The first sub-objective was to examined the decolourization of Reactive blue 19 (an anthraquinone dye) by Trametes versicolor laccase immobilized on controlled porosity carrier (CPC) silica beads and the second was to analyze the kinetic effects of a non-ionic surfactant Merpol, sodium sulfate, and sodium chloride on laccase decolourization of Reactive blue 19. Decolourization of Reactive blue 19 by immobilized laccase was mainly enzymatic although dye some adsorption occurred.  Decolourization led to less toxic by-products from azo and indigoid dyes whereas increased toxicity was observed for anthraquinone dyes. The feasibility of immobilizing laccase on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) through its sugar residues with a simple procedure was demonstrated and the mass of enzyme immobilized compared well with other commercial acrylic supports. The decolorization of Reactive blue 19 by laccase was inhibited by the non-ionic surfactant, Merpol by substrate depletion.  A model describing this inhibition was developed and was validated by a saturated equilibrium binding experiment. While sodium sulfate (ionic strength) had no effect on either ABTS oxidation or dye decolourization, sodium chloride inhibited laccase during dye decolourization and the type and nature of the inhibition depended on the substrate. With ABTS, the inhibition was hyperbolic non-competitive whereas it was parabolic mixed with Reactive blue 19.</description>

   <description>This dissertation arose from a need to derive an inclusive model for describing the historical meanings of progressive education.  It considers reform rhetoric published in two widely distributed and accessible journals in Ontario, The School and The Canadian School Journal, between 1919 and 1942.  These sources brought together a wide variety of educationists in the province, including teachers, school board representatives, members of the Department of Education, inspectors, and the staff of teacher training institutions, and were forums for the exploration of new and progressive educational ideas.  Various conceptions and interpretations of what progressive education would entail were published side by side, in parallel.&#xd;
This dissertation describes the rhetoric of progressive education, which concerned three domains—active learning, individualized instruction, and the linking of schools to contemporary society—and considers the distinctions within this language.  Further, this dissertation argues that progressivist ideas were interpreted and represented in different ways according to conceptual orientation and context.  Three distinct interpretations of progressive education are described in this thesis.  The first progressivist orientation was primarily concerned with child study and developmental psychology; the second concerned social efficiency and industrial order; the third concerned social meliorism and cooperation.  Hence, I draw not only on three different domains of progressivist rhetoric, but also on three distinct orientations to reform.  What emerges is a description of how different progressivists understood and represented Ontario’s transforming schools, in a context affected by the forces of modernity, world war, and economic depression.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2009-06-15 15:59:13.04</description>
   <description>This thesis estimates the effects of monetary policy shocks by employing vector&#xd;
auto regressions (VAR). I argue that to the extent the central bank and the private sector&#xd;
have information not reflected in the VAR, the measurement of policy innovations&#xd;
is contaminated. These incorrectly estimated policy shocks then generate misleading&#xd;
results about the effects of monetary policy. This thesis first attempts to figure out&#xd;
the variables indeed observed by central banks to make monetary policy decisions and&#xd;
then formulates the monetary policy reaction function by using those variables. Having&#xd;
identified more realistic monetary policy functions in VAR models, I conclude that&#xd;
most of the previous puzzling results about the effect of monetary policy shocks might&#xd;
be due to incorrectly identifying the monetary policy reaction function.</description>

   <description>The Prevalence of Epilepsy and Seizures in Subjects with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. MSc Thesis, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, May 2009.&#xd;
&#xd;
OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is the umbrella term that describes the range of adverse developmental outcomes that occur in offspring as a consequence of maternal drinking during pregnancy. FASD has been associated with a large number of co-morbidities, including neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Epilepsy occurs in 0.6% of the population in Canada. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of epilepsy or seizure disorders in people who have been diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS) or Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all active charts (N=1063) at St. Michael’s Hospital (Toronto) and Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital (Edmonton) FASD clinics. A total of 425 subjects between the ages of 2 to 49 were included in the analysis. The relationship between FASD diagnosis and other risk factors for co-occurrence of epilepsy and seizures (e.g. extent of exposure to alcohol and other drugs, type of birth, maternal history, and trauma) in subjects with FASD was also examined. Chi-square tests and multivariate multinomial logistic regression were used. RESULTS: Twenty-five (5.9%) individuals with FASD had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, and 50 (11.8%) had at least one documented seizure episode, yielding an overall prevalence of 17.7% with a history of seizures in this population. Those with epilepsy or seizures were two times (Odds Ratio=2.27, 95% Confidence Interval=1.14-4.51, p&lt;0.05) more likely to have an unnatural birth and those with epilepsy were three times (OR=3.41, 95% CI 1.11-10.5, p&lt;0.05) more likely to have had an unnatural type of birth (breech, caesarean, forceps or vacuum) than those subjects with no history of seizures. None of the other risk factors examined were associated with a greater prevalence of epilepsy or seizures in subjects with FASD. These results indicate a remarkably high prevalence of epilepsy/seizures in the FASD population of two specialized FASD clinics compared with the general population.</description>

   <description>This dissertation studies depictions of the Middle East in the works of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. My discussion focuses on two prominent members of the Brotherhood—Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt—and utilizes an interdisciplinary approach that examines the poetry, prose, unpublished correspondence and journals, sketches, watercolours, and oil paintings that they produced prior to 1856. I argue that Rossetti and Hunt make use of the Middle East as a repository for and reflection of the ambiguities and ambivalences of their own positions as avant-garde artists and authors.&#xd;
&#xd;
Chapters Two and Three focus on the work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Chapter Two examines Rossetti’s juvenilia in order to trace the ways in which the young author-artist uses the Middle East as a platform from which to work out the interplay between narrative and image, the conceptualization of the role of the author and artist, and the use of realistically depicted elements in religious painting. Chapter Three continues this discussion of Rossetti through an investigation of the 1850 edition of his poem “The Burden of Nineveh,” which centres on an encounter with an ancient Assyrian statue, and I argue that Rossetti links this artifact to the P. R. B. and uses it to critique the artistic ideals of mid-nineteenth-century England.&#xd;
&#xd;
The next two chapters shift to an investigation of William Holman Hunt’s first visit to the Middle East in 1854-6, a journey that became a focal point of the author-artist’s career. Chapter Four makes extensive use of Hunt’s unpublished diaries and letters from his sojourn in the Holy Land to destabilize the widespread conception of the artist as a staunch imperialist and the foremost English religious painter of the nineteenth century. Building on this foundation, Chapter Five looks back to the three months that Hunt spent in Egypt in 1854 and investigates the ways in which the complex experiences that the author-artist describes in his unpublished letters from this period filter into the watercolours, sketches, and oil paintings that he executed in Egypt.</description>

   <description>The four studies of this thesis provide an overview of the epidemiology of physical activity in Canada. In the first study two methods of coding activities used in estimating leisure-time physical activity energy expenditure (LTPAEE), from a questionnaire including 21 specific activities, and up to three “other” activities were compared. The authors assessed whether the assignment of activity intensity for “other” activities has an effect on LTPAEE and the classification of respondents as physically active versus inactive. The results indicate that the population classification of activity level is not affected by the intensity code; however, individual level LTPAEE is under-estimated from light and vigorous activities and over-estimated from moderate activities using the current method. In study two the proportion of Canadians meeting Canada’s physical activity guidelines for moderate and vigorous activities was estimated. The prevalence of adults reporting no activity has not changed since 1994/95 and the prevalence of meeting the guidelines has increased by about 11%. Men, younger adults, those with higher income and lower body mass index (BMI) meet the guidelines more often than their peers. The epidemiology of walking among Canadians between 1994 and 2007 was assessed in the third study. Walking was the most popular activity, regardless of age, sex, BMI or income group; however, only 30% of walkers walked regularly. Women, older adults, those with lower BMI and lower household income walk regularly more often than their counterparts. Women, older adults and lower income Canadians tended to derive 100% of their total LTPAEE from walking. An evaluation of whether meeting the guidelines for physical activity was associated with lower odds of chronic conditions and reporting fair/poor health was undertaken in study four. After adjustment for covariates, the odds of type 2 diabetes, obesity and reporting fair/poor health were significantly higher among those not meeting the guidelines for both sexes and for high blood pressure among women. Together these findings provide an understanding of the limitations of estimating LTPAEE, provide estimates of the proportion of Canadians meeting the guidelines for physical activity and provide insight into the relationship between meeting the guidelines and chronic conditions.</description>

   <description>Ethanol teratogenicity involving the developing brain is the leading preventable cause of mental deficiency in the Western world. Chronic prenatal ethanol exposure (CPEE) may be a risk factor for ethanol abuse and altered responsiveness to nicotine in postnatal life. Previous studies in our laboratory have utilized maternal oral administration of a high-dose (4 g ethanol/kg maternal body weight/day) ethanol regimen that induces structural and functional deficits in the fetus and postnatal offspring. The objective of this thesis was to test the hypotheses that moderate CPEE produces in postnatal offspring: (i) structural and functional teratogenic effects; (ii) increased ethanol preference; (iii) altered responsiveness to acute nicotine; and (iv) increased nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in forebrain structures, namely the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Pregnant Dunkin-Hartley-strain guinea pigs were given 24-h access to aqueous ethanol solution (5%, v/v) sweetened with sucralose (1g/L) or aqueous sucralose solution (1g/L) throughout gestation. Spontaneous locomotor activity in an open field was measured in offspring on postnatal day (PD) 10. Beginning around PD 40, ethanol preference in the offspring was determined using a two-bottle-choice paradigm. Each animal was given 2-h daily access to aqueous ethanol solution (0 - 3%, v/v) and water over 33 days of testing. Subsequently, hippocampal and frontal cortical tissues were obtained for the measurement of nAChR population by radioligand binding. Moderate maternal consumption of the aqueous ethanol produced growth restriction in postnatal offspring of both sexes, and increased spontaneous locomotor activity in male offspring only. These postnatal outcomes are similar to the teratogenic effects produced by a high-dose, binge-type ethanol regimen. Compared with control, offspring from mothers that consumed ethanol throughout gestation exhibited greater preference for aqueous ethanol, and a decrease in the concentration of nAChRs in the frontal cortex, but not the hippocampus. These data demonstrate that, in the guinea pig, moderate maternal consumption of ethanol is a useful model for studying ethanol neurobehavioural teratogenicity; and chronic prenatal exposure to ethanol enhances ethanol preference in young adult offspring and altered expression of nAChRs in the frontal cortex.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a multiple-method investigation of teachers’ responses to the adoption and implementation of a compulsory laptop program (CLP).  It reports on the beliefs, opinions, and behaviours of teachers responsible for translating a CLP into classroom-based reality.  The study is based on data collected from 18 interviews, 2 focus groups, and classroom observations of 5 teachers obtained from teachers and administrators at one Canadian independent school, as well as an online survey data from educators at nine independent schools across Canada.   &#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of the research was to investigate the impact of adopting and implementing a planned change initiative by examining teachers’ responses to a school-wide mandated curriculum initiative by focusing on their perceptions of (a) requisite participation, (b) essential components, and (c) changing roles when implementing a CLP. &#xd;
&#xd;
The findings of the study include four supports for teachers trying to implement a CLP into teaching practices.  First, clearly communicate and revise shared, benchmark-driven policies on an ongoing basis to assist in unifying an understanding of the program.  Second, address teachers’ self-imposed pressures within a CLP by ensuring individual teachers’ intrinsic motivation and affective needs are respected and addressed.  Third, provide teachers with job-embedded learning opportunities to work individually and in small groups, and with access to knowledgeable resources in order to connect technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge, to meet just-in-time needs.  Fourth, adopt an implementation model that is fluid and addresses elements affecting a teacher to provide a more inclusive and realistic method for explaining and supporting what may occur when teachers engage in implementing a CLP.</description>

   <description>Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are involved in common and complex&#xd;
diseases, such as cancer, is a major challenge in current molecular epidemiology.&#xd;
Knowledge of such SNPs is expected to enable timely&#xd;
diagnosis, effective treatment, and, ultimately, prevention of human disease.&#xd;
However, the tremendous number of SNPs  on the human genome, which is estimated at more than eleven million,&#xd;
poses challenges to obtain and analyze the information of all the SNPs. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis we address the problem of selecting representative SNP markers for supporting effective disease-gene association studies.&#xd;
Our goal is to facilitate the genotyping and analysis procedure, associated with such studies, by providing effective prioritization methods for SNP markers based on both their allele information and functional significance.&#xd;
However, the problem of SNP selection has been proven to be NP-hard in general, and current selection methods impose certain restrictions and use heuristics for reducing the complexity of the problem.   &#xd;
We thus aim to develop new heuristic algorithms and systems to advance the state-of-the-art, while relaxing the restrictions. &#xd;
To address this challenge, we formulate several SNP selection problems and present novel algorithms and a database system based on the two major SNP selection approaches: tag SNP selection and functional SNP selection. Furthermore, we describe an innovative approach to combine both tag SNP selection and functional SNP selection into one unified selection process.&#xd;
We demonstrate the improved performance of all the proposed methods using comparative studies.</description>

   <title>Messenger RNA Expression of the ABCA3 Transporter and Vascular Nitrite Distribution in Rat Aorta After Treatment with Glyceryl Trinitrate</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology) -- Queen's University, 2009-06-23 14:18:16.122</description>
   <description>ABCA3, a 150 kDa protein belonging to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, has been shown to play a role in surfactant production in humans. However, in bacteria, ABC transporters are known to mediate the flux of nitrite. Biotransformation of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), a drug used in the treatment of heart conditions such as angina pectoris and heart failure, yields the inorganic nitrite anion, and the intracellular oxidation of this ion may lead to the formation of tyrosine-nitrated proteins and cellular damage. Immunohistochemical studies indicate the presence of ABCA3 in rat aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells. My objective was to assess whether changes in either ABCA3 mRNA expression or nitrite accumulation occur during chronic exposure to GTN. Accordingly, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 0.4 mg/hr GTN for 48 hours to induce GTN tolerance, and the aortas removed. Nitrite and ABCA3 mRNA levels were assessed using the Greiss colorimetric assay, and real-time or semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. In control aortas, endothelium removal resulted in an apparent 25-35% decrease in ABCA3 mRNA levels, indicating that the transporter is expressed in endothelial cells more abundantly than in smooth muscle cells since the ratio of endothelial cells to smooth muscle cells in the rat aorta is approximately 10:1. Furthermore, ABCA3 mRNA levels were decreased by 70% in aortas from GTN-tolerant animals, whereas the mRNA levels of a related transporter, ABCA1, remained at control levels. An inverse correlation between nitrite and ABCA3 mRNA levels occurred after the induction of GTN tolerance, with an apparent redistribution of nitrite to endothelial cells. These findings indicate that chronic GTN exposure results in altered expression of ABCA3, and that this is associated with altered nitrite distribution in blood vessels from GTN-tolerant animals.</description>

   <description>A novel multi-tank thermal energy storage (TES) was evaluated experimentally and numerically. The multi-tank storage is based on the interconnection of standard hot water storage tanks by a single charge flow loop. Each tank is charged through a thermosyphon loop and natural convection heat exchanger (NCHE). Both series- and parallel-connected configurations were investigated and results show that high degrees of stratification can occur. &#xd;
	To predict the performance of the series- and parallel-connected multi-tank TES, a numerical model was developed and implemented in the TRNSYS simulation environment.  Laboratory tests were also conducted to measure the unit’s performance under charge conditions representative of combinations of clear and overcast days. The effects of rising and falling charge loop temperatures and power levels on storage temperatures and heat transfer rates were studied and indicated that sequential stratification was achieved in the series-connected storage. &#xd;
	Under certain conditions, reverse flow through the thermosyphon loops was identified, leading to destratification and carry-over of heat to the downstream storage tanks. Consequently, a new model was developed and showed to model reverse thermosyphon operation. A subsequent analysis showed that these effects could be minimized by careful system design. &#xd;
	To quantify the relative benefits of the sequentially stratified TES, values of exergy stored versus time were determined and compared against fully stratified and fully mixed storages. Results show that the series configuration closely matches the exergy level attained by a perfectly stratified storage. &#xd;
	Finally, annual simulations conducted for a typical multi-family installation showed that the multi-tank storage performed at a level comparable to a single, fully stratified, storage.</description>

   <description>Education for All (2005) offers a developmentally appropriate plan based on responsiveness to intervention (RTI) research. The model, termed the tiered approach, advocates intervention as a step in the process of identification which involves closely monitoring students in the primary years and providing additional support through direct instruction and increased monitoring of students who are at-risk. There are numerous empirical studies discussing the potential benefits of the RTI model (Feiker Hollenbeck, 2007; Fuchs &amp; Deshler, 2007). However, the promise of a theory is never enough to ensure a change in the practice of teachers or an improvement in the learning of students.  Since it is the teachers who will alter their classroom practice and systematically monitor student progress in order to decide whether suitable learning trajectories are being achieved, researchers must examine how best to support teachers in the face of such change. This study describes, through the use of focus group data, teachers’ views of their experiences participating in a pilot project of the RTI model. While exploring the supports and barriers that these teachers face in the first year of implementing the RTI model, this study describes the limitations imposed by the teachers’ perceived lack of empowerment throughout the pilot project.</description>

   <description>A Pan-style scanning tunneling microscope (STM), with a vertical coarse approach mechanism, was designed, built and tested. The microscope will be operated in ultra-high vacuum and also at cryogenic temperatures (8 K) inside a continuous flow cryostat. Fundamental differences in operating principle exist between the new microscope and the beetle-type inertial sliders [1] that have been the mainstay of the group for the last eight years. While Pan-style microscopes do already exist [2], they remain challenging to build, and an active area of research [3]. This system represents a bold departure from well-trodden paths, and will greatly expand the range of experiments that our group can perform.&#xd;
&#xd;
The operating principles of inertial piezoelectric motors are detailed. Design guidelines for a piezoelectric motor are given, and used in the design of the vertical coarse approach motor. A simple, inexpensive implementation for creating waveforms with an extremely fast fall time is discussed. Motor performance is tested, and a minimum step size of 20nm is found for frequencies ranging from 0 Hz to 3 kHz. The motor operates with high dynamic range: individual 20nm steps can be taken, as well as being able to move at a velocity of 0.4mm s−1. Little is known about the vibrational properties of Pan-style microscopes. Vibrational testing of the microscope revealed the expected scanner bending mode at 1.6 kHz (above the scanner bending mode of our beetles at 1.2 kHz), and a complicated response signal above this frequency. Custom extension springs for an eddy-current damping system are built and tested. A low resonant frequency of 1.8 Hz is found, which is ideal for the application.&#xd;
&#xd;
Initial testing of the STM in ambient conditions is performed on two different surfaces. A moir´e supermesh [4] with periodicity 3nm is observed on a highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface, and agrees well with previously published results. Using a flame-annealed Gold on mica surface, a low drift rate of 0.6nm s−1 is observed over a period of 13 minutes. Single-height atomic steps are observed on both surfaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, the microscope is shown to be capable of zooming into different features on a surface, and scanning at different length scales.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-06-27 19:07:47.066</description>
   <description>In cooperative networks, relays cooperate and form a distributed multi-antenna system to provide spatial diversity. In order to achieve high bandwidth efficiency, distributed space-time block codes (DSTBCs) are proposed and have been studied extensively.&#xd;
Among all DSTBCs, this thesis focuses on the codes which are single-symbol maximum likelihood (ML) decodable and can achieve the full diversity order.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents four works on single-symbol ML decodable DSTBCs. The first work proposes the row-monomial distributed orthogonal space-time block codes (DOSTBCs). We find an upper bound of the data-rate of the row-monomial DOSTBC and construct the codes achieving this upper bound. In the second work, we first study the general DOSTBCs and derive an upper bound of the data-rate of the DOSTBC. Secondly, we propose the row-monomial DOSTBCs with channel phase information (DOSTBCs-CPI) and derive an upper bound of the data-rate of those codes. Furthermore, we find the actual row-monomial DOSTBCs-CPI which achieve the upper bound of the data-rate.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the third and fourth works of this thesis, we focus on error performance analysis of single-symbol ML decodable DSTBCs. Specifically, we study the distributed Alamouti's code in dissimilar cooperative networks. In the third work, we assume that the relays are blind relays and we derive two very accurate approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions of the distributed Alamouti's code. In the fourth work, we assume that the relays are CSI-assisted relays. When those CSI-assisted relays adopt the amplifying coefficients that was proposed in [33] and widely used in many previous publications, upper and lower bounds of the BER of the distributed Alamouti's code are derived. Very surprisingly, the lower bound indicates that the code cannot achieve the full diversity order when the CSI-assisted relays adopt the amplifying coefficients proposed in [33]. Therefore, we propose a new threshold-based amplifying coefficient and it makes the code achieve the full diversity order two. Moreover, three optimum and one suboptimum schemes are developed to calculate the threshold used in this new amplifying coefficient.</description>

   <description>The interaction between metal nanoparticles and small molecules has been investigated by FTIR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy.  Electrospray deposition into an argon matrix was chosen as the initial method.  An electrospray metal source was tested in development stage.  Both the formation of a stable corona discharge as well as a stable Taylor cone were successfully completed.  Problems arose when the entire system was tested.  It was determined that the vacuum was insufficient for the length of the flight path.  Focus then shifted to nanoparticles in more conventional environments.  Sol-gel encapsulated nanoparticles were generated, in the form of both monoliths as well as thin film coatings on silicon wafers.  The gels were exposed to 1atm of carbon monoxide in a gas cell.  The method encountered problems due to spectral interference from the matrix.   The next attempt consisted of solution stabilized nanoparticles.  The solution was exposed to various amounts of both ammonium sulphate and diethylamine.  There was again the problem of solvent interference, even when attempting to observe the system using Raman spectroscopy.  Finally, surface stabilized nanoparticles were generated, using 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane to adhere the particles to glass slides.  While the coating was successfully applied to the glass slides, as confirmed with Raman spectroscopy, it was not possible to get the nanoparticles to adhere.  Future outlook for this project is briefly reviewed.</description>

   <description>The gas-phase chemistry of butanal, propanal, and acetaldehyde has been investigated using electron bombardment matrix isolation techniques. Each aldehyde was diluted in excess argon gas and subjected to electron bombardment with 300eV electrons.  The products of subsequent reaction processes were matrix isolated and analyzed by FTIR absorption spectroscopy.  Ionized butanal produced a variety of decomposition products including propane, propene, propyne, ethene, ethyne, CCCO, ketene, formaldehyde, CO, CH2=CHCH2•, CH2CHO•, HCO• and methane.  Products resulting from ionized propanal included the ethyl radical, ethane, ethene, ethyne, CO, CH2CHO•, HCO• and methane.  In both cases the products are believed to be formed from C—C cleavages of the parent ion followed by hydrogen atom scavenging and/or hydrogen atom abstraction from proximally located species.  Dehydrogenation products of propane and ethane are proposed to result from product secondary ionization, a process dependent on high electron currents.  Surprisingly, in the case of butanal, the McLafferty Rearrangement, a dominant process in electron ionization mass spectrometry, was not observed to occur.  &#xd;
Electron bombardment of acetaldehyde:Ar mixtures produced many decomposition products including methane, CO, HCO•, CH3CO•, CH2CHO•, CH3• and ketene.  The isomerization product, vinyl alcohol, was also observed.  As way of investigating the mechanisms of the above products, experiments were performed in which the acetaldehyde:Ar mole ratio was varied.  Variations in the acetaldehyde:Ar mole ratio produced dramatic variations in the products formed, demonstrating a transition from unimolecular chemistry at low acetaldehyde mole ratios, to processes consistent with bimolecular processes at intermediate mole ratios.  Variations in the total flow rate of gas resulted in nonsystematic changes in product yields but provided further evidence for unimolecular methane formation via the elimination of neutral CO.  Finally, an investigation into the mechanism of vinyl alcohol using the acetaldehyde isotopomer, CD3CHO, in conjunction with computational methods provided further evidence that enol formation occurs as a result of a direct 1,3-H-transfer and not consecutive 1,2-H-transfers.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this research was to explore vocal pedagogy that places development of self-knowledge at the center of the investigation. I looked at the personal growth that occurred as a result of the distinctive qualities inherent in singing lessons that included spiritual practices. The goal for unity of body, mind, and spirit in performance bears a close resemblance to the basic meditative practices of mastery through repetition, intense listening, and deep connective breathing that have been used for thousands of years in all mystical traditions. The singing studio is a place where self-discovery can be encouraged and held with respect. This exploration examined vocal pedagogy as a means to finding one’s personal voice. Little literature exists on voice and self-knowledge, and a search for relevant sources revealed that there appears to be no professional training available in the area of voice and self-knowledge, although many people appear to be developing their own strategies for this purpose. My own experience and practice as a voice teacher with a strong spiritual identity, places me as someone who may benefit from further information about voice and self-development.&#xd;
The study consisted of two phases. Phase one consisted of interviews with three educators who use singing lessons as a tool for development of self-knowledge. The findings of these interviews informed phase two, which was a series of ten singing lessons given to one female adult student who had requested a type of singing study that would promote self-knowledge. The lessons used both traditional vocal techniques and spiritual practices.&#xd;
I discovered that the use of spiritual practice combined with traditional vocal technique deepened the experience of the lessons and enhanced every aspect of my traditional vocal pedagogy. Research that involved the researcher and the process of research so intimately allowed a pedagogy to emerge that is responsive, deliberately non-linear, in which curriculum is shaped dialogically by both student and teacher in an intimate evolving relationship.</description>

   <description>Background: The prevalence of adult overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide.  Innovative weight reduction interventions are needed to decrease the physical, psychological, and financial costs associated with this condition.  Individually-adapted physical activity interventions delivered by Health Educators in a primary care setting have shown promise in addressing adult overweight and obesity.  Process evaluations are needed to clarify results obtained from randomized controlled trials and to provide insight regarding optimal programming strategies for obesity reduction interventions.&#xd;
Purpose: To investigate the process evaluation components dose, fidelity, and quality of implementation of the PROACTIVE intervention to increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults in a primary care setting.&#xd;
Methods: One hundred ninety-four overweight or obese adults (135 women, mean age = 51.3 years, SD = 10.8; 59 men, mean age = 54.3 years, SD = 10.6) were randomized to attend 22 individualized behavioural counselling sessions over 12 months.  The Physical Activity Recall questionnaire, Session Summary Forms, and Health Care Climate Questionnaire were utilized to measure physical activity and intervention dose, fidelity, and quality.  Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted.&#xd;
Results: Overall physical activity and total active hours did not significantly change after 6 and 12 months of participation in PROACTIVE; however, physical activity intensity did significantly change.  Light intensity physical activity decreased while moderate intensity physical activity increased from baseline to 6 months; this shift was maintained from 6 to 12 months.  Dose and fidelity of implementation did not predict physical activity involvement at 6 and 12 months.  Three-quarters of the intervention was implemented as planned and women received a significantly greater percentage of intervention content then men.  Quality of the Health Educator-client relationship significantly predicted total number of hours spent being physically active at 12 months, but should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.&#xd;
Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest that dose and fidelity do not predict physical activity involvement and that additional research is warranted to investigate quality.  It is recommended that future studies examine the critical intervention content that correlates to an increase in physical activity among overweight and obese adults.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes a finite element analysis (FEA) model of an indirect heating thermal actuator. The heat transfer mechanisms are investigated and the conductive heat transfer is found to be the dominant heat transfer mode. A model simplification method is discussed and used in the analysis to reduce the degrees of freedom and avoid meshing failures. The device is fabricated with the MetalMUMPs process. Measurements of the displacement as a function of the driving voltage are made to verify the FEA model. The results show that the simulation result of the FEA model produced a reasonable agreement with the experimental data. The difference between the FEA result and test result is investigated. A novel thermal actuator with integrated capacitive position sensor is also investigated. This new thermal actuator with an integrated capacitive sensor uses the indirect heating thermal actuator discussed in the first part of the thesis to achieve a new integration method. The displacement of the actuator provided by the sensor enables a feedback control capability. The analytical model, FEA and test results for the capacitive sensor are presented to validate the design concept. The test results show a reasonable agreement with the analytical analysis and the FEA. Finally, a manual displacement tuning application and a PI feedback control application with the designed thermal actuator with integrated capacitive sensor are documented.</description>

   <description>Biphasic systems have been studied for in situ product removal (ISPR), and have shown improvements in bioreactor performance. With immiscible solvents, concerns associated with solvent biocompatibility, bioavailability and operation have been identified. One alternative is a solid-liquid system in which polymer beads are used, absorbing and removing target compounds from the aqueous phase while maintaining equilibrium conditions. In such systems, the capability of a polymer to absorb the compound of interest is an important parameter. This work has identified polymer properties that may be important to the interaction between polymers and target compounds for selected biotransformation molecules including 2-phenylethanol, cis-1,3-indandiol, iso-butanol, succinic acid and 3-hydroxybutyrolactone. Furthermore, the biotransformation from L-phenylalanine to 2-phenyethanol, an important aroma compound in industry, was examined in detail.&#xd;
It was found that relatively hydrophobic compounds tend to be absorbed by polymers better than hydrophilic ones based on partition coefficient tests. Since all of the biotransformation molecules tested have polar functional groups such as alcohol, acid and lactone, polar polymers such as Hytrel® performed better than non-polar polymers such as Kraton® possibly due to the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the polymer and the solute. Crystallinity and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding were also found to be important polymer properties.&#xd;
Hytrel® 8206 was identified as the best working polymer to absorb 2-phenylethanol. A solid-liquid batch mode two phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) with 500 g Hytrel® generated an overall 2-PE concentration of 13.7 g/L, the highest reported in the current literature. This was based on a polymer phase concentration of 88.74 g/L and aqueous phase concentration of 1.2 g/L. Better results were achieved via contact with more polymers with the aqueous phase applying a semi-continuous reactor configuration. In this system, a final 2-PE concentration (overall) of 20.4 g/L was achieved. The overall productivities of these two reactor systems were 0.38 g/(L-h) and 0.43 g/(L-h), respectively. This experiment successfully demonstrated that with the appropriate selection of polymer, solid-liquid TPPB systems were able to greatly enhance bioproductions associated with end product inhibition in terms of final product concentration and productivity. The ease of operation is also attractive compared to two liquid phase systems.</description>

   <description>Manipulations to cyclic nucleotide populations show considerable promise in the treatment of vasculopathies associated with luminal narrowing and PDE inhibition currently represents one of the most selective methods of clinically modifying levels of these second messengers.  Many cardiovascular diseases are associated with a change in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype, resulting in a hyperproliferative cell devoid of contractile properties. This cell has been defined as “synthetic/activated” and differs from the normal  “contractile/quiescent” VSMC in several aspects.  Previous investigations have established that phosphodiesterase 1C (PDE1C), a PDE not produced in contractile/quiescent VSMCs is upregulated, and the functionally dominant PDE in the presence of calcium in these cells.  This study looked to establish a role for PDE1C in synthetic/activated VSMCs as it relates to the management of VSMC phenotype.  Herein, we show that RNAi mediated knockdown of PDE1C decreased expression of phenotype-dependent markers in HASMCs including PDGF-alpha receptor, l-caldesmon, and TRPC1, while the expression of other markers, including PKG, vinculin, and beta-1 integrin were unaffected.  Treatment with PDE1C siRNA also reduced cell migration, proliferation, and the ability of HASMCs to bind extracellular matrix proteins.  These effects were mediated without any major changes in global cAMP levels.  Furthermore, a novel interaction between PDE1C and the TRPC cation channel was identified that may establish a role for PDE1C in calcium-cAMP mediation.  These findings establish an important role for PDE1C in the synthetic/activated HASMC, both phenotypically, and at the sub-cellular level.</description>

   <description>An integrated circuit can now contain more than one billion transistors. With&#xd;
increasing system integration and technology scaling, power and power-related issues&#xd;
have become the primary challenges of integrated circuit design. In this dissertation,&#xd;
techniques and algorithms, from system-level synthesis to emerging integration&#xd;
and device technologies, are proposed to address the power and power-induced thermal&#xd;
and reliability challenges of modern billion-transistor integrated circuit design.&#xd;
In Chapter 1, the challenges of semiconductor technology scaling are introduced.&#xd;
Chapter 2 reviews the related works. Chapter 3 focuses on the reliability optimization&#xd;
issue during system-level design. A reliable application-specic multiprocessor&#xd;
system-on-chip synthesis system is proposed, called TASR, which exploits redundancy&#xd;
and thermal-aware design planning to produce reliable and compact circuit designs.&#xd;
Chapter 4 introduces three-dimensional (3D) integration, a new integrated circuit&#xd;
fabrication and integration technology. Thermal issue is a primary concern of 3D integration.&#xd;
A 3D integrated circuit heat flow analytical framework is proposed in this&#xd;
chapter. Proactive, continuously-engaged hardware and operating system thermal&#xd;
management techniques are presented and evaluated which optimize system performance&#xd;
than state-of-the-art techniques while honoring the same temperature bound.&#xd;
Chapter 5 presents reconfigurable architecture design using single-electron tunneling&#xd;
transistor, an ultra-low-power nanometer-scale device. The proposed design has the &#xd;
potential to overcome the power and energy barriers for both high-performance computing&#xd;
and ultra-low-power embedded systems. Conclusions are drawn in Chapter 6.</description>

   <description>For over thirty years Afghanistan has been challenged by war, political and civil instability, mass displacement, human rights abuses, drought, and famine. It is not surprising that health and quality of life of vulnerable groups in this region are among the worst in the world. In general, women and children have had especially limited access to education and healthcare. The situation in Afghanistan is difficult, but by no means impossible and renewed international focus combined with shifting internal dynamics provide a real opportunity to change the trajectory of the country and lives of millions of Afghans. With regard to internal dynamics, the health and education of children, I believe, provide one of the greatest opportunities for Afghanistan to build a new and peaceful path in the twenty first century.&#xd;
At the heart of a successful development strategy in Afghanistan will be stitching together local capabilities and resources and tailoring projects to context. Afghan children present an ideal starting ground.  This thesis asks the question: how might children’s participation and the Child-to-Child approach to health education and community development be used effectively in Afghanistan? I analyze the possibilities and limitations of the Child-to-Child approach were it to be implemented in the traditional/Islamic context of Afghanistan. More broadly, I highlight external and internal forces that are affecting and will continue to shape future health intervention and development projects such as Child-to-Child in Afghanistan.&#xd;
I conclude that, at this time, Afghan children will receive adequate and long term health care (through initiatives such as Child-to-Child) only when essential and basic services/needs are met, geo-political conflicts between industrial nations over Afghanistan are resolved and future intervention programs are designed using culturally sensitive strategies not only to provide health services but also to address the underlying non-medical determinants of health related to Afghanistan’s development process.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-06 15:01:57.866</description>
   <description>Lisfranc injuries affect at least 1 out of every 55,000 people each year. Although they&#xd;
are rare foot injuries, their effects can be devastating. 20-40% of Lisfranc injuries are&#xd;
missed upon first presentation. This increases the number of poor outcomes, resulting in a disproportionate number of malpractice lawsuits and compensation claims.&#xd;
&#xd;
The Kingston Brace was designed to support an injured foot during a CT scan with the&#xd;
goal of providing the diagnosing physician with the best diagnostic information possible.&#xd;
&#xd;
A prototype was designed and built to support a variety of foot orientations in order to determine which orientation is optimal for Lisfranc joint CT scanning.&#xd;
&#xd;
Three fresh frozen cadaver feet were put through several experiments with the Brace.&#xd;
The 2D diagnostic quality of CT scans taken using the Kingston Brace was compared&#xd;
against that of CT scans using the existing protocol. The Kingston Brace allows for a&#xd;
greater visualization of the injured Lisfranc joint than the existing CT protocol. Lisfranc joint spreading was used as a measure of potential pain in injured patients. The joint spreading was minimal, suggesting that injured patients would not feel as much additional pain during imaging. Also, the adoption of the Kingston Brace resulted in no change in the morphological parameters resulting from more advanced 3D analysis.&#xd;
&#xd;
The experimentally determined optimal Kingston Brace orientation was found to be 9◦&#xd;
of plantarflexion and 13◦ of eversion. These orientations can be incorporated into the next generation of Kingston Brace design.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-07 15:45:19.052</description>
   <description>N-glycosylation is a metabolic process found in all three domains of life. It is the attachment of a polysaccharide glycan to asparagine (Asn) residues within the amino acid motif, Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr. In the archaeon, Methanococcus maripaludis, a tetrasaccharide glycan was isolated from purified flagella and its structure determined by mass spectrometry analysis. The linking sugar to the protein is surprisingly, N-acetylgalactosamine (β-GalNAc), with the next proximal sugar a derivative of N-acetylglucosamine (β-GlcNAc), being named β-GlcNAc3Ac, and the third sugar a derivative of N-acetylmannosamine (β-ManNAc), with an attached threonine residue on the C6 carbon (β-ManNAc3NAm). The terminal sugar is an unusual diglycoside of aldulose ((5S)-2-acetamido-2,4-dideoxy-5-O-methyl-α-L-erythro-hexos-5-ulo-1,5-pyranose). Previous genetic analyses identified the glycosyltransferases (GTs) responsible for the transfer of the second and third sugars of the glycan, as well as the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) which attaches the glycan to protein. Left unidentified were the first and fourth GTs, the flippase as well as any genes involved in glycan sugar biosynthesis and modification.  In this work, genes suspected to be involved in the biosynthesis of N-linked sugars, as well as those that might encode the missing GTs and flippase were targeted for in-frame deletion. Mutants with a deleted annotated GT gene (MMP1088) had a small decrease in flagellin molecular weight as determined by immunoblotting. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis confirmed that the N-linked glycan was missing the terminal sugar as well as the threonine found on the third sugar of wildtype cells. Mutants with a deleted gene annotated to be involved in acetamidino synthesis (a functional group that is present on the third sugar), also had a decrease in flagellin molecular weight. MS analysis determined that the N-linked glycan was missing the acetamidino group on the third sugar as well as its attached threonine, along with the terminal sugar. Both mutants were able to assemble functional flagella but had impaired motility compared to wildtype cells in mini-swarm agar. Deletions were also constructed in four other GT genes considered candidates in assembly of the linking sugar. However, none of these mutants had the expected decrease in flagellin molecular weight.  &#xd;
With the work done in this study, the glycosyl transferase that attaches the last sugar of the M. maripaludis N-linked assembly pathway has been identified as well as a gene involved in the biosynthesis and modification of the glycan sugars.</description>

   <description>The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between dietary patterns with diabetes and mortality risk from all-cause and cardiovascular disease while controlling for the confounding effects of fitness.  The secondary objective was to examine the combined effects of dietary patterns and fitness on chronic disease and mortality risk.  Participants consisted of 13,621 men and women from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study who completed a standardized medical examination and 3-day diet record between 1987 and 1999.  Reduced rank regression was used to identify dietary patterns that were predictive of unfavorable profiles of cholesterol, white blood cell count, glucose, mean arterial pressure, HDL-cholesterol, uric acid, triglycerides, and body mass index.  One primary dietary pattern emerged, which was labeled the “Unhealthy Eating Index”.  This pattern was characterized by a large consumption of processed meat, red meat, white potato products, non-whole grains, added fat, and a small consumption of non-citrus fruits.  After adjustment for covariates, the odds ratio for diabetes and the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality were 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 1.81-3.58) and 1.40 (1.02-1.91) in the highest quintile of the Unhealthy Eating Index when compared to the lowest quintile, respectively.  After controlling for fitness, these risk estimates were reduced by 51.6% and 55.0%.  The Unhealthy Eating Index was not a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality before or after controlling for fitness.  Examining the combined effects of dietary patterns and fitness revealed that both variables were independent predictors of diabetes (Ptrend &lt;0.0001), while fitness (Ptrend &lt;0.0001) but not unhealthy eating (Ptrend=0.071) significantly predicted all-cause mortality risk. These results suggest that both diet and fitness must be considered when studying disease.</description>

   <description>It was conjectured in the early 1950¡¯s that the empirical&#xd;
spectral distribution (ESD) of an $n \times n$ matrix whose entries&#xd;
are independent and identically  distributed with mean zero and&#xd;
variance one, normalized by a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$,&#xd;
converges to the uniform distribution over the unit disk on the&#xd;
complex plane, which is called the circular law. The goal of this&#xd;
thesis is to prove the so called Replacement Principle introduced by&#xd;
Tao and Vu which is a crucial step in their recent proof of the&#xd;
circular law in full generality. It gives a general criterion for&#xd;
the difference of the ESDs of two normalised random matrices&#xd;
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}A_n$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}B_n$ to converge to 0.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to constrain the fundamental hydrogeological processes of a large crystalline fractured rock watershed in the Canadian Shield. The fundamental hydrogeological processes of groundwater recharge, flow and discharge are examined individually as well as holistically using a revised conceptual model. The study area is the topographically-subdued Tay River watershed in eastern Ontario where a thin veneer of soil overlies Precambrian crystalline rocks and Paleozoic sediments. Spatial scales from local-scale (100s m2 to 1 km2) to watershed-scale (>100 km2) are examined. Recharge processes are defined using hydrogeological characterization, numerical simulation and isotopic, thermal and hydraulic responses to a snowmelt event. Soil thickness and bedrock transmissivity are highly heterogeneous at the local scale. Cold, 2H depleted snowmelt locally recharged the bedrock aquifer to depths of at least 20 m within two days. This rapid recharge process is localized to areas where the soil is very thin whereas slow recharge is likely widespread. The impact of lineaments on groundwater flow at the watershed-scale is examined using geomatic analysis, hydrogeological characterization, numerical simulation and fracture mapping. Lineaments are interpreted as structural features because the two principal lineament sets are oriented parallel to fracture and fault orientations. The fractured bedrock underlying lineaments generally consists of poorly connected zones of reduced permeability suggesting lineament can be barriers to recharge and flow in this setting. Natural conservative, radioactive, and thermal tracers are integrated with streamflow measurements and a steady-state advective model to delimit the discharge locations and quantify the discharge flux to lakes, wetlands, creeks and the Tay River. The groundwater discharge rate to most surface water bodies is low. Groundwater discharge is distributed across the watershed rather than localized around lineaments or zones of exposed brittle fractures. In the revised conceptual model, recharge is considered two separate processes, groundwater flow is compartmentalized and the discharge flux is considerably lower than porous media watersheds. This thesis provides a better understanding of fundamental hydrogeological processes in a large crystalline fractured rock watershed which impacts the sustainability of water resources and ecology.</description>

   <description>Regulation of expression of the intestinal actin-binding protein, villin, a marker of intestinal epithelial differentiation, is poorly understood.  Activation of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on sub-epithelial myofibroblasts stimulated the secretion of Wnt5a, while activation of the CaSR on intestinal epithelia increased expression of Ror2, a Wnt-family co-receptor.  Immunocytochemistry has localized Ror2 expression in the epithelia lining the small intestine from the crypt base to the villus tip.  The aim of this study was to determine whether Wnt5a binding Ror2 in intestinal epithelia stimulated transient increases in phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) which lead to increased expression of villin transcript and protein.  To examine Wnt5a-Ror2 regulation of villin expression, we transgenically overexpressed wild-type, truncated, or mutant Ror2 constructs in HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells and nontransformed fetally-derived human intestinal epithelial cells (HIECs), added conditioned media containing Wnt5a and measured changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, villin amplicons and protein expression by RT-PCR and Western blot techniques. Wnt5a addition caused a transient increase in pERK1/2, which was maximal at 10 min but diminished by 30 min. Transient transfection with a siRNA duplex against Ror2 diminished Ror2 amplicons and protein and reduced the extent of pERK1/2 activation.  Structure-function analysis revealed that deletion of the cysteine-rich, kringle, or tyrosine kinase domain or substitution mutations of tyrosine residues in the intracellular Ser/Thr-1 region of Ror2 prevented the Wnt5a-stimulation of pERK1/2.  Deletion of the intracellular proline and serine/threonine rich regions of Ror2 had no effect on Wnt5a-stimulation of pERK1/2 in HT29 cells.  Western blot analysis demonstrated that villin protein was increased by over-expression of wild-type Ror2 in HT-29 cells and HIECs in the presence of Wnt5a.  The increase in villin expression was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of MEK1&amp;2 and casein kinase 1, but not by PKC and p38 inhibitors.   Neither Wnt3a nor EGF addition increased villin protein.  This work suggested that stromal Wnt5a will stimulate pERK1/2 via the Ror2 tyrosine kinase domain to generate increased villin protein. These findings suggested that Ror2 homeostasis and Wnt5a interaction with Ror2 are important determinants of the regulation of villin expression in the intestine.</description>

   <title>The Role of Phosphodiesterases in Cyclic Nucleotide Compartmentation Across Different Pathways in the Adult Rat Ventricular Myocyte</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-15 11:01:49.571</description>
   <description>In cardiac myocytes, multiple receptor mediated signalling pathways converge on cyclic nucleotide production.  These second messengers act to achieve changes in cellular function.  Despite this, each signalling molecule and receptor can achieve distinct sub-cellular effects.  This has led to the theory of cyclic nucleotide compartmentation, which has been postulated to be mediated by phosphodiesterases (PDEs).  Research in this field has focused on compartmentation using β-adrenergic stimulation.  As an extension of this work, we investigated the effects of two agonists, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 10 nM) and forskolin (FSK; 30 nM), on various cellular parameters in the presence of either cilostamide (1 µM) a selective PDE3 inhibitor, or Ro 20-1724 (10 µM) a selective PDE4 inhibitor.  In myocytes treated with PGE2, unloaded cell shortening and intracellular calcium transients exhibited significantly different (p&lt;0.05) values of 147 ± 10% and 138 ± 5% of pre-treatment (t=0) values, respectively, in the presence of PGE2 and Ro 20-1724 (all n=5).  However, values were not significantly different in cells pre-treated with cilostamide.  Conversely, FSK resulted in significant increases of 153 ± 9% (n=5; P>0.05) and 189 ± 20% (n=5; P>0.05) of t=0 in cells treated with cilostamide and Ro 20-1724, respectively.  PGE2 enhanced ICa,L was not altered using either PDE inhibitor.  However, with FSK as an agonist, a significant increase in peak ICa,L from -6.0 ± 0.8 pA/pF to -7.7 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n=5; P>0.05) was observed in cells pre-treated with Ro 20-1724.  SR calcium loading was also increased, but only in cells pre-treated with Ro 20-1724, with values of 127 ± 11%  and 156 ± 47% of t=0 (n=5) for FSK and PGE2, respectively.  Our results demonstrate that a unique pattern of regulation exists for PGE2 and that it is different from what was found previously with isoproterenol.  We have shown that this is achieved by functionally localizing PDEs to distinct compartments.  Specifically, PDE4 is localized at the SR, PDE3 at the sarcomere, and a combination of both at the calcium channel.  However, our ICa,L results also indicate that the location of the receptor and adenylate cyclases must be considered relevant to compartmentalizing the cAMP signal.</description>

   <title>Between Virtue and Vice: Moral Worth for the Rest of Us</title>

   <description>Most of us fall short of virtue—we are, at various times, weak-willed, selfish, self-absorbed, hypocritical, morally complacent, cowardly, and self-deceived. But most of us are not vicious, either. In this dissertation I argue that the actions of flawed, morally imperfect agents can be as praiseworthy as the actions of more perfectly virtuous people. &#xd;
The first, introductory chapter explains my account of moral worth, which depends on the assessment of an agent’s deliberative outlook in acting. In the second chapter, I argue that being praiseworthy on every possible occasion is not a precondition for being praiseworthy on any particular occasion. This may seem obvious, but it is also inconsistent with a common interpretation of the nature of virtue.&#xd;
The third chapter argues that someone’s actions can be morally worthy despite displaying a failure of practical rationality quite similar to weakness of will, or akrasia. By exploring cases of so-called inverse akrasia, I argue that sometimes, an agent can be praised for acting in ways that he himself believes are morally wrong, and that while these actions display serious failures of practical reason, they can still be both done for a good reasons and deserving of praise.&#xd;
The fourth chapter explores the moral status of hypocrisy. I reject the standard interpretation of hypocrites as blameworthy manipulative deceivers, and argue instead that they are people who misdirect their ethical attention by caring too much about their image for having certain values, and not enough about the values themselves. &#xd;
The second, third, and fourth chapters draw a close connection between moral imperfection and failures of self-knowledge. The fifth and final chapter therefore considers the nature of such failures of self-knowledge by exploring the moral significance of self-deception. I argue that, in a central range of cases, it is impossible to be self-deceived about the content of one’s own mind. Instead, I argue that the morally relevant form of self-deception is a failure of self-assessment. This has important implications for our understanding of moral development, since it means that such development centrally involves the cultivation of a specific kind of self-knowledge.</description>

   <description>This dissertation explores and defends a form of perfectionism, which I call ‘public value perfectionism’. It is an approach that emerges from Sen’s capability critique of Rawls’s doctrine of primary goods and I argue that this form of perfectionism is not only compatible with, but also demanded by, a general defence of liberal neutrality. It is designed to fulfill a demand of justice that is beyond the reach of neutralist tools, yet it belongs within a larger neutralist framework in virtue of being justified by the same types of reasons that support neutralism. One of the main justifications for state neutrality is that it can serve as a means to remove or reduce disadvantage imposed on vulnerable groups. I will argue that in the case of disability limited state perfectionism can serve as a means toward that same goal.&#xd;
    The series of arguments that I make to defend public value perfectionism concern issues relevant to debates about neutrality and perfectionism, the metric of advantage, justice and disability, and health resource rationing. These issues each play a role in the argument I develop, which states, simplifying somewhat, that in order for society to make defensible rationing decisions about social spending that aims to reduce disability, we need an approach to advantage—i.e., public value perfectionism—that contains important elements of perfectionism and yet is grounded on neutralist considerations.</description>

   <description>The remediation of soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is endorsed by environmental protection agencies worldwide. Recent studies demonstrated the removal of these contaminants from soil utilizing polymer beads, with subsequent PAH release and degradation in solid-liquid two phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs). Although such a process was successful, significant mass transport limitations involving PAH release from the polymers hampered productivity. The current work examined the possibility of applying sonication in solid-liquid partitioning systems to enhance delivery and degradation of PAHs. &#xd;
&#xd;
	Small scale physical testing revealed delivery rates of PAHs from Desmopan, increased by 5 fold under intermittent sonication relative to non-sonicated conditions. Enhancements were also displayed as shifts to higher release equilibria under sonicated conditions, agreeing with sonochemistry concepts. Improvements were demonstrated across a range of polymers, suggesting that sonication could enhance PAH release with any polymers deemed feasible for environmental applications. A PAH-degrading microbial consortium was enriched, and it was demonstrated that sonication also improved the rate of phenanthrene degradation delivered from Desmopan by four times, confirming transport improvements while minimizing cellular inactivation effects. 	&#xd;
&#xd;
	A mass transport analysis showed that without sonication, delivery of PAHs was restricted by the external resistance at the solid-liquid interface. Ultrasound was shown to enhance both external and internal transport properties, allowing rates not achievable through increased liquid mixing. Diffusivities quantified with and without ultrasound decreased as a function of permeant molecular size. Additionally, partitioning coefficients under sonicated and non-sonicated conditions decreased with PAH molecular size. Finally, an examination of permeant property data demonstrated that polarizability was the best descriptor of thermodynamic and transport behaviour in solid-liquid systems. &#xd;
&#xd;
	The possibility of inducing equivalent improvements was investigated in a bench scale TPPB, in which sonic exposure improved degradation rates of phenanthrene by 2.7 fold when delivered from Desmopan. A window of on/off operation for ultrasonic cycling was also demonstrated, providing potential for optimizing sonication via rational selection of exposure times. DNA analysis also revealed that the consortium composition was maintained in the presence of sonication and also demonstrated that the consortium was comprised of bacteria belonging to the Pandoraea, Sphingobium, and Pseudoxanthomonas genera.</description>

   <description>Recent analyses of creativity in the North American economy have underscored the importance of city-regions in the generation of economic dynamism. These studies have been concerned with at least two principal assertions. The first assertion is that the social dynamics of city-regions constitute the foundations of economic success. The second assertion is that the distribution of human capital (talent) is a crucial element in regional economic prosperity; yet the distribution of human capital across cities is uneven. Therefore, the question emerges: what factors influence the locational choices of talented individuals? In recent years, this question has received considerable scholarly attention. This thesis has identified two existing gaps within this field of inquiry. Conspicuously absent from studies in this area are theoretical insights offered by cultural geographers in the field of whiteness and race. Economic geographers have created an essentialized reading of racial diversity in the economic performance of city-regions. Moreover, work in this area has been constrained by a quantitative focus and a lack of empirical evidence. Accordingly, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a more nuanced understanding of how social processes and institutions underlie and are shaped by the economic performance of city-regions. This is achieved by drawing on insights from an empirical study of 44 semi-structured interviews with academic talent in the City of Kingston, Ontario and 12 interviews with community insiders. The results on the one hand reveal complex dynamics linked to why academics live in particular places, but on the other hand point to one overriding explanation for why academics locate where they do: namely, academics are attracted to Kingston, first and foremost, because of academic jobs, not urban amenities or other characteristics of place.</description>

   <description>A Barkhausen noise (BN) testing system was developed for the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of residual stresses in CANDU reactor feeder pipes. The system consists of a four-channel arbitrary waveform flux control system (FCS), and the spring-loaded tetrapole prototype (SL4P) BN probe. The combination of the FCS and SL4P was shown to provide repeatable BN measurements on feeder pipe samples, with variations in air gaps between the SL4P poles and the sample from 0.43 mm to 1.29 mm, and typical pickup coil coupling uncertainties for the total BN energy from ±2% to ±7%. Precision for elastic strain estimation in feeder pipes was found to be between ±7 MPa and ±9 MPa in tension, depending on the excitation field configuration, and negligible in compression. Modelling of the BN penetration depth as a function of the excitation field was used to estimate the BN penetration depth between 5 μm at 300 kHz to a maximum of 500 μm at 3 kHz. The modelling, engineering, and procedures developed for this BN testing system provide an improved basis for the future advancement of BN testing, and ferromagnetic NDE in general.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, English) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-07 13:23:15.868</description>
   <description>Focusing on the work of Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, and Mina Loy, this thesis argues that late nineteenth-century decorative art had a profound influence on American modernist poetry. Despite the fact that many modernist artists and critics actively disavowed any decorative influence, I argue that a decorative ethos lives on in modernist poetry. Many of the aesthetic features that we associate with modernist poetics (such as figurative abstraction, spatial form, and fragmentation) actually owe a debt to nineteenth-century decorative theories and practices. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first chapter provides an historical and theoretical context for these poets' ambivalent engagement with decorative art, and will consider some of the unconscious ideologies that shape the tensions and anxieties that define this inter-art relationship. In my second chapter, I argue that the gaudy interiority of Stevens' early poetry is influenced by Aestheticism's material culture of decoration. Rather than perpetuate the critical model of Stevens as a retiring dandy aesthete, however, my analysis reveals the ways that his poetry both evokes and disrupts Aestheticism's decorative ideals by opening up his verse to the imperatives of social reality. The third chapter argues that Marianne Moore turns to the logic and rhetoric of evolution as a basis for legitimating what she perceived as the ornamental aspects of her poetry, including descriptive detail, rhetorical complexity, and graphic patterning. She does so in order to prove the social utility of her style, which might otherwise be deemed frivolous or effeminate. The fourth and final chapter considers Mina Loy's poetics of fragmentation and decomposition in light of nineteenth-century decorative theory and practice. Like Charles Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde, who emulated the ideal of the modern artist as rag-picker/decorator, Loy recuperates the aesthetic value of broken and discarded materials by submitting them to decorative techniques. &#xd;
&#xd;
The influence of decorative art on American modernist poetry has long been neglected in the scholarship. This study seeks to fill this critical gap and aligns itself with the general effort in modernist studies today to expand and redefine new social, theoretical and cultural modernities previously ignored or suppressed in twentieth-century criticism.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-23 12:57:10.248</description>
   <description>Carbon-carbon bond formation is one of the most important reactions in organic chemistry, and the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction has become a forerunner in this area.  Considerable research has been directed at the mechanistic aspects and synthetic utility of the reaction; however, little attention has been given to the formation of the putative PdL2 catalysts.  Due to their high reactivities, these catalysts are typically difficult to store and therefore are often generated in situ in unknown yields and at unknown rates via any number of available palladium precursors.  This thesis describes research directed towards determining the optimum conditions to quantitatively generate compounds of the type Pd(0)Ln (L = PMePh2, PPh3, PCy3, PMeBut2, PBut3, dppe, dppp, dppf) from Pd(h5-C5H5)(h3-1-Ph-C3H4).  Pd(h5-C5H5)(h3-1-Ph-C3H4) has been found to be a superior precursor for synthesizing catalytically active PdL2 compounds due to its ease in handling and reactivity with tertiary phosphines.&#xd;
Furthermore, investigations into the role of water in the transmetallation step of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction are presented.  The research indicates that water is necessary to effect the transmetallation step when coupling [NBu4][PhBF3] with 4-bromotoluene in toluene; however, the amount of water above one equivalent has no significant effect on the rate or yield of the reaction.</description>

   <description>It is well known that surface water waves interact with  fluid mud on the sea bed. Wave mud interaction results in high wave energy dissipation and mud mass transport. This kind of wave energy dissipation, which generally is much more significant than wave dissipation due to bottom friction, should be considered in the simulation of wave evolution and transformation in muddy coastal environments. &#xd;
In this research, a two-dimensional horizontal wave propagation and morphodynamic model for muddy coasts was developed.  The model can be applied on a general three dimensional bathymetry of a soft muddy coast to calculate wave damping, fluid mud transport and resulting bathymetry change under wave action.  In addition to the effect of wave-mud interaction on wave propagation, the dissipation due to wave-mud interaction was also implemented in SWAN (a third generation numerical model for Simulating WAves Nearshore) using a multilayered wave mud interaction model. These two models combined can be used for generation and propagation of waves in muddy coastal areas. The nonlinear constitutive equations of the visco-elastic-plastic model are adopted for the rheological behavior of fluid mud in this research.&#xd;
The results of the numerical model are compared against a series of wave-basin experiments, wave flume experiments and field observations.  Comparisons between the simulated results with the both field and laboratory data reveal the capability of the proposed model to predict the wave transformation and mud mass transport.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-26 10:59:39.956</description>
   <description>Background:  Injury and obesity are two of the leading public health problems in youth around the world. To reduce the burden of obesity, efforts are underway to increase physical activity participation; however, physical activity is also the leading cause of injury in youth.  Recovery from injury is also important as long periods away from regular activity can have major effects on the health of youth. &#xd;
Objectives: This thesis is in manuscript format. The objective of the first manuscript was to determine whether relationships between physical activity and physical activity injuries are modified by BMI status in Canadian youth. The objective of the second manuscript was to examine the effect of BMI status on the time to recovery within youth who have suffered an injury. &#xd;
Methods:  Data were obtained from the 2006 and 2002 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) surveys. The 2006 Canadian HBSC was a nationally representative survey of 9672 youth in grades 6 through 10 from across Canada. The 2002 Canadian HBSC was an analogous survey of 7235 youth, of which approximately 50% experienced a medically treated injury. Analyses were driven by theory, and considered relationships among the major variables. &#xd;
Results:  In manuscript 1, cross-sectional analyses indicated that those who reported high levels of physical activity experienced greater risks for physical activity injury in &#xd;
comparison to those with low levels of activity. BMI status was not identified as an effect modifier in any analyses. In manuscript 2, recovery for youth who were obese and suffered a combined injury (broken bone and strain/sprain) were longer than recovery times for normal weight youth.  Times to recovery for obese youth were not significantly elevated for broken bones and sprain/strains. &#xd;
Conclusions: Physical activity participation relates to injury experiences in a consistent manner across BMI groups. Special safety precautions are not justified for obese youth in physical activity programs.  BMI status was found to influence times for injury recovery.  These are important clinical results that demonstrate that obesity may have a role in the osteoarticular health of youth and should be considered as a factor in treatment plans.</description>

   <title>Causal Uncertainty in Social Interactions: The Impact of Interpersonal Expectations and Uncertainty Reduction on Liking</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-24 15:13:51.847</description>
   <description>High causally uncertain (CU) individuals experience lingering doubts about their ability to determine the causes of social events (Weary &amp; Edwards, 1994). Furthermore, these people tend to perceive their interactions and conversational partners more negatively (Boucher &amp; Jacobson, 2009). However, the reasons for these negative reactions remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the current set of studies was to explore two possible explanations for these reactions. Specifically, in three studies, I examined if insufficient uncertainty reduction or negative interpersonal expectations mediate the relationship between causal uncertainty and liking for a recent acquaintance. In Study 1 (N = 114), participants engaged in a brief unstructured dyadic conversation, whereas in Study 2 (N = 176), they engaged in three conversations with different partners. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 220), I examined the effects of temporarily activating causal uncertainty beliefs during initial interactions.&#xd;
As predicted, causal uncertainty was negatively associated with liking and uncertainty reduction. In Studies 1 and 2, high CU participants reported more uncertainty about themselves and their partner, and less liking than did low CU participants. Although chronic levels of causal uncertainty in Study 3 were not associated with liking or uncertainty reduction, participants who reported more current feelings of uncertainty also reported more uncertainty about themselves and their partner, and less liking. More importantly, uncertainty reduction fully mediated the effect of causal uncertainty on liking in Study 1 and partially mediated the effect of current uncertainty feelings on liking in Study 3. Therefore, high CU people’s negative social perceptions appear to stem, at least in part, from an inability to reduce their social uncertainty during initial interactions.&#xd;
	In contrast, the relationship between causal uncertainty and interpersonal expectations remains unclear. Although causal uncertainty (as well as current uncertainty feelings) in Studies 1 and 3 were not associated with negative interpersonal expectations, high CU participants in Study 2 did report more negative expectations for their first conversation relative to low CU participants. Furthermore, although causal uncertainty was positively related to rejection sensitivity, rejection sensitivity was unable to account for the causal uncertainty effects on liking.</description>

   <description>The advancement in computing in the last three decades has introduced many devices in our daily lives including personal computers, laptops, cellular devices and many more. The data we need for our processing needs is scattered among these devices. The availability of all the scattered data in the devices in use associated to an individual user as one is achieved in a Personal Information Environment. Data recharging is a technique used to achieve a Personal Information Environment for an individual user using data replication.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose a data recharging scheme for an individual user’s Personal Information Environment. We study the data availability to a user by conducting a simulation using the data recharging algorithm. This data recharging approach is achieved by using master-slave data replication technique.</description>

   <description>Numerous studies have identified that elevated plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are an emerging risk factor for a variety of atherothrombotic disorders. Apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], the unique glycoprotein component of Lp(a), consists of tandem repeats of a plasminogen kringle (K) IV-like domain, followed by sequences homologous to the plasminogen KV and protease domains. Apo(a)/Lp(a) has been consistently shown to regulate endothelial function and inhibit plasminogen activation. In the present study, we have demonstrated that apo(a), signaling via integrin alphaVbeta3, is the functional unit in Lp(a) to stimulate in vitro endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration, and activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in cultured ECs. Both apo(a) and Lp(a) have also been shown to reduce the levels of active and total transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in cultured EC medium in an integrin alphaVbeta3–dependent manner. Despite the stimulatory effects of apo(a) on EC proliferation and migration, we have further confirmed an inhibitory effect of apo(a) on EC in vitro angiogenesis using a fibrin gel tube formation assay. We have provided evidence proving apo(a) inhibits angiogenesis through inhibition of plasminogen activation, and this inhibitory effect is dependent on the presence of apo(a) KV domain. Lastly, apo(a) is shown to reduce the protein levels of annexin A2 and S100A10 in ECs, which implies another potential mechanism by which apo(a)/Lp(a) could impair plasminogen activation on cell surface. In summary, we have discovered the first complete outside-in signaling pathway elicited by apo(a)/Lp(a) in ECs and have built up a connection between the ability of apo(a) to inhibit plasminogen activation and its inhibition of angiogenesis.</description>

   <description>Steps on surfaces have long been explored for their own sake, and exploited as growth&#xd;
mediators. However, another type of linear surface defect - the domain boundary - has been largely neglected. Here we introduce domain boundaries of the 5x5 dimer-adatom-stacking fault reconstruction, explore their properties and demonstrate that they too can be used to mediate growth in a useful manner.&#xd;
&#xd;
When a thin layer of Ge is grown on Si(111) lattice strain induces the overlayer to reconstruct as Ge5x5.  Using solid phase epitaxy, many domains of 5x5 can be grown.  The domain interiors have excellent order, and with careful annealing, the boundaries that separate them are straight and uniform. Well-ordered boundaries propagate along the two high symmetry directions &lt;1 -1> or &lt;1 1> and are called A-type or B-type respectively. Boundaries of the second type are unique to Ge5x5. Registration with the substrate restricts the misfit between domains to discrete possibilities which are labeled according to a modified version of the system used for domain boundaries of Si(111)7x7.  The distribution of observed boundary types is strongly peaked and reﬂects the relative energies of boundaries of different character. The expanded labeling scheme can be used to sketch the kinetic processes which lead to the distribution peaks. The dominant boundary by far is the one known as B[-2 2], which accounts for almost half of all observed boundaries.  The atomic structure for this type of boundary has been established as a truncated 7x7 unit cell. Thus, these boundaries are linear arrays of quasi-7x7 embedded in a sea of 5x5.&#xd;
&#xd;
On the Si(111)7x7 surface the Group 13 elements, when deposited at sub-ML coverages and low temperatures, form magic clusters.  The perfect uniformity and precise registration that earns them the moniker ‘magic’ make these clusters unusual among self-organized atomic scale objects. The clusters that form on 5x5 lack the uniformity of their counterparts on 7x7. However, with many domains, deposited In or Ga segregate to the quasi-7x7 B[-2 2] boundaries and there form magic clusters. The boundary thus acts as a template for growing straight lines of precisely spaced, atomically identical, nanoscale clusters.</description>

   <title>Towards a Relational and Dynamic Perspective of Leadership</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-05 17:20:43.173</description>
   <description>This dissertation is composed of three manuscripts, all of which focus on the role of followers in leadership.  Manuscript 1 investigates followers’ preferences for leader characteristics.  Guided by social identity theory and the similarity-attraction paradigm, followers’ preferences were examined using a vignette-type approach.  The results show that follower self-worth moderated the relationship between leader-follower similarity and follower preference for leader characteristics.  Under conditions of low self-worth, followers preferred leaders whose characteristics were opposite from their own; conversely, under conditions of high self-worth, followers preferred leaders whose characteristics were similar to their own.  Despite the importance of leaders, attention is drawn towards followers’ cognitions about themselves.&#xd;
	Manuscript 2 argues that followers are equal exchange partners with their leaders, thus actively contributing to the nature of their relationships with their leader.  Consistent with social exchange theory, there was a significant relationship between followers’ pro-social behaviors associated with secure attachment style and conscientiousness and leaders’ pro-social behaviors such as helping and trust.  In addition, anti-social follower behaviors begat anti-social leader behaviors; followers’ fearful attachment style predicted abusive supervisory behaviors.  These findings contrast leader-centric notions, and they emphasize that followers can participate in determining the nature of their relationships with leaders.&#xd;
	Manuscript 3 evaluates bidirectional influence between leaders and followers on three work values: humanistic beliefs, organizational beliefs, and work ethic.  Although there was no support for upward influence, the short-term nature of the study may have limited the opportunity for sequential bidirectional influence to occur.  There was, however, a significant downward influence upon followers’ organizational beliefs.  These results suggest that leader influence may be particularly effective, or followers may be particularly vulnerable to leader influence on some dimensions (e.g., the importance of the collective) versus others (e.g., individualism at work, and the extent to which work fulfills people).  &#xd;
	Finally, in the general discussion, directions for future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>Knee osteoarthritis is a disease that affects nearly 40% of the global population over the age of seventy.  It is believed that the incidence and progression of osteoarthritis can be partially attributed to changes in mechanical joint loading.  Consequently, changes in lower-limb joint moments are important outcome measures for its treatment and prevention.   The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of four different anatomic joint models on the detection of changes in lower-limb joint moments due to knee osteoarthritis. &#xd;
&#xd;
Moments during gait were calculated for 44 subjects with moderate osteoarthritis and 44 asymptomatic subjects, then expressed using four joint models: Joint Coordinate System, Plane of Progression, Distal, and Proximal.  Discrete peak measures and principal component scores were compared between groups. &#xd;
&#xd;
Hip adduction magnitude, knee adduction magnitude, peak early-stance knee internal rotation, and peak ankle plantarflexion moments were different between groups regardless of joint model.  Differences detected using principal component analysis were less sensitive to the choice of joint model. Results support adoption of the Joint Coordinate System as a standard for joint moment expression due to its clinical relevance and ability to detect differences due to moderate knee osteoarthritis.</description>

   <description>Compared with healthy controls, subjects with medial knee osteoarthritis walk using similar kinematics but greater activation of knee-spanning muscles, especially on the lateral side of the knee (furthest from centerline of the body).  Although muscle forces generally compress the knee joint, it had been speculated that this specific activation pattern actually reduces compressive loads across the medial (closest to centerline) side of the knee where osteoarthritis is most common.  It is not feasible to measure intra-articular contact forces in biological human knee joints.  Therefore, a musculoskeletal simulation was developed to estimate the effect of elevated activation on knee contact forces. &#xd;
A generic musculoskeletal model was adapted to account for subject-specific frontal-plane alignment of the knee joint, and modified to isolate the medial and lateral components of the compressive knee contact load.   The model’s predictions were validated using in vivo data obtained from a subject with an instrumented knee prosthesis.  Subsequently, the model was used to demonstrate that elevated muscle activation, as found in osteoarthritis subjects, does not protect against harmful medial loads, but actually contribute to an increase in peak load shortly after heel-strike.  Since osteoarthritis subjects did not appear to adopt a protective gait pattern, the second half of the dissertation was devoted to the evaluation of a clinical device that is known to reduce medial loads during gait: the knee unloader brace.&#xd;
To accomplish medial unloading, braces apply a frontal plane abduction moment to the knee which, if large enough, would pry open the medial contact surfaces.  A novel method was developed to non-invasively compute the abduction moment applied by the brace to each subject’s leg using a mechanical stiffness calibration.  The computed brace moment was incorporated into the musculoskeletal model in order to quantify relative contributions of muscle forces, inverse dynamic joint loads, and the applied brace load in reducing medial contact forces for treatment of medial knee osteoarthritis.  The model revealed that kinematic, muscular, and inverse dynamic changes were dominated by the large applied brace moment.  The medial unloading effect of knee braces could be enhanced by reducing external and muscle forces through gait modification.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2009-07-30 15:13:59.116</description>
   <description>The Issue: The integration of evidence into practice is a complex process. Facilitation is a strategy that may assist practitioners with enhancing evidence uptake in nursing practice. However, the concept is not well understood from a front-line nursing perspective. &#xd;
&#xd;
Thesis Objectives: To describe facilitation in moving evidence into nursing practice and determine the nature of the facilitator role and the process of facilitation in theory and from actual experience to develop a conceptual framework to guide practitioners.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: A descriptive design utilizing mixed methods was employed:  1) Focused review of the literature that synthesized the current state of knowledge on facilitation as role and process in the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) in nursing. 2) Case audit and focus group interview with facilitators of cases involved in adapting guidelines and planning for implementation. &#xd;
A provisional framework was developed based on the literature review which guided the case audit and focus group interview. The data from the literature was integrated with data from those actively involved in facilitation to refine the framework. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results:&#xd;
Focused literature review: A final set of 39 papers were identified. Facilitation is described as supporting and enabling practitioners to improve practice through evidence implementation. Certain aspects of the role and the strategies being employed to promote change are evident. Current literature reveals that facilitation is viewed as an individual role as well as a process involving individuals and groups.&#xd;
&#xd;
Case audit and focus group interview: Forty-six discrete, practical facilitation activities discovered in the literature were in large part found as occurring within the cases. An additional 5 new, distinct activities related to facilitation were found in the case documentation. Findings suggest that facilitation is a multifaceted process and a team effort. Communication and relationship-building are key elements.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: The transparency and detail displayed in the revised framework may contribute to systematically developing, implementing, and testing facilitation interventions in nursing contexts. Facilitation is clearly an important strategy to advance EBP and the improved understanding of facilitation offered in this thesis provides a guiding framework for future investigations of evidence implementation where facilitation is a key element.&#xd;

   <description>Low temperature cleavage fracture behaviour was investigated using four experimental microalloyed bainitic plate steels. The four plate samples were produced by different thermomechanical processing (TMP) schedules and had yield strengths in the range 540 - 670 MPa.&#xd;
Microstructures were characterized by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD). Quantitative data was obtained for prior austenite grain (PAG) size, volume fractions of two bainite types (conventional bainite and acicular ferrite) and EBSD 15° domain size. Charpy impact tests (using two notch orientations) were carried out over a range of temperatures. Cleavage facet sizes were measured on -196°C Charpy samples.&#xd;
The range of TMP schedules produced variations in PAG width, type of bainite and 15° domain size. The effects of these three microstructural features on cleavage crack propagation are discussed. Results indicate that the microstructures are controlled by i) deformation below TNR and ii) accelerated cooling rate. Domain structure reflects TMP. There is no clear correlation between domain size and cleavage facet size.</description>

   <description>Constrained codes have been used in data storage systems, such as magnetic tapes,&#xd;
CD’s and DVD’s, in order to reduce the likelihood of errors by predictable noise.&#xd;
The study of constrained codes is based on the study of sofic shifts, which are sets of&#xd;
bi-infinite sequences that can be presented using labeled directed graphs called presentations. In this thesis, we will primarily focus on two classes of sofic shifts, namely shifts of finite type (SFT’s) and periodic-finite-type shifts (PFT’s), and examine their properties.&#xd;
&#xd;
We first consider Shannon covers of sofic shifts. A Shannon cover of a sofic shift&#xd;
is a deterministic presentation with the smallest number of vertices among all deterministic presentations of the shift. Indeed, a Shannon cover is used as a canonical presentation of a sofic shift, and furthermore, it is used when computing the capacity of the shift or when constructing a finite-state encoder. We follow an algorithm by Crochemore, Mignosi and Restivo which constructs a deterministic presentation of&#xd;
an SFT and we see how to derive a Shannon cover from the presentation under their&#xd;
algorithm. Furthermore, as a method to determine whether a given deterministic&#xd;
presentation is a Shannon cover of a sofic shift, we will provide, based on research by&#xd;
Jonoska, a sufficient condition for a given presentation to have the smallest number&#xd;
of vertices among all presentations of the shift.&#xd;
&#xd;
We then move our focus towards PFT’s, and investigate new properties of PFT’s from various perspectives. We define three types of periods that can be associated with a PFT and do pairwise comparisons between them. Also, we consider the zeta function of a PFT, which is a generating function for the number of periodic sequences in the PFT, and present a simple formula to compute the zeta function of a PFT.</description>

   <description>Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is an important species in the expansion of aquaculture, which supplements strained natural fish stocks worldwide. Although nitrogen accumulation in aquaculture has been documented as hazardous, recent studies have highlighted its potential to positively affect fish growth. The current study investigates the growth and oxygen consumption of juvenile Nile tilapia exposed to high (sub-lethal) and low levels of total water ammonia (TAmm). &#xd;
	The first series of experiments aimed to determine the effects of high TAmm toxicity on indicators of metabolic rate and whole-body growth. Results of non-acclimation exposures to ammonia suggest that high levels of TAmm (1000, 2000 and 4000 μM) negatively affect oxygen consumption and ventilation rates, with reduced respiratory efficiency at 4000 μM. This effect on oxygen consumption was not present after a 48hr acclimation period to TAmm concentrations. Tilapia grown under the TAmm treatment conditions had significantly reduced weight and length after 84 days at concentrations of 2000 and 4000 μM. &#xd;
	The second series of experiments investigated metabolic rate and growth under conditions of low-level TAmm (75, 150, 300, 600, 1200 and 2400 μM) to determine potential positive effects on growth. The results of these experiments indicated that oxygen consumption was reduced in non-acclimated fish at concentrations of 75, 150 and 300 μM, which were therefore examined in subsequent growth experiments. This oxygen consumption reduction was not present after 48hrs of ammonia acclimation. Tilapia grown at low TAmm (≤300 μM) did not exhibit significant differences in weight, length, condition factor or specific growth rate within the 56-day experiment. &#xd;
	This study demonstrates that high levels of TAmm significantly impair tilapia whole-body growth. Furthermore, low levels of TAmm (≤300 μM) do not appear to affect growth. In both series, an initial reduction in metabolic rate was noted in non-acclimated fish, but was not present after 48hr TAmm acclimation. While fish “recovered” from initial effects of high TAmm on oxygen consumption and ventilation, significant negative effects on growth were noted. This study suggests that tilapia adapt to the initial effects of TAmm through a process that, at high levels, is energetically costly and compromises growth.</description>

   <description>A multi-hop, amplify-and-forward (AF), cooperative diversity system with K relays&#xd;
is studied. An accurate approximate expression for the symbol-error-rate (SER) is&#xd;
derived for the multi-hop system. Also, a lower bound for the outage probability of the&#xd;
system, that is tight throughout nearly the entire signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range,&#xd;
is presented. Neither an SER expression nor an outage probability expression had&#xd;
previously been reported in the literature for the multi-hop system. To assist in the&#xd;
derivation of the SER expression, the cumulative density function (CDF), probability&#xd;
density function (PDF), and moment generating function (MGF) are found for the&#xd;
random variable (RV), Z = X Y / (X + Y + c), where X and Y are RVs which have&#xd;
PDFs that are sums of terms of the form x^n exp(-b x). It is shown that with the CDF,&#xd;
PDF, and MGF of this type of RV, it is possible to derive an expression for the SER&#xd;
of the multi-hop system for several important scenarios with respect to what type&#xd;
of fading is present in the channels of the system. To assist in the derivation of the&#xd;
lower bound of the outage probability, the CDF is found for an interesting new RV,&#xd;
presented in a recursive formula, that is used to represent the upper bound of the&#xd;
instantaneous end-to-end SNR of the multi-hop system. These mathematical results&#xd;
are useful beyond the scope of the multi-hop system researched in this thesis. Also,&#xd;
many of the results found in this thesis for the previously-scarcely-studied multi-&#xd;
hop sytem are shown to be generalizations of results that had been found for the&#xd;
previously-often-studied two-hop, AF, cooperative diversity system with K relays.</description>

   <description>Given the importance placed on participation and empowerment in global health initiatives, the perspective of young people with disabilities has emerged as a vital field of study.  This critical ethnographic study gained insight into the perspectives of adolescents with disabilities aged 12 to 18 years who were affiliated with a community-based rehabilitation program in the urban slums of North India.  The purpose of this research was to highlight the collective voices of adolescents with disabilities about their rehabilitation challenges, to explore how the culture influenced the rehabilitation challenges faced by adolescents, and to support collaborative work among adolescents with and without disabilities that would inform organizational activities.  Fieldwork was conducted from January to May 2005 and October 2006 to March 2007 with 21 adolescents with disabilities, 11 adolescents without disability, and 10 community-based rehabilitation team members.  Multiple data collection methods were utilized to ensure that participants could comfortably express their views.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A conceptual framework called the ‘Adolescent Group Empowerment Pyramid’ was developed that illustrates one process for empowering adolescents with disabilities and their peers without disabilities within a community setting.  Group empowerment involves adolescents with disabilities working towards assuming greater ownership over their rehabilitation while collaborating with their peers.  The ‘group’ concept provided the foundation for the framework because adolescents viewed the group setting as enjoyable and effective.  Three areas associated with meaningful group empowerment included: group participation, group demonstration, and group recognition.  Three external support factors and ten areas for nurturing the group empowerment process are also described.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Participants promoted a more liberal approach to empowering adolescents that embraced the notion of collaboration (rather than competition), interdependence (rather than independence), shared benefits (rather than individual gain), and the interaction of community groups.  This approach promotes a harmonious balance between empowerment and the community, rather than an aggressive approach to gaining power over or from other marginalized individuals.  Group empowerment, achieved through enabling group-centered occupations, encourages adolescents to collectively work for social and occupational justice.  To ensure the sustainability of community-based rehabilitation initiatives, programs must be aware of personally meaningful factors that empower and maintain the interest of the target population.</description>

   <description>Tracking multiple targets in a high cluttered environment where multiple receivers are used is a challenging task due to the high level of false alarms and uncertainty in the track hypothesis. The multi-static active sonar scenario is an example for such systems where multiple source-receiver combinations are deployed. Due to the nature of the underwater environment and sound propagation characteristics, tracking targets in the underwater environment becomes a complex operation. Conventional tracking approaches (such as the Kalman and particle filter) require a predetermined kinematic model of the target. Moreover, tracking an unknown and changing number of targets within a certain search area requires complex mathematical association filters to identify the number of targets and associate measurements to different target tracks. As the number of false detections increases, the computational complexity of conventional tracking system grows introducing further challenges for real-time target tracking situations. The methodology presented in this thesis provides a rapid and reliable tracking system capable of tracking multiple targets without depending on a kinematic model of the target movement. In this algorithm, Self Organizing Maps, Dynamic Programming and the Hough transform are combined to produce tracks of possible targets’ paths and estimate of targets’ locations. Evaluation of the performance of the tracking algorithm is performed using three types of simulations and a set of real data obtained from a sea trial. This research documents the results of experimental testing and analysis of the tracking system.</description>

   <description>This thesis provides a comparative study of machine vision (MV) classification techniques for the detection of missing clips on an automotive part known as a cross car beam.  This is a difficult application for an automated MV system because the inspection is conducted in an open manufacturing environment with variable lighting conditions.&#xd;
&#xd;
A laboratory test cell was first used to investigate the effect of lighting.  QVision, a software program originally developed at Queen’s University, was used to perform a representative inspection task.  Solutions with different light sources and camera settings were investigated in order to determine the best possible set up to acquire an image of the part.  Feature selection was applied to improve the results of this classification.&#xd;
&#xd;
The MV system was then installed on an industrial assembly line.  QVision was modified to detect the presence or absence of four clips and communicate this information to the computer controlling the manufacturing cell.  Features were extracted from the image and then a neuro fuzzy (ANFIS) system was trained to perform the inspection.   A performance goal of 0% False Positives and less than 2% False Negatives was achieved with the feature based ANFIS classifier.  In addition, the problem of a rusty clip was examined and a radial hole algorithm was used to improve performance in this case.   In this case, the system required hours to train.&#xd;
&#xd;
Five new classifiers were then compared to the original feature based ANFIS classifier: 1) feature based with a Neural Network, 2) feature based with principle component analysis (PCA) applied and ANFIS, 3) feature based with PCA applied and a Neural Network, 4) Eigenimage based with ANFIS and 5) Eigenimage based with a Neural Network.  The effect of adding a Hough rectangle feature and a principle component colour feature was also studied.  It was found that the Neural Network classifier performed better than the ANFIS classifier.  When PCA was applied the results improved still further.  Overall, feature based classifiers had better performance than Eigenimage based classifiers.  Finally, it should be noted that these six classifiers required only minutes to train.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2009-08-07 17:56:13.739</description>
   <description>Active learning should be the ultimate aim of education. I argue that it is a three interrelated-step model of curriculum: one which promotes critical thinking, involves dialogue and ultimately indicates growth. It is a model intertwined in an intricate web of ideas borrowed from John Dewey and Paulo Freire. &#xd;
	In this thesis, I analyze the International Baccalaureate (IB) Theory of Knowledge (TOK) curriculum as an example of a document that seeks to foster active learning. To be able to analyze whether the IB TOK curriculum promotes active learning, I dissect the curriculum in terms of its philosophy and objectives.&#xd;
	Curriculum theorists do not agree on a universal definition of curriculum. Therefore, I explore four distinctive theories of curriculum and theory in order to find a definition that best fits the IB TOK curriculum and philosophy: 1) curriculum as a body of knowledge to be deposited, 2) curriculum as a product theory, 3) curriculum as a process, and 4) curriculum as praxis.&#xd;
	I argue that in order for active learning to take place, the three components of active learning need to exist together. Active learning needs to promote critical thinking as a means to understanding one’s self and others. And, active learning needs to involve dialogue to enable people to become fully aware of their own position within the community and the world, and that of others. Critical thinking and dialogue in turn ensure growth. Growth is defined in terms of conscientização and Praxis; this is premised on two conditions: 1) to become aware of the realities in one’s life; and, 2) to take informed and practical actions to change these assumptions. It is then, I argue, that learning becomes active. It is indeed, as Freire would say, breaking away from ‘silence’ imposed on us by oppressors and attaining “the freedom of the learner” in Dewey’s words.&#xd;
	It is only through active learning that individuals can critically think, enter a meaningful dialogue with others, and ultimately have the courage to act, and as a result create a life which is meaningful—not just for themselves but for everyone.</description>

   <description>Aims: To describe use of post-operative radiation for endometrial cancer in Ontario. To identify system-related and patient-related factors affecting access to this treatment.&#xd;
&#xd;
Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with surgically resected endometrial cancer in the Canadian province of Ontario between 1992-2003. Patients with evidence of incurable cancer at diagnosis or previous cancer diagnosis were excluded. We used multiple logistic regression to assess patient and system factors affecting radiation use. We controlled for disease-related and treatment-related factors: histology, surgical staging, type of hysterectomy and peritoneal biopsy. We applied a mixed model to account for clustering of data by operating hospital. &#xd;

Results:  9,411 women comprised the study cohort. The median age was 63 years. 26.2% received adjuvant radiation. The proportion of patients receiving radiation varied between cancer centre catchment areas from 18.0% to 34.3% (median 26.3%). In multivariate analysis, older patients were more likely to receive radiation up to the age of 80 (p&lt;.0001). Patients who lived further from regional cancer centres were less likely to receive radiation (p=.0210). Patients who had their surgery during longer prevailing wait times at regional cancer centres were less likely to receive radiation (p=.0441). There was a 2.7-fold variation in the odds of radiation use between cancer centre catchments (p&lt;.0001). Management at a comprehensive gynecologic oncology centre was associated with use of radiation for patients who had surgical staging of lymph nodes. Year of diagnosis and neighborhood income quintile did not significantly affect the use of radiation. &#xd;

Conclusions: There is wide variation in use of radiation for endometrial cancer in Ontario. There is evidence that system factors unrelated to patient’s needs affect use of adjuvant radiation for endometrial cancer in Ontario. Age is a key patient-related factor affecting radiation use.</description>
