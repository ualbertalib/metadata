   <title>Estimating suburban population growth: A study of the Ottawa-Gatineau CMA, 1996-2016</title>

   <description>The purpose of this project was to determine the proportion of Ottawa-Gatineau Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) residents living in less sustainable forms of suburban development and to determine how this proportion has changed geographically and temporally, and to determine if Ottawa’s suburban growth management policies are achieving their targets. &#xd;
&#xd;
This report found that most Ottawa-Gatineau residents lived in less sustainable forms of development; 76% of the CMA population, over 1 million people, lived in automobile suburbs or exurbs. The good news is that temporal trend analysis found that the share of CMA population growth of the automobile suburbs decreased from 1996-2016, while that of the active cores increased over the same time period. However, the share of CMA growth of the transit suburbs decreased from 1996-2006, while that of the exurbs increased over the same time period. Geographic trend analysis found that most of Ottawa’s population growth was focused outside of the Greenbelt, and mainly in the Western area of Ottawa. Due to boundary and definition issues, direct comparison of study results with Official Plan quantitative growth targets was not possible. However, it is clear that most population growth is still occurring in the less sustainable automobile suburbs and exurban areas.</description>

   <description>A fundamental understanding of the mechanisms affecting the mobility of granular landslide flow is critical for the management of risk to life and infrastructure below unstable slopes. Modelling methods used in practice are frequently semi-empirical and require calibration against high-quality physical data. Large scale physical landslide modeling in the Queen’s University landslide flume was conducted with the primary objective of quantifying the effect of collisional flow on the mobility of granular landslides. A series of monodisperse landslide tests was conducted with a constant volume of material, using various nominal grain sizes. A second series of monodisperse tests was conducted using a constant nominal particle size, while varying the size of the source volume. Flow velocities and flow thicknesses were quantified using high frame rate digital image data captured from top-down and side-profile viewing angles. Shear rates and volume fractions were calculated using data from the side-profile viewing camera. Highly instrumented “Smart Rock” sensors embedded within the landslide flow experiments were used as a means to measure the accelerations within the flows. Terrestrial laser scanning provided a method of accurately capturing deposit shape results, used for mobility analyses. Highly collisional landslide flows were produced when flow thicknesses were small relative to the particle size of the constituent landslide materials. Collisional flows were more dilute, travelled faster, were sustained for shorter durations, and resulted in larger measurements of acceleration magnitude. Landslide flows with similar collisional activity were observed to exhibit similar mobility behaviour. The flows with largest observed differences in collisional activity produced a change in the Fahrböschung of nearly 15 %. Collisional flows exhibited increased mobility and spreading compared to more frictional flows.</description>

   <description>Canada has experienced a significant increase in the transport of diluted bitumen (dilbit), a&#xd;
predominant oil sands product that is created by combining bitumen with diluents derived from&#xd;
oil-gas condensates and other proprietary compounds. The chemical composition of dilbit varies&#xd;
to meet season and transport conditions. While the toxicological effects of a variety of crude and&#xd;
refined oils are well studied, the toxicity of dilbit to fish embryos, which are immobile and thus at&#xd;
a high a risk of exposure to oil in the event of a spill remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, this&#xd;
study assessed the toxicity of two Winter dilbit blends, Access Western Blend (AWB) and Cold&#xd;
Lake Blend (CLB), to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos. Embryos were exposed&#xd;
to a range of water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF;&#xd;
using Corexit®9500A as dispersant) for both AWB and CLB. After exposure, hatched fish were&#xd;
assessed for blue sac disease (BSD) and expression of selected biomarker genes. Developmental&#xd;
malformations were observed more frequently with increasing concentrations of AWB and CLB&#xd;
in both WAF and CEWAF treatments and included tube heart, pericardial edema, and&#xd;
craniofacial deformities. Levels of cyp1a and gst mRNA were elevated with increasing total&#xd;
concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in both AWB and CLB WAF and CEWAF&#xd;
conditions. However, there were no significant changes in mRNA levels for p53, sod, cat, and&#xd;
gsr. These results suggest that expression of cyp1a and gst may serve as biomarkers for dilbit&#xd;
exposure in fathead minnow, furthering our understanding of dilbit-responsive indicators of&#xd;
toxicity in fish species native to North America. This study is important as it utilizes the same&#xd;
exposure methodology to examine the toxicity of two commonly used Canadian dilbits,&#xd;
facilitating the comparison of dilbit toxicity.</description>

   <description>The automated inspection and sorting of parts is a common application of Machine Vision (MV). The sorting of parts is possible only after reliable classification. The goal of this thesis was to develop and validate a flexible MV system that can reliably classify small parts. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are popular choices as classification algorithms. Classifiers developed from supervised algorithms perform well when trained for a specific application with known classes. Their drawback is that they are considered inflexible as they cannot be easily applied to a different application without extensive retuning. Moreover, for a given application, they do not perform properly if there are unknown classes. Classifiers developed from semi-unsupervised algorithms can work with unknown classes but cannot work with multiple known classes.&#xd;
A novel solution to these limitations has been developed using a hybrid two-layered approach with supervised SVMs, semi-unsupervised SVMs and supervised ANNs. With the hybrid approach as the basis for the classifier, a flexible MV system was designed with four key characteristics: 1) cost effective hardware, 2) a realistic and manageable image database, 3) an effective image conditioning process and 4) a comprehensive features library. Four hybrid classification methods were developed and tested: 1) semi-unsupervised SVM followed by supervised SVM (USVM-SSVM), 2) supervised SVM followed by semi-unsupervised SVM (SSVM-USVM), 3) semi-unsupervised SVM followed by supervised ANN (USVM-SANN) and 4) supervised ANN followed by semi-unsupervised SVM (SANN-USVM). The target performance criteria for the system was an accuracy of 95% with 0% false positives.&#xd;
To validate the system and to demonstrate its flexibility, experiments were conducted with two hardware setups, three applications (gears, connectors, coins) and five sets of high quality images with known/unknown classes. The effect of image quality was studied by digitally blurring and dimming the conditioned images. It was found that SANN-USVM gave the best results and exceeded the target performance criteria. A software package known as FlexMVS for Flexible Machine Vision System was written to evaluate the hybrid approach and to enable easy execution of the image conditioning, feature extraction and classification steps.</description>

   <description>Model Driven Development (MDD) enables users to construct complex systems by leveraging models, often in some graphical notation, and pre-built application components. With MDD, users create a model using a language such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) or UML for Real-Time (UML-RT). Certain tools supporting these languages allow building the code from the created models.&#xd;
Build systems transform source code, libraries, and data files into deliverables, such as deployment-ready executable files. Build tools play a critical role in the software development process by automating the compiling and packaging process. In a large MDD project, building accounts for a significant amount of time and effort, and optimization of the build process is still an actively researched topic. MDD tools rely heavily on the existing build tools, so there are possibilities of inheriting limitations and issues from the existing tools. This calls for making the existing build process more efficient.&#xd;
Hence, we propose a methodology to optimize the build process at the model level by comparing any two model versions, determining the impact of the change on a model, and generating a patch for the changed and impacted model elements.&#xd;
Finally, we present a prototype tool that serves to optimize the build process by generating a patch for the changed and impacted model elements. Also, using the prototype tool, we measure the time taken to compute the impacted elements.</description>

   <description>Authors of persuasive documents strive to influence the attitudes of their readers in such a manner that they are encouraged to respond in a desired way. For instance, companies produce advertisements with the goal of persuading consumers to purchase those companies' products or services. We designed a system to transform the language used in documents to either increase or decrease the evaluation, activity or potency (EPA) level of the documents. We validated the effectiveness of our system by transforming the language used in several persuasive documents and asking participants, by means of a survey, to identify whether the original version or the transformed version of the text was more positive, passive or potent. The purpose of the survey was to determine if participants are able to detect the transformations&#xd;
produced by our system. Participants were able to detect many of the transformations. Our survey revealed that the degree to which participants are able to detect the transformations is related to the EPA dimension of the transformation, as well as whether the transformation increased or decreased the EPA level of the text. There was no significant correlation between the gender of participants and the ability of participants to detect the transformations.</description>

   <description>NP-GLIDE polyurethane (PU) coatings are prepared by curing a commercial polyol, a hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDIT), and P1-g-PDMS, a graft copolymer consisting of a polyol backbone and grafted poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) side chains.  These coatings are termed NP-GLIDE coatings because most test liquids with surface tension values higher than ~22 mN/m have no problem to glide cleanly off them and the coatings contain on their surfaces and within the PU matrix nanopools of a grafted liquid ingredient (PDMS) for dewetting enablement. To optimize the dewetting performance of the NP-GLIDE coatings, the effect of varying the length of the PDMS chains in the P1-g-PDMS samples was investigated.  P1-g-PDMS polymers with PDMS molecular weight of 1.00 × 103, 5.0 × 103, and 10.0 × 103 g mol-1 were synthesized and cast together with a commercial polyol and HDIT as transparent antismudge coatings.  Studies showed that when the PDMS molecular weight was 10.0 × 103 g mol-1, the dewetting ability of the coating was lower than that prepared from P1-g-PDMS with PDMS molecular weight at 5.0 × 103 g mol-1.  This result should be due to the higher viscosity of the higher molecular weight PDMS and therefore lower mobility of the surface PDMS chains.  When the PDMS molecular weight was 1.00 × 103 g mol-1, the resultant coating did not perform well either, likely due to the fact that the surface PDMS layer was not thick enough to fully cover the surface.  Using a PDMS molecular weight in between (MW = 5.0 × 103 g mol-1), proved to provide the best compromise between surface coverage and viscosity and resulted in the best dewetting performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
The effects of varying PDMS content and incorporating free silicone oil into the coatings were also examined.  Coatings with 1.00 to 6.0 wt. % PDMS showed good dewetting properties, with higher PDMS content performing slightly better.  1.00 wt. % PDMS was proved to be the lower limit of PDMS content as coatings with 0.50 wt. % PDMS were unable to shrink ink or paint.  Infusing the sample with free silicone oil also showed improved contact angles, sliding angles, and contact angle hysteresis especially when water was used as the test liquid.</description>

   <description>Model-Driven Development is based on the principle that the code can be automatically generated from software models that capture the high-level implementation of the system. This process of software development can save a lot of time and cost, in addition to eliminating the need for writing complex code.&#xd;
&#xd;
An example of MDD is the development of complex real-time embedded software systems using a real-time proﬁle of UML (UML-RT). Development of this software is diﬃcult mainly due to timing constraints in a resource-constrained environment.&#xd;
Adequate consideration of these timing constraints is very important for ensuring the integrity and reliability of a real-time software system. Papyrus for Real-Time(Papyrus-RT) is an open source modeling environment, which can be used to model&#xd;
complex real-time systems using the UML-RT language.&#xd;
&#xd;
In our thesis, we have taken a rover, an autonomous embedded system vehicle, as our case study. We are extending Papyrus-RT by adding new features to facilitate the model-based development of rover software. The goal of the project is to streamline the process of developing rover software using Papyrus-RT by making it more user-friendly and simpler. One of the key research outcomes is a highly customizable conﬁguration page in the multi-editor panel of Papyrus-RT. The conﬁguration view provides a centralized visualization of a select number of relevant design parameters such as attribute value, property when designing the software for the rovers. Further, it also serves as a single point for all the design modiﬁcation and customizations.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, as a proof of concept, a fully functioning rover is constructed, and the code that is generated through the customized version of our tool is used to drive the rover.</description>

   <description>This research investigates the use of learning techniques to select control parameters in the Model Predictive Control (MPC) of autonomous vehicles. The general problem of having a vehicle track a target while adhering to constraints and minimizing control effort is defined. We further expand the problem to consider a vehicle for which the underlying dynamics are not well known. A game of Finite Action-Set Learning Automata (FALA) is used to select the weighting parameters in the MPC cost function. Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) is combined with a Kalman Filter to simultaneously identify the model while estimating the system states. Planar inequality constraints are used to avoid spherical obstacles. The performance of these techniques is assessed for applications involving ground and aerial vehicles. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the combined FOS-FALA architecture reduces the overall number of design parameters that must be selected. The amount of reduction depends on the specific application. For the differential drive robot case considered here, the number for parameters was reduced from six to one. Furthermore, the learning strategy links the selection of these parameters to the desired performance. This is a significant improvement over the typical approach of trial and error.</description>

   <description>Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) has been the focus of intense research in the last years. The objective of SMPC is to design control systems corrupted by stochastic noise. Existing solutions include the implementation of Robust MPC schemes, where the worst case scenario is taken into account. As this approach often results in conservative and expensive solutions, a number of researchers have addressed the need for more optimistic and realistic tailored control schemes that can handle stochastic process behaviour. SMPC gives practitioners a tool to take most realization of uncertainty in the controller design, while guaranteeing feasibility and stability. The work presented in this thesis focuses on developing an SMPC algorithm for nonlinear systems with additive stochastic uncertainty. The scheme is carried out in a fast sampled-data approach, which yields an advantageous computational load. &#xd;
&#xd;
We develop a sampled-data scheme for deterministic systems through sampling control moves. Two sampled-data schemes have been proposed and examined in benchmark simulations including a CSTR system. The first scheme considers a hybrid control system, where a continuous-time flow control occurs during a fine time grid, and a discrete-time jump control looks after jumps in a coarse time grid. The second scheme is a complete sampled-data system through discrete control moves throughout the two time grids. It was shown that the second control scheme succeeded in reducing the cost function along with a huge reduction in CPU time for all the simulations. &#xd;
&#xd;
Secondly, the latter sampled-data scheme was modified to handle stochastic noise through the inclusion of an expected cost and probabilistic constraints. The resulting control can handle moderate noise signals and produce much better results than conventional nonlinear SMPC schemes. The proposed stochastic sampled-data MPC scheme is designed to tackle nonlinear dynamical systems with moderate noise signals with a large precision and low CPU time.</description>

   <title>Passports to Adulthood, Strong Families and Good Mothers: A Critical Examination of Developmental Disability Discourse in Ontario Between 2008-2014</title>

   <description>This study investigates ways in which motherhood and family are implicated in contemporary policy and practice relating to adults diagnosed with developmental disabilities in Ontario, Canada.  In Ontario, recent policy changes emphasize the importance of supporting families and stress inclusion, choice and independence as desirable and attainable outcomes for disabled adults.  At the same time, Ontario’s provincially regulated developmental services system has been charged by families, journalists and government officials as failing to adequately provide for adults with developmental disabilities and their families, many of whom are said to be in crisis.  Conducted from a feminist and disability studies informed, post-structuralist perspective, the current research explores how meanings associated with disability, family and motherhood make contemporary disability related policies and practices possible. More specifically, the current research was undertaken to describe developmental disability discourse in Ontario between 2008-2014, especially as it engages with conceptualizations of motherhood and family.  Results from a discourse analysis of policy documents, interviews with eight mothers of adults diagnosed with developmental disabilities and Legislative Assembly of Ontario Select Committee on Developmental Services transcripts indicate that the disabled adult subject embodies discursive flows, tensions and contradictions.  Belonging to a category of fixed, medicalized difference from a norm, the disabled adult subject is envisioned as legitimately unable to enact the demands of successful neoliberal citizenship; while simultaneously envisioned as deserving recognition as a unique adult human who should exercise choice and individual potential to approximate normative adulthood and successful neoliberal citizenship.  This tension-laden discourse is made possible by and perpetuates gendered ideals and practices of parenting and a related familialization of care, thereby extending and expanding intensive mothering practices and expectations.  At the same time, developmental disability discourse also makes it possible for mothers to draw boundaries around their mothering roles and make demands of the province.</description>

   <title>Assessment of Trail Characteristics and Invasive Species Prevalence of an Alternative Border Crossing Route for the A2A Trail</title>

   <subject>A2A Trail</subject>
   <description>The A2A (Algonquin to Adirondacks) Trail was proposed in 2014. Upon completion, it would be the first multi-national long distance trail in North America. Part of the proposed plan is an alternative border-crossing route, which would see trail users first travel from Cape Vincent to Kingston by existing ferry system, and then from Kingston back to main route of the A2A Trail through the K &amp; P Trail and the Cataraqui Trail. Without studies done on either of the trails, feasibility of the alternative route was unknown. As a result, the research project has been completed to investigate environmental/ecological feasibility of the alternative route of the A2A Trail by assessing key trail characteristics (such as trail grades) and invasive plant species prevalence along the K&amp;P Trail and the Cataraqui Trail. It is found that the alternative route is not feasible as both trails lead to establishment of invasive plant species, and suffer from trail degradations due to issues in trail design and maintenance. Further studies and works on both trails are needed in order to improve the feasibility of the alternative border-crossing route for the A2A Trail.</description>

   <description>Catalytic formylation of amines with CO2 and H2 is an efficient and selective way to produce formamides, which have many applications in the industry. However, all of the highly active catalysts reported in the literature have used precious metals, which are expensive, scarce, at risk of depletion, and toxic. Recently, research has focused on formylation of the amine with CO2 and hydrogenation using inexpensive abundant-metals.  &#xd;
In this regard, this thesis focuses on the development of homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides using abundant-metals. Firstly, in situ formation of catalysts from abundant-metal salts and phosphine ligands was tested for the formylation of dimethylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine, morpholine, aniline, and N-methylaniline with H2 and CO2. From the screening tests, efficient in-situ catalysts such as Ni(acac)2 and Ni(OAc)2·4H2O/dmpe (acac- = acetylacetonato; dmpe = 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) were identified for the formylation of morpholine and 2-ethylhexylamine, respectively. &#xd;
The hydrogenation of CO2 to formamide using a primary/secondary amine was also tested in the presence of preformed catalysts ([NiX2(dmpe)] or [NiX(dmpe)2]X, where X = Cl-, CH3CO2-, acac-, BPh4-) in DMSO. Morpholine and 2-ethylhexylamine are formylated at 100 °C and 135 °C, respectively at a total pressure of 100 bar with TONs (TON = turnover number) up to 18,000, and 1,610, the highest TON using any abundant-metal phosphine complex to date. With the appropriate selection of catalyst and reaction conditions, >90-98% conversion of amine to formamide was achieved, and the effect of changing the metal to amine ratio was also investigated. &#xd;
Nickel complexes have not been much explored for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid derivatives. We describe the syntheses of Ni(II) complexes, [Ni(dmpe)2Cl]Cl; [Ni(dmpe)Cl2]; [Ni(Me2(O)P(CH2)2P(O)Me2)(acac)2]n; and [Ni(acac)(MeO)(MeOH)]4. The preformed Ni(II) complexes were also tested as homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamide using morpholine and dimethylamine as substrates. It was found that DMF formed with a TON value of 6,300, the highest TON for that product using abundant-metal phosphine complexes to date.&#xd;
Co(II)/Ni(II)-PPN (PNN = (2-(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-6- diethylaminomethyl)pyridine) complexes have also been prepared and characterized, and tested for CO2 hydrogenation to formamide. Unfortunately, these complexes were not catalytically active.</description>

   <description>Soil salinization is an environmental issue affecting global soil quality and plant productivity. Landfilling of cement kiln dust (CKD), a saline waste by-product from the cement manufacturing process, results in soil salinization, negatively impacting the physical and chemical characteristics of soil, and potentially affecting the health of plant and aquatic communities. Phytotechnologies were selected and implemented in an effort to remediate a CKD landfill located in Bath, ON. Halophytes are salt tolerant plants that make up ~1% of the world’s terrestrial flora and have been previously employed to remediate salinized soils. Objective 1: following the phytoextraction of chloride via a resident, invasive grass, Phragmites australis (common reed), aboveground biomass was harvested and placed in composters in a laboratory and directly at the field site. Significant reductions in biomass (28  6%) and reductions in chloride, with rinsing, (43.7  37.4%) were achieved in the laboratory, and significant reductions in both closed composters (87  6%) and in open compost piles (89  8%) were achieved at the field site, indicating that composting is a feasible alternative disposal method to landfilling and incineration of salt-contaminated plant material. Objective 2: recretohalophytes utilize specialized salt glands, which excrete salt onto their shoot surfaces. In a theory referred to as ‘haloconduction’, excreted salt has the potential to be transported away from the site of contamination via wind. Two native recretohalophytes, Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass) and Distichlis spicata (inland saltgrass), were selected to explore the theory of haloconduction in the field. Under ideal conditions, this study found that both species have the potential to remediate the site in 0.5 – 3.5 years. Three windborne salt collection methods were devised and implemented at the field site, and were able to confirm the transportation of salt via wind. Their continued use will be critical for establishing further understanding of the theory of haloconduction before a full-scale method of phytoremediation is established at the site. This thesis provides promising results for the use of phytotechnologies to remediate a salt-impacted CKD landfill that may be applied to other industrial sites, roadsides, or agricultural operations in the future.</description>

   <description>Registration of two 3D point clouds is a problem encountered in many domains in&#xd;
3D computer vision. A correct correspondence between the overlapping portions of&#xd;
the point clouds can be used to generate a transform that registers the two point&#xd;
clouds. The search for correspondences can be done using techniques that attempt&#xd;
to find similarity between local or global surface geometry. However, such methods&#xd;
have their limitations. Global methods fail when there is significant surface occlusion,&#xd;
while local ones degrade in performance in the face of noise and outliers. In cases&#xd;
of significant occlusion, noise, and outliers, it is best to rely on a large number of&#xd;
correspondences between very small subsets of points [3]. The higher the number&#xd;
of correspondences, the more likely it is to find the correspondence that represents&#xd;
the correct transformation to achieve registration. In this thesis, a generalization to&#xd;
these subsets that allows us to control the degree of their ambiguity is introduced.&#xd;
Our generalization provides a way to optimize the number of correspondences as to&#xd;
achieve the maximum speed up without sacrificing robustness. We show that for&#xd;
the problem of offline registration we can achieve a speed up factor of up to 4.4x&#xd;
using our generalized version of the algorithm. We also use our generalization with&#xd;
and improved version of 4PCS [52], and show that we can achieve further efficiency&#xd;
improvements over the state of the art in raw point registration&#xd;
iIn addition to the generalization of the 4-Point Congruent sets method, we present&#xd;
a novel RANSAC framework for 3D registration. Unlike the standard RANSAC ap-&#xd;
proach, our approach requires sampling only 2 points and thus reducing the worst&#xd;
time complexity of the algorithm. We present two flavours of this approach and evalu-&#xd;
ate it by comparing it to 4PCS and Super 4PCS. We achieve a speed up improvement&#xd;
of up to 57x over 4PCS and are on par with Super 4PCS in most cases.</description>

   <description>PICO500 is an upcoming dark matter experiment searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter. The experiment is a 500L bubble chamber and is currently in the design phase. This thesis presents simulations of neutron backgrounds which will be incident on the PICO500 detector, the results of which indicate that the rate of single-bubble events caused by backgrounds will be &lt;1.67 events/year in the case of internal backgrounds, and &lt;2.18 events/year in the case of external backgrounds, assuming a muon veto efficiency of 80%. Also presented is a new piece of simulation code which allows for the consistent simulation of muon-induced-neutrons using Geant4 and an analysis of the efficiency of the simulated muon veto.</description>

   <title>Menadione as a Novel Approach to Increasing Carbon Monoxide Production in Pregnancy: Establishing a Possible Therapeutic Role in Pre-eclampsia</title>

   <subject>Carbon Monoxide</subject>
   <description>Despite its negative connotation as a toxic gas, carbon monoxide (CO) is involved in anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and vasodilatory processes, suggesting a possible therapeutic role in many disease states. Endogenous CO production results in a resting percent carboxyhemoglobin (%COHb) level of 0.5 – 1.5% in humans. In smokers, this can rise to 17%.&#xd;
It has been shown that women who smoke have a lower risk of developing pre-eclampsia (PE), which is thought to be due to an increase in CO. PE is a pregnancy-related disease that is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria. PE is multifactorial, but a common belief is that poor placentation and systemic maternal endothelial dysfunction are involved in its pathogenesis. &#xd;
Menadione (MD), synthetic vitamin K3, increases CO production in rat brain microsomes. This research tested the hypothesis that MD could also raise CO in the blood and tissue of pregnant mice. A dose-response study was first conducted in non-pregnant mice to determine an efficacious, non-lethal dose. After determining their baseline water consumption rate, non-pregnant CD-1 mice were given one of three doses of MD in drinking water for seven days. No significant differences in %COHb between groups were observed. Splenic CO production and mass doubled in the 4 g/L and 6.5 g/L MD groups, compared to the 1.5 g/L and control cohorts. &#xd;
In a separate experiment, the effect of MD on gestational day (GD) 15 placental tissue CO production was tested using two different tissue preparation methods. Non-linear regression showed that while absolute levels of CO were higher in sonicated placentas than whole placentas, the relative increase in CO between concentrations was the same using either method. &#xd;
Lastly, oral administration of 6.5 g/L MD from GD10.5 – 17.5 significantly decreased maternal weight gain and fetal survival. Significant increases in %COHb and splenic CO were seen in the treatment group on GD17.5, with a positive trend for CO production in the liver, placenta and kidney. Overall, the findings demonstrate that MD can induce CO production in vivo. However, further studies in a mouse model of PE at a safer dose must be done to establish the drug’s therapeutic potential.</description>

   <description>The American Friends of the Middle East (AFME) was a civil society organization that operated various cultural and technical programs in the Middle East. This thesis analyzes its activities and interactions with Arab states, particularly Egypt, during the early Cold War era. The AFME was committed to an agenda of neoliberal modernization. Its operations aimed to improve the political, economic, and cultural conditions of the Middle East via integration into the US orbit. The American private sector, rather than state actors, would oversee this process. The AFME broke with the foreign policy orthodoxy of the US state while subverting the postcolonial ambitions of Nasserist pan-Arabism by facilitating the expansion of US corporate development in the Middle East. Arab nationalism was committed to neutrality and economic sovereignty, neither of which the AFME respected, despite its professed commitment to friendship and understanding with the strategically vital Middle East.</description>

   <description>Heavy industries such as mining, constructions and transportation manufacturing are currently facing many dilemmas due to the critical and harsh conditions that they collide with during their operations. Such environments faces many challenges in managing the wireless communication due to the heavy equipment, large machine and wide areas that might cause failures in such systems. Thus, there is a great need for solutions to overcome those critical issues. We introduce single channel-MoT (SC-MoT) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that runs on top of LoRa physical layer. The protocol adapts the multiple channel protocol MoT for industrial applications enabling ease of implementation and lower cost and delay. SC-MoT uses LoRa modulation to offer an extended range of communication with high sensitivity and low noise. Similar to MoT, SC-MoT uses the centralized scheduling technique to achieve collision-free transmissions with low delays and long power source lifetime. In addition, features such as broadcasting and rapid acknowledging are also implemented in SC-MoT. We evaluate SC-MoT against MoT with respect to waiting times, energy consumption and cost. We also show results from field experiments in a harsh Industrial environment.</description>

   <description>Directional couplers are an essential component in several microwave applications. Lumped element directional couplers gained a lot of attention due to their compact size. This thesis represents a lumped element model for transdirectional and codirectional couplers. Unlike the classical inductive coupling used for modelling, capacitors are used to represent the coupling mechanism between the two coupled lines. Transdirectional couplers are recommended for many applications such as power dividers and power combiners because of the direct current (DC) isolation between the input and output ports. Generic design equations are demonstrated at any frequency with arbitrary coupling coefficients for the lumped element transdirectional coupler. In addition, design equations for lumped element codirectional couplers at any frequency with 3 dB coupling coefficient are presented. lumped element transdirectional coupler and codirectional coupler are designed and fabricated at 1 GHz to verify the design methodology. Both are fabricated using FR-4 substrate. There is good agreement between the simulated and measured results for both designs.</description>

   <description>The topic of planning senior-friendly neighborhoods is important for urban planners because of the demographic shift that Canada is experiencing. Since seniors tend to age in place, this will affect every community, therefore it s important that planners work to create communities that facilitate age-friendly living. This research aims to evaluate the downtown of the City of Kingston’s physical environment, how the environment encourages or inhibits activities such as walking for older adults and as a result evaluate the age-friendliness of this environment. The report proposes recommendations that can be taken by the City of Kingston to improve the age-friendliness of the downtown core. The goal of this report was to identify the age-friendliness of Kingston’s downtown-built environment. The aim of this research was to evaluate the City of Kingston’s downtown outdoor spaces and buildings, against the World Health Organizations (WHO) age-friendly guidelines and make recommendations.</description>

   <subject>1970-1990</subject>
   <description>This dissertation investigates the evolution of environmental protection (EP) policy in Hubei Province from the early 1970s to the middle 1980s. It addresses the local impacts of economic and environmental policies during this remarkable period of transition in China, taking Hubei as a case study to capture the local evolution of policy implementation and establishment of EP by state agencies in China. Discussion illuminates the early origins of a shift in governance in Hubei from an agenda dominated by economic growth objectives toward more balanced regulation, revealing a series of features in China’s early policy failures in the regulation of industrial waste emissions, and later policy adaptations by sub-national government agencies.&#xd;
The study consists of an introduction and six substantive chapters. Chapter 2 outlines Hubei’s historical and environmental setting. Chapter 3 examines how agencies responsible for EP were established in Hubei from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s, identifying four groups of agencies. Chapter 4 reviews scholarly writing by Chinese economists on EP issues, illuminating the early formation and underlying assumptions of China’s national economic policies of EP during the 1970s and 1980s. Chapters 5 and 6 present case studies on Hubei’s industrial waste pollution, describing how communities were affected by industrial waste emissions that imposed enormous damage to water, air and soil. Chapter 7 examines how local EP agencies struggled with administrative red tape, under-funding, and under-staffing. Guided by their mandate to protect the environment and by growth-oriented economic principles, Hubei’s EP agencies also demonstrated local initiative and policy adaptation in implementing EP policies. In conclusion, I discuss how practices of pricing the “right to pollute” evolved in Hubei and how the practical recognition of industries’ right to pollute compromised the local implementation of national environmental policies.</description>

   <title>Effects of Reticular Activation on Long-Term Depression in Primary Visual Cortex of the Long-Evans Rat</title>

   <subject>Long-Term Depression</subject>
   <description>Long-term depression (LTD) is a widely studied form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, typically induced by prolonged low-frequency stimulation (LFS). LFS is highly eﬀective in eliciting LTD in vitro, but several studies have failed to induce LTD using LFS in vivo, for reasons that remain unclear. The main objective of this thesis was to assess whether different levels of ongoing background activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) alter the effectiveness of LFS to induce LTD under in vivo conditions, using urethane anesthetized rats. LFS applied to the lateral geniculate nucleus resulted in LTD of field postsynaptic potentials (fPSPs) recorded in the primary visual cortex (V1). Pairing LFS with stimulation of the brainstem (pedunculopontine) reticular formation resulted in the appearance of faster, more complex activity in V1 and prevented LTD induction. Reticular stimulation alone (without LFS) had no eﬀect on cortical fPSPs. Application of scopolamine and mecamylamine did not restore LTD or prevent the complex oscillatory activity seen in V1. These results show that excitation of the brainstem activating system blocks the induction of LTD in V1. Thus, higher levels of neural activity may inhibit depression at cortical synapses, a hypothesis that could explain discrepancies regarding LTD induction in previous in vivo and in vitro work.</description>

   <description>While a significant amount of attention is often paid to the notion of forced and abusive marriages in Afghanistan, little has been said to give Afghan women the agency and opportunity to speak out for themselves and talk about their own personal experiences in relation to marriage and marriage practices. This especially pertains to Afghan women in the Canadian diaspora when multiple layers of identity associated with gender, culture, and faith become intertwined. Navigating romantic relationships through these multiple intersections becomes even more complex, but it does offer room for creativity, resistance, and accommodation. In fact, for most Afghan women in the Canadian diaspora, their attitudes towards marriage practices and marriage choice reveal diverse perspectives on gender ideologies and gender relations. The purpose of this thesis is to explore how individualistic desires and cultural values and expectations affect the marriage choices of first and second-generation Afghan women living in the Canadian diaspora.  This study is based on qualitative research consisting of in-depth, extensive online interviews¬¬ and draws on postcolonial and anti-racist feminist analyses to map out the complex interactions of race, gender, religion, and sexuality that pertain to the diverse experiences faced by Afghan women when engaging with feminism. Understanding the rationalizations behind marriage choice and practices for Afghan women in the diaspora paves the way for better understanding of a group that has typically been neglected in academia.</description>

   <description>Significant progress has been achieved recently in the development of solution-processed organic photovoltaic devices, and they are now in the early stages of commercialization. However, achieving a smooth and homogenous film morphology without disturbing the optical and electronic properties of the active layer remains a crucial challenge to overcome for developing small-molecule materials. Strong molecular forces between conjugated small molecules can result in the nucleation of molecular crystals in solution, thereby resulting in an incomplete film coverage with high surface roughness. In addition, most small-molecule donor and acceptor materials tend to crystallize rapidly during solvent and thermal annealing to yield films of poor quality with polycrystalline small domains separated by grain boundaries, which act as electron traps and limit the long-range transport of electrons, and thusly impacting negatively device performance.&#xd;
To improve film quality with enhanced efficiency, several efforts are focused on molecular design which is based on high solubility, high optical absorption, high charge carrier mobility and a high interfacial gap between donor and acceptor. The approach studied herein consists in improving the film quality of PV devices by synthesizing amorphous glass-forming donors and acceptors with improved optical and electronic properties. Organic molecular glasses are a class of glass-forming materials that usually show outstanding glass-forming ability, and high kinetic stability towards crystallization. Organic materials functionalized with glass-forming mexylaminotriazine derivatives can remain indefinitely in the amorphous state at working temperatures, thereby preserving their optical and electronic properties. In this thesis, we developed molecular glasses functionalized with n- and p-type organic small molecules and studied their optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties.&#xd;
This thesis mainly focuses on the optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of target mexylaminotriazine-functionalized amorphous donor and acceptor materials which show outstanding PV performance compared to their crystalline analogues. In addition, the structural and morphological properties of their respective thin films studied by XRD, AFM and SEM are also discussed.</description>

   <description>This work presents the BitDrones System, a platform for developing interactive 3D tangible user interface applications. This system is a first step towards interactive self-levitating programmable matter. Although there have been many attempts to create programmable matter, BitDrones represents a unique contribution where the voxels are self-levitating, and completely controllable in 3D, all while still allowing user interactions. Several generations of BitDrones units are presented, beginning with BitDrones that are single self-levitating pixels and moving to fully graspable 3D tangible voxels. Each BitDrone consists of a 3D printed wireframe cube with RGB LEDs mounted on a nano-quadcopter, which allows it to self-levitate. Groups of BitDrones are controllable directly by the user through a series of unimanual, bimanual, gestural, and embodied controller interactions. Interactions such as Touch and Drag are possible simply by grasping and moving the BitDrones. Gestural interactions such as Point and Click allow the user to manipulate remote BitDrones. Also described are several application scenarios that are possible with the BitDrones system. These include a 3D Canvas, a tangible Grid, an animation recording and playback, and an embodied controller designed to operate as Flying LEGO Bricks.</description>

   <description>Youth with cerebral palsy (CP) may be prescribed rehabilitation exercises by physiotherapists in order to improve or maintain motor function as they grow into adolescence. However, in the field of physiotherapeutic medicine, adherence to exercise prescriptions has been shown to be low. Motivation and enjoyment have been identified as important factors of adherence to prescribed exercise, and gamification of rehabilitation exercise has been shown in some cases to improve motivation, enjoyment, and exercise adherence for youth with cerebral palsy. In this thesis, we present Bootle Rumble, an exercise video game for youth with cerebral palsy which intends to motivate high-quality rehabilitation exercise without sacrificing enjoyable gameplay.&#xd;
&#xd;
Bootle Rumble’s design balances four distinct constraints: (1) it must motivate high-quality exercise; (2) it must be balanced for effort rather than individual ability; (3) it must be accessible to youth with CP; and (4) it must be fun. These constraints led to several unique game design decisions, which we describe in this thesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
To gain early evaluation of the design decisions that underly Bootle Rumble, we conducted a pilot study involving three participating youth with CP, their parent/guardians, and a participating physiotherapy assistant (PTA) who works with youth with CP. This pilot study focused on evaluating (1) our form-tracking mechanic, in which players’ quality of exercise influences the outcomes of in-game choices, (2) player enjoyment while playing Bootle Rumble, and (3) the effectiveness of Bootle Rumble’s design.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results gathered from our pilot study show promise for Bootle Rumble as an enjoyable adjunct to rehabilitative exercise for youth with CP. Our PTA’s observations suggest that Bootle Rumble incentivizes high-quality exercise. Responses from our participating youth with CP suggest that Bootle Rumble is enjoyable. We further leverage our results to evaluate several of Bootle Rumble’s design decisions. These design decisions may be useful to future developers intending to gamify rehabilitation for youth with CP and other motor disorders.</description>

   <description>Permanent closures and consolidations of public schools are becoming increasingly common in Ontario. This report explores this issue in-depth by examining the potential impacts of a recent decision to close a secondary school in Kingston Ontario, Kingston Collegiate Vocational Institute (KCVI), on the quality of life for residents and neighbourhood well-being and liveability. There is limited empirical evidence on the impacts of school closures on households and neighbourhoods. This report contributes to the gap in research by exposing social impacts experienced by residents currently dealing with the impending closure of their local secondary school, providing an important contribution to the discussion on what considerations should be investigated when determining a school’s future. Further, this report investigates how school asset management can be improved by incorporating more effective collaboration into the decision-making process, reflecting the values and priorities of residents. A multilevel case study was employed using a mixed methods approach to data collection. Using the impending closure of KCVI at the study case, households within the school’s catchment area were surveyed to investigate the potential impacts of the closure at the household level, and key informants were interviewed to investigate the potential impacts at the neighbourhood level. The study findings demonstrate significant concerns about neighbourhood and household well-being and liveability upon the impending closure of KCVI. The decision to close KCVI highlighted three main planning-related conflicts: conflicts with Provincial sustainability policies that place high priority on sustainable land use and development practices to reduce carbon emissions, make efficient use of public infrastructure, and ultimately support the health and well-being of future generations; conflicts with municipality, in terms of missed opportunities to work collaboratively to develop a cohesive plan for the future of the community; and conflicts with the values and priorities of the public, thereby fostering distrust and resentment among residents with the LDSB. The findings strongly indicate that the current school closure process is flawed and does not reflect the values of residents or adequately consider the social well-being of neighbourhoods.</description>

   <title>Access and Wait Times: A Geographic Exploration of Diagnostic Imaging in Ontario</title>

   <description>Diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role in frontline health care, providing the information some physicians need to make a diagnosis and determine a course of treatment. Delays in access not only lead to undue stress for patients who are not sick but can postpone treatment for those who are. The issue of lengthy wait times in Canada, in particular, is both socially and politically charged, as “waiting lists” are typically viewed as a proxy for access to care. The topic is widely reported in mainstream media and has been targeted by both federal and provincial governments. &#xd;
&#xd;
Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey – Annual Component, 2010 and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, this thesis aimed to provide a holistic understanding of the accessibility of diagnostic imaging in the context of Ontario, with specific attention given to the role of wait times. IBM SPSS 24.0 was used to perform cross-tabulations, chi-square tests of independence and run a binary logistic regression model, while geographic analysis was performed using Esri’s ArcMap software. &#xd;
&#xd;
Waiting too long was cited as the top barrier to access for diagnostic services, with worry, stress and anxiety being the main impact associated with waiting. Differences in the types of difficulties and impacts of waiting were observed based on population characteristics. Wait time acceptability differed depending on difficulty with access and was shown to influence one’s rating of broader health services. Most respondents reported that their wait time was acceptable, regardless of geography. That said, wait times for MRI services were variable throughout the province. Average provincial wait times increased between January 2014 and December 2016 and did not meet the 28-day target at any point throughout the study period.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This research suggests that while wait times should remain an important government priority, there is a need for more targeted interventions that take into account patient experience from a broad perspective. Simply increasing the capacity available to perform diagnostic services has not proven to be a sufficient strategy. Future research can help inform this policy direction by employing more comprehensive methodologies that critically engage with patient perceptions.</description>

   <description>Thin films of azobenzene-polymer material show unique photo-responsive behavior under irradiation with two interfering laser beams. That leads to generate surface inscription pattering known as Surface Relief Grating (SRG). Moreover, two different types of polymers were used in this research, and we used them with new series of azobenzene compounds. In fact, the H-bonding between donor and acceptor system was applied to create the link between the polymer and the azobenzene materials. The chromophore units in the azobenzene were attached to the polymer backbone through hydrogen bonding. In this research, we determined the efficiency of hydrogen bond to form SRG on azo-polymer thin films. The UV-VIS absorption spectra of the azo-polymer film showed broad band extending from 400-700 nm with maximum occurring at 430-580 nm. The laser’s wavelength was selected within the absorption band. Azo-polymer thin film was irradiated with a 532 nm green laser at room temperature. The obtained grating was confirmed by AFM scanning method, and grating depth up to 86 nm was observed.</description>

   <description>The main objective of this thesis was to develop a biohybrid network with appropriate mechanical properties for a range of soft connective tissue engineering applications that could be degraded solely by the action of the target enzymes. An α-vinyl sulfone (VS), ω-methacrylate (MA) heterobifunctional poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC)/ poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-PTMC was prepared and conjugated to a di-cysteine containing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive peptide to form a curable prepolymer. These biohybrid formulations were designed to be cured via a simplified one-step cross-linking process by having both the synthetic polymer and the MMP-sensitive peptide components in a single prepolymer. The degradation behavior and the change in moduli were assessed for the biohybrid networks in vitro using a proteinase-containing medium and in vivo using a Wistar rat model. Both studies confirmed the enzyme degradation of the biohybrid networks via the cleavage of the peptide component and the hydrolytic resistance of the synthetic polymer backbone and the thio-ether linkage over the experimental time frame. The new formulation may be able to support the lost or damaged soft connective tissue mechanically, with identical mechanical features, until the healing process is completed. In addition, a moderate tissue response was observed to the implanted biohybrid networks which was comparable to that observed towards a VicrylTM suture. This observation suggested that these new materials can be considered biocompatible for tissue engineering applications. Overall, the developed biohybrid formulation has shown promising in vitro and in vivo degradation and mechanical properties that would be suitable for soft connective tissue engineering.</description>

   <title>The Role of Interleukin-33 in the Pathophysiology of Endometriosis</title>

   <description>Endometriosis is a debilitating condition that affects 6-10% of reproductive aged women. It is categorized by the growth of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus. There is no non-invasive diagnostic test available and treatments provide temporary relief but no cure exists. Issues surrounding endometriosis are related to the limited understanding of endometriosis pathogenesis as this is a difficult disease to recapitulate in animal models. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is theorized to occur due to retrograde menstruation, where menstrual debris is refluxed into the peritoneal cavity and instead of being cleared, this debris adheres to peritoneal surfaces. The inability to clear menstrual debris is thought to be a result of immune dysfunction. Indeed, chronic inflammation is considered hallmark feature of endometriosis. Interleukin(IL)-33 is an alarmin that has emerged as a critical regulator of several chronic inflammatory diseases. Previous reports have found that IL-33 is elevated in the plasma and peritoneal fluid of deep infiltrating endometriosis patients; however, these reports did not investigate the role, if any, of IL-33 in the disease pathophysiology. I hypothesize that IL-33 is produced by the endometriotic lesions and that IL-33 contributes to the chronic inflammation in endometriosis. Using endometriosis patient plasma and tissue samples, as well as endometrial epithelial, endothelial and endometriotic cell lines and an established syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis, I investigated the central role of IL-33 in endometriosis. My results indicate that endometriotic lesions from women with moderate/severe endometriosis produce significantly higher levels of IL-33 compared to the endometrium of healthy, fertile controls. In vitro stimulation of endometrial epithelial, endothelial and endometriotic epithelial cells with human recombinant IL-33 led to the production of pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines. Additionally, stimulation of endothelial cells with IL-33 induced angiogenesis in vitro.  In the syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis, intraperitoneal mouse recombinant IL-33 injections caused systemic inflammation, which manifested as an increase in plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to PBS-treated control mice. Furthermore, endometriotic lesions from mouse recombinant IL-33-treated mice were highly vascularized and exhibited increased proliferation. Collectively, my studies provide convincing evidence that IL-33 perpetuates inflammation, angiogenesis and lesion proliferation, which are critical events in the lesion survival and progression of endometriosis.</description>

   <description>Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) is a rare but lethal primary liver cancer. Debate exists about whether tumor size should be considered in disease staging. This study aimed to examine the association between tumor size and overall survival (OS) in surgically resected patients with IHCC and to compare a newly proposed staging system that includes tumor size with the current American Joint Cancer Committee on Cancer classification/ Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) system. &#xd;
Methods: This is a retrospective population-based study from 2002-2012 in Ontario, Canada. Patients with IHCC who underwent surgical resection were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry and Canadian Institute for Health Information. Pathology data was abstracted from primary pathology reports. The association between largest tumor size and OS was assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. The predictive accuracy and discriminative abilities of the 7th edition AJCC/UICC TNM staging system was compared with the newly proposed staging system using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the proportional hazards model and a concordance index (c-index), respectively. &#xd;
Results: The study cohort of 121 cases had a median age of 63.9 (Range: 30.7-86.0), 43% were men, the median tumor size was 6 cm (Range: 0.6-13.0), and median follow-up time was 37.6 months (Range: 0.3-126.7). After multivariate analysis adjusting for sex and T-category, no association was observed between tumor size and OS (HR for ≥5 cm=1.08, 95% CI: 0.34-3.49, p-value=0.893). Comparison of the TNM staging systems revealed that the 7th edition AJCC/UICC was comparable at predicting and discriminating survival to the newly proposed system (c-index=0.92 vs 0.86). &#xd;
Conclusion: There is no association between tumor size and OS in patients with surgically resected IHCC and these results argue against the inclusion of tumor size into IHCC disease staging.</description>

   <description>Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that can grow in a variety of environments. They have become a popular feedstock for the production of biofuels, high-value chemicals, and nutraceuticals. One of the main products obtained from microalgae is biodiesel: a mix of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) obtained from the transesterification of triacylglycerol (TAG). However, microalgal biodiesel still cannot compete economically with petroleoum diesel. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to explore alternatives to make microalgal cultivation for biodiesel more efficient. &#xd;
Microalgal treatment of municipal wastewater has been discussed as a strategy for the simultaneous removal of excess nutrients and the generation of microalgal biomass. This thesis evaluated the performance of Scenedesmus sp. and Chlorella sorokiniana in the removal of nutrients from non-sterile, highly concentrated synthetic-wastewater. These microalgae removed up to 60% NH4+ and 44% PO43- in a semi-continuous cultivation mode without negatively affecting effluent quality, demonstrating that microalgal growth can be coupled with wastewater treatment. &#xd;
Microalgal research is growing, and efforts to enhance TAG production are the focus of many studies. Reliable genetic modification protocols for many species, such as Chlorella vulgaris, are still not available. Therefore, work with the model Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a practical alternative for proof-of-concept studies. The work in this thesis generated five Chlorella vulgaris starch mutants through UV-mutagenesis: four low-starch producing and one starch-overproducer. Additionally, four Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transgenic lines expressing Chlorella vulgaris genes involved in glycerolipid metabolism were developed. Mutant st27, with lower starch production than wildtype, displayed up to 3.8-fold increase in TAG, illustrating the importance of the organic carbon source in the medium to provide enough carbon precursors for TAG biosynthesis. Similarly, the transgenic lines increased lipid content more than 100-fold, suggesting that increasing glycerol-3-phosphate availability is crucial to generate oleaginous feedstock. &#xd;
This thesis illustrates the possibility of generating microalgal strains rich in both starch and TAG, which would be a promising feedstock for microalgal biorefineries. Additionally, two new gene candidates to improve TAG yields in microalgal strains are suggested, expanding on the knowledge available for metabolic engineering of microalgal crops for biodiesel production.</description>

   <description>From 1995 to 1998, Ontario was the site of a sustained political and industrial conflict between the provincial government of Premier Mike Harris and a loosely-coordinated protest movement of labour unions, community organizations, and activist groups. The struggle was aimed at the defeating the “Common Sense Revolution,” a sweeping neoliberal program advanced by the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. The program designed to renovate the state, rationalize the social safety net, repeal barriers to capital accumulation, and decisively weaken the strength of organized labour.&#xd;
What became a union-led extra-parliamentary opposition drew in large sections of the population often aligned with a political culture of statist collectivism encompassing both social democracy and “Red Toryism”. The movement emerged at a time when the two major parties aligned with such ideas embraced neoliberal policies. Under the leadership of Mike Harris, the Red Tories were pushed out of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, the one-term New Democratic government of 1990-95 made a decisive turn towards neoliberal austerity amidst a catastrophic recession, declining federal transfers, and employer hostility.&#xd;
Through the union-led “Days of Action” of large political strikes, mass demonstrations, and numerous militant protests, the implementation of the Common Sense Revolution was slowed and weakened and the government’s popularity greatly diminished. However, the province’s union leadership was deeply divided over loyalties to the New Democratic Party following its turn to neoliberal austerity. One union leadership faction opposed the Days of Action while the other proved unwilling to escalate the scale of industrial disruption against the Common Sense Revolution. The crisis led to an open factional dispute within organized labour that culminated in the formal suspension of the political strikes in the summer of 1998.&#xd;
The outcome was an unprecedented political defeat for the labour-led forces defending an expansive redistributive welfare state, and a retreat by organized labour from extra-parliamentary political strategies in favour of electoralism. The government managed to regain support before winning re-election in 1999. The end of the Days of Action marked the political triumph of neoliberal restructuring and permanent austerity, and the crafting of a new political and economic common sense that has endured in Ontario to this day.</description>

   <description>Modern data storage systems are typically built using hard drives and other components that are prone to failure. The financial, operational and legal impact of data loss is usually quite high, particularly for owners of massive storage data-centers. Data loss prevention is therefore a critical aspect of storage system design. Techniques such as data replication are incapable of satisfying the cost and energy-efficiency required in a large-scale distributed storage system (DSS). Erasure codes for data storage are required to offer systematic encoding, low repair locality, low encoding/decoding complexity and low decoding/storage overhead. However, information theoretical bounds have shown that all these metrics might need to be carefully traded off with one another.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this dissertation, analysis and design of Fountain codes for DSSs with respect to key performance requirements is performed. The first design proposed starts with a theoretical characterization of repair locality and system reliability for a Fountain coded system. The symbol repair locality probability as well as Data loss probability under BP decoding for a Fountain code are both derived. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) procedure is then used to determine degree distributions that achieve a good trade-off between repair locality, edge complexity and reliability. The second proposed solution offers a closed-form degree distribution using a modified truncated Poisson distribution (MTPD). The design is motivated by a careful study of the contributions from different encoding degrees towards the system performance.&#xd;
An analysis of the Fountain code probability of redundancy is used to determine the Poisson parameter.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both proposed solutions come with approximately 10% additional decoding overhead compared to recent contributions based on algebraic codes. However, their design for implementation over a binary finite field and excellent repair capabilities make them quite attractive for implementation. Through simulations, we also show that their decoding overhead performance exhibits significant improvement over some existing Fountain code degree distributions in the literature. For instance, with the MTPD, we achieve a data loss probability closely approaching 10^-4, while other Fountain codes compared are about a factor of 10^2 higher.</description>

   <title>Assembly of the O Antigen in the Highly Pathogenic Escherichia Coli Serotype O104:H4</title>

   <description>Escherichia coli serotype O104:H4 (ECO104) is an intestinal pathogen that causes severe bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure and death. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are important virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria and our goal is to understand the enzymes and mechanisms involved in the assembly of the outer O antigenic polysaccharides of the ECO104 LPS. The O antigen repeating unit of ECO104 has the structure [4-Galα1-4Neu5,7,9Ac3α2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-]n, which contains a mimic of the human sialyl-T-antigen found on certain types of cancer cells. Each monosaccharide subunit of the repeating structure is added sequentially by glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of a donor sugar from a nucleotide sugar onto a nucleophilic acceptor. Our aim was to biochemically characterize the second, third and fourth glycosyltransferases that synthesize the repeating unit of ECO104 by expressing the enzymes transgenically in non-pathogenic E. coli BL21, by purifying the enzymes and performing enzyme assays to determine substrate specificity, co-factor requirements, and enzyme kinetics, as well as creating single point mutations in the enzymes to identify key residues.  The second enzyme, WbwC, a β1,3-Gal-transferase, has an absolute requirement for a diphosphate in the acceptor. Remarkably, the third enzyme, α2,3-sialyltransferase WbwA, and the fourth enzyme, α1,4-Gal-transferase WbwB, also have this requirement. This finding is unique in that glycosyltransferases further down the O antigen synthesis pathway usually do not require a diphosphate in the acceptor substrate. WbwB does not require any divalent metal ions for activity and several synthetic bis-imidazolium salts could inhibit the enzymes. This work provides insight into the biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides and identifies potential anti-bacterial targets and a strategy for vaccine synthesis.</description>

   <description>Overexpressing a mouse Bax cDNA in yeast cells induces cell death.  When heterologously expressed in yeast cells overexpression of a mouse cDNA encoding Bax, human Thyroid Cancer-1 (TC-1) or annexin V (ANXA5) suppresses the Bax induced cell death. My goal was to characterize the anti-Programmed Cell Death (anti-PCD) potential of these human cDNA sequences. In addition to rescuing Bax-expressing cells, I found that TC-1 and ANXA5 are pro-survival sequences that protect yeast from other death-inducing stresses including copper sulfate. TC-1 also prevented the deleterious effects caused by over-expression of a number of endogenous yeast pro-apoptotic sequences, including the YCA1 encoded metacaspase; the YBH3 encoded Bcl-2 Homology domain 3 protein, the NUC1 encoded DNase, as well as the apoptosis-inducing factor encoded by AIF1.  Even though the protective effects were more pronounced in rescued cells over-expressing YBH3 and YCA1, TC-1 could still protect yeast mutant strains lacking YBH3 and YCA1 from the growth inhibitory effects of copper sulfate. Our results demonstrate that TC-1 and  ANXA5 are pro-survival sequences that are able to attenuate stress-induced programmed cell death.</description>

   <subject>Ontario Leadership Framework</subject>
   <description>The Ontario Leadership Framework (OLF) recognizes that effective school leadership is a critical component for organizational success. Specifically, the OLF attempts to provide a leadership road-map by identifying leadership competencies for educational administrators, as well as the personal resources necessary to meet those competencies. However, the OLF does not go far enough in providing school leaders with the knowledge and skills necessary to meet those leadership competencies. The purpose of this project was to provide a comprehensive resource for school leaders in their aim to be effective in leadership roles. Using a backwards-design model, a three-part workshop was developed as part of this project. It is rooted in both leadership and motivational theory to support school leaders in meeting the competencies of effective leadership. Through their participation in the leadership exercises and knowledge gathering&#xd;
opportunities, participants will develop their understandings of concepts of leadership, motivation, and the context in which both leaders and followers operate. Participants will be provided with the selection of tools for building their leadership capacity in a meaningful and sustainable way. The culminating activity requires participants to draw on their knowledge of leadership and motivation theory as they develop a leadership plan that is directed towards&#xd;
meeting various OLF competencies of effective leadership. The overall objective is for participants to transfer their knowledge and skills to the school context, allowing them to be more effective in meeting their professional practice needs.</description>

   <description>Landslide generated tsunamis are a natural phenomenon, capable of causing catastrophic consequences at the site of impact as well as some kilometers away. In order to increase understanding of these hazards, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale flume investigate the wave characteristics in the near-field and far-field based on a variety of landslides. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first objective is to examine the difference between the near-field maximum wave amplitude generated by highly mobile (water) and dry granular landslides. The results indicate that quantifying time and length scales are imperative in order to accurately estimate the maximum amplitude for highly mobile flows. The relationship between the time and length scales has a direct influence on the wave amplitude. The dry granular landslide decelerates much faster and therefore produce a smaller near-field maximum wave amplitude than those produced by highly mobile flows. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second objective is to investigate the relationship between near-field wave shape of an impulse generated wave and the landslide properties. Quantifying the wave shape in terms of asymmetry allowed for the development of a novel framework, which provides a time-series for an impulse wave generated by a landslide with certain characteristics of thickness and velocity. &#xd;
&#xd;
The third objective explores the near-field maximum wave amplitude generated by a higher mobility granular flow. The impulse waves generated in this study were in between the amplitude of the dry granular and highly mobile flows previously tested. This indicates that mobility can be quantified using the relationship between the time and length scales, and impulse waves generated by the highly mobile (water) flows is an accurate upper-bound of mobility.</description>

   <description>Traditionally unclothed, the figure of Eve made a sudden appearance on highly visible areas in the interior and exterior of European churches, built during the great architectural efflorescence of ca. 1100, now characterised as the Romanesque. Adapted, re-read, and sexualized, the story of Eve advanced particular agendas surrounding sex and gender. She became a plastic translation of socio-religious ideology, which imagined Eve’s body as a site of sin. &#xd;
&#xd;
Concerned mostly with the imagery of Eve between ca. 1080 to 1200, this dissertation not only explores the broad iconographical tradition of Eve in French Romanesque sculpture, but also places key monuments, such as the lintel fragment from Saint-Lazare Cathedral (ca. 1120), Autun, into a fuller context that includes regional trends, vernacular and religious literature, and socio-historical issues. Focusing on primary source material, textual evidence, and cultural context, this dissertation applies a multidisciplinary approach that includes digital humanities methods. Not only is it concerned with the application of current discourses of femininity and gender into pre-modern issues, but it also displays its findings through contemporary technological tools, making its scientific contribution more accessible and representative of its time. &#xd;
&#xd;
Moreover, this dissertation investigates codes in non-phonetic scripts and cultural practices for a more complete grasp of medieval visual expression and gender issues. It articulates the ways monumental Romanesque sculptures of Eve, which are in some respects similar to contemporary billboards, are not only passive reflections of political, religious (or secular/cultural), and social realities, but are also commodities and objects that act as social agents to remodel, challenge, and influence their society. In this context, the dissertation acknowledges the broader ideological systems present in Western Mediterranean societies. It identifies monumental French Romanesque sculptures of Eve as a possible precursor to modern-day advertisements — most especially those promoting perfumes that operate as performative image sources for and of female identity.</description>

   <description>N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) borane systems have become an important topic in main group chemistry. Finding uses as catalysts, coordinators for radical polymerizations, and reagents in a variety of reactions, NHCs have become a very important ligand for fundamental research. However, there have been relatively few studies on NHC-boranes over the last fifty years. This thesis will make new strides in the understanding and reactivity of NHC-boranes with UV light.&#xd;
&#xd;
Modeling after a previous result, NHC-BH3 systems were investigated for their photoreactivity. The systems investigated were found to decompose under irradiation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The systems were shifted to NHC-BH2R where the R group has a b-hydrogen relative to the boron center. When exposed to UV light a facile reaction occurred, akin to a b-hydrogen elimination reaction. The resulting products are an NHC-BH3 and the corresponding alkene from the elimination.&#xd;
&#xd;
BMes2 moieties chelated by an NHC were synthesized, analogous to previous work. When irradiated by UV light, mesitylene was eliminated, yielding a new B-C pi-bond. This new system contains an imbedded 1,3-azaborine within its multicyclic structure and is the first example of this type. When the precursor was heated, the boron moiety was eliminated and the ring closed to make a new 1H-imidazo[1,2-a]indole. This new compound shows a striking similarity to pyrido[2,1-a]isoindole (iczH). Like iczH, there is a new highly nucleophilic carbon center at the apex of the new 5-membered ring.&#xd;
&#xd;
Due to synthetic ease, iczH was selected to test nucleophilicity in place of the 1H-imidazo[1,2-a]indole. The reactivity of iczH as a nucleophile was explored with a variety of transition metals and main group elements. A normal adduct was formed when reacted with a platinum(II) center, while an 6 complex was formed with a chromium(0) center. When iczH was reacted with group 11 metals(I), a redox reaction took place, producing the solid metal, protonation iczH, and a dimer of iczH. A chlorophosphines was found to be very reactive with iczH once again resulting in protonated iczH while also producing an icz-functionalized phosphine. Despite the HOMO residing on the carbon of the icz unit, the phosphorous atom (dominant in HOMO-1) was still the favoured nucleophile when reacted with borane, producing a new borane-phosphine adduct. These new compounds were fully characterized by NMR and X-ray crystallographic analysis.</description>

   <description>Caenorhabditis elegans inhabit heterogeneous environments and are often faced with&#xd;
diverse environmental cues. The nematode must modulate behavioural and physiological&#xd;
mechanisms to avoid aversive environmental conditions while favouring conditions that promote&#xd;
growth. Therefore, organisms must detect environmental cues via sensory neurons, integrate&#xd;
sensory evoked signals via interneurons, and modulate downstream pathways dependent on&#xd;
environmental context. Internal cues, such as a well fed or starved condition, can also&#xd;
reconfigure the neural circuitry. Interneuron AIB functions as an integration hub that integrates&#xd;
sensory-evoked signals and fine-tunes locomotory behaviours.&#xd;
Previous work has highlighted that galanin-like G-protein coupled neuropeptide receptor&#xd;
NPR-9 and stimulatory glutamate gated cation channel receptor GLR-1 function in anterior&#xd;
interneuron AIB. npr-9 loss-of-function and over-expression mutants display abnormal&#xd;
spontaneous locomotion patterns. Hence, we evaluated npr-9 and AIB-specific glr-1 mutant&#xd;
locomotory phenotypes in response to diverse environmental cues. We have shown that NPR-9&#xd;
functions in concert with GLR-1 to regulate AIB activity. We also highlighted that overexpression&#xd;
of npr-9 interferes with locomotory modulation suggesting that NPR-9 upregulation&#xd;
inhibits the capacity of AIB to integrate environmental cues. This phenotype persists in the&#xd;
context of starvation suggesting that NPR-9 and AIB are also required for internal cue dependent&#xd;
modulation.&#xd;
AIB regulation via NPR-9, serotonin gated chloride channel MOD-1, and tachykinin&#xd;
GPCR TKR-2 also regulates lipid metabolism, likely via the control of glutamate release. In the&#xd;
context of the locomotory circuit, glutamate release inhibits inter/motor neuron RIM via&#xd;
inhibitory glutamate gated chloride channel receptor AVR-14. Transforming growth factor beta&#xd;
(TGF-β) receptor homolog receptor DAF-1 has been found to function in RIM and is regulated&#xd;
via glutamatergic signaling. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of AIB glutamate release on&#xd;
daf-1 lipid phenotypes. We highlight that diverse receptors in AIB can influence lipid&#xd;
metabolism and feeding behaviour, while the influence of starvation also appears to be integrated&#xd;
by AIB in the regulation of the aforementioned phenotypes. Collectively, this thesis indicates&#xd;
that interneuron AIB integrates diverse signals from sensory neurons to modulate an array of&#xd;
behavioural and physiological signaling pathways dependent on internal and external cues.</description>

   <description>A Master’s Report submitted to the School of Urban and Regional Planning in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Urban and Regional Planning.</description>
   <description>The objective of this research was to provide justification and best practices for linking disaster and emergency management policies and goals within coastal municipalities on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. There is increasing literature to support that the most effective approach to Disaster and Emergency Management (DEM) is through local integration of resilience-based DEM policy with urban planning practices and policies; however, this is not yet common practice for many communities in Canada. In British Columbia, local authorities are responsible for both DEM and Urban Planning, but these functions are mandated by separate provincial legislation and implemented through different plans. This translates into two unnecessarily separated functions at the regional district and municipal level that do not contribute to overall community resiliency. In this research, the Official Community Plans (OCP) of four municipalities, Victoria, Courtenay, Nanaimo, and Port Alberni, were analyzed to determine how and to what extent disaster and emergency management policy is currently incorporated into the plans. From these results, the identification of barriers and opportunities, and confirmation interviews with four professionals, four Provincial level and eight municipal level recommendations were provided to enable greater incorporation of DEM into OCPs and improve overall community resilience to disasters.</description>

   <title>Deficits in Eye Movement Control in Adults with FASD</title>

   <description>Individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are believed to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system (CJS). However, accurate reporting of prevalence rates of FASD in the CJS is a significant clinical challenge. This is a reflection of the fact that the diagnostic process requires collaboration from a multidisciplinary team, and there is a low clinical capacity in Canada for diagnosing FASD. In addition, screening every individual that enters the CJS in this way is prohibitively expensive. However, identifying individuals with FASD in the CJS is essential for two reasons. First, understanding the true prevalence rates of FASD will aid in developing much-needed programming and rehabilitation plans to better address the needs of these individuals. Second, rapid identification of these individuals within the CJS will lead to better outcomes for the individuals, and potentially reduce the high rates of recidivism. &#xd;
Tracking eye movement behaviours has been shown to differentiate children with FASD from typically developing controls. This may be due to the substantial overlap in the areas of the brain known to control saccades, and the areas known to be sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure. To the best of our knowledge, studies investigating eye movement control in adults with FASD have never been performed. The objective of this study was to investigate whether eye tracking can differentiate between adults with FASD in the CJS and control groups for each factor (FASD and CJS involvement). In this study,  criminal justice involvement did not significantly affect eye movement control. As a result, adults with FASD were compared directly with adults without FASD, regardless of criminal justice involvement. Compared with control adults (n=22), adults with FASD (n=15) exhibited significant differences in eye movement performance, including an overall decreased proportion of correct trials, as well as deficits in accuracy, attention, response inhibition, working memory, and variability. These results support the notion that eye movement tracking identifies differences in brain function between adults with FASD and controls, and could contribute to an inexpensive, rapid, and reliable screening tool for FASD that may one day be used in the CJS.</description>

   <title>Passive Lower-Limb Exoskeletons for Human Gait Assistance: Development and Evaluation</title>

   <subject>Assisting Human Walking</subject>
   <description>Walking is the basis of human locomotion. With an increasing aging population, the need for devices that assist human walking are in demand. While several simple devices exist such as canes, braces, and walkers, to assist the elderly or individuals suffering from gait impairment, these devices often limit the user’s performance and increase their energy expenditure during walking. Recently autonomous exoskeletons that reduce the user's energy expenditure without limiting their performance have been developed. Unfortunately, these exoskeletons are heavy and have limited operating time due to their actuation mechanisms and power demands.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis focuses on the development and testing of passive lower limb exoskeletons that assist level walking. Passive or un-actuated exoskeletons, are naturally lighter and fully autonomous since they do not rely on electro-mechanical actuators to assist the user. This reduces the environmental impact and provides accessibility to populations without access to a power source. Like the mechanical wristwatch, passive exoskeletons utilize the potential energy of the user’s natural motion to “power” the assistance. This potential energy is otherwise dissipated in the body in deformation of soft tissues or as heat. By harnessing the potential energy and releasing it at properly timed intervals, it is possible to reduce the metabolic energy expenditure of the user and reduce the onset of fatigue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Three passive exoskeleton devices to assist the user during level walking were developed using two approaches. The first approach attempts to minimize the step-to-step transition cost of walking, where energy is lost due to collision of the leading leg with the ground. The approach focuses on a method of reducing the energy lost during the collision and using the energy to assist the trailing leg. The second approach examines assistance of the leg joints during walking. This approach follows an inter-joint energy transfer paradigm where potential energy at one joint is used to assist a different joint. The performance of each device and their effects on the biomechanics and energetics of the user are presented. Contributions of this thesis further our understanding of the mechanics in human locomotion and interactions with passive exoskeletons.</description>

   <title>Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Stability of Horizontal Boreholes during Horizontal Directional Drilling</title>

   <description>This thesis focuses on the stability of horizontal boreholes in sand and saturated clay during Horizontal Directional Drilling. For saturated clay, new criteria for distinguishing tensile and shear failure were developed and case studies were used to support the criteria. New ‘risky’ and ‘dangerous’ zones along the drilling path were defined. Lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest influences the failure mechanisms and an overview of this coefficient was presented including lessons learned from the tests for obtaining this coefficient. Hydro-sand and sandy gravel were used for the tests presented in this thesis and the influence of compaction effects has been investigated. Contrary to conventional understanding, no obvious compaction-induced earth stresses were observed. For sand, a series of medium-scale mud loss experiments have been successfully conducted. The relationships between maximum allowable mud pressure (P_max) and burial depth, pump rate and multi-layer stratigraphy (dense sand overlain by loose sand or dense sandy gravel) were examined. Values of P_max obtained using finite element analyses were close to the P_max results for experiments at different burial depths. Based on a parametric study undertaken using numerical modelling, a new design equation for calculating P_max in uniform sand has been developed. Case studies were also used to support the design equation and a new ‘dangerous’ zone was identified along the drilling path. In addition, stress paths (relationships between radial and hoop stresses at the crown of the borehole) calculated using finite element analyses that deviate from the elastic closed form solution have been investigated. Based on the experiments, P_max is independent of pump rates and dependent on parameters associated with the multi-layer stratigraphy. In practice, it is conservative to use the design equation when dense sand is overlain by dense sandy gravel and a reduction factor was developed for the design equation when a loose layer rests on top of the dense layer. Furthermore, mud travelling paths from the primary infiltration zone around the borehole along shear planes to the ground surface have been examined. Ground surface movement was monitored using Geo-PIV combined with a new post-processing method for diminishing ‘pseudo displacements’ in three-dimensional applications, and it is found that the maximum ground movement occurred just before mud flowed out of the soil rather than the moment when mud pressure reaches a peak value.</description>

   <description>People have been employing dogs to assist with conservation work for more than a century. While the literature documents the efficacy of using dogs in these roles, the welfare and experiences of these dogs has received little attention. I explored the lives of conservation canines in Canada through two case studies. My aim was to explore the roles, welfare, and environmental impacts of conservation canines in Alberta and Ontario in order to determine whether conservation canine programs offer humane and sustainable job opportunities – those that are good for animals, humans, and the environment. I employed qualitative research methods via interviews with canine handlers and participant observations, as well as quantitative methods to assess animal welfare using an ethogram. My findings suggest that conservation roles are good for dogs because dogs showed signs of enjoyment and little stress while working, and handlers primarily used reward-based training as opposed to punishment; however, aversive stimuli are used at times, thus welfare may be at risk in some cases. These roles are also good for people as handlers seemed proud of their work and showed strong connections with their canines. Finally, they are good for the environment as they help educate the public about conservation issues, such as invasive species, and deter natural resources-related crimes, such as poaching. This assessment is based on three major frameworks: animal studies, animal welfare, and sustainability. Based on my findings, I recommend implementing more rigid guidelines for the care of working dogs in order to ensure their long-term welfare in situations where welfare might be impaired. Future research should further investigate the handlers’ experiences and environmental impacts of this work and include physiological indicators of welfare. Other case studies should also be explored in order to provide a more complete representation of conservation canine programs and the extent to which they might be humane and sustainable.</description>

   <description>Background: Research shows that park quality, available amenities, and facilities are strongly associated with physical activity. However, the majority of the research evidence comes from studies conducted in high income countries (HICs). The main objective of the current study was to explore relationships between the quality of community sport and recreation spaces and their physical activity patterns in a low-to-middle income country (LMIC). A secondary objective was to compare these patterns between renovated and non-renovated sites. Methods: Data were collected from community sport and recreation spaces (n=10) throughout Guadalajara, Mexico. Direct observation measures were used to assess site quality (PARA) and collect information on user characteristics and physical activity levels (SOPARC). Pearson’s correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests were used in analyses. Results: Users were primarily male (66.6%), adult (48.4%), and sedentary (51.7%). There was a strong, significant relationship between the quality of sport and recreation spaces and all site users (r_partial= .775,p&lt; .05), as well as active users (r_partial= .826,p&lt; .01). No significant differences in group medians were detected among all site users or active users when renovated and non-renovated sites were compared.  Conclusions: Findings suggest that the quality of community sport and recreation spaces is related to physical activity behaviour. Additionally, there may be a threshold level of quality needed to attract users beyond which additional improvements in quality do not translate into a higher number of users. These results have the potential to optimize the design, maintenance and promotion of COMUDE (Municipal Council of Sport) sport and recreation spaces.</description>

   <description>Insufficient blood flow to the brain generates widespread neurological damage, yet not all brain regions are similarly vulnerable to ischemic injury. During stroke, failure of the Na+/K+-ATPase generates a robust anoxic depolarization that silences neurons in higher brain regions such as the neocortex, whereas the brainstem is capable of recovery and is therefore less sensitive to ischemic damage. The alpha subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase is primarily responsible for the ion transport rate, particularly the α1 and α3 isoforms which are expressed in neurons. Based on prior evidence that α3 isoform mRNA expression is proportionally greater in the brainstem whereas α1 isoform mRNA expression predominates in higher brain regions such as the neocortex and cerebellum, this study used immunoblotting to investigate the distribution of Na+/K+-ATPase α1 and α3 isoform proteins in the mouse and rat brain. It was determined that α1 isoform expression is higher in the neocortex and cerebellum, whereas α3 isoform expression is higher in the brainstem. In addition, the striatum and hippocampus express similar amounts of both the α1 and α3 isoforms of the Na+/K+-ATPase, although this may be due to a heterogeneous isoform distribution pattern as suggested by pilot immunohistochemical experiments. To assess whether elevated oxidative stress generates adaptive changes in Na+/K+-ATPase expression, isoform distribution was studied in the Aldh2-/- mouse model of oxidative stress, as well as in mice subjected to a chronic unpredictable stress protocol. No changes in Na+/K+-ATPase isoform expression were detected in these cohorts, except for a small but significant decrease in α1 isoform expression in the cerebellum of chronically-stressed Aldh2-/- mice compared to unstressed wild-type mice. To assess whether transient ischemia generates adaptive changes in Na+/K+-ATPase expression, isoform distribution was studied in rats subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24 hours of recovery. Pilot immunoblotting experiments suggested an increase in the expression of both α1 and α3 isoforms of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the infarcted striatum, indicating that the Na+/K+-ATPase may be implicated in selective neuronal vulnerability to ischemia, but not oxidative stress. This may help identify molecular targets for improving higher brain survival post stroke.</description>

   <description>This study investigated Chinese high school students’ motivational orientations as measured by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), and the extent to which motivational orientations contribute to learning engagement and language achievement in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. 390 high school students from Grade 11 at one secondary school in northern China completed a paper-based questionnaire that measures SDT motivational orientations, learning engagement, and self-perceived English proficiency. Their most recent English course test score was also collected as a language achievement indicator. The data was quantitatively analyzed to address the research questions. The results identified four dimensions of SDT motivational orientations and two factors of learning engagement among these Chinese high school English learners, and revealed extensive associations among motivational orientations, learning engagement, and their language achievement. Intrinsic motivation was confirmed to predict positive learning engagement and a high level of language achievement. Introjected regulation was noted to be a minor contributor to English test score. Compared to learning engagement, SDT motivational orientations remained to be strong determinants in contribution to various language achievement across all effective indicators, such as self-perceived language proficiency and test score. This study is important in addressing the foreign language motivation research gap of individual difference with a younger age group of high school students and within a unique English as a Foreign Language learning context in China.</description>

   <description>Laser keyhole welding and laser additive manufacturing are high intensity laser based advanced manufacturing techniques that offer numerous advantages over more traditional processes. However, because of the extreme spatial temperature gradients, both have complicated interaction physics that make them hard to control. Moreover, these techniques and their temperatures can prove exceptionally difficult to monitor because of these physics, which can fluctuate the emissivity wildly. This necessitates monitoring techniques that are high-speed and high-resolution to capture these dynamics. Inline coherent imaging (ICI) is a low coherence interferometric ranging technique that has previously been used to characterise the morphology of both processes. In this work, I developed a novel method to collect high-resolution, high-speed absolute temperature measurements during laser processing, inline temperature imaging (ITI), such that ITI can be used in conjunction with ICI. ITI offers spatial resolutions of 30µm at imaging speeds of up to 10kHz, for temperatures ranging from 1600K to 4500K. I have resolved spatial and temporal temperature dynamics in laser processing never before observed. Moreover, I highlight the potential future works of this technique, especially in conjunction with ICI, to better characterise more aspects of laser processing, with a hope for eventual real-time in-situ feedback control.</description>

   <description>There is a need for coach development programs that target coaches’ interpersonal behaviours (Lefebvre et al., 2016) and that are informed by behaviour change techniques (Allan et al., 2017).  In addition, current and future coach development programs could benefit from comprehensive evaluations to determine their impact on the coaches and athletes involved (Evans et al., 2015).  Recently, Turnnidge and Côté (2017a) developed the Transformational Coaching workshop to fill these gaps in the literature.  Informed by the full-range leadership model (Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006) and the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie et al., 2011), the workshop offers coach education on a range of interpersonal behaviours using a leadership perspective.  Considering that the Transformational Coaching workshop has yet to be evaluated, the purpose of this study was to evaluate its impact by systematically observing coaches’ behaviours before and after their involvement in the workshop.&#xd;
	Participants included eight male head coaches of youth competitive soccer teams with an average of 14.25 years of coaching experience.  Systematic observation and coding using the Coach Leadership Assessment System (CLAS; Turnnidge &amp; Côté, 2016b) was employed pre- and post-workshop participation to examine the duration of coaches’ leadership behaviours. &#xd;
	Paired samples t-tests, bootstrapped confidence intervals, and effect sizes indicated that idealized influence (p = .067, d = .76), inspirational motivation (p = .087, d = .70), and intellectual stimulation (p = .132, d = .60) behaviours had confidence intervals that did not cross zero, thus approaching statistical significance.  However, from a pragmatic perspective, the workshop significantly influenced these behaviours considering the medium to large effect sizes observed.  Furthermore, following the workshop, coaches displayed less neutral behaviours (p = .007, d = 1.34).  Coaches also spent significantly more time, after the workshop, displaying leadership behaviours through instruction/feedback (p = 0.013, d = 1.17) and significantly less time displaying leadership behaviours through organization (p = .001, d = 1.90).  There were no significant differences in other leadership behaviours, modifiers, or recipients.  These findings offer detailed descriptions of how coaches’ behaviours changed after participating in the Transformational Coaching workshop.  Practical implications for the workshop and future research opportunities are discussed.</description>

   <title>Growing Pains: Exploring the implications of Urban Vertical Growth on Emergency Fire Service delivery in Toronto, Ontario</title>

   <subject>Urban Planning</subject>
   <subject>Vertical Growth</subject>
   <subject>Fire Services</subject>
   <description>High-rises have become second nature in today’s urban landscape, and Toronto is no exception. With defined geographical borders, the only place for new growth is up. While the growth is supported by Toronto’s Official Plan (2015), the shift to vertical growth has created issues for emergency services. One of these issues is in changes to response times because once firefighters arrive at the building; they must travel vertically to the site of the incident with all the equipment needed to respond to the emergency. This report examines how urban planners can help mitigate the risks posed by the Toronto Fire Services’ vertical growth challenge in the City of Toronto through the examination of three questions; (1) How is the delivery of emergency services by Toronto Fire Services (TFS) affected by vertical growth in Toronto?, (2) To what extent is there a difference between the provision of Fire Services in single detached homes (low density) and high-rise developments?, and (3) What planning solutions can be implemented to help Toronto Fire Services to continue to provide the public with the best service possible? This research utilized a mixed method approach examining case studies of other cities to examine potential planning solutions, Geographic Information Systems analysis to examine the impact of high-rises on the travel times of Fire Service apparatus’ using the NFPA standard four minute travel time, and an estimated vertical response time of two minutes, and interviews and focus groups with City of Toronto personnel to assess how the delivery of services has been impacted by vertical growth. Case study analysis revealed a number of lessons that the City of Toronto and TFS may consider. These include interdivisional collaboration amongst Toronto’s many divisions, and the inclusion of Fire Service in major planning documents (something not found in Toronto). GIS analysis found that with the current standard all residences can be reached within the four minutes. However, when the vertical element is accounted for a significant difference appears for high-rise buildings outside of the downtown core as the traditional suburbs of Toronto turn to densification in the form of high-rises while relying on stations placed for low density. Interview discussions found that many of the issues facing TFS are not a result of the physical high-rise structures themselves, but the ancillary impacts of the buildings, namely the number of people who have occupied them and spill out into the street network on a daily basis as well as a lack of proactive conversations surrounding developments and construction, and the narrowing of streets to make way for multi-modal transportation for those now populating the city. Based on the focus group and interviews a series of conversations were identified as necessary to mitigate the impacts of vertical growth, some of which have already begun. These include conversations around resource allocation, communication with the public, City, and Province, and systemic change to how residents view high-rise buildings, and the cost of densification. This report presents five recommendations for Planners to consider in their own work to mitigate the vertical challenge for Fire Services.</description>

   <description>The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming alpha subunit of the channel that conducts the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) in the heart. Reductions in IKr cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes individuals to potentially fatal arrhythmias that can be triggered by stress. One potential link between stress and hERG function is protein kinase C (PKC) activation. However, PKC regulation of hERG is complex and seemingly conflicting results have been reported. In the present study, both acute and chronic effects of PKC activation were investigated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on hERG channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Western blot analyses demonstrate that chronic PKC activation increases expression of intracellular and&#xd;
membrane-bound hERG protein. However, the increased channel abundance is accompanied by a decrease in hERG current (IhERG) after chronic PMA treatment. Furthermore, patch clamp data reveal that acute PKC activation reduces IhERG, and this effect is dependent on the presence of the N-terminus of the channel. Upon truncation of the N-terminus of hERG, chronic activation of PKC increases both hERG protein expression and current. The increase in hERG protein is&#xd;
partially mediated by reduced degradation of mature hERG channels. This results from increased phosphorylation of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 subtype 2 (Nedd4-2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates hERG degradation. These findings demonstrate that PKC regulates hERG in a balanced manner, increasing expression while decreasing current.</description>

   <description>This dissertation assembles four previously published articles on the subject of queer archives and evidence. Published over a period of almost thirty years, the articles reflect the author’s changing approach to archival evidence, changes related to his shifting response to queer politics and theory over this same period. The introduction situates the articles within the author’s ongoing work on the history of perversion as well as on queer relationality and temporality. It adopts Foucault and his ideas on the “insurrection of subjugated knowledge” to conceptualize archives and evidence as material and embodied; as non-identitarian; and as activist-oriented in order to critically intervene in state practices of liberal governance. The conclusion places the thesis in the context of the ‘new queer archive studies.’ It offers a critique of the over-aestheticizing and depoliticizing of archives and evidence within recent queer theory and assesses the prospects for the continued insurrection of archival evidence.</description>

   <description>The autonomic nervous system controls numerous effectors within the human body, working to adapt to changing environments. It is composed of three divisions: the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems. Sympathetic and parasympathetic activity have been related to emotion, cognition and behaviour. Sympathetic and parasympathetic influence on behavioural performance has been examined extensively; however, the autonomic modulation of performance in tasks involving distinct voluntary and automatic behaviours has not been directly investigated. Interleaved pro- and anti-saccade tasks (IPASTs) are regularly used to evaluate voluntary and automatic behaviour, respectively. The pro-saccade task requires an automatic visuomotor response whereas the anti-saccade task requires the suppression of an automatic response and the generation of a voluntary response in the opposite direction. We sought to investigate parasympathetic and sympathetic modulation of voluntary and automatic saccade behaviour using an IPAST. Thirty healthy human controls completed five blocks of trials (each block: 40 pro / 40 anti = 8 minutes) over 45 minutes. We explored the relationship between experiment duration, autonomic activity and performance in the context of this task as arousal varied. Eye movements, pupil size, electrodermal activity and electrocardiogram were measured throughout. The consecutive measurement of these peripheral autonomic indices further allowed for the investigation of the role of autonomic drive in their coordination.&#xd;
A clear effect of time-on-task on arousal was present in all three measures with arousal increasing across the first three blocks. This modulation of arousal however, was unrelated to task performance, which was unaffected by block number. Lastly, a task effect on performance was found, replicating previous studies. A task effect on arousal was also demonstrated. The changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity underlying this effect however are unclear. These findings suggest that the development of cognitive fatigue is not a concern in the use of the IPAST subtending 45 minutes. Additionally, further investigation of autonomic modulation of performance in the IPAST may contribute to the interpretation and analysis of related fMRI data and its application towards investigations of autonomic dysfunction in various neurological disorders. Moreover, the effects of task and block on arousal demonstrated here warrant further investigation.</description>

   <title>Steady-State Time-Domain Analysis of LLCL Resonant Converter</title>

   <subject>Time-Domain Analysis</subject>
   <description>This thesis presents a new LLCL resonant converter topology which is capable of providing zero voltage switching of MOSFET switches for a wider range of operating frequency as compared to conventional LLC resonant converter topology. The proposed topology (LLCL) is a modified form of conventional LLC resonant converter topology where an additional inductor is connected in parallel with the LLC resonant tank on the input side. &#xd;
&#xd;
For the analysis of a series resonant converter, frequency domain modelling (FDM) is usually sufficient due to the limited modes of operation. However, for a three or more element resonant tank, multiple modes of operation arises due to which FDM is restricted for analysis for operation below resonant frequency when the circuit enters in freewheeling mode otherwise known as Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM). Hence, a detailed time domain analysis is presented describing the steady state behavior of the circuit under continuous and discontinuous mode of operation.&#xd;
&#xd;
A comprehensive analysis of LLCL type converter is performed and compared with that of a conventional LLC resonant converter which demonstrates the benefits obtained by the proposed topology. Voltage gain and resonant tank component current stress is derived, as a function of various circuit parameters such as the ratio of inductors and normalized relative frequency, to assist in the design trade-offs.  The time domain analysis is verified with simulation studies using PSIM 11.0.</description>

   <description>With the goal of finding an effective condition monitoring tool for low-speed gearbox applications, vibration-based tests and Acoustic Emission (AE) tests have been performed on several gearbox sets in normal and faulty conditions.&#xd;
Vibration based tests were conducted both on-site and off-line. Vibration signals from the gearboxes were mostly corrupted by background noise, as was demonstrated by the close proximity of dominant frequencies in the frequency spectrum. Among those, 121.5 Hz was observed as the most significant dominant frequency for both on-site and off-line test regardless of speed changes. This frequency response was speculated to be a property of electrical noise.&#xd;
The AE tests were conducted on faulty and normal gearboxes at different shaft speeds from 3 to 35 rpm. Hit-based, time-driven and frequency domain AE parameters were used to compare their effectiveness. The count rate, absolute energy and signal strength were found to be good hit-based parameters in this application. The count rate was the best hit-based parameter with the largest parameter difference value at a shaft speed of 25 rpm. The absolute energy was observed to be the best time-driven parameter. Both frequency and time-frequency analysis results indicated that the faulty gearbox has higher spectral peaks in the lower frequency range, which was confirmed numerically by the frequency centroid difference.&#xd;
AE was shown to be superior to vibration signal analysis in condition monitoring of low-speed gearbox faults with numerous AE parameters identified as showing significant differences between normal and faulty gearbox conditions.</description>

   <description>Forest resource inventory (FRI) information is critical to sustainable forest management. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) offers a cost-effective option for modelling forest inventory, biophysical and ecological variables over large areas. Given that traditional ALS-based FRIs rely primarily on height data, the objective of this research was to examine the potential of ALS intensity data, multi-seasonal multispectral imagery, and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) for enhancing traditional ALS-based FRIs using a combination of non-parametric and parametric modelling techniques. For size class distribution estimation, the results of k-nearest neighbor imputation and random forest regression demonstrated that the combination of ALS height- and intensity-based metrics improved accuracy compared to models based on either type of metric alone. Using a hierarchical variable clustering technique, ALS intensity data were found to carry unique information complementary to passive near-infrared data, despite their similarity in wavelengths. Compared to ALS data alone, the addition of multi-seasonal imagery contributed to more accurate models of basal area and species mixture. In contrast, ALS height- and intensity-based metrics exhibited unparalleled utility for modelling stem density compared to optical imagery. Among the three multispectral sensors examined (i.e., Landsat-5 TM, Sentinel-2A and WorldView-2), Sentinel-2A proved to be the most cost-effective for enhancing ALS-based FRI, owing to its sufficient spatial resolution and inclusion of key spectral bands (i.e., red-edge and shortwave infrared). Compared to ALS, similar functional groups of metrics were found in DAP data, but DAP metrics lacked the capacity for characterizing canopy permeability. Due to the lack of penetrating echoes, gap fraction information was not well represented by DAP, resulting in suboptimal accuracy for LAI estimation compared to ALS. However, a comparison of functional groups between DAP and ALS identified tasks for which DAP is suitable (e.g., volume, forest successional stages, and species mix). Overall, this research demonstrates that ALS-based FRIs can be enhanced by additional sources of input, such as ALS intensity data and multispectral imagery; thereby demonstrating greater potential for more advanced FRIs for Canadian forests.</description>

   <description>I analyse the Sixties Scoop through the lens of Indigenous and feminist scholarship to contextualize the Scoop within the specific historical, political, and cultural moment of the postwar Canadian “welfare state” during which it was occurring. In the 1960s and 1970s, Canada was attempting to foment a unique “Canadian” identity that became increasingly tied to the values of cultural pluralism and tolerance. During this time, both the state and Indigenous activism questioned where and how Indigenous people would “fit” (or would not fit) into the burgeoning Canadian cultural “mosaic” of the late 20th century. Through an analysis of the 1966/67 federal government report, A Survey of the Contemporary Indians of Canada: Economic, Political, and Educational Needs and Policies (The Hawthorn Report), alongside articles from the Journal – Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies (JOACAS), mostly authored by social workers about reserve communities in Northern Ontario during the 1960s and 1970s, I aim to illuminate the intimate relationship between capitalist development, settler colonialism, and patriarchy in postwar Canada. I argue that one of the causes of the Scoop was the inability of governments and Children’s Aid Societies (CAS) administrators and frontline service providers to conceptualize the mass apprehension of Indigenous children from their homes during the 1960s to 1980s as holistically and inextricably connected to the social, political, cultural, and economic aspects of Indigenous people’s lives.</description>

   <description>Evolvability is a population's ability to change its underlying genetic makeup through natural selection, to evolve. Most measures of short-term evolvability relate genetic change to the abundance and geometry of standing genetic variation, making the additional assumption that this structure is captured by the genetic variance-covariance matrix G; G applies in only the multivariate normal scenario. Because we observe non-normality in natural distributions and are often unable to verify statistically whether a particular distribution is normal, we propose an alternate approach to discussing the short-term evolvability of general populations.&#xd;
Changes in the underlying genetic makeup of a population are observed as changes in the relative frequency of the population's traits. This is fundamentally a change in distribution, and is best quantified using an information-theoretical approach. The resulting measure of evolvability and its constraints apply to any well-behaved distribution and are for normally distributed traits a function of G; we suggest that existing measures may be placed within our general formulation.&#xd;
Comparing the total constraint to the sum of univariate constraints on individual traits we quantify the constraint due to multivariate trait interactions; we propose this as an appropriate measure of pleiotropic constraint. We find that pleiotropic constraint is highly dependent on the total correlation information, and to advance towards a suitable null hypothesis for tests of pleiotropy we derive the distribution of this quantity under multivariate normal independence. For large system sizes this relates to the Marchenko-Pasteur distribution, and is approximately normal, obeying Lyapunov's central limit theorem.&#xd;
We demonstrate the unique theoretical and practical advantages of a distribution-level approach to evolvability using both simulated and real data from Drosophila. In line with intuition, incorrectly assuming an absence of non-normality in the  distribution of phenotypic traits leads to underestimation of the evolutionary constraint.</description>

   <title>The Impact of Vatican II on Catholic Religious Secondary Education in the Province of Ontario</title>

   <description>This thesis examines the impact of Vatican II on secondary religious education in Ontario. In order to understand this impact, pre-Vatican II secondary religious education is analysed beginning with the role of the papacy and the eventual imposition of Neo-Thomism on Catholic schools. The conditions of reception for the reforms of Vatican II, in particular for the Declaration on Christian Education, are also examined. During the long sixties secondary religious education experienced a fundamental shift as both the pre-Vatican II approach to education and the dominant theology of Neo-Thomism were abandoned. Influenced by both the Vatican II reforms and the conditions of reception, secondary religious education shifted from an objective, content-driven approach to a subjective approach that focused on the inner transformation of the individual and the establishment of a Christian community within the school.  By the late 1970s, an effort was made to establish a balance between these two approaches as Catholic schools struggled to deal with the pervasive influence of secularism and the collapse of the Catholic classicist culture. This thesis proposes a new curricular framework aimed at achieving this balance.</description>

   <title>A Rechargeable Zn-Cu Battery Using a Selective Cation Exchange Membrane</title>

   <description>The Daniell cell (Zn-Cu battery) offers several potential advantages over current battery technologies, but is held back by the problems of copper ion (Cu2+) crossover. We resolved this through employing a selective cation exchange membrane as the separator. The membrane allows sodium ions (Na+) to maintain ion transfer between the zinc and copper half-cells while preventing Cu2+ from entering the zinc half-cell. We observed that at equal electrolyte conductivities, the potential of zinc deposition is larger in sulphate electrolytes than in chloride electrolytes. Zinc nitrate electrolytes lead to the formation of zinc oxide (ZnO) which passivated the zinc electrode surface. In copper electrolytes, sulphate and nitrate electrolytes possessed nearly equal potentials for electrodeposition. Chloride-based copper electrolytes possessed large negative potentials for copper deposition due to the stabilization effect of chloride (Cl-) on the monovalent Cu+ intermediate species. Tafel analyses revealed that zinc deposition and dissolution had near identical kinetics in sulphate and chloride electrolytes when they were present at equal conductivites. We also observed through cyclic voltammetry and Tafel analyses that there is a small increase in the kinetics of both the zinc and copper electrochemical reactions as the active ion concentration was increased. Low levels of Cu2+ did not have a significant effect on the zinc electrode performance, but at 1000 ppm concentration of Cu2+, the overpotentials for zinc deposition and dissolution were much larger. It was observed at open-circuit that at low concentrations of catholyte, only very little Cu2+ was able to cross the membrane. Recharging the battery without any Na+ in the electrolyte was not possible. When 1.0 M sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) was added to the catholyte the battery was able to be successfully cycled 100 times with no noticeable losses in performance and only small amounts of Cu2+ crossing over. High coulombic efficiencies were observed at low current drains.</description>

scholars and transgender activists on transgender representation in media. The rubric aims to&#xd;
address the most salient issues found in contemporary transgender representation and guide its&#xd;
user toward identifying more inclusive forms of transgender visibility that resist stereotypes. The&#xd;
rubric is both a resource for the analysis of transgender visibility as well as the production of&#xd;

   <description>Introduction: Community integration (CI) has been known in the literature to promote physical and mental heath and well-being within the growing population of older adult immigrants in North America. However, the components of CI that promote this positive impact is unclear.&#xd;
Objectives: This study aimed to explore the components of CI for older adult immigrants.&#xd;
Methods: Relevant articles for this scoping review were found using Arskey and O’Malley’s framework. Sixty-six articles were found using PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, Sociological Abstracts, &amp; CINHAL.&#xd;
Results: Findings reveal that CI is defined by six components: (1) Employment; (2) Social Integration; (3) Healthcare Access/Availability; (4) Religious/Spiritual Participation and Cultural Practice; (5) Availability and Access to Services/Community/Leisure Services; (6) Feeling at Home/Being Related to Family. The barriers and facilitators were explored for each component.&#xd;
Conclusions: This research evidence reveals the significance of CI for older adult immigrants and addressing the service gaps should be a priority for North America's healthcare system.</description>

   <description>Technological change refers to the ways in which physical objects, practices, and knowledge develop over time. Marketing and consumer research understand technological change and its impact on market structures as processes of diffusion. These processes follow predictable patterns in which innovative technologies with objectively superior capabilities or performance are more likely to diffuse, displacing existing technologies. While this progression from the past to the present remains central in most theories linking technological change and marketplace structures, the role of the future remains under-examined. Recent empirical work in market and consumer research emphasizes the role of the future on how individuals think and act in the present, suggesting that interpretations of the future play an important role in the relationship between technology and marketplace structures. Drawing on the sociological theory of Castoriadis, this thesis examines cultural narratives of future-oriented social imaginaries surrounding a given technology and how these imaginaries come to shape current marketplace activity. Through an ethnographically-informed longitudinal study (2012-2018) of the emerging markets for 3D printing hardware, software, and services, I find market actors making sense of 3D printing through four distinct future-oriented social imaginaries linked with hybrid market mythologies. Rather than only superior technology diffusing through the marketplace, the findings reveal the diffusion of future-oriented social imaginaries, and how this diffusion relates to the ongoing development of market arrangements. I discuss the implications of these findings for studies of market systems, diffusion of innovations, and unintended market change.</description>

   <title>A Novel Mechanism of Tumour Cell Drug Resistance Induced by the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Immune Checkpoint</title>

   <description>Immune checkpoints are regulators of the immune system that are critical for self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity. The programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint is often co-opted by tumour cells to escape the immune system. Whereas most studies on the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint focus on mechanisms leading to inactivation of immune effectors, we have shown that binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 on the surface of tumour cells leads to activation of oncogenic pathways as well as resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in tumour cells. Development of drug resistance is responsible for treatment failure in over 90% of patients with metastatic cancer. Autophagy is a well-established mechanism of drug resistance in cancer cells. Hence, we hypothesized that PD-1/PD-L1 signalling induces drug resistance in tumor cells by up-regulating autophagic pathways. &#xd;
&#xd;
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that exposure of human breast cancer cells to recombinant PD-1 (rPD-1) resulted in a time-dependent increase in LC3-II as well as Beclin1 protein levels, two important mediators of autophagy. 4T1 mammary carcinomas from mice treated with rPD-1 also showed increased levels of LC3-II protein levels. Moreover, imaging of breast cancer cells expressing GFP-tagged LC3 revealed a time-dependent increase in autophagosome formation following administration of rPD-1. Inhibition of autophagy using chloroquine prevented drug resistance induced by PD-1/PD-L1 signalling. Furthermore, results revealed that exposure of breast cancer cells to rPD-1 resulted in increased extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and that ERK phosphorylation is required for PD-1/PD-L1 induced autophagy. These studies provide a rationale for the use of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockers and autophagy inhibitors as potential chemosensitizers in cancer therapy.</description>

   <title>How Do You Really Feel?: Two Experiments on the Impact of Affect on Investor Judgment and Decision Making</title>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis is to understand how investor judgments and decisions around an&#xd;
earnings announcement are influenced by affect. In the first study, I examine the impact of&#xd;
unrelated tweets on investor judgments when they receive a positive earnings announcement&#xd;
through Twitter. I find that both negative and positive affect elicited by posts in an investor’s&#xd;
Twitter feed unrelated to the investment results in investment attractiveness judgments that are&#xd;
lower than when unrelated tweets are neutral in tone. I find that a warning from the SEC about&#xd;
the impact of these irrelevant Twitter posts helps to reduce the influence of only negative&#xd;
incidental affect. Further analysis reveals that an investor’s ability to understand the cause and&#xd;
effect relationship of emotions achieves a similar debiasing result. In the second study, I examine&#xd;
how two types of negative affect, anger and fear, influence investor behavior after a negative&#xd;
earnings announcement. I find that anger and fear lead to very different information search and&#xd;
processing behaviors. Anger, while not impacting how much additional information an investor&#xd;
accesses, reduces how much time they spend reading materials and how deeply the information&#xd;
is processed. In contrast, fear leads to an increase in how much additional information is&#xd;
accessed, as well as increases the amount of time spent reading the materials; it also leads to&#xd;
better recall of that information. Results also show that anger causes investors to allocate less&#xd;
money to the firm that just announced negative earnings whereas fear did not affect investment.&#xd;
Finally, my results show that an investor’s ability to manage his/her emotions can reduce the&#xd;
influence of anger on investment decisions. Together, these studies extend the accounting and&#xd;
psychology literatures related to affect, earnings announcements, social media, attributions, and&#xd;
emotional intelligence. My findings have practical importance, suggesting that investors,&#xd;
managers, and regulators need to be aware that affect can arise due to the channel used to&#xd;
disseminate earnings and the language used by managers to explain earnings performance. The&#xd;
positive takeaway is that emotionally intelligent investors can insulate themselves from the&#xd;
influence of affect.</description>

   <description>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian men and is characterized by a dysregulated immune response which is influenced by cancer cell-intrinsic genetic aberrations. Loss of the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) occurs in 20-30% of PCa tumors and is associated with disease progression and an aggressive phenotype. Clinical and preclinical studies demonstrate that loss of PTEN expression correlates with decreased Type I Interferon (IFN1) pathway markers, suggesting that PTEN has a role in regulating the immune response by impacting IFN1 signaling. To characterize the role of PTEN in shaping cellular immune-related properties, we assessed cell-intrinsic IFN1 responses using NanoString gene expression analysis and secreted cytokine profiling in PCa cells with variable PTEN expression. We observed distinct response patterns at baseline and following treatment with IFN1 agonists. We generated PTEN knockout derivatives of PCa cells and observed statistically significant differences in expression patterns of IFN1 pathway genes in PTEN-deficient cells during normal growth and following treatment with IFN1 agonists. Genes involved in innate immune signaling, antiviral responses, and inflammation were significantly decreased in PTEN-knockout cells. Additionally, PTEN-knockout cells had significantly decreased secreted levels of major inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines including CXCL1 and CXCL10 compared to PTEN-intact PCa cells. Given the significance of the cross-talk between cancer cells and surrounding immune cells in cancer progression, these findings are important in elucidating the specific contribution of cell-intrinsic pathways to the PCa tumor microenvironment. This investigation may lead to exploitation of PCa cell-intrinsic IFN1 pathways for rational design and use of immune-based therapies to improve management of PCa.</description>

   <title>Asynchronous Complementary Dual Channel Current Source Gate Driver for Synchronous Buck Converters</title>
   <creator>Mckay, Robert</creator>
   <contributor>Jain, Praveen</contributor>
   <subject>Power Electronics</subject>
   <description>Currently there is a push for higher switching frequency DC-DC converters, especially in mobile and computer applications. Higher frequency operation allows for better transient performance and a reduction in the size of magnetic components. This leads to converters with a higher power density. However, certain challenges arise from operating at higher switching frequencies. Focusing on the Synchronous Buck Converter, efficiency may be degraded due to higher switching loss, higher diode conduction loss, and higher gate drive loss. &#xd;
	To increase efficiency, different gate drive configurations have been designed with the goal of minimizing losses for MOSFETs being switched at high frequencies. Higher efficiency operation at higher frequencies can be accomplished with resonant gate drives, which include an inductor in the gate drive. The advantages may include: a high, constant gate current that enables faster switching and the possibility to return gate drive current to the source as opposed to ground. However, few gate drives are able to capture both these advantages – the ones that do suffer from other disadvantages such as high component counts, high complexity, and high conduction loss in the gate drive.&#xd;
	An Asymmetric Complementary Dual Channel Current Source Driver is proposed in this thesis specifically designed for a Synchronous Buck Converter. Merits include: a constant, high gate current used to switch the Control MOSFET and Synchronous MOSFET; discharging the MOSFETs to the source, reducing gate drive losses; lower component count than other designs; and lower conduction loss due to reduced precharge and discharge intervals versus other designs. &#xd;
	There are two sides to the gate drive: one driving the Control MOSFET, the other driving the Synchronous MOSFET. A coupled inductor links the two sides of the gate drive and transfers charge between the gates of the MOSFETs.&#xd;
	The proposed gate drive is specifically designed to maximize efficiency when applied to a Synchronous Buck Converter. The efficiency is verified and compared via analysis and simulation, the operation of the gate drive was verified via simulation and experimentally.</description>

   <title>Riding the waves: The formation and evolution of vertical bending waves in Milky Way-like disc galaxies</title>

   <description>In this thesis we study the dynamics of vertical (bending) waves in Milky Way-like disc galaxies. The main goals of the thesis are to form a coherent picture for the formation and evolution of bending waves using three-dimensional $N$-body simulations, develop tools and machinery to aid in the study of vertical waves in both simulations and astrometric surveys, and to make predictions for what we might see in the analysis of Gaia data.&#xd;
&#xd;
The hallmark simulations presented in this thesis evolve a two-component disc embedded in smooth and `clumpy' haloes, where the latter contains multiple orbiting substructure. One of our main conclusions is that vertical (bending) waves should be generic, long-lived features of massive discs that can form with and without provocation from external agents, though the predominant type of vertical wave induced by the latter is dependent on the perturber's orbital parameters. Furthermore, we find that bending is a property almost exclusive to kinematically cooler (thin disc) stellar populations.&#xd;
&#xd;
In our simulations bending waves manifest as variations in mean vertical displacement and bulk vertical motions, that together behave largely as simple monochromatic plane waves. At intermediate radii they appear as tightly wound, short-wave corrugations that match smoothly onto the warp near the edge of the disc. By way of Fourier and spectral analyses, based on classical studies of in-plane density waves and further developed in this thesis for the study of vertical waves, we find that in general the waves are a superposition of modes that comprise two main branches on the radius-rotational frequency plane.&#xd;
&#xd;
The preeminent result of this thesis is a novel sequence of events describing the life-cycle of bending waves, which involves excitation, dispersion, phase-wrapping or shearing across the disc, self-gravitating wave-like action, and disc heating. This conclusion is largely borne out of the comparison between frequency power spectra of waves in our simulations with predictions from linear perturbation theory, and suggests that the wave-like features in astrometric surveys such as Gaia may indicate the existence of long-lived modes of a dynamically active disc in addition to perturbations from recent disc-satellite interactions.</description>

   <description>This work studies the use of two-dimensional (2D) crystal materials as mechanical elements in an electromechanical resonant system. 2D materials form crystals that have strong in-plane bonds but weak out-of-plane bonds, allowing for their separation into thin planar layers. Graphene and niobium diselenide are two such materials studied, and they are suspended as electrodes in a parallel plate capacitor. When this capacitor is integrated into an electromagnetic resonant circuit, any movement of this suspended material will greatly effect the resonance frequency of the circuit. Measurement of the resonance frequency allows a dispersive readout of the motion. This system of two coupled harmonic oscillators has the potential to demonstrate strong coupling where the two must be described in a combined state. The light-matter interactions can pave the way to quantum-limited measurement of position and perhaps a means to control, measure, and store qubit information in quantum computing systems.&#xd;
&#xd;
A method to fabricate and optically characterize suspended capacitor devices was developed with the ultimate goal of testing in a dilution refrigerator. Low loss superconducting aluminum integrated circuits were designed and made with these capacitors to allow microwave readout and interaction with the motion of the vibrating membrane materials. Predictions on the microwave electromechanical sideband output shows feasibility for future cryogenic measurements of the 2D crystal motion.</description>

   <description>Asymmetric matching alleles models assume that each parasite genotype specializes on a matching host genotype to a different degree. We study system behavior of a single locus di-allelic asymmetric matching alleles model. Inline with other investigators, we make the counter-intuitive observation that intermediate levels of asymmetric matching lead the parasite genotype with the lowest fitness in it's matching host genotype to, on average, be at majority frequencies. The parasite genotype with the highest fitness in its matching host keeps the frequency of this matching host low, which keeps its own frequency low. Further analysis of our asymmetric matching alleles model yields three novel predictions. To begin, a facet of asymmetric matching whose study has been avoided involves the fitness implications of imperfect matching. Imperfect matching permits reduced fitness for parasites enacting a cross infection. Under imperfect matching, increasing the relative fitness for cross infections lowers the level of asymmetric matching required for a parasite genotype to have the highest fitness when infecting any host, which would drive this parasite genotype to or near fixation. Having this high fitness parasite genotype near fixation yields a selection pressure within the host population to mitigate parasite success by having a high frequency of the cross infection host genotype. The second model prediction demonstrates that asymmetric matching can lead to increased system stability by dampening oscillations and lowering the amount of mutation needed for stability. Finally, our analysis predicts that the magnitude of antagonism between parasites and hosts has a large effect on the genetic composition and system behavior of the host-parasite system. We find that parasite and host mutation contribute differently to these antagonism-mediated effects. Overall, studying the single locus system behavior of asymmetric matching allele models should allow for better informed future studies concerning the effects that asymmetric matching has on; polymorphism incidence, recombination rate and mutation rate evolution.</description>

   <title>Reaction of CS2 and CO2 with Amidines and Guanidines</title>
   <creator>Alshamrani, Aliyah</creator>
   <contributor>Jessop, Philip</contributor>
   <subject>CS2, CO2, Amidines, and Guanidines</subject>
   <description>Neutral organic bases such as amidines and guanidines are very useful in studies of the reactivity of heterocumulenes such as carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to build C-C or C-N bonds. Reaction of amidines with CS2 in the absence of water and without adding desulfurization reagents or solvents is less documented. In this research I have investigated different types of sulfur and nitrogen containing products obtained upon reaction of carbon disulfide with cyclic and acyclic amidines. The reactivity behaviour and the resulting products depend on the structure of the starting amidines. Our observations for the contrasting reactivity were supported by calculations of the free energy of the reaction.&#xd;
&#xd;
     1,4,5,6-Tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives, as examples of cyclic amidines, follow different reactivity compared to acyclic amidines. They also follow different patterns of reaction with CS2 depending on their structures. Possessing an N-H bond allows the cyclic amidine to form a dithiocarbamate salt {[BH+] [(B-CS-2)-(H)]}, where B is the starting amidine, analogous to those formed by secondary amines [R2NH2][R2NCO2] and [R2NH2][R2NCS2] with CO2 or CS2, respectively. If the molecule does not possess an N-H bond then observed reactivity depends on whether there is a methylene alpha to the amidine carbon. Having such a methylene group promotes the formation of trithioanhydride. A tetrahydropyrimidine having neither an N-H bond nor an alpha methylene forms an unstable zwitterionic adduct (B-CS2).&#xd;
&#xd;
     The acyclic amidines and their analogues (e.g., acetamidines and TMG) have the ability to rotate around the (C=N) bond to form a four-membered cyclic transition state which cleaves to form two molecules: isothiocyanates (RNCS) and thioacetamide or tetramethylthiourea (TMTU) in the case of the guanidine. Such rotation cannot happen in cyclic amidines due to their rigidity. &#xd;
&#xd;
        Alkylation reactions performed on the products of the reaction of 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidines and CS2 lead to the formation of dithiocarbamate salts and dithiocarbamate esters and other interesting compounds. Compounds structurally related to these products have significant medical applications. The alkylation products also serve to confirm the proposed structures of some of the products obtained from the initial reactions with CS2.&#xd;
&#xd;
      Both cyclic and acyclic amidines and their analogues were exposed to different CO2 pressures (1 or 60 bar) under various temperatures (room temperature or 60 oC) in order to form carbamic acid or carbamate products, but either bicarbonate salts or no reactivity were observed.</description>

   <description>The interaction of organic molecules with metal surfaces to form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been extensively investigated. The formation of SAM on metal surfaces has potential applications in microelectronics, chemical sensing and metal protection in which the SAM quality and stability play critical roles. Thiols are the most widely used in SAM technology. However, the metal-thiolate bond is rapidly oxidized under ambient conditions. Therefore, new ligands were investigated to replace thiols, namely N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). NHCs are well known as ligands for transition metal complexes. Consequently, they are strong candidates for SAM formation on transition metal surfaces. So far, NHCs have been applied to gold surfaces, which produced films with remarkable stability. However, less is understood about the interaction of NHCs with other transition metals. One particularly interesting transition metal is copper, which has significant applications in electronics, heat transfer, etc. Copper is cheaper than gold, but it is easily oxidized and corroded in different media, thus finding a method of preventing this oxidation is very important. Here, we present a study of NHC interactions with clean and oxidized copper surfaces at different temperatures. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments have been carried out, using both a standard XP spectrometer at fixed X-ray energy, and experiments at variable photoelectron energies carried out at the Canadian Light Source synchrotron. The result shows that exposing the oxidized copper surface to the NHC solution led to a complete removal or reduction of the oxide layer from the surface, followed by a SAM formation on the reduced surface. Evidence from mass spectrometry shows copper and oxygen complexes in the solution, which proves the ability of the NHCs to interact with the oxide layer and remove it from the surface. Further experiments carried out at varying temperature and NHC exposure times have revealed further details on the mechanism of carbene reaction with the surface. These results show promise in gaining a more fulsome understanding of the dynamics of NHC interactions with Cu, with a view to designing surfaces that are passivated towards oxidation.</description>

   <description>Subfornical organ (SFO) neurons exhibit heterogeneity in ionic current expression and spiking behaviour, where the two major phenotypes appear as tonic and burst firing. Insight into the mechanisms behind this heterogeneity is critical for understanding how the SFO, a sensory circumventricular organ, integrates and selectively influences autonomic nervous system, endocrine, and behavioural function. To integrate efficient methods for investigating this heterogeneity, we built a single-compartment, Hodgkin-Huxley type model of an SFO neuron that is parameterized by SFO-specific in vitro voltage-clamp data. The model accounts for the individual membrane potential distribution and spike train variability of tonic and burst firing SFO neurons. Analysis of model dynamics confirms that a persistent Na+ and a Ca2+ current are required for burst initiation and maintenance, and suggests that a slow-activating K+ current may be responsible for burst termination in SFO neurons. Additionally, the model suggests that heterogeneity in current expression and subsequent influence on spike afterpotential underlies the behavioural differences between tonic and burst firing SFO neurons. The use of our model in coordination with in vitro electrophysiology experiments, provides a platform for explaining and predicting the response of SFO neurons to various combinations of circulating signals, as demonstrated by our preliminary investigation of inflammatory and cardiovascular signal integration. Our model predicts that 24-hr incubation in tumor necrosis factor alpha, an inflammatory cytokine, will result in the potentiation of SFO neuron excitability in response to angiotensin II. This prediction provides a potential mechanism to support previous findings that inflammation may be potentiating angiotensin II actions in the SFO. Future studies will work to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the integration of physiologically important signals in the SFO.</description>

   <description>This study develops a measure of accounting consistency based on the idea that the accounting function is the accounting measurement system that managers use to translate economic events to financial statements. When a firm uses accounting policies and estimates consistently, one can estimate its current-year earnings accurately by applying prior years’ accounting function to the current-year economic events. Empirically, I find that my accounting consistency measure is positively associated with analyst following and forecast accuracy, and negatively associated with analyst forecast dispersion. To further test the effect of accounting consistency on analyst behavior, I examine the impact on analyst forecasts of accounting policy changes, which reduce accounting consistency. I find that accounting policy changes decrease analyst forecast accuracy and increase analyst forecast dispersion. These results suggest that accounting consistency benefits financial statement users.&#xd;
	This study also examines the impact of SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, on the information processing of financial analysts. SFAS No. 154 is issued to improve accounting consistency between periods when there is a voluntary accounting policy change. Using 969 voluntary accounting policy changes from 1994 to 2015, I find that the impact of voluntary accounting policy changes on analyst forecast accuracy and dispersion is weaker under SFAS No. 154 than under the predecessor standard, APB Opinion No. 20, indicating that SFAS No. 154 improves financial reporting usefulness by enhancing accounting consistency. This finding provides evidence for standard setters and regulators regarding the benefits of SFAS No. 154 adoption.</description>

   <description>Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Progress has been made in diagnosing and treating this condition, however the mechanisms by which it develops have yet to be fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays an important role in cardiovascular disease. Cytokines are elevated in patients with hypertension and heart failure, as well as in animal models of these conditions. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a cytokine, has been shown to increase blood pressure and sympathetic output, and it is critical in the development of hypertension. It has been determined that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the central nervous system mediates the effects of TNFα. Knockdown of the TNFα receptor in the SFO ameliorates sympathoexcitation following heart failure, further suggesting a mechanism by which TNFα acts in the SFO to regulate cardiovascular function. However, it is unknown how TNFα modulates SFO neurons to cause these effects. Therefore, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and [Ca2+]i imaging on dissociated SFO neurons isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats to determine their activity in response to TNFα. We found that acute application of TNFα depolarized 50% of SFO neurons and increased their firing rate. We also found that chronic treatment of SFO neurons with TNFα increased their excitability, an effect that was mediated, at least in part, by a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation threshold of the voltage-gated Na+ current. Furthermore, we observed that TNFα potentiated angiotensin II-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in SFO neurons. This effect was also mediated by the voltage-gated Na+ current, as tetrodotoxin prevented this potentiation. These data suggest cellular mechanisms by which TNFα increases blood pressure and sympathetic activity through actions in the SFO, and thus provide new insight into how circulating inflammatory cytokines may contribute to cardiovascular regulation in health and disease.</description>

   <description>TAZ is a transcriptional co-activator and an effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. Since its discovery in 2000, we have gained tremendous insights into the roles TAZ plays in development and disease. TAZ acts as an oncogene in human breast cancers. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that TAZ directs multiple aspects of breast cancer cell behaviour (e.g. cell proliferation, cell migration/invasion, stem cell phenotypes, chemotherapy resistance). While these processes represent critical cancer cell-intrinsic functions for TAZ, little is known about how breast cancer cell TAZ expression affects the ways that cancer cells respond to, or manipulate, factors in their tumour microenvironment (e.g. growth factors, non-neoplastic cells). Over the past decade, our lab has aimed to understand the precise gene targets transcriptionally regulated by TAZ that mediate its activities in breast cancer. In my thesis, I explore how TAZ influences breast cancer cell behaviour in response to extrinsic factors and identify specific gene targets of TAZ that mediate these interactions. First, I show that TAZ directly regulates the expression of a key component in the insulin signaling pathway, IRS1. Upregulation of IRS1 by TAZ contributes to TAZ-induced proliferation of mammary epithelial cells in 3D culture in the presence or absence of supplemental insulin. I next explore whether cancer cell TAZ expression can modify the anti-neoplastic immune response. I use NanoString to specifically screen for immune-related transcriptional targets of TAZ and discover that TAZ affects the mRNA expression of many gene targets that are relevant to immunology. I identify the immune checkpoint molecule, PD-L1 as a TAZ-regulated gene. Upregulation of PD-L1 by TAZ impairs T cell function in co-culture experiments. Interestingly, I uncover evidence that PD-L1 is not upregulated by TAZ in multiple mouse cell lines suggesting that this relationship may not be conserved across species. Through this work, I have uncovered two distinct mechanisms by which TAZ affects interactions between breast cancer cells and their environment. These findings provide insights into the roles of TAZ in neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease processes and may provide the foundation for future studies investigating novel strategies for targeting TAZ-high breast cancers.</description>

   <description>Altered metabolism is an inherent property of cancer and provides a rich opportunity for exploring its underlying biology and developing diagnostic biomarkers. We used desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) to investigate the spatial distribution of small metabolites and lipids within prostate biopsy core tissue. Thirty-five cores across 18 cases were analyzed and 965 regions of interest (ROIs) were selected corresponding to pathologically-validated benign or cancer tissue. A range of multivariate statistics were conducted to identify differentially abundant metabolites as well as for construction of a metabolic classifier of cancer tissue. Of the 25 differentially abundant metabolites, we identified increased citrate in benign tissue and increased glutamate in cancer tissue. We also identified increased levels of lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in benign tissue and increased fatty acids (FAs) and phospholipids in cancer tissue, including; PEs, phosphatidylinositols (PIs) and phosphatidylcholines (PChs). Our data is suggestive of differential lipid metabolism in prostate cancer (PCa) needed to support development and progression of the disease. We also found that the metabolic profile of PCa was reflective of the grade of the case rather than the grade of the individual biopsy core. Differential metabolites observed between grades of PCa displayed evidence of further dysregulated lipid metabolism with increasing aggressiveness.&#xd;
Additionally, we utilized a training cohort to construct a principal component analysis (PCA)/linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model which achieved an overall accuracy of 97%. Independent validation of this model on the remaining cases displayed an overall accuracy of 85%. Further studies will validate this PCa specific metabolic pathway as well as explore additional grades of PCa to identify metabolic profiles associated with each stage of aggressiveness. Ultimately, the validated accuracy of this classifier and the correlation of differentially abundant metabolites with established cancer metabolism, indicates that DESI-MSI is an effective tool for elucidating cancer metabolism with the potential for clinical translation.</description>

   <description>Since the mid 1900s, acidification has impacted water quality and threatened the ecological integrity of thousands of lakes and streams across Eastern North America and Europe. After the implementation of industrial emission reductions programs in the late 1960s, chemical recovery of historically acid-damaged lakes was observed, but a lag in biological recovery has been partially attributed to changes in multiple environmental variables, such as warming climate, shoreline development, and the introduction and spread of invasive species. To assess the continued recovery of historically acidified lakes, forty-four lakes were sampled for zooplankton and water chemistry in and around Killarney Provincial Park during peak emissions in 1972-73, through the decades after emission reduction programs were implemented in 1990, 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2016. We assessed changes in both univariate and multivariate zooplankton community metrics through time, and evaluated recovery using a reference lake approach that included 8 circumneutral lakes within Killarney Provincial Park and 55 non- acidified lakes in Algonquin Provincial Park. In addition, we assessed the relative importance of local biotic and abiotic variables in shaping recovering zooplankton communities in Killarney and Algonquin Provincial Parks. We found strong evidence for continued chemical and biological recovery in acidified lakes in Killarney Provincial Park. Species richness and diversity increased in acid-recovered lakes to values statistically indistinguishable from those of our reference lakes, and multivariate-based community composition shifted towards a community structure more similar to reference lakes. Several variables were identified as important drivers of zooplankton community structure, including pH and ion concentrations, nutrient concentrations, fish community, water clarity, maximum lake depth, and surface area, with environmental variables accounting for less variation in communities through time. Overall, these results indicated that recovery is still progressing in historically acidified lakes, and unlike similar Canadian Shield communities that did not experience severe acidification, pH and its legacy effects are still acting as primary drivers of zooplankton community structure in Killarney Provincial Park lakes.</description>

   <description>The focus of this investigation was to examine the acoustic trends present during operation of an automotive door closure at two impact speeds using experimental and computational methods. The impact speeds were 0.851m/s and 1.179m/s. Transient sound pressure measurements from five different door closure mechanisms were collected in a semi-anechoic chamber using a three-element condenser microphone array. Post-processing methodologies such as Sound Pressure Level versus 1/3 Octave Bandwidth and Continuous Wavelet Transform computations were conducted. These procedures provided an in-depth analysis on the overall generated sound in addition to identifying which frequencies dominate the response at the same time as specific impact events during latch operation. Sound quality metrics such as loudness and sharpness were used to explore how the impulsive sound relates to a consumer’s impression of the sound. It was suggested in past research that individuals prefer sounds that possess a ‘deep’ sound characteristic as opposed to sounds characterized as ‘metallic’. It was revealed that the overall sound quality was mainly influenced by the frequency composition of the sound. &#xd;
&#xd;
The focus of this study was the sound generated by the impact events present during the latch-locking operation. With ANSYS Rigid Body Dynamics and Explicit Dynamics, it was concluded that two impact events within the latch influenced the acoustic response. The impacts occurred between the Striker/Over-Slam Bumper #1 and the Ratchet/Housing. These were labelled as the primary and secondary impact events respectively. Investigation of the experimental sound data revealed that the faster entrance speed (1.179m/s) produced a sound with a larger normalized magnitude. Furthermore, the additional energy allowed frequencies approximately 2.5kHz and below to become more pronounced. The findings suggest that increasing the closing speed could produce a “more preferred” sound based on psychoacoustic principles. &#xd;
&#xd;
A computational acoustic analysis using ANSYS Workbench was performed to complement the experimental analysis. Only the primary impact event was simulated due to the inherent limitations of the workstation used to perform the analysis. Similarities between the computational and experimental data were present. However, it is recommended that an alternate simulation software that is capable of modelling “physical impacts” be used.</description>

   <description>The solvents used in painting and finishing are the primary source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, VOCs have been incinerated in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) that is heated using natural gas and emits significant amounts of CO_2 and H_2 O to the atmosphere [1]. The Fumes to Fuel process has been developed by Ford Motor Company to concentrate these VOCs. Optionally, hydrogen can be generated from the VOCs via steam-reforming, and purified for use in hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts. This process greatly reduces the amount of CO_2  emitted and generates clean energy. The overall efficiency of hydrogen production can be improved by adding a pre-reforming step before the primary steam reformer. The pre-reforming is done in the concentrator where a limited amount of VOCs are converted into hydrogen and carbon oxides. This work examined potential opportunities of the Fumes to Fuel process, including application throughout all automotive assembly plants as well as other industries to produce significant amounts of hydrogen for fuel cells. This study was followed by preliminary kinetic testing to validate an experimental setup that was built to test the catalytic performance of adsorbent supported VOC reforming catalyst. Methanol steam reforming kinetic measurements were done using a bench mark Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at temperatures of 200, 240, and 260 ºC. Rate constants and the activation energy from these tests were compared with values from the literature and good agreement was demonstrated. The experimental setup will be used in future studies of potential adsorbent supported catalysts for pre-reforming of VOCs. These catalysts were prepared by impregnating adsorbent materials with noble metals and then characterized, though improvements should be made to the procedure, included testing different supports. These catalysts are to be tested in the experimental setup in the future now that the experimental setup is proven. The objective is to use these results to evaluate the possibility of carrying out some pre-reforming in the desorber/concentrator step of the Fumes to Fuel process leading to improved overall performance.</description>

   <title>The role of extracellular vesicles in the transfer of multidrug resistance in human ovarian cancer cells</title>

   <description>Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Canadian women and has the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic malignancies. First-line treatment is typically cytoreductive surgery followed by a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Unfortunately, patients frequently relapse with drug resistant disease, and only 45% of patients survive beyond 5 years. Drug resistance results from multiple mechanisms, one of which is mediated by one or more of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters. The two ABC transporters considered clinically relevant in ovarian cancer are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). These plasma membrane transporters can efflux an array of solutes from the cell, including paclitaxel.&#xd;
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a collective term for nano-sized membrane vesicles released from all mammalian cells that can serve as cell-free vehicles to deliver a variety of biomolecules to recipient cells. The human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and 2008, and their drug resistant variants, AD645 and 2008/MRP1, which overexpress P-gp and MRP1, respectively, were used to investigate whether transporter-containing EVs can transfer drug resistance to sensitive cells. All four cell lines were shown to release EVs isolated by differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), as indicated by the presence of EV markers CD63, CD81, and syntenin-1 in immunoblots of EV extracts. P-gp and MRP1 were also detected in EV extracts from AD645 and 2008/MRP1 cells, respectively. DUC- isolated AD645 EVs appeared toxic to A2780 recipient cells and there was no detectable transfer of paclitaxel resistance after co-culture. SEC-isolated AD645 EVs were more enriched than DUC-isolated EVs for CD63, CD81, and syntenin-1, and appeared less toxic to A2780 cells.&#xd;
However, P-gp was not enriched in SEC-isolated AD645 EVs and there was no detectable ii&#xd;
transfer of paclitaxel resistance or P-gp to A2780 cells. These observations suggest that the amount of functional P-gp transferred to recipient cells was insufficient to confer detectable resistance. These studies suggest that although P-gp and MRP1 can be detected in cellular material consistent with the presence of EVs, additional experiments are needed to optimize isolation of transporter-enriched EVs and co-culture conditions to detect the transfer of drug resistance.</description>

   <description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex, multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory impairment and frequently presents with neuropsychiatric comorbidities, notably anxiety and depression. We have established Aldh2-/- mice as an oxidative stress-based model of age-related memory loss and cognitive impairment. However, very little is known about non-cognitive behavioural deficits, or if a sexual dimorphism exist in this model, as it does in humans. We performed a behavioural characterization of anxiety-related behaviours in response to aversive stimuli and depression-like behaviours related to despair and anhedonia. The performance of three cohorts at different time points (3-4, 7-8, and 11-12 months) was examined in a battery of behavioural tests consisting of an assessment of mobility and exploration (open field test), anxiety-related behaviour (light/dark box, elevated plus maze), and depression-related behaviour (forced swim test, tail suspension test, sucrose preference test). Compared to wild type mice, male and female Aldh2-/- mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviours that were first observed at 7 months of age. This anxious behaviour was prevented in Aldh2-/- mice treated with a deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acid (D-PUFA) diet for 10 weeks. Male Aldh2-/- mice exhibited a diminished preference for sucrose compared to wild type male mice. Dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary (HPA) axis presents along with AD, anxiety, and depression. It was postulated that HPA dysfunction may underlie anxious and depressed behaviours in this model. This was evaluated using a mild chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm. The sucrose preference test and serum corticosterone analysis revealed no differences in response to chronic stress or acute stress between Aldh2-/- and wild type mice. These data reveal previously unreported behavioural abnormalities in the Aldh2-/- model of AD-like cognitive impairment.</description>

   <description>Biojet fuel represents the best short-term option for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)&#xd;
emissions from the aviation industry. In the near term, biojet fuel is most likely to&#xd;
be produced via the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. Canola&#xd;
is one of the most readily available feedstocks for HEFA fuel production in Canada,&#xd;
and interest has been shown in developing a domestic supply chain for biojet fuel.&#xd;
However, there is substantial variation in the reported emissions reductions that&#xd;
HEFA biojet from crop-based feedstocks can offer. The primary concern surrounds&#xd;
the inconsistent inclusion of land use change emissions. In addition to infrequently&#xd;
including land use change emissions, previous life cycle assessments (LCAs) of canola&#xd;
biojet fuel have not used Canadian production data, or have failed to examine the&#xd;
sensitivity of calculated emissions intensity to variation in many LCA parameters.&#xd;
In this thesis, the emissions intensity of canola biojet was calculated across four co-product&#xd;
allocation methods both with and without land use change emissions. Land&#xd;
use change emissions from potential grassland conversion on the Canadian Prairies&#xd;
were estimated using a soil carbon model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on life cycle&#xd;
inputs and co-product allocation parameters was performed.&#xd;
Results suggested that without land use change, canola biojet fuel may provide&#xd;
emissions reductions of 35% to 54% compared to petroleum jet fuel. Land use change&#xd;
has an overwhelming influence on biojet fuel emissions intensity, and its inclusion&#xd;
results in negative reductions in most cases. Emissions intensity and the sensitivity&#xd;
to parameter changes varied across allocation methods. This research points to the&#xd;
importance of standardized LCA methodology, and to the development of advanced&#xd;
biojet fuel production pathways that do not compete for arable land.</description>

   <description>The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is an endangered species that inhabits fresh, brackish, and oceanic waters. Eels are elusive; little is known about their seasonal movements, depth distribution, and microhabitat associations in fresh water. Radio and acoustic telemetry was used in the slow-flowing upper St. Lawrence River (1.5-by-12-km section) to study 33 transmitter-implanted large yellow-phase resident eels from September 2014 to June 2017. Semi-monthly minimum movements peaked the last part of April (450 m), first part of May (393 m), and last part of October (283 m). Eels were inactive and dormant from the last part of December to the first part of April, when they emerged and moved into shallow water (&lt; 2.5 m) as water temperatures approached 10 ºC. Eels moved slightly deeper in summer as temperatures peaked, likely following prey-fish movements, started moving deeper in October as temperatures dropped below 8 ºC, and settled for the winter in December at approximately 3.8 m. Telemetry allowed precise locating of eels (approximately 1,500), enabling detailed examination of microhabitat associations. Substrate properties, vegetative biomass, and cover were analyzed throughout the study area to describe habitat that was available (34 sites), selected (31), and never frequented (non-selected, 6). Two general ecotypes were found: one that associated with soft substrate with vegetative cover, mainly the green algae Chara vulgaris, and the other with hard substrate and large rock cover. The soft substrate ecotype dominated (88%); sediment was significantly softer, quantified by an impact penetrometer, and higher in organic content (> 14 %) compared with available and non-selected habitats. Site fidelity among seasons and years was remarkable: four eels consistently used the same rock cover from spring to fall, but all eels overwintered in soft substrate at sites that were slightly harder and had significantly lower organic content (P = 0.026) and Chara biomass (P = 0.007) than summer and fall sites. Discriminant analyses determined that most of the variance in distribution of eels is related to substrate type, followed by vegetative cover, primarily Chara. Telemetry revealed that eels had consistent and very predictable seasonal activity patterns and specific microhabitat associations and preferences.</description>

   <description>Teacher apprehension towards integrating Indigenous perspectives into the general classroom curriculum is an issue that should become a priority in Ontario Faculties of Education. Teachers’ attitudes and perceptions towards Indigenous education can impact instructional judgments and pedagogical decisions, which influence the learning opportunities afforded to Indigenous and non-Indigenous students (Riley &amp; Ungerleider, 2012; Pajares, 1992; Cantu, 2001). The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) Calls to Action Report outlines the necessity to improve the quality of teacher knowledge, understanding, delivery and integration of Indigenous content (2015). The purpose of this study is to explore pre-service teachers’ knowledge of Indigenous education and their attitudes towards including Indigenous perspectives in the general classroom, prior to and after completing a mandatory introduction to Aboriginal studies course. The purpose was informed by two research questions: 1) What baseline knowledge and attitudes toward Indigenous curriculum integration are pre-service teachers entering and leaving the Faculty of Education with? 2) Does coursework adequately prepare pre-service teachers to confidently integrate Indigenous content into the general classroom? A mixed-method study was conducted using a sequential explanatory design, examining 117 pre-service teachers from Queen’s University, Canada. Pre-course and post-course data was collected through surveys and in-depth individual interviews. Survey data analysis indicated differences from pre-course (time 1) to post-course (time 2). Additionally, eighteen individual interviews were conducted. Overall, pre-service teachers had positive attitudes towards integrating Indigenous perspectives into the general classroom but lacked content knowledge and believed that their weakness in preparation to integrate Indigenous Education into the general classroom was due to their teacher education program design. Findings of this study will be of interest to Faculties of Education, policy makers and teacher educators.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I defend associative duties – typically understood as non-contractual, special moral responsibilities that arise from valued relationships – as a genuine class of duties. I do this in the spaces of both normative ethics and liberal, political philosophy. The thesis accordingly has two parts. In the first, I defend a particular account of associative duties against their reduction to obligations and conventional divisions of moral labour, and against popular rival accounts that view associative duties not as duties so much as instruments for realizing a valuable state of affairs in which the relationships to which they are socially attached exist. I suggest the following instead: certain relationships are characterized by properties that constitute moral reasons – which in cases amount to duties given their symmetricity and weight – whose recognition is the same as non-instrumentally valuing the relationships. In the second, I defend the claim that we owe associative duties to our compatriots while in dialogue with liberalism, whose twin values of liberty and equality both cut against associative duties qua non- contractual responsibilities to afford priority to the welfare of our associates. By outlining problems that arise from her traditional eschewing of associative duties, I tempt the liberal to an interpretation of the conflicts between her values and associative duties as “extrinsic”, that is, as between genuinely competing values and their attendant demands.</description>

   <description>The ever increasing demand for high speed transport is causing a massive increase in the amount of passengers utilizing air travel. To be able to meet the ever increasing regulatory demands for reduced emissions that are being placed on the air travel industry, there exists an ever present need to advance their technology at an incredible pace. This leads to development and use of the most cutting edge and advanced technologies available, such as Topology Optimization and Additive Manufacturing. Challenges still remain in being able to effectively utilize these technologies as they are both relatively new, however integrating the two together has massive potential for the air travel industry to meet and exceed the emissions regulations. &#xd;
This work presents the methodology for developing a high fidelity mesoscale simulation of the additive manufacturing process which considers all aspects of the machines and the process parameters involved with the construction of components, including the effects of powder bed, Gaussian laser distributions, and specific laser movements. The methodology utilizes the element birth and death finite element formulation to simulate the addition of layers over time and also performs a full transient thermo-mechanical simulation to capture both the temperature history related to the moving heat source, as well as the effect of the temperature history on the residual stress and deformation that is inherent in components generated through additive manufacturing. The methodology was validated by comparing in-situ temperature measurements to the simulation data and was deemed acceptable by achieving 15% error throughout the process. The final stage of this work involved a parameter analysis to capture the effects of the parameters on the residual stress and deformation. Results showed agreement with other literature results, and provided trends that shed some light on the uncertainty of the AM process in hopes of providing recommendations for the development of a methodology for large scale process modeling.</description>

   <title>Alteration in MicroRNA Expression Pattern in CD-1 Mouse Fetal Liver Cells Following In Vitro Benzoquinone Exposure</title>
   <creator>Platt, Alex</creator>

   <subject>Benzene, Fetal liver, microRNA</subject>
   <description>The incidence of childhood leukemias in developed countries is increasing and in utero exposure to environmental toxicants such as benzene may be primarily responsible. The mechanism behind benzene- induced hematotoxicity is not completely understood, however, previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that following in utero exposure to benzene, CD-1 mice one year after birth had an increased incidence of hematopoietic tumours. This suggests that molecular changes before birth could be responsible for the development of childhood leukemias. The objective of this thesis was to investigate whether altered MicroRNA (miR) expression following exposure to benzoquinone (BQ) in fetal hematopoietic cells is a potential pathway by which environmental toxicants could initiate in utero carcinogenesis. To test this, fetal liver cells isolated from gestational day (GD) 14 CD-1 fetal mice were exposed to BQ in vitro for 3 hours. The identification of largescale expression pattern changes in miR expression pattern in a subset of miRs was then conducted using a hybridization array plate. The finding that BQ was able to alter miRs in fetal liver cells led us to examine specific miRs identified in the literature to be associated with hematotoxicity, including miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-19b. Evaluation of miRs through qRT-PCR identified significant increases in miR-155 and miR-19b in fetal hematopoietic cells following 6 hours of BQ exposure, however no difference was observed in miR-146a expression at any time point. To investigate if the miR expression change had decreased downstream mRNA targets, we evaluated targets of miR-155 (c-Myb and Sfpi1) and miR-19b (Pten). There was no statistically significant differences in any of the mRNA evaluated, however there was a trend towards decreased levels of c-Myb and Sfpi1 mRNA expression following BQ exposure for 6 hours, correlating with the time of increased miR-155 expression. This study reveals miRs as a potential mechanism of benzene-induced hematotoxicity, and highlights the importance of continuing to understand the mechanisms for in utero benzene-initiated hematotoxicity for potential therapeutic targets.</description>

   <title>Instructing Nursing Students on Early Identification and Screening for Postpartum Depression Using Simulation Training</title>

   <description>Early identification of depressive symptoms associated with postpartum depression (PPD) is key to its treatment.  Nurses’ lack of skills and knowledge were identified in the literature as barriers to screening for postpartum depression.  In this study the researcher explored the use of simulation to instruct undergraduate nursing students on the screening and care for PPD.  &#xd;
A quasi-experimental design study was conducted in the Fall 2017 and Winter 2018, with a convenience sample of senior undergraduate nursing student at Queen’s University (n=19).  Knowledge, attitudes, perceived communication skills and confidence were measured pre- and post-simulation training using a 26-items and 12 statements Perinatal Depression Monitor tool.  A strong knowledge base and positive attitudes toward PPD were found prior to and after simulation.   Nearly 78% of participants strongly agreed with the statement that “Nurses should assess early and often for PPD”.  The participants’ mean scores of perceived communication skills and confidence levels increased in the posttest (communication skills, pretest M: 3.68, posttest M: 4.15; confidence, pretest M: 2.73, posttest M: 3.57).  &#xd;
As the simulation in this study was the first experience for most of the participants to practise a scenario involving PPD, it was found that this simulation aligns with the Knows How level in Miller’s (1990) Pyramid of Clinical Competence.  The lack of knowledge regarding the use of the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale screening tool and community PPD referral resources for mothers at risk for PPD were evident among the study participants.  This discrepancy suggests a gap between the Shows How and Knows How levels in the pyramid.  It is recommended that undergraduate students be taught with scenarios involving screening for PPD in their nursing curriculum (3rd year) to better prepare them to reach the Shows How level in the simulation laboratory.  This will ideally increase the students’ competence and preparedness to screen for PPD and provide nursing care for patients with PPD in their practice.</description>

   <description>Intra-cavitary needle-based interventions are challenging due to highly deformable cavity and targeted tissue motions. Multi-needle insertions are more challenging given the continuously shifting boundary conditions of surrounding structures intra-operatively. This thesis presents the furtherment of enabling technologies for surgeries seeking to enhance treatment effectiveness by improving needle insertion performance. A modular phantom-based insertion platform was designed and implemented as a framework for comparative studies. The main elements of this platform -- organ phantom, needle guidance unit, and needle driving unit -- were defined for intra-cavitary brachytherapy in cancer treatment with potential for other investigations. The platform performance was conducted through force/torque and electromagnetic data acquisitions. A novel needle driver was devised combining simultaneous translational and rotational oscillations at needle base to investigate optimum needle motion within intra-cavitary limitations having the minimized needle-tissue interaction while maintaining needle mechanical properties for non-straight needle guides. Optimal hybrid oscillational needle motion through in-vitro experiments were concluded to achieve a desirable velocity-independent force profile. A force model encompassing combined oscillations was developed to estimate axial needle force. A multi-stage insertion methodology was elaborated to characterize the interaction between needle and guide within needle-tissue interaction. The intra-operative frictional controllability (IFC) index is proposed for insertion performance management using the frictional power rate of the needle through its guide at different insertion velocities, since velocity changes are inevitable. IFC provides effective criterion to surgeons for optimal needle management specifying power change requirements during velocity-sensitive needle guide frictional reactions. Minimizing the range of frictional power changes, intra-operatively, increases control over the insertion process. IFC was calculated for two needle guides using the implemented platform. A multi-needle-insertion-based intra-cavitary robotic system (InCavBot) resulted from preliminary evaluation and design factors accounting for all requirements and constraints. Kinematic and workspace analyses were conducted for the candidate system that incorporates two serial manipulators. A volumetric index was introduced to prioritize the needle insertion order, based on changes in the targeting workspace after each insertion. Design concepts and prototypes were presented for a proactive intra-cavitary needle guide with organ immobilizing options, a hybrid oscillational needle driving hand tool, and an intra-cavitary needle anchorage unit.</description>

   <description>The recent emergence of “sleep positivity” in high performance sport, as characterized by the expansion of scientific sleep research and expertise, the growing availability of commercial sleep products, and new sleep technology companies, increasingly shapes how sleep-related problems are defined and managed in the athletic realm. Scientific evidence and common sense consistently link lengthy and sufficient sleep in athletes to enhanced performance and wellbeing. However, such optimistic views of sleep stand in contrast to the conditions of high performance, which regularly expose athletes to experiences of fatigue, overtraining, and sleep loss. I address this contradiction by offering a feminist critical history that aims to makes sense of the beliefs, values, and assumptions that position optimal personal sleep habits as “the” solution to a range of problems that arise within exhausting competitive sport systems. What if more sleep isn't really what athletes “need”? &#xd;
&#xd;
Influenced by Michel Foucault’s “history of the present” and the feminist cultural studies of sport literature, I develop a methodological framework that allows me to trace how understandings of sleep in sport have shifted across the twentieth and early twenty-first century. By drawing on a range of historical materials, including archival documents, athletic training manuals, coaching guidebooks, newspapers, textbooks, peer-reviewed journals, films, commercial advertisements, and the online materials of sleep-optimizing companies, I show that while sleep may be a biological necessity, it is also a cultural phenomenon. I explore how ideas and discourses related to sleep serve as a site of governance and examine the way that understandings of “good” sleep have often led to the moral and physical regulation of athletes. I argue that instead of assuming that the promotion of sleep in athletes’ lives is unambiguous and benevolent, it is important to examine the cultural and historical conditions that shape such prescriptions in the first place. I challenge sport scholars and sport practitioners to seriously consider the limitations of “healthy” high performance sport and bring attention to the way that the realm of competitive sport shapes broader understandings of sleep-related problems and the types of solutions that might be offered in response to them.</description>

   <title>Distance to specialist medical care and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in rural Saskatchewan</title>

   <description>Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-disordered breathing condition. Rural populations in Canada may be particularly at risk due to high reported levels of obesity, physical inactivity and other related risk factors. Patients with OSA symptoms are often not diagnosed clinically, which is a concern given the health and safety risks associated with unmanaged OSA. The availability of fewer practicing medical specialists combined with longer travel distances to access healthcare services results in barriers to diagnosis and treatment in rural communities. &#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: This study aimed to (1) determine whether the proportion of adults reporting OSA symptoms and no sleep apnea diagnosis in rural populations varied by travel distance to specialist medical care; and (2) assess whether any distance-related patterns were attributable to differences in the frequency of sleep apnea diagnosis among adults who may require sleep specialist care. &#xd;
 &#xd;
Methods: We used a cross-sectional epidemiologic study design, with longitudinal confirmation of key findings. Our study base included adults who completed a 2010 baseline questionnaire for the Saskatchewan Rural Health Study; the follow-up phase of the study began in 2014 and ended in 2015. 6525 adults from 3731 households made up our sample. Statistical analyses used log-binomial regression. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Rural adults who reported the largest travel distances (≥ 250 km) to specialist medical care were 1.17 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.29) times more likely to report OSA symptoms and no sleep apnea diagnosis compared to those who reported the smallest (&lt; 100 km) distances. However, the proportion of sleep apnea diagnoses was low and unaffected by reported travel distance among adults who may require sleep specialist care. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: In rural Saskatchewan, there was a greater OSA burden among adults reporting the largest travel distances to access specialist medical care, which suggests decreased use of healthcare services in remote populations. However, among adults who may require sleep specialist care, the proportion of sleep apnea diagnoses was low and unaffected by reported travel distance. Other healthcare access barriers may be contributing to the low sleep apnea diagnostic rate and should be evaluated in future research.</description>

   <title>“A (Re)turn to the Archive:  Reading the Lives and Works of Yvonne Vera and Dambudzo Marechera”</title>

   <description>In this dissertation, I read the life and work of the Zimbabwean authors, Yvonne Vera (1964 – 2005) and Dambudzo Marechera (1952 – 1987), against a set of assumptions about the work of African life storytelling in late liberalism. The circulation and reception of narrated lives in the global literary marketplace tends to centre a form of liberal subjectivity premised on the presumed virtues of speech and presence, supporting a series of claims about the therapeutic value of representation in the event of Africa’s historical traumas. I argue that the trauma-informed narratives that Vera and Marechera present in their fiction put pressure on conventional notions of trauma that emplot therapeutic understandings of postcolonial narrative in which the telling of one’s story brings release from that story. Both Vera and Marechera resist the normative development of personhood that presumes self-disclosing speech acts to be universally therapeutic, and that underwrites developmentalist notions of improvement and inclusion. To demonstrate this, I read a form of silence in Vera’s archive and in her fiction that resists western oppositional hierarchies between silence and speech, and a parallel form of refusal, in Marechera’s archive, to perform his ‘arrival’ on the world literary stage as a redemptive ending to the harrowing story of his birth in the Harare townships. I trace their attempts to make suffering matter differently, against a backdrop of nationalist suffering writ large in the master fiction of collective struggle in Zimbabwe, and against a conventional view of African suffering that appeals abstractly to a global literary audience as a form of normative emancipation from the postcolonial condition, arguing that both authors imagined forms of freedom beyond their conscription into the world of Man.</description>
