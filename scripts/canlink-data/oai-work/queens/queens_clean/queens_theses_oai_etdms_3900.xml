   <description>Outer Ring and Halliday Lake deep (~670-800 m) unconformity-related U prospects are located in the eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin. Petrographic, lithogeochemical and short-wavelength-infrared (SWIR) spectroscopic studies were conducted to understand the nature of geochemical dispersion in the basin. Aqua regia partial digestion lithogeochemical results indicate that REEs and HFSEs vary with stratigraphy, are likely hosted in restite phases and thus are not useable pathfinder elements. Aqua regia and weak acid leach (WAL) results indicate that As, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Ni are viable pathfinder elements whose enrichments can be traced from the unconformity to the surface. These pathfinders are associated with faulting, fracturing and alteration and appear to be related to graphitic metapelitic and calc-silicate gneisses. Minimal radiogenic Pb is present in sub-economic U mineralization indicating that it has formed recently and that it may have been remobilized from high grade U mineralization. WAL U-Pb isotope results indicate that radiogenic Pb has been dispersed through the entire thickness of the Athabasca Group sediments throughout the basin history. &#xd;
	Soil samples from which the &lt;2 µm soil clay fraction was separated and tree cores were collected over the Halliday Lake prospect. X-ray diffraction indicates the clay fractions are host to plagioclase, which is derived beyond the basin edge. Elements such as K, Mg, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Ni appear to be related to this basement component. However, these elements are also enriched in association with anomalous bedrock lithogeochemistry and alteration implying a mixture of the basement and sandstone signatures. Similar elements are enriched in the tree cores in an area associated with thin overburden, anomalous alteration and lithogeochemistry suggesting that the trees roots may be directly tapping the underlying bedrock. Radiogenic 207Pb/206Pb ratios from the clay fraction are spatially associated with drill holes, which intercepted sub-economic U mineralization, while common 207Pb/206Pb ratios are associated with barren drill holes. The tree core 207Pb/206Pb ratios are generally less radiogenic however some are consistent with the clay fraction ratios. Geological, geophysical and surficial geochemical data indicate that the Halliday Lake prospect may be host to unconformity-related U mineralization.</description>

   <title>Characterization of TAFI Activation by the Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Complex</title>

   <description>Once activated, protein C (PC) and thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) initiate anticoagulant and anti-fibrinolytic pathways, respectively. PC and TAFI are activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM) complex. Endothelial PC receptor (EPCR), which binds PC, enhances the activation of PC, but not TAFI. We investigated PC and TAFI activation on cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC) in the absence or presence of an antibody against EPCR. In the absence of antibody, PC is the favoured substrate of the thrombin-TM complex. In contrast, in the presence of antibody, PC activation is reduced to a level similar to that of TAFI, suggesting that EPCR acts as a molecular switch that influences substrate preference. PC does not compete with TAFI for activation and vice versa, raising the possibility that the two proteins interact with distinct populations of thrombin-TM complexes on endothelial cell surface. &#xd;
	Based on our previous work, the TM-dependence of TAFI activation by thrombin is mediated through exosite interactions involving a positively-charged patch surrounding Lys 42, Lys 43, and Lys 44 on TAFI. Using TAFI variants with one, two or three of these Lys residues replaced with Ala, we determined that each individual Lys residue contributes equally to overall TAFI activation by thrombin-TM and that they act in a cooperative fashion to promote activation. This cooperative interaction is evident in lysis assays where threshold-like behaviour is evident; thus, the anti-fibrinolytic effect of TAFIa is only attenuated when its generation falls below this threshold. &#xd;
	Capitalizing on this Lys-dependent interaction of TAFI with thrombin-TM, we synthesized 10-amino acid peptide analogs of this region. Analogs with one, two or three Lys residues progressively attenuated TAFI activation by thrombin-TM. This was a specific effect because (a) the peptide analogs had no effect on PC activation, (b) the inhibitory effect was lost if the three Lys residues were replaced with Thr, and (c) epsilon amino-caproic acid, a Lys analog, had no effect. These studies not only suggest that lysine residues at 42/43/44 comprise an exosite that mediates the interaction of TAFI, but not PC, with thrombin-TM, but also identify novel reagents that have potential antithrombotic activity by modulating TAFI activation.</description>

   <title>Along-strike comparison of strain and timing of deformation in the lower Himalayan metamorphic core, west-central Nepal</title>

   <description>Orogens are typically analysed and modelled as two-dimensional cross-sections, downplaying their three-dimensionality and potential variability along strike. Geologic mapping accompanied by microstructural and geochronological analyses from the lower Himalayan metamorphic core in west-central Nepal record along-strike similarity in flow style, despite variability in the timing of both metamorphism and deformation. The Main Central thrust high-strain zone at the base of the Himalayan metamorphic core varies in thickness, lithotectonic stratigraphy, and field metamorphic gradient along the mapped 250 km strike length. Sampling from two along-strike transects targeted specific lithotectonic units near the base and top of the high-strain zone. In situ monazite U-Th/Pb geochronology and trace-element analysis of samples from the top of the high-strain zone&#xd;
record protracted Eocene-Oligocene prograde metamorphism followed by Miocene retrograde&#xd;
metamorphism. The metamorphic ages, as well as muscovite 40Ar/39Ar age, gradually decrease from&#xd;
northwest to southeast along strike, punctuated by an abrupt ca. 3-8 Myr age decrease in the east central&#xd;
Annapurna foothills. Geochronology results are not fully consistent with predictions from either channel flow or wedge extrusion models, and may exemplify the continuum between these end-member models. Quartz crystallographic preferred orientation fabrics from the base of the high-strain zone document similar flow style and plane-strain conditions at ca. 440°C along 70 km&#xd;
strike length in central Nepal. Muscovite 40Ar/39Ar ages, which are interpreted as the approximate ages of these deformation fabrics, decrease from ca. 7 to 4 Ma from northwest to southeast along strike at this structural level. Differences in the crustal architecture and timing of metamorphism and deformation indicate there is structural variation and diachronous evolution along strike of the lower metamorphic core in west-central Nepal. This variability spatially corresponds with the subsurface Faizabad ridge, a feature on the Indian plate that projects beneath the Himalaya in this region, and highlights the possible impact of subsurface ridges on the geometry of the basal Himalayan décollement and the tectonic evolution of the metamorphic core.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Law) -- Queen's University, 2015-01-21 13:02:11.693</description>
   <description>The purpose of this study is to examine the dilemma of how individual criminal responsibility can be attributed, in a principled manner, for crimes that have been perpetrated through collective conduct within the context of international criminal law. International crimes are inherently collective, and raise issues of complexity and gravity that do not commonly arise in domestic law, but which share similarities with domestic law’s treatment of organized crime. The traditional foundation for attributing individual criminal responsibility, being causation, is examined and found to be problematic in the case of collective crimes, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. It is suggested that non-causal justifications for attributing criminal liability are consistent with societal concepts of blame, responsibility, and harm, and should be considered in the interests of generating a more comprehensive and predictable theory for personal guilt in collective crimes. Four approaches to individual criminal responsibility for collective conduct that have emerged in international criminal law are reviewed, and found to be problematic. However, as opposed to discovering a fifth approach, it is suggested that a return to the founding theory of Anglo-American common law conspiracy may offer a viable solution. A historical review of conspiracy theory demonstrates that when the theory is applied with integrity it presents a non-causal justification for individual criminal responsibility based an augmented form of agency theory, supported by concepts of risk creation. Its elements, when properly applied, present predictable and comprehensive limits on liability.</description>

   <description>Researchers have recently suggested using the problem-solving court principles that guide criminal court mental health diversion initiatives in large North American cities and elsewhere to deliver similar objectives outside of well-resourced, specialized urban courts. The proliferation of these initiatives is a response to the overrepresentation of people with mental illness caught up in the justice system. But while the “problem-solving court” principles and those of the foundational theoretical approach known as therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ) include the need for an effective “rehabilitative response,” a contemporary understanding of this response from mental health rehabilitation research—including current thinking about the role of culture in mental health recovery—is not well explored. Meanwhile, in the mainly Inuit Canadian Arctic territory of Nunavut, criminal court mental health diversion initiatives do not exist. This dissertation examined the potential for delivering the objectives of criminal court mental health diversion in Nunavut using TJ and problem-solving court principles. A qualitative multiple-case study involving 55 semi-structured interviews as well as three focus groups was used to gather and analyze the experiences of justice personnel, health workers, members of community organizations and other community members in three Nunavut communities (Iqaluit, Arviat, and Qikiqtarjuaq). The study showed that the confounding effects of Inuit culture comprised a dominant issue in conversations about the three most-discussed objectives of TJ and problem-solving principles:  identifying mental illness, approaches to treatment and therapeutic services, and interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary collaboration. The impacts of geographic remoteness and resource limitations were of less concern. Themes revealed in conversations about culture showed a clear resonance with culturally responsive concepts from mental health research known as “protective factors” in the mental health of Inuit and other indigenous people. This result suggests a consideration of protective factors may be essential for TJ and problem-solving court thinking in the context of mainly Inuit Arctic communities. Further, the research revealed culturally relevant characteristics of mainly Inuit communities relevant to identifying mental illness that could pose hurdles to importing typical criminal court mental health diversion initiatives across cultural and social boundaries in the Far North.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the viability of the commodity streaming business model, both as a standalone enterprise and as a financing service for exploration and mining companies.  A silver streaming company, Silver Wheaton, was chosen as the subject of a case study to accomplish this and nine silver streams that it acquired in its first eight years from 2004-2012 were analysed and evaluated.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Using publicly available technical data, cash flow models were developed for all of the mines and development projects with which Silver Wheaton made agreements during this time period.  Subsets of these cash flows were isolated to represent the positions of both Silver Wheaton and its operating partners in each transaction.  The Capital Asset Pricing Model and its associated economic metrics were employed and calculated for all of the isolated stream cash flow models to evaluate the expected financial gain or loss to each party for every deal.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Cash flow models were developed using two silver price series; one conservative and one bullish price series.  These were compiled through the aggregation of price forecasting data from mining equity research reports published in the months leading up to each transaction. &#xd;
&#xd;
It was found that the business model resulted in poor financial outcomes for Silver Wheaton and excellent financial outcomes for its operating partners in over 50% of the transactions it concluded, when evaluated at conservative silver prices.  Conversely, when evaluated at bullish silver prices it resulted in excellent financial outcomes for Silver Wheaton and extremely poor financial outcomes for its operating partners in every instance.&#xd;
&#xd;
Given that today silver is produced primarily as a by-product to gold and base metals, the business model has a uniquely large target market when focusing on silver and has been replicated to varying degrees of success by other companies, both with silver and other commodities.  It provides a viable alternative to traditional financing avenues for exploration and mining companies during all periods of the mining business cycle and is positioned to grow in significance as a form of mine and project financing.</description>

   <description>Hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid is usually performed with precious metal catalysts. However, due to the cost and scarcity of precious metals, recent research has focused instead on first row transition metals. Of specific interest to our group are bis-phosphine and carbene complexes of iron, cobalt and nickel. Initial efforts found catalytically active species, which generated decent turn over numbers (TON). It was found that 10 different metals have at least some catalytic activity for this reaction, when combined with 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane, including Fe, Co, Ni, In, Zn and Mo.

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-01-26 15:43:29.849</description>
   <description>This thesis investigates experimentally and analytically the structural performance of sandwich panels composed of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins and a soft polyurethane foam core, with or without thin GFRP ribs connecting skins. The study includes three main components: (a) out-of-plane bending fatigue, (b) axial compression loading, and (c) in-plane bending of sandwich beams. &#xd;
Fatigue studies included 28 specimens and looked into establishing service life (S-N) curves of sandwich panels without ribs, governed by soft core shear failure and also ribbed panels governed by failure at the rib-skin junction.  Additionally, the study compared fatigue life curves of sandwich panels loaded under fully reversed bending conditions (R=-1) with panels cyclically loaded in one direction only (R=0) and established the stiffness degradation characteristics throughout their fatigue life. Mathematical models expressing fatigue life and stiffness degradation curves were calibrated and expanded forms for various loading ratios were developed.  Approximate fatigue thresholds of 37% and 23% were determined for non-ribbed panels loaded at R=0 and -1, respectively.  Digital imaging techniques showed significant shear contribution significantly (90%) to deflections if no ribs used. &#xd;
Axial loading work included 51 specimens and examined the behavior of panels of various lengths (slenderness ratios), skin thicknesses, and also panels of similar length with various rib configurations.  Observed failure modes governing were global buckling, skin wrinkling or skin crushing.  In-plane bending involved testing 18 sandwich beams of various shear span-to-depth ratios and skin thicknesses, which failed by skin wrinkling at the compression side.  The analytical modeling components of axially loaded panels include; a simple design-oriented analytical failure model and a robust non-linear model capable of predicting the full load-displacement response of axially loaded slender sandwich panels, accounting for P-Delta effects, inherent out-of-straightness profile of any shape at initial conditions, and the excessive shear deformation of soft core and its effect on buckling capacity.  Another model was developed to predict the load-deflection response and failure modes of in-plane loaded sandwich beams. After successful verification of the models using experimental results, comprehensive parametric studies were carried out using these models to cover parameters beyond the limitations of the experimental program.</description>

   <description>Recent theories of motor control emphasize the role of sensory feedback in driving motor output and how feedback could be flexibly modulated to adapt to the behavioural requirements of a task. Here, we tested the merits of this theory by studying how sensory feedback is modulated by behavioural context and studied the possible neural circuitry underlying such task dependent processing. Mechanical perturbations were applied to the arms of our subjects (in humans or non-human primates) in different behavioural tasks to quantify task-dependent muscle responses. We also quantified cortical responses in non-human primates to explore the neural basis of this flexible feedback processing. Our first experiment (Chapter 2, human study) shows that introducing redundancy in a bimanual postural control task could rapidly change the magnitude of muscle responses to the perturbations in as little as 50ms. In our second experiment (Chapter 3, NHP study), we show that primary motor cortex (M1) responses to mechanical perturbations were rapidly modulated (in as little as 40ms), when the monkey was engaged or not in a postural control task (task-dependent response). Strikingly, the initial perturbation responses remained identical across tasks (task-independent response). We speculated that different sources of feedback, with different time delays and sensitivity to behavioural tasks, might be driving M1 activity; one driving the early task-independent response and the other driving the late task-dependent response. We therefore, studied perturbation responses in a range of sensory and motor cortices across 3 different behavioural contexts (Chapter 4, NHP study). We found sensory feedback to be rapidly transmitted to all these cortical regions within 25ms of limb disturbance. Furthermore, sensory feedback was differentially modulated across these areas, depending on the behavioural task. For instance, posterior parietal area 5 was the first area to show response modulation with task engagement (same as experiment 2). Primary motor cortex, on the other hand, was the first area to show modulation in perturbation response with different spatial targets (i.e., target selection). These results suggest that a highly distributed neural substrate is involved in processing sensory feedback and each area plays a unique role in context-dependent modulation of feedback responses.</description>

   <description>There has been relatively little study of system change among scholars of international relations. Several academics have referred to the subject as the “evaded dimension” of IR. The reasons for the omission are complex but include a normative inclination to model stability during the dangerous years of the Cold War and the related preeminence of political realism as the primary theoretical lens of IR analysis. Much of the research work since the Second World War used a technically suitable but distinctly Westphalian template for examining the international system. This approach was perhaps useful for understanding contemporary western IR but may have provided a skewed data set from which scholars could investigate the dynamics of system change.&#xd;
With the Cold War over and the field in the midst of an intellectual expansion, and in the spirit of those scholars who recently called for an IR approach that isn’t “owned and operated by Europe” (referring specifically to Security Communities), this study seeks to suggest an alternerative historical model of system change - one based less upon the explanatory utility of force or interest, but of ideas. Using the “constructivist” lens of analysis, this paper seeks to show how the founder of the Islamic faith, the Prophet Muhammad, used what we recognize today as “strategic social construction” to subvert key social institutions of the tribal-state system of Arabia in 570 AD. His phased efforts at deploying new normative arrangements steadily eroded the structure of ideas on which the system depended. As the “mutual constitution” of personal and system identification began to collapse, a new structure arose based upon reconfigured identities among a new super-tribe of Muslims, the Umma.&#xd;
This case study provides an insight into a period of history many in the west conventionally view as a violent conquest. This alternative ideational explanation is possibly a useful counterpoint, as well as a supplement to existing historical data on system change. Finally, there are modern, real-world applications that are briefly discussed at the conclusion.</description>

   <title>The Effects of Hydrogen Sulfide on Neurons in the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract</title>

   <description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter that has recently been described to affect the membrane potential of neurons in a number of brain areas. Using whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques, I investigated whether the H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) affects the membrane potential of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract, an autonomic nucleus where NaHS has previously shown to effect blood pressure and heart rate.&#xd;
Bath application of NaHS (1 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM) to 300 µm coronal NTS brain slices led to a clear reversible depolarization in 95% of neurons tested (72/76), and in 64% (46/72) of these responding neurons was followed by a longer lasting hyperpolarization. These effects on membrane potential were found to be concentration-dependent.&#xd;
Furthermore, in the presence of the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KA), the depolarizing effects of 5 mM NaHS (5.0 ± 2.2 mV (n=7)) were still observed, although they were significantly reduced compared to regular aCSF (7.7 ± 2.0 mV (n=7), p *&lt; 0.05, paired t-test). These observations support the conclusion that NaHS has both pre and post-synaptic effects which contribute to controlling the excitability of NTS neurons. I also tested the hypothesis that hyperpolarizations in response to 5 mM NaHS resulted from modulation of the KATP channel by comparing effects observed following the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (-1.9 ± 0.9 mV (n=8)) with those recorded in control conditions (-7.9 ± 1.2 mV n=8, p* &lt; 0.05, paired t-test). This nearly complete loss of hyperpolarizing effects in the presence of glibenclamide identifies a primary role for the KATP channel in the NaHS induced hyperpolarization of NTS neurons. &#xd;
Thus, the H2S donor, NaHS causes two responses in NTS neurons. These effects were found to be in part post-synaptic and the KATP channel was found to play a role in the NaHS induced hyperpolarization. This study has for the first time described post-synaptic effects of this gasotransmitter on the membrane potential of NTS neurons and thus implicates this transmitter in regulating the diverse autonomic systems controlled by these NTS neurons.</description>

   <description>The existence of community-based ecosystem monitoring activities is a relatively new concept that has been on the rise in past years for several reasons, including decreased governmental funding and capacity for monitoring, a growing awareness of environmental issues and a desire to participate in environmental planning and protection (Au et al., 2000; Bliss et al., 2001; Sharpe and Conrad, 2006; Sharpe et al., 2000). Water quality monitoring has become one of the most widespread types of community monitoring (Devlin, 2011). This research project is part of a larger initiative called the CURA H2O Project, based out of St. Mary’s University, Nova Scotia, Canada. CURA H2O looks at streamlining community-based water monitoring and resource management, with a focus on Nova Scotia. The province currently lacks a comprehensive policy water management framework (Sharpe and Conrad, 2006), but has very active community groups monitoring water resources to fill in the governance gap. This research project relates to one of CURA H2O’s objectives to review the state of CBM in Canada: the purpose of this research project is to investigate the state of community-based water monitoring in Southern Ontario, Canada, focusing on the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) landscape north of the Greater Toronto Area as a case study. The ORM was chosen for its ecological and hydrological significance, as well as the history of environmental activism and its water governance framework. The qualitative methods used to obtain this data included a literature review, in-depth interviews and a workshop with relevant stakeholders, as well as a document analysis of grey literature related to CBM. The main findings from the research project can be summarized as follows:&#xd;
1.Water governance in Ontario involves multiple stakeholders.&#xd;
2.CBM on the ORM takes the form of water quality and quantity, as well as policy monitoring.&#xd;
3.Government agencies are involved in CBM initiatives, although it is not officially recognized.&#xd;
4.	CBM groups face many barriers which inhibit their ability to impact decision-making.&#xd;
5.Participation in CBM is likely to increase in the future.&#xd;
6.CBM programs in Nova Scotia and the ORM have some similarities and differences.</description>

   <description>Remediation of sites impacted by dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) is an ongoing, costly challenge where technological improvement is needed to allow for cost-effective cleanup.  Remedial processes using in situ thermal technologies have received increasing attention in recent years.  Electrical resistance heating (ERH) is a commonly applied thermal technology in the industry.  ERH applications are used at heterogeneous sites, where permeability contrasts can significantly impact the heating process along with the movement of DNAPL and gas phases.  To further understand this, a series of intermediate-scale laboratory experiments were completed in a two-dimensional flow cell examining the impacts on subsurface processes occurring during ERH.  Groundwater velocity variations within a homogenous coarse sand were shown to limit the heating rates during ERH.  Additionally, experiments entailed the heating 270 mL of trichloroethene (TCE), chloroform (CF), and tetrachloroethene (PCE) pools in a medium-grained silica sand with a coarse-grained sand lens located above the DNAPL pools.  Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, gas saturations, and aqueous DNAPL concentrations were collected and observed using a distribution of thermocouples, front-face image capture, and post treatment soil sampling.  In each experiment, temperatures increased above DNAPL-water co-boiling plateaus creating estimated gas volumes of 131 L, 114 L and 215 L that originated from the TCE, CF and PCE pools respectively.  Produced gas migrated vertically, entered the coarse lens and became trapped beneath a capillary barrier laterally spreading outside the heated treatment zone where 26 - 56% of injected DNAPL condensed back into a DNAPL phase.  These findings demonstrate that layered heterogeneity with higher permeability lenses can potentially facilitate the transport of contaminants outside the treatment zone by mobilization and condensing of gas phases during ERH applications.</description>

   <description>The scientific community has increased its focus on studies dealing with land-use change and water quality. The emphasis on land use and water quality can be attributed to the continued rise in human population leading to an overall degradation of water quality and serious modifications in land use characteristics. The current study is focused on regional-level linkages between land use and surface water quality which in turn affect interrelationships at a larger scale.  The main objective of the present research is to discover the interrelationship between the change in land use and its impact on surface water quality in the Cataraqui Region. The feasibility of adopting Adaptive Environmental Management [AEM] techniques as a sustainable resource management process within the region is also discussed. A total of four watersheds with seven Provincial Water Quality Monitoring [PWQMN] stations under Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority [CRCA] jurisdiction are analysed. Eight parameters including water alkalinity, water hardness, phosphorus, iron, aluminum, vanadium, manganese and chloride are examined under PWQMN guidelines for each station as indicators of  surface water quality over a time period of twenty years from 1993-2012. Land use maps are prepared using Landsat imagery at five-year intervals for areas drained by each creek. Final analysis shows a minor causal relationship between land-use change and surface water quality within the four selected creeks. An increasing trend for metallic and persistently high concentration of non-metallic parameters indicates the need for better and improved AEM procedures to ensure sustainable utilization of water resources in the future.</description>

   <description>An admittance-based controller for autonomously digging in fragmented rock piles was developed and tested by using a 1 t surface loader, and a 14 t Atlas Copco Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) vehicle. This admittance-based Autonomous Loading Controller (ALC) had superior consistency over both digging at constant velocity, and manual digging. The ALC was able to dig 39 % more material in 61 % less time than manual operators over 26 dig attempts by using a 14 t LHD in an underground mine, although it did require 68 % more work. The ALC achieves these performance improvements by controlling the mechanical admittance between the bucket and the rock pile. In contrast with nearly constant velocity digging observed in manual operators, controlling mechanical admittance allows the ALC to alter the velocity of the bucket in response to the dig reaction forces. Maintaining a preset admittance results in the ALC avoiding high and low force areas below the surface of the rock pile, which are indicative of obstacles and pockets respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
The ALC is both novel and important because it was developed for use in fragmented rock piles by using industry-scale equipment, compared to existing methods that use small scale excavators in soil or gravel targets. The major contributions discussed in this thesis are the ALC, which opens a whole new area of digging research, a tuning process for the ALC, a comparative analysis of the ALC against manual and constant velocity digging, a preliminary study of how the rock pile characteristics a_ect loading, and methods for biasing the ALC towards successfully exiting the rock pile.&#xd;
&#xd;
The end result of these contributions is an autonomous loading method that loads considerably more material more consistently than a manual operator. The ALC was also remarkably robust to changes in dig platform and in multiple dig targets, which suggests that it is easier to tune and operate than behaviour, learning, or other heuristic based methods. The ALC still requires a human operator to select the rock pile entry point, but the ALC could be used with existing remote control methods to dramatically improve performance. Furthermore, the ALC is a vital step towards realizing the productivity and consistency advantages of fully automating the LHD cycle.</description>

   <description>Helmets are widely used as protection against sports-related concussions. The degree of concussion protection offered by a helmet may be related to the fit between the helmet and head. This thesis discusses different approaches that could be used for helmet fitting, and presents the design and implementation of a prototype helmet fitting recommendation system. The prototype system uses a Kinect sensor to scan a client’s head and then compares the head shape to helmet shapes from a database of off-the-shelf helmets. A slice extraction method is used to compare a standard reference slice extracted from the head to a corresponding slice from the helmet. The degree to which the helmet fits the client’s head is calculated and displayed to the user. This thesis describes the scanning procedure that was conducted to obtain 3D head shapes from a number of participants, and reports results about the measured head and helmet shapes; results show there is significant variation in both head and helmet shapes. The prototype system could potentially help a concussion expert make recommendations about helmet fit to clients, if more research about the effects of helmet fitting on concussion protection becomes available.</description>

   <description>Youth with cerebral palsy (CP) have limitations in physical abilities that make it difficult for them to participate in traditional physical activity and social interaction. Exergames, video games combined with physical activity, represent a promising approach to allow youth with CP to participate in physical activity while socializing with others. However, commercial exergames present challenges to accessibility that can be difficult to overcome for youth with CP. One way of addressing these problems is by designing exergames considering the physical abilities and limitations of this population, providing methods and interfaces to interact with the game that are easy for them to use.&#xd;
This research provides insights into how to design exergames that youth with CP can play, enjoy, and use effectively to socially communicate and interact with peers. To approach this challenge, a year-long participatory iterative design process was followed, involving medical professionals, game designers, computer scientists, kinesiologists, physical therapists, and youth with CP. The result of this process was a set of guidelines for the design of gameplay that is accessible for youth with CP, a set of guidelines to provide social accessibility in online games for youth with CP and an online exergame implementing these guidelines. The game was evaluated over two home-based studies with youth with CP. The first study focused on the evaluation of the playability of the game over eight weeks. The second study focused on the evaluation of the game’s effectiveness as a platform for social interaction for youth with CP over ten weeks. Results from both studies show that the games built following the guidelines were indeed playable, enjoyable and effective at allowing and promoting social interaction.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-01-30 01:55:50.636</description>
   <description>In this thesis, an isolated resonant bidirectional converter is proposed for transportation applications such as mid-size electrified airplanes. The proposed converter is capable of transferring the nominal power in both directions, either from the high voltage side to the low voltage side (step-down mode), or from the low voltage side to the high voltage side (step-up mode). It is shown that the converter transfers full power over the entire range of terminal voltages with guaranteed zero voltage switching (ZVS) for all the voltage and power levels.&#xd;
The achievement of ZVS switching is obtained through the right combination of modulation scheme and low-cost passive auxiliary circuits added to the main converter. Two modulation schemes are developed to achieve the aforementioned merits. The first proposed modulation scheme decouples the switching frequency from other control variables and combines them in a straightforward manner to gain a single control variable and, at the same time, maintain soft switching without complex calculations or lookup tables. This provides the capability of using the well-established control approaches for this converter system. The second modulation scheme provides the same functionality under constant frequency operation. The inter-bridge phase-shift uniquely determines the duty-cycles for both of the bridges on either side such that soft switching operation is maintained in all the working conditions. Having the phase-shift as the only independent control variable reduces the problem from a multivariable to a single-variable control problem that allows the use of well-established control methods without compromising the functionality of the system.&#xd;
In addition to the modulation schemes two types of low cost, robust passive auxiliary circuits are introduced with different flexibilities and component counts to guarantee the zero voltage switching of the converter. No active components are used and no limitation is imposed on the converter switches. All the analytical predictions are experimentally verified and the functionality of the proposed system is validated.</description>

   <description>Coagulation and fibrinolysis are essential processes that ensure a rapid, localized response to vascular damage and subsequent removal once the damage is repaired. These two processes are extensively regulated by various feedback mechanisms and inhibitors. In blood, clotting appears to be an all or none event. Such a phenomenon is governed by thresholding behaviour. Thresholding occurs when a precursor generates a response that can either feedback or be inhibited. Prothrombin activation under conditions in which both of these mechanisms are present was determined to experience thresholding. Thrombin generation initiated by factor Xa in the presence of factor V and antithrombin was fit to a model of prothrombin activation. This model showed that factor Va generation before complete factor Xa inhibition is essential for thrombin generation. Upon factor Va formation, factor Xa becomes highly protected from inhibition, and as a result activates prothrombin more efficiently. These data provided mechanistic detail into the thresholding behavior of coagulation.&#xd;
Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) suppresses fibrinolysis by removing carboxyl-terminal lysine residues exposed by plasmin (Pn) on fibrin. These cleavages result in reduced plasminogen (Pg) activation and increased Pn inhibition by antiplasmin (AP). The effects of TAFIa on tissue type Pg activator (tPA) inhibition by Pg activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) on fibrin were quantified. High molecular weight fibrin degradation products (HMW-FDPs), a surrogate for Pn-modified fibrin, decreased the rate constant for tPA inhibition 3-fold. In the presence of Pg, HMW-FDPs decreased the inhibition rate constant 30-fold. TAFIa treatment of the HMW-FDPs removed the protection associated with Pg, but not HMW-FDPs. TAFIa also abolished the protection of Pn from AP associated with Pn-modified fibrin in clots formed with Glu-Pg, but did not do so in clots formed with Lys-Pg. These data showed that once Lys-Pg and Lys-Pn are generated, the ability of TAFIa to prolong lysis is greatly reduced. These data identified new mechanisms in which TAFIa can attenuate fibrinolysis.</description>

   <description>Oil and gas pipelines buried off the east coast of Canada are in a complex and dynamic environment with many inherent risks, including scour events by large icebergs in shallow water, which present a significant hazard to their safety and structural integrity. A thorough understanding of pipe soil interaction under large deformations imposed either by iceberg scour or other means, is critical to the design of oil and gas pipelines and to the current understanding of pipeline-soil interaction. Iceberg keel gouging events are a large strain numerical problem and experimental data evaluating shear strain behaviour of the test material, strain localization of the soil shear bands, and material flow into the void left behind the displaced pipe are needed in order to model the pipe-soil interaction behaviour involved in these processes.&#xd;
&#xd;
A full scale laboratory test configuration was developed to performed experimental work on horizontal pipe-soil interaction, modeling a large deformation event similar to iceberg scour. Lateral pipe displacement tests were conducted with industry grade pipelines up to 0.61 m in diameter, tested at two burial depths in both loose and dense synthetic olivine sand.  Transparent sidewalls were incorporated into the test apparatus to enable the use of digital image correlation (DIC) to determine soil displacements. DIC provides a new source of high quality experimental data which can capture the complex large strain soil behaviour in full scale pipe-soil interaction tests. DIC was used to observe the shear strain behaviour of the test soil, strain localization into soil shear bands, and material flow into the void left behind the displaced pipe, and pipe features including mobilization distance, uplift and trajectory. The influence of soil density, burial depth ratio, and pipe diameter has been evaluated on all of these concepts. It was found that significant soil densification occurs in a compression zone in front of the test pipes, causing the soil and pipe behaviour in loose sand to reflect the results of tests conducted in dense sand.</description>

   <description>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is the most widely signed and ratified human rights treaty in history. The Convention is law in the nearly two hundred countries that have ratified it including Canada and India. This project is an ethnography exploring the effectiveness of the text of the CRC in two contexts, one which is largely structured by text (Canada) and one which is not (India). To map, in depth, the top-down social relations of the CRC the author provides rich descriptions of her fieldwork in the Punjabi village of Butala and the Canadian city of Brampton. Using the new sociology of childhood as a conceptual framework, the author argues that the CRC is inherently flawed because it is in text and can therefore only create change in environments mediated by text.</description>

   <description>This thesis aims to explore simple methods to improve the analytical performance of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometry (OES) and mass spectrometry (MS). &#xd;
&#xd;
1.	An argon-nitrogen mixed-gas plasma with a hydrogen sheath gas was developed in order to improve plasma robustness for the analysis of geological/environmental samples by ICP-MS and ICP OES. Nitrogen was added to the outer plasma gas, to reduce matrix effects, while hydrogen was added as a sheath, around the nebulizer flow, to improve energy transfer to the central channel. Increased robustness allowed for the direct quantitative multi-element analysis of certified soil, ore and seawater reference materials by ICP-MS and ICP OES, without using any matrix matching or internal standardization. &#xd;
&#xd;
2.	An IR-heated sample introduction system with a conventional pneumatic nebulizer was investigated in order to improve the analytical performance of ICP OES. The aerosol generated by a pneumatic nebulizer, coupled to various spray chambers, was heated to 230 °C using an IR heater. Under optimum conditions and compared to conventional pneumatic nebulization at room temperature, a 6-fold improvement in sensitivity and a 4 to 7-fold improvement in detection limit was obtained for 38 elements using the IR-heated sample introduction setups. Another IR-heated sample introduction system was also investigated for both aqueous and organic (metals-in-oil) solutions. Under optimum conditions and compared to conventional pneumatic nebulization at room temperature, a 3-fold improvement in sensitivity and a 6 to 9-fold improvement in detection limit was obtained for 22 elements using the IR-heated sample introduction system, for both aqueous and organic solutions. &#xd;
&#xd;
3.	A measure of robustness in ICP-MS was investigated. The Be II/Li I intensity ratio was directly related to the Mg II/Mg I ratio in OES. Moreover, the 9Be+/7Li+ ratio was inversely related to the CeO+/Ce+ and LaO+/La+ oxide ratios in MS. The suppression effect of sample matrices was significantly reduced, if not eliminated in the case of 0.01 M Na, when the 9Be+/7Li+ ratio was around 0.30. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on using a simple analyte intensity ratio, 9Be+/7Li+, to gauge plasma robustness in ICP-MS.</description>

   <title>Object Recognition by Registration of Repeatable 3D Interest Segments</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-02-04 14:12:11.215</description>
   <description>3D object recognition using depth data remains a difficult problem in computer vision.  In this thesis, an object recognition system based on registering repeatable 3D surface segments, termed recognition by registration (RbR) is proposed.  The goal is to eliminate the dependency on local geometry for establishing point-to-point correspondences, while maintaining the robust trait of a global technique by applying a pairwise registration process on these individual segments.&#xd;
The extraction of repeatable surface segments is achieved by inheriting the high repeatability of interest points, most often utilized to increase the performance of matching local shape descriptors.  Precisely, dense sets of interest points are connected to form the surface segment boundaries by greedily optimizing a smoothness constraint.  The reconstructed boundaries provide an effective means to facilitate fast 3D region growing on the object and scene surfaces, forming the 3D interest segments.  &#xd;
Pairwise registration of the model and scene interest segments must then consider the imperfectly extracted segments due to data noise, occlusion, and error from the segmentation itself.  An adaptation of the robust 4 points congruent sets (4PCS) registration algorithm was shown to register interest segments efficiently with great success.  This is achieved by utilizing the prior knowledge of the 3D model interest segments that can be preprocessed, coupled with pose clustering of the retrieved transformation candidates.  &#xd;
Experimentally, the interest segment repeatability, registration rate, and the object recognition rate were evaluated using a variety of free-form objects in 3D model data corrupted with synthetic noise and real 2.5D cluttered scenes.  It was found that the interest segments are highly repeatable (>80% per top segment per scene), and that they can also be registered successfully within a reasonable number of RANSAC cycle of the 4PCS algorithm.  Compared to other state-of-the art local approaches, RbR enjoyed superior object recognition rates in both accurate LiDAR data and noisy Kinect data (on average >90% for all objects tested in both sets of data), demonstrating that the approach provides a very attractive alternate solution to those in the current literature.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-01-31 10:18:50.029</description>
   <description>This work focuses on the coupling between channel geometry, flow, bank erosion and planimetric changes in meandering streams. The study has the following three objectives: 1- to gain insight into how the flow patterns in meandering streams are affected by the stream geometry and flow conditions; 2- to evaluate existing equations for the determination of bank erosion rates; and 3- to seek an explanation for why some meandering streams remain regular (or symmetric) in plan shape while evolving in plan, while other acquire irregular shapes.&#xd;
The thesis is also used as an opportunity to introduce a new technique to immobilize the movable boundary and present a series of tests to assess the structural integrity of the coating layer and its roughness (Chapter 2).&#xd;
Chapter 3 presents a series of laboratory tests carried out to investigate the effect of different geometric characteristics and hydraulic conditions on the pattern of the initial flow in sine-generated meandering streams. The most significant finding of the work is that it demonstrates that the meander wavelength plays a considerable role in determining the location in flow plan of the convergence-divergence zone of flow.&#xd;
Chapter 4 presents an experimental study involving a meandering stream with a fixed bed and movable banks. The initial flow at the beginning of the test is detailed with the aid of Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry. The natural deformation of the bank under the action of flow is closely monitored and recorded. The location of maximum bank erosion is found to be between that of maximum bed deformation (or maximum downstream gradients of flow velocity) and maximum flow velocity. This intrinsic shift between the locations in plan of maximum velocity gradient (where maximum bed deformation occurs) and the location of maximum bank erosion appears as a likely mechanism leading to deviations from regular meandering plan shapes.</description>

   <description>"#surrogacy: Confronting the coloniality of Twitter and contemporary transnational surrogacy practices in India" begins to think about how the racial histories of modernity provide a lens to consider transnational surrogacy in India.  My thesis aims to unpack the complex dynamics that exist between contemporary commercial surrogacy practices, social media, archiving, and Western colonialism. This conceptual project is divided into three parts (historical, conceptual and empirical) to allow for a nuanced examination of colonial archives, the embedded colonial 'logic' and tropes in these archives, and the continuities of colonial and racialized histories that permit for an understanding of how and why India became the first transnational hub for commercial surrogacy. My scholarly work examines surrogacy and the racialized and gendered 'markings' of colonialism, as they intersect with modes of technology and transnationalism in the twenty-first century. Specifically, I seek to expose how Indian women's bodies are ever tied to colonial processes seen through transnational surrogacy transactions.                 This thesis spans historical moments as well as geographical and spatial locations as a means to necessarily articulate and conceptualize the coloniality of both surrogacy and Twitter. Here, the histories of transatlantic slavery, South Asian colonialism, and South Asian postcolonialism are pushed together to identify the dynamic workings of these tensions that allow us to think through our historical and colonial present. Namely, I am situating contemporary transnational surrogacy practices alongside the histories of racial violence, motherhood, and technology.  The historical, conceptual and empirical frameworks being employed here encourage, and necessitate, broader and more complex thinking around transnational surrogacy practices. To extend the thinking around contemporary transnational surrogacy is my intention; to position surrogacy practices within the processes of racialization and colonization necessarily illuminates the often-overlooked histories and positionalities that frame the reproductive transactions.</description>

   <description>A lack of technical expertise, fueled by a lack of positive examples, can lead to companies opting not to implement energy reduction projects unless mandated by legislation. As a result, companies are missing out on exceptional opportunities to improve not only their environmental record but also save considerably on fuel costs. This study investigates the broad topic of energy efficiency within the context of the industrial sector by means of a thorough review of existing energy reduction strategies and a demonstration of their successful implementation. The study begins by discussing current industrial energy consumption trends around the globe and within the Canadian manufacturing sector. This is followed by a literature review which outlines 3 prominent energy efficiency improvement strategies currently available to companies: 1) Waste heat recovery, 2) Idle power loss reduction and production rate optimization, and lastly 3) Auxiliary equipment operational performance. Next, a broad overview of the resources and tools available to organizations looking to improve their industrial energy efficiency is provided. Following this, several case studies are presented which demonstrate the potential benefits that are available to Canadian organizations looking to improve their energy efficiency. Lastly, a discussion of a number of issues and barriers pertaining to the wide-scale implementation of industrial efficiency strategies is presented. It discusses a number of potential roadblocks, including a lack of energy consumption monitoring and data transparency. &#xd;
While this topic has been well researched in the past in terms of the losses encountered during various general manufacturing process streams, practically no literature exists which attempts to provide real data from companies who have implemented energy efficiency strategies. By obtaining original data directly from companies, this thesis demonstrates the potential for companies to save money and reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions through the implementation of energy efficiency projects and publishes numbers which are almost impossible to find directly. By publishing success stories, it is hoped that other companies, especially SMEs (small and medium enterprises) will be able to learn from these case studies and be inspired to embark on energy efficiency projects of their own.</description>

   <description>Process monitoring and controller performance assessment are essential tools for ensuring that manufacturing processes operate safely, predictably, meet quality targets and operate profitably. Efficient techniques for process analysis and controller assessment facilitates are important for identifying areas for process and control improvement. Sheet- and film-forming processes pose special challenges for these techniques, because they often have periods of non-steady-state operation, and can exhibit both spatial and temporal variations. Existing process evaluation and analysis methodologies are oriented primarily for processes under steady operation, and focus on temporal variations. &#xd;
&#xd;
New tools are proposed to address limitations on the application of minimum-variance-based controller performance assessment to metal rolling processes. Extensions are proposed which address: 1) non-constant deadtime that arises from changes in rolling speed during startup, steady operation and wind down in the rolling process; 2) constraints on control actions; and 3) different sampling intervals for the manipulated variable input and the process output. The efficacy of the proposed extensions are demonstrated using an aluminum rolling mill and simulation examples. &#xd;
&#xd;
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a promising technique for analyzing time series that decomposes data into a number of interpretable frequency components. New filtering and spectral interpretations of SSA are proposed in this work, including a modification to the computational procedure that produces a filter with zero-phase lag. Links between SSA are made to other signal processing and time series techniques. The potential for SSA in analyzing chemical manufacturing processes is demonstrated using an extended analysis of a two-tank process under periodic operation. An SSA-based approach is proposed for computing minimum-variance-based controller performance assessment, and as illustrated using an example. This technique has potential for providing more detailed diagnosis of elements causing poor controller performance. &#xd;
&#xd;
The effectiveness of a recently proposed two-dimensional SSA (2D-SSA) algorithm is investigated for the analysis of two-dimensional problems that frequently arise in sheet forming processes. The use and interpretation of this algorithm is demonstrated using two simple examples of rolling processes with known defects in the roll. 2D spectra are computed using the 2D-SSA algorithm, and are interpreted.</description>

   <description>The application of membrane filtration for drinking water treatment is limited by membrane fouling due to the accumulation of biopolymers. Biofiltration may be an effective pretreatment approach to reduce the biopolymers, thus improving the performance of membrane filtration. Biological treatment with the microbial community associated with drinking water treatment systems can potentially play a positive role on chemical contaminant removal and biopolymer reduction through biodegradation. However, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) developed inside biofilters through microbial secretions may have adverse effects on downstream membrane filtration if an EPS sloughing event occurs. In this study, the efficacy of biofiltration to remove biopolymers was investigated. Methods developed for the analyses of EPS associated with microbial flocs and biofilms in wastewater were adapted to analyze surface waters where biopolymers are typically found at lower concentrations. &#xd;
Freeze-drying was found to be an effective method for concentrating water samples and to recover and analyze neutral and acidic polysaccharides (PS), but was ineffective for protein (PN) quantification. EPS extracted from the biofilter media was analyzed as part of the characterization of the microbial community associated with biofiltration. Results of water samples suggest that a passive biofilter was not effective for PS removal at the Peterborough drinking water pilot plant (DWPP). However, coupled with a roughing filter, a consistent removal of PS was observed in the passive biofilter at the Mannheim DWPP. Nutrient addition, hydrogen peroxide supplementation, inline coagulation and GAC were found to have impacts on PS removal and total EPS. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are a group of acidic PS, potentially playing an important role in membrane fouling. A significant reduction (over 20%) of TEP was observed in the passive biofilter at the Mannheim DWPP, suggesting the positive role of biofilter in removing TEP. Subsequently, microbial community analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA sequencing have been undertaken to understand the microbial stability of biofiltration system by studying the microbial community association between source water and biofilter systems. High similarities of microbial communities (30-65%) based on DGGE analysis were found between source waters and biofilters, suggesting microbial community shift inside biofilters are due to the changes in the microbial community of source water. Biofilters do not appear to develop into stable compartmentalized communities. It appears these are subject to fluctuation or shifts linked to the conditions of the source water. Therefore, fluctuation of biofilter performance may be expected.</description>

   <description>Hayton’s La Flor des estoires de la terre d’Orient (1307) is typically viewed by scholars as a propagandistic piece of literature, which focuses on promoting the Ilkhanid Mongols as suitable allies for a western crusade. Written at the court of Pope Clement V in Poitiers in 1307, Hayton, a Cilician Armenian prince and diplomat, was well-versed in the diplomatic exchanges between the papacy and the Ilkhanate.  This dissertation will explore his complex interests in Avignon, where he served as a political and cultural intermediary, using historical narrative, geography and military expertise to persuade and inform his Latin audience of the advantages of allying with the Mongols and sending aid to Cilician Armenia. This study will pay close attention to the ways in which his worldview as a Cilician Armenian informed his perceptions.  By looking at a variety of sources from Armenian, Latin, Eastern Christian, and Arab traditions, this study will show that his knowledge was drawn extensively from his inter-cultural exchanges within the Mongol Empire and Cilician Armenia’s position as a medieval crossroads. The study of his career reflects the range of contacts of the Eurasian world.</description>

   <description>This dissertation studies various economic issues related to the housing market. First, I investigate how trading frictions in a housing market affect lenders' decisions. In Chapter 2, by employing a dynamic house search model with long-term mortgage debt, I find that a more liquid housing market reduces not only the possibility of a borrower to default but also the lender's cost upon default. These benefits induce lenders to require lower credit requirements and issue larger loans.&#xd;
&#xd;
Second, Chapter 3 is an empirical study of volatility clustering (ARCH/GARCH effects) in home price of Canadian cities. I find that most Canadian major cities exhibit ARCH/GARCH effects in house price return and several cities also show TGARCH effects, i.e. price volatility is asymmetric in response to positive and negative shocks. Furthermore, I analyze the determinants of house price volatility and document asymmetric price adjustment in Canada.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, in Chapter 4, I develop a static house search model with indebted sellers to study the asymmetric adjustment of house prices. The analysis shows that positive changes of the average house price are larger and more likely to reflect the underlying shocks than negative changes due to the equity effect, i.e. sellers with less house equity tend to post higher asking prices. This result is consistent with empirical findings that the house price exhibits downward rigidity.</description>

   <description>In this study, we report a novel use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a platform to model the function of human RET isoforms, RET9 and RET51. C. elegans does not encompass an orthologue of RET. Thus, we ectopically expressed the intracellular domain of RET9 or RET51 under the control of a C. elegans neuronal specific reporter, mec-4. We showed that the resulting transgenic animals expressed RET isoforms that were phosphorylated in the six touch neurons of the animal. RET-expressing animals exhibited a premature axon termination phenotype, with the phenotype of RET51-&#xd;
expressing animals being significantly more penetrant than RET9 animals. The premise of the study was to use the RET model as a platform to study individual RET isoforms using the premature termination phenotype as a functional readout of isoformic activity.&#xd;
We developed and expressed mutant RET constructs of RET51 and RET9 harboring an activating mutation, M918T, and tyrosine substitutions to further dissect signalling events and differences between the RET isoforms. We identified Y1062 as a key signalling hub on RET51 that when abrogated, significantly suppressed the premature termination phenotype. Further, we showed that human RET interacted with&#xd;
worm orthologues of Cbl, Grb2, and Nck, key adapter proteins known to bind RET. We hypothesize that RET may be sequestering signalling proteins that normally associate and signal through C. elegans pro-growth receptors, SAX-3 and UNC-5, on the growing axon. Alternatively, or in addition, RET may potentially be actively signalling through MAPK pathways to promote growth cone collapse and premature termination of axons. We investigated the application of our model for drug testing, and identified the kinase inhibitor sorafenib as a potent suppressor of the RET induced phenotype. Together, our results demonstrate a novel application for C. elegans where individual RET isoforms and various derived mutants can be studied in isolation to&#xd;
further our understanding of signalling events contributing to RET-mediated disease.</description>

   <description>The international resources of nickel sulphides are quickly diminishing.  In order to satisfy forthcoming nickel demands, the feasible mining of nickel laterite deposits is imperative.  Nickel laterites cannot be easily treated since the nickel is finely disseminated throughout the ore.  Therefore, very expensive leaching and smelting processes are required to process nickel laterite ore.  The incentive for the present research was to develop a new carbothermic reduction process for nickel laterite ore that would produce a higher grade of nickel than current industrial techniques.  &#xd;
Microwave Vacuum Reduction Processing (MVRP) of a nickeliferous silicate laterite ore, followed by magnetic separation was performed.  The variables investigated included: processing time, microwave power, system pressure, use of argon as an inert gas, charcoal addition, pyrite addition, sample mass, dewatering of the sample and magnetic field intensity.  &#xd;
The optimum conditions were determined to be a processing time of 5 minutes, microwave power of 1100 W, pressure of 11 kPa, 6% charcoal addition, 30 g sample mass and magnetic separation using a WHIMS at 1A.  These conditions produced a high grade magnetic concentrate which contained 21.0% nickel with a corresponding nickel recovery of 69.6%.  The use of a vacuum atmosphere reduced the partial pressure of oxygen, increased the rate of reaction of the sample, and the lowered the reaction temperature of the process.&#xd;
When sulphur was added to a sample in the form of pyrite, less microwave energy was used, and a higher maximum temperature was reached than a sample without pyrite.  The use of an argon atmosphere resulted in high nickel grades of 7.16 to 9.24%, with moderate to high nickel recovery values of 37.64 to 88.77%.  &#xd;
Regarding the tests performed in air, a processing time greater than 10 minutes was found to be detrimental to the nickel recovery due to oxidation of the sample.  The presence of magnetite, Fe3O4, indicated that the reduced sample was oxidized during microwave processing (overheating from a long processing time) or once the sample was removed from the applicator (air exposure).  The nickel was recovered as ferronickel, primarily kamacite, α•(Fe,Ni) or taenite, γ•(Fe,Ni) in higher grade concentrates.</description>

   <description>The widespread adoption of cloud computing makes cloud services a core component of modern IT systems. Cloud service monitoring brings benefits to both service providers and consumers. It enables customers to track the status and quality of their services to ensure that their SLAs are satisfied and possibly record any SLA violations. It also supports service providers to predict potential violations and deploy additional resources in advance to avoid possible penalties of performance violations. However, federated cloud poses challenges to application monitoring due to the lack of cross-platform interoperability, management, and vendor lock-in constraints. In addition, SLA definitions might be different from one service provider to another. &#xd;
Many cloud providers offer tools to enable customers to monitor the performance of their cloud-based services. The major drawback of these commercial monitoring tools is that they do not present enough detail to consumers to be able to customize the behavior of these tools to accommodate their specific requirements. In addition, such monitoring tools typically are provider-dependent, which means that consumers cannot use the same monitoring platform for multiple cloud providers.&#xd;
In this thesis, we present SLAM, a flexible framework for SLA monitoring in federated cloud environments. SLAM is platform-independent, which enables interoperability between different cloud providers. SLAM can monitor physical and virtual resources. It uses user-defined rules and policies to map SLA parameters to relevant low-level metrics. SLAM supports monitoring of distributed nodes and hosts using an agent-based model. It supports different monitoring frequencies (i.e. checking rate) for each monitoring metric. In addition, we propose a service benchmarking approach that can compare similar services offered by different cloud providers without deploying monitoring agents at the provider’s site. We implemented a poof-of-concept prototype to showcase the flexibility and usability of our proposed system. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed system is scalable and poses a very limited overhead on target systems.</description>

   <description>In order to reduce the use of conventional, petroleum-based Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites in construction, natural alternatives are being explored such as natural fibres and bio-based resins. However, there are several known disadvantages to natural fibre reinforced composites such as lower mechanical properties and a higher affinity for moisture absorption leading to limited applications.&#xd;
In this study, three chemical treatments were chosen to address common issues associated with natural fibre composites: acetic anhydride, alkalization and amino-silane. These treatments were applied to unidirectional flax mats with a soaking time of 1 hour at low concentrations. Composite sheets were then fabricated with a commercial bio-based epoxy, and tested in standard tensile and lap-splice tests in order to evaluate their effect on mechanical properties. It was found that 2 % acetic anhydride for 1 hour produced the best results, with a 72 % increase in tensile strength and 2 % amino-silane with a soaking time of 1 hour, produced a 20 % improvement in shear strength.&#xd;
A single fibre fragmentation test (SFFT) was also performed on the chemically treated flax fibres in order to get a better understanding of the flax/matrix interface. It was found that 2 % Amino-Silane also showed the most improvement in micromechanical shear strength, supporting the lap-splice test results.&#xd;
Finally, a moisture absorption test was performed on fully fabricated chemically treated flax fibre composites in order to determine the effect on moisture absorption.  1 % acetic anhydride showed to be the most successful group with a 17 % moisture resistance improvement.</description>

   <description>Given the increasing variety of non-traditional family arrangements, together with reproductive technologies and adoption practices, assumptions about what constitutes a family and what constitutes a parent have been called into question. By using adoption as a paradigm example, my thesis examines different concepts of parenthood, what it means to be a parent, and how parental obligations are incurred.&#xd;
I support a pluralist concept of parenthood, according to which genetics, gestation, or intent to raise a child may each be sufficient to capture who is considered to be a parent in a variety of cases including adoption, contract pregnancy, or gamete donation. Using a pluralist concept of parenthood, I then consider how parental obligations are generated. &#xd;
While some have argued for a causal account of parental obligation (i.e., parents incur obligations by bringing a child into existence), I favor a voluntarist account. A voluntarist account argues that parental obligations are best understood as generated through consensually and voluntarily taking on the role of parent with the intent, rights, and obligations of raising a child. &#xd;
I argue that causal accounts fail to provide an adequate explanation of the source of obligations because a) causation is not sufficient and not always necessary to ground obligation, b) causal accounts lead to troubling restrictions on women’s reproductive autonomy, c) causal accounts cannot justify why other factors such as intent are irrelevant, and d) causal accounts have difficulty non-arbitrarily limiting the number of people involved in a causal chain in the creation of a child. &#xd;
Moreover, I explain why, on the whole, a voluntarist account is preferable. Voluntarism with regard to parental obligations has the following advantages: a) making sense of different meanings of the term “parent”, b) avoiding the pitfalls of causal accounts, and c) explaining the significance of the parent-child relationship.&#xd;
Using a voluntarist framework, I then examine the ethical implications for women and men, and for children who are placed for adoption.</description>

   <description>Recently gathered statistics on Internet usage indicate that news consumption occurs mostly online, and that youth in particular are more likely to get news and information from mobile devices.  Such statistics tend to reflect what has been widely held as a positive link between technology and communication in an increasingly interconnected world.  In short, advances in the ways people gather information about the world around them will unlock greater democratic potential.  However, statistics on the pervasiveness and increased usage mobile phones amongst youth does not demonstrate the degree to which mobile news consumption influences youth engagement in civic or political activities, meaningful daily practices, and life in contemporary Canadian society.  In order to better understand the reality of this link one must look beneath the surface of news consumption and examine the many ways in which youth negotiate their relationships to the social world.  Interviews based on the daily habits and practices of students mobile news consumption, framed in terms of choice, ethics, and identity, revealed a more precise understanding of these relations.  Based on this new information, the thesis concludes that pervasiveness of student mobile phone use is more than the overwhelming success of marketization.  Instead, their use of these devices helps them to negotiate the rhythms of everyday student life.  Not only do the students form intimate relationships with their mobile phones, they also utilize them to direct their energies toward a variety of civic and political issues through the frequent and unbroken exchange of information.</description>

   <description>Static quantum chemical calculations and first principles molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the behavior of two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded systems under sliding conditions, with the goal of assessing whether such systems may be useful as lubricants. The results demonstrate that these systems can be effective lubricants if the hydrogen bonds (HBs) in the system are of moderate strength, evenly distributed in the system, and restricted to reside within the layers. One system that meets these conditions was found to exhibit friction forces and friction coefficients that are comparable to layered systems consisting of sheets of atoms connected via covalent or ionic bonds, such as graphite and MoS2. The results also show that the flexibility associated with the HBs allows this system to reversibly undergo large structural deformations. This ability allowed this system to undergo a slip mechanism in which the layers buckled, which was found to reduce the slip barrier. The ability to reversibly accommodate structural changes may represent an advantage of systems comprising sheets of covalently or ionically bonded components, which can be damaged irreversibly as a result of large structural deformations.</description>

   <description>The dissolution of residual, or trapped, light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) is an important process that controls, in part, many LNAPL contaminated site remediation. Smear zones can be created in LNAPL source zones by water table fluctuation, trapping both residual LNAPL and gas below the water table to create a three-phase gas-LNAPL-water system. Two sets of laboratory experiments were conducted in this study to investigate the effect of trapped gas on the distribution and dissolution of trapped LNAPL. The first set involved visualization experiments where heptane was spilled in a two-dimensional (2-D) cell. Observations suggested that both heptane and air were trapped during an experiment with a large water table fluctuation, and consisted of singlets, doublets and multi-pore ganglions. Heptane was distributed as very thin films around most of the trapped air, and as discontinuous lenses, most of which were connected to air. The second set of experiments consisted of toluene dissolution experiments in short one dimensional (1-D) columns. Results showed that toluene dissolution was faster in an air-toluene-water system than in a toluene-water system. Toluene concentrations in the three-phase system were high during the early period of the dissolution, and dropped rapidly after 150-250 pore volumes, followed by long tailing concentrations. The increased toluene-water interfacial area associated with toluene films or layers in the three-phase system might be responsible for the observed dissolution behaviour. Toluene concentrations during dissolution from the two-phase system declined more slowly, and were consistently higher than those in the three-phase experiments. Modelling showed that existing two-phase empirical dissolution models, when applied to a three-phase system, over-predict early toluene concentrations, and significantly under-predict the later toluene concentrations and the time required for dissolution. The lumped mass transfer coefficient, based on the best fit of a general power law model, was found to be orders of magnitudes higher for dissolution in the three-phase system than that for the two-phase system. In conclusion, trapped LNAPL dissolution in the presence of trapped gas is substantially different than that which occurs without any gas phase, and predictions of natural attenuation and remediation performance made using two-phase models will be misleading.</description>

   <description>Zirconium alloys have been widely used in the CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) reactor as core structural materials. Alloy such as Zircaloy-2 has been used for calandria tubes; fuel cladding; the pressure tube is manufactured from alloy Zr-2.5Nb. During in-reactor service, these alloys are exposed to a high flux of fast neutron at elevated temperatures. It is important to understand the effect of temperature and irradiation on the deformation mechanism of zirconium alloys. Aiming to provide experimental guidance for future modeling predictions on the properties of zirconium alloys this thesis describes the result of an investigation of the change of slip and twinning modes in Zircaloy-2 and Zr-2.5Nb as a function of temperature and irradiation. The aim is to provide scientific fundamentals and experimental evidences for future industry modeling in processing technique design, and in-reactor property change prediction of zirconium components.&#xd;
In situ neutron diffraction mechanical tests carried out on alloy Zircaloy-2 at three temperatures: 100˚C, 300˚C, and 500˚C, and described in Chapter 3. The evolution of the lattice strain of individual grain families in the loading and Poisson’s directions during deformation, which probes the operation of slip and twinning modes at different stress levels, are described. By using the same type of in situ neutron diffraction technique, tests on Zr-2.5Nb pressure tube material samples, in either the fast-neutron irradiated or un-irradiated condition, are reported in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, the measurement of dislocation density by means of line profile analysis of neutron diffraction patterns, as well as TEM observations of the dislocation microstructural evolution, is described. In Chapter 6 a hot-rolled Zr-2.5Nb with a larger grain size compared with the pressure tubing was used to study the development of dislocation microstructures with increasing plastic strain. In Chapter 7, in situ loading of heavy ion irradiated hot-rolled Zr-2.5Nb alloy is described, providing evidence for the interaction between moving dislocations and irradiation induced loops. Chapter 8 gives the effect on the dislocation structure of different levels of compressive strains along two directions in the hot-rolled Zr-2.5Nb alloy. By using high resolution neutron diffraction and TEM observations, the evolution of type &lt;a> and &lt;c+a> dislocation densities, as well as changes of dislocation microstructure with plastic strain were characterized.</description>

   <description>An environmental role in breast cancer etiology has been suspected but evidence is still inconclusive. Traffic-related air pollution is a potentially modifiable risk factor that has been studied in the etiology of breast cancer. Two Canadian studies using similar methodology to this study have recently reported positive associations between exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a proxy for traffic-related air pollution, and breast cancer. &#xd;
This thesis used land-use regression to estimate NO2 exposure for 2,015 women recruited from Vancouver, British Columbia (BC) into a population-based case-control study conducted in 2005-2010. Cases were recruited from the BC Cancer Agency and controls from the Screening Mammography Program of BC. Cross-sectional and historical analyses were conducted using NO2 estimated at time of study entry and ten years prior to study entry, respectively. Logistic regression models were created to estimate the relationship between exposure to NO2 and breast cancer, adjusting for breast cancer risk factors and stratified by menopausal status. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, assessing potential biases introduced by screening mammography program attendance and immigrant status, among others.&#xd;
The analysis at study entry included 964 cases and 945 controls. No association between NO2 exposure (per 5 ppb increases) and risk of breast cancer was observed in the postmenopausal sample at study entry or at ten years prior to study entry. A consistent positive association in premenopausal women was observed at study entry (OR=1.17, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.48) and ten years prior to study entry (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.49). The association between historical estimates of NO¬2 (per 5 ppb increases) and breast cancer was stronger in a sensitivity analysis excluding cases who had not attended screening mammography in the premenopausal sample (OR=1.20, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.59).&#xd;
This study adds to the growing literature on exposure to traffic-related air pollution and breast cancer incidence. The results provide some support for the hypothesis that increased exposure may be associated with breast cancer, particularly in premenopausal women, although bias may have been introduced due to the selection of controls from a screening mammography program and low response rates. Future research, especially using prospective cohort studies, is needed.</description>

   <description>This research program focused on the corrosion resistance and development length of reinforcing steel coated with Cementitious Capillary Crystalline Waterproofing (CCCW) materials. The first part of this research program involved using the half-cell potential method to evaluate the corrosion resistance of CCCW coating materials. One hundred and two steel bars were embedded in concrete cylinders and monitored. In total, 64 steel reinforcing bars were coated with CCCW prior to embedment, 16 mortar cylinders were externally coated with CCCW, and 22 control (uncoated) samples were tested. All the samples were immersed in a 3.5% concentration chloride solution for a period of one year. Three coating types were studied: CCCW-B, CCCW-B+C and CCCW-C+D. The test results showed that the CCCW coating materials delayed the corrosion activity to varying degrees. In particular, CCCW-C+D applied on the reinforcing steel surface dramatically delayed the corrosion activity when compared to the control samples. After being exposed to the chloride solution for a period of one year, no sign of corrosion was observed for the cylinders where the concrete surface was coated. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second part of this research evaluated the bond strength and development length of reinforcing steel coated with two types of CCCW coating materials (CCCW-B+C and CCCW-C+D) using a modified pull-out test method. A self-reacting inverted T-shaped beam was designed to avoid compression in the concrete surrounding the reinforcing steel. Steel reinforcing bars were embedded along the web portion of the T-beam with various embedded lengths and were staggered side by side. In total, six T-beams were fabricated and each beam contained 8 samples. Both short-term (7 days) and long-term (3 months) effects of water curing were evaluated. The reinforcing steel bars coated with CCCW-B+C demonstrated a higher bond strength than did samples coated with CCCW-C+D. However, the bond strengths of samples with coating materials were reduced compared with the bond strength of the control samples. Bond reduction factors were obtained for design purposes for various coating types.</description>

   <description>The prediction of gas distributions in the subsurface is critical for many applications, including the remediation of volatile contaminants in groundwater by in situ air sparging, or releases from either shale gas development or geological carbon dioxide sequestration. These distributions are strongly affected by porous media heterogeneities. It is important to know if our current theoretical knowledge can predict gas flow in realistic two-dimensional systems. &#xd;
This study’s objective was to investigate the breakthrough of gas through layered heterogeneities, with a particular focus on pool dynamics and gas entrapment. Two controlled gas injection experiments were performed for two heterogeneous transparent soil packs, which enabled detailed gas visualization at the pore scale. Digital images were collected at high temporal and spatial resolutions and converted to saturation images using a newly derived and validated relationship. &#xd;
A two-point logarithmic saturation – pixel intensity (S-I) relationship was evaluated, with the comparison to the macroscopic endpoints being the most useful for validation, and influential in satisfying the mass balance. The methodology to derive and validate this relationship may be reduced to a single test, which is superior to the labour-intensive methods used previously in studies that used light reflection techniques.&#xd;
Using this new S-I relationship, transient pool behaviour, which included saturation profiles and pool heights, was examined for three gas pools during numerous filling and emptying events: two gas pools were beneath undulating capillary barriers (CBs) and one gas pool was beneath a simpler one-peak CB. Gas migrated upwards and collected as highly gas-saturated pools, beneath a series of CBs. The pools broke through the CBs via narrow channels. As the pool released gas, the pool height reduced until flow through the CB ceased. &#xd;
The behaviour of the two pools beneath undulating CBs behaved differently than predicted. Firstly, the pools disconnected laterally due to pinch-points trapping highly gas-saturated pockets. Secondly, some pools completely emptied to near residual gas saturation with near-zero pool heights. This may be explained by the high local air flow velocity through a single pore throat. Complete emptying of gas pools must be considered in order to accurately predict gas storage in heterogeneous systems.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-02-28 20:48:25.858</description>
   <description>Distributed generation (DG) is a continuously developing trend for interconnecting renewable sources of energy like solar and wind to the utility grid (UG), in addition to the traditional sources of energy. The intensive integration of these renewable sources, with a large increase in power switching electronics devices at the industrial and domestic level creates significant issues with power quality (PQ).  Due to the strict standards imposed on DG systems and consumer demand for higher PQ, flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) were developed.&#xd;
This thesis is focused on one of these FACTS devices, the nine-switch unified power quality conditioner (UPQC). It is presented as a flexible and effective solution for current and voltage related problems of the DG system by enhancing PQ. Maintaining similar power rating compared to the conventional UPQC, the nine-switch UPQC functions during normal, sag and swell operation while utilizing three less semiconductor switching devices. The equivalent power rating of its semiconductor switching devices, with respect to the conventional counterpart, results in reduced losses and cost of the entire system. A variable-band hysteresis control method that is applied to the shunt and series terminals performs independent control of the nine-switch UPQC currents and voltages. The shunt and series terminal controllers are accurate and fully utilize the nine-switch UPQC dc-link voltage. By avoiding a multi-loop structure and cascaded resonant blocks, controllers provide with fast, robust and stable control, while maintaining switching frequency close to the selected value. As a result, the nine-switch UPQC simultaneously mitigates current and voltage harmonics, provides power factor correction and compensates sag and swell voltage variations. All design procedures are described in details.</description>

   <description>Interest in developing biofuels, which are biodegradable, clean burning and renewable energy sources alternative to petroleum-based fuels, has increased in recent years. Microalgae are considered to be the most promising alternative energy resources and have potential to replace non-renewable fossil fuels. However, the economical extraction of lipids from microalgae for the production of biofuel is limited in part by the energy costs related to solvent use, as well as the potentially harmful effects of traditional solvents. This study investigated the use of CO2-expanded methanol and liquid CO2 as greener alternatives to traditional solvents to extract lipids from dried or wet biomass of microalgae. Unlike extractions using conventional solvents, these new methods require little to no volatile, flammable, or chlorinated organic solvents. &#xd;
CO2-expanded methanol (cxMeOH) consists of pressurized gaseous CO2 dissolved in methanol. When compressed CO2 dissolves in methanol, the solvent expands in volume and decreases in polarity, reducing the amount of organic solvent needed and using much lower pressures than those required for supercritical CO2. The decreased polarity of methanol in cxMeOH increased the selectivity of the solvent towards the extraction of biodiesel-desirable neutral lipids (NLs) and free fatty acids (FFAs). The selectivity was up to 82% for those desired lipids when cxMeOH was used, compared to about 50% when a conventional solvent was used. Moreover, the use of cxMeOH reduces the volume of organic solvent needed for the extraction by up to five times. &#xd;
The use of liquid CO2 (lCO2) presents many advantages of sustainability, safety and selectivity over the use of conventional solvents because this technique requires no flammable, highly volatile, or chlorinated solvents. The lCO2 with its low polarity has high affinity for non-polar lipids. The lCO2 was used to extract lipids from dried as well as the wet biomass of microalgae. Using lCO2, it is possible to extract up to 10% neutral lipids relative to the mass of dry algae. Also, the lCO2 extracts were up to 96% biodiesel desirable lipids with high content of oleic acid compared to only about 50% desirable lipids in conventional solvent extracts.</description>

   <description>Despite the major advances in signal processing methods used nowadays, GPS receivers still face substantial challenges, such as multipath, which remains a dominant source of ranging error. The presence of GPS multipath influences the acquisition and tracking modules inside the receiver leading to biased measurements or loss of lock of the GPS satellite signal. Consequently, GPS receivers cannot provide reliable position, velocity and time solutions. The main objective of this thesis is to introduce high resolution signal processing techniques to enhance the performance of the GPS receiver in harsh navigation environments. This research proposes a two-tier approach. The first introduces a robust spectral estimation method to acquire the carrier frequency accurately after the completion of the coarse acquisition of the GPS signals. The second method targets improving the code delay estimation inside the tracking loops of the GPS receiver to mitigate the challenging closely spaced multipath effect. In this research, a SPIRENT GPS simulator is utilized to examine the performance of the proposed methods against the state of the art techniques. The proposed fine acquisition method uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to provide robust spectral estimation of satellite Doppler frequency. The performance of the proposed fine acquisition method is evaluated against both the computational load and the noise effects. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the FFT-based fine acquisition methods resulting in 70% improvement in the acquisition accuracy at low SNR of -15 dB using only short window size of 1 ms. Moreover, this method speeds up the tracking loops in order to correctly lock the carrier Doppler shift frequency. Furthermore, the proposed multipath mitigation technique, which operates in the tracking module, is based on fast orthogonal search to enhance the code delay estimation for GPS receivers. The proposed tracking module results in an average improvement of 32% in the positioning accuracy when compared to other multipath mitigation techniques. This thesis research resulted in computationally efficient GPS acquisition module that can work in low SNR environment for limited resource GPS receivers. In addition, a robust tracking module capable of mitigating challenging GPS multipath effects is also introduced in this thesis.</description>

   <description>Dynamically scaled centrifuge analogue models are used to investigate recent interpretation of enhanced gravity data, which highlights northeast-striking inherited faults in the crust of northern India. The reactivation of these faults in the subducting Indian crust during the collision of India and Asia in the Paleogene (ca. 45–40 Ma) and early Neogene (ca. 20–15 Ma) is investigated to elucidate their potential role in localizing deformation in the upper crust.&#xd;
Models consist from bottom to top of a rigid basement material, a ductile middle, a layered package representing the upper crust, and a near-surface brittle layer. Viscoelastic materials used as analogues for the mid- and lower crust demonstrate complex dynamic behaviour; effective viscosity alone is not sufficient to determine if a material will be an effective analogue. Two series of rheological experiments are conducted using an oscillating parallel-plate rheometer to measure the storage and loss moduli and effective viscosities of potential materials. Inherently cohesive synthetic sands are suggested as suitable analogues for the brittle upper crust, historically not reproduced in centrifuge models.&#xd;
In models simulating early stage collision (ca. 10 Myr after onset), deformation is dominated by left-lateral strike-slip deformation along the inherited basement fault. This manifests in the upper brittle layer as three major sets of faults striking northwest–southeast (the same orientation as the basement fault), northeast–southwest, and east–west. Extension is accommodated in the northeast–southwest striking faults. In models simulating later stage collision (ca. 35 Myr after onset), deformation is dominated by shortening in the upper crust and two sets of folds develop. Strike-slip offset along the basement fault manifests in the ductile middle layer as lateral flow and the development of necking zones. These necking zones are interpreted to be discreet zones of strain transfer to the semi-ductile and brittle upper layers, localizing normal faults above. Three fault sets develop in the same orientation as the early stage collision models. &#xd;
We propose that the normal faults stepping en échelon along the basement fault are analogous to south Tibet graben in the prototype. These models, though based on the Himalaya, can be used as examples for thick-skinned orogenic systems worldwide.</description>

   <description>The high relative efficiency demonstrated in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) arises from a combination of light scattering within, and photo-generated electron transport through, the porous structure of a TiO2 anodes. However, the convoluted conduction path for extracting photo-generated electrons through the sponge-like structure of conventional DSSC anodes has limited further improvement. This thesis is an investigation of thin film deposited TiO2 anodes with branched tree-like structures that mimic the highly-efficient natural flow structures of trees, rivers, and the human vascular system, which can providing uninterrupted paths for photo-generated electron transport through the hierarchical branches. The main goal has been the development of a robust fabrication process for the study of DSSCs with anodes deposited with glancing angle deposition (GLAD) as it is a new area of research and the first DSSCs produced in our lab. The anodes are deposited as thin films using electron-beam evaporation with two different source of material: metallic Ti and TiO2. Ti films are shown to exhibit highly branched characteristics, with distinct branches when deposited at rate of 15  ̊A/s versus 5  ̊A/s (i.e. rate dependence). A thermal oxidation study for these films is performed using H2/ O2 at 450◦C-520◦C. For TiO2 films, post deposition annealing is performed in O2 at 450◦C. Two methods are explored to create defined active areas of the films: dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) wet etching, and lift-off lithography. DSSCs are constructed using standard components (N719 dye, I−/I3− electrolyte, and Pt cathode) paired with the photoanodes. The films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The properties of DSSCs are investigated with current density-voltage measurements (J-V). Annealed TiO2 films with thickness ranging from 1 μm-3.3 μm exhibit power conversion efficiency of DSSC of 0.5% -3.7%, respectively, which are higher efficiency than GLAD DSSCs reported in the literature for coatings of this thickness. The high fill factors (0.82) indicate good shunt and series resistances for the cells, which are also higher than DSSCs reported in the literature. The enhancement in efficiency and thus in short-circuit current is attributed to good cell performance (i.e. uniform active area), increase in the specific surface area for dye adsorption, and continuous electron transport in the interconnectivity structures.</description>

   <title>Improved Limits On The Existence Of Dark Matter. The Final Results From The PICASSO Experiment.</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2015-03-13 16:25:08.295</description>
   <description>The final results of the PICASSO experiment, with 409 kg days of exposure collected from November 2012 to January 2014, have yielded new limits for Spin-Dependent and Spin-Independent Dark Matter interactions.\\&#xd;
&#xd;
The data collected and the various backgrounds were assiduously studied using Monte Carlo simulations and a new set of sophisticated analysis techniques including the wavelet analysis presented in this thesis. In general, a good suppression of most backgrounds was attained. The neutron background event rate was reduced to about a factor of 10 compared to the previous phase of the experiment. Electronic and acoustic noise events were thoroughly suppressed. A new class of ``mystery events'' were removed as well. All that remained was the irreducible alpha background.\\&#xd;
&#xd;
No signal consistent with a WIMP Dark Matter hypothesis was observed. Consequently, an exclusion curve was obtained with a minimum limit at ${90\%}$ C.L. of ${\sigma_{\chi p}^{SD} =0.0228}$ pb at a WIMP mass of 20 GeV/$c^2$ in the Spin-Dependent sector. By combining results from 2012 and the current results, an improved constraint of ${\sigma_{\chi p}^{SD}}$(90${\%}$ C.L.) ${=0.0188}$ pb at 20 GeV/$c^2$ was placed on the Dark Matter interaction with protons in the Fluorine nuclei used in the detectors.\\&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition, the new limits on WIMP-proton interactions in the Spin Independent sector exclude the DAMA/LIBRA results (at ${90\%}$ C.L.) for low masses below 12 GeV/$c^2$ and further constrain the published CRESST and CDMS Si discovery regions at low WIMP masses.</description>

   <description>Using affect theory and feminist content analysis, this thesis situates the social media disclosures of BC teenager Amanda Todd within a larger genre of youth trauma videos on YouTube. Amanda's story has been deployed by the Canadian government and various non-profits to justify interventions that focus on protecting youth from the newest iteration of "stranger danger" on the Internet. Videos in the My Secrets genre, which can be read as a visual autobiography, overwhelmingly focus on violence young people have experienced in their homes and neighbourhoods at the hands of family and friends. Re-contextualizing Amanda's story within this genre allows for new readings of her story that challenge dominant discourses about cyberbullying and the sources of danger for youth in the age of new media and Web 2.0.</description>

   <description>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the world and stem cell therapy has shown promise for its treatment. Focusing on adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), numerous aspects still need to be investigated, including depot- and donor- dependent differences in ASC characteristics and the cardiomyogenic potential of these cells within the complex microenvironment of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM).&#xd;
In the first part of my thesis, a standardized comparative study was conducted between donor-matched subcutaneous and omentum fat ASCs, as well as donor-matched pericardial fat and thymic remnant ASCs. This study highlighted variability in the yield, viability, immunophenotype, clonogenic potential, doubling time, and adipogenic and osteogenic potential of the ASC populations. More specifically, ASCs isolated from both intrathoracic depots had a significantly higher proportion of CD34+ cells at passage 2. Furthermore, ASCs from subcutaneous and pericardial adipose tissue demonstrated enhanced adipogenic capacity, whereas ASCs isolated from the omentum displayed the highest levels of osteogenic markers in culture. Through cell culture analysis under hypoxic conditions (5% O2), oxygen tension was shown to be a key mediator of colony forming efficiency and osteogenesis for all depots.&#xd;
In the second stage, non-crosslinked 3-D porous foams derived from decellularized porcine cardiac ECM were developed. Mincing and milling processing methods were explored during scaffold fabrication and the architecture, ECM composition and physical properties of the foams were characterized. The minced foams demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties, improved long-term stability under simulated culturing conditions and better conservation of ECM constituents. &#xd;
The final stage of experimental work focused on investigating the cardiomyogenic differentiation of pericardial fat ASCs on minced cardiac foams, collagen I gels and tissue culture polystyrene using modified cardiomyogenic medium (MCM) or 5-azacytidine stimulation. Results showed that MCM was more effective than 5-azacytidine in stimulating cardiac gene and protein expression. Furthermore, enhanced differentiation was observed with both treatments on the cardiac foams, suggesting a synergistic effect of the cardiac ECM. Further, the cardiac foams were observed to provide an inductive microenvironment for the ASCs under control medium culture conditions, inducing cardiomyogenic gene and protein expression in the absence of external differentiation factors.</description>

   <description>Synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP and long-term depression, LTD) plays an important role in processes of learning and memory formation. In order to provide a link between these neurophysiological and cognitive processes the following experiments were performed using behavioral, electrophysiological, and pharmacological in vivo methods in order to describe synaptic plasticity in the adult rat visual system after learning a simple visual discrimination task.&#xd;
Initially, a novel method is described providing a simple and noninvasive means to restrict visual input. Using a harness and face-mask for monocular occlusion, rats were trained in a monocular visual discrimination task using a Y-shaped water maze. Following learning, assessment of synaptic plasticity in the thalamocortical visual pathway found both general (changes in short-term plasticity in both cerebral hemispheres) and localized changes (greater LTP levels in the hemisphere contralateral to the open eye). The enhanced LTP in the primary visual cortex (V1) was blocked by an NR2B antagonist, suggesting that training resulted in changes in NMDA receptor expression or functioning.&#xd;
Next, the effectiveness of LTD stimulation protocols to elicit synaptic depression under in vivo conditions were assessed. Of several single-pulse induction protocols tested, only strong low frequency burst stimulation (SLFS) produced significant, but transient (~20 min) depression in V1 (not affected by blockade of NMDA or metabotrobic glutamate receptors). These data highlight the resistance of the thalamocortical visual system to undergo synaptic depression in vivo. To examine whether learning alters LTD induction, SLFS was delivered to the thalamocortical visual pathway or the V1-perirhinal cortex pathway following visual discrimination. Neither pathway exhibited changes in LTD following training, suggesting that the learning-induced LTP facilitation reflects an expansion of the synaptic modification range.&#xd;
Finally, the role of different populations of NMDA receptors (cortical vs. thalamic) in LTP induction in naïve and visually trained rats was examined. Surprisingly, naïve rats do not require activation of cortical NMDA receptors to express LTP, while LTP in trained rats involved the activation of both thalamic and cortical NMDA receptors. In summary, this thesis provides novel evidence for a metaplastic, training-induced up-regulation of LTP mechanisms in the thalamocortical visual system of adult rats.</description>

   <description>The harmony and the unity among truth, good, and beauty is the ideal realm for humans to hope for. Our human being’s highest life purpose in the present is to lead a truthful, good, and beautiful life. Our humankind’s preeminent educational aim is the exploration of and the search for truth, good, and beauty. The Confucian philosophy is the base of the constitution of China’s educational ideals. During an extensive period of experimentation, the Confucian philosophy contributes to the education system comprising educational aim, curriculum, and instruction. The Confucian primary educational aim centers on the concept of jen (benevolent), which is to cultivate the person of jen or exemplary person (human quality of truth, good, and beauty); Its curriculum consists of teaching the Six Arts including li or rites (good), yue or music (beauty), she or archery (truth), yu or charioteering (truth), shu or reading (truth), and *shu or mathematics (truth). The Confucian pedagogy focuses on three major instructions such as connecting knowing and acting, teaching students according to their aptitude, and skillful directing. The Confucian educational aim, curriculum, and methods reflect the characteristics of the educational system in ancient China. John Dewey’s pragmatic philosophy and his educational ideals represent the value system of the Western modern society. Built upon pragmatism, Dewey establishes an educational aim of “educating good citizenship” (human quality of truth, good, and beauty). His major curriculum consists of knowledge (truth), emotion (beauty), and capability (good); and his main teaching methods are learning by doing, learning through inquiry, indirect learning, and integrated subjects. The Deweyan educational philosophy generates a great impact on solving social problems resulting from the social transformation in the Twentieth century Unites States of America. This study, which compares and discusses the educational theory of truth, good, and beauty between John Dewey and the Confucianism, has a practical meaning in terms of further refining and innovating current early childhood education theories.</description>

   <description>Portable navigation is increasingly becoming an essential part of our lives. Knowing a person’s position and velocity using a portable device, such as a smartphone, tablet, smartwatch, or smartglasses, has become a basic part for many people’s lives. However, portable navigation is still facing many challenges: mainly navigation in urban canyons or indoors where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are weak or unavailable, and the need to compromise the accuracy and precision of inertial sensors in return for limiting their cost and size to place in portable consumer devices. &#xd;
As a result, portable navigation needs to employ different algorithms for each mode of motion, to assure optimal results in each case. &#xd;
This thesis’ contribution is to provide a motion mode recognition module that aims to detect a wide range of motion modes using micro-electro-mechanical sensors (MEMS) within a portable navigation device, which is robust to the device usage, and device orientation. The proposed motion mode recognition module works with good accuracy in the absence of absolute navigational signals (such as GNSS or WiFi). The motion modes detected are: stationary, walking, running, cycling, in a land-based vessel, walking in a land-based vessel, standing on a moving walkway, walking on a moving walkway, moving on stairs, taking elevator, standing on an escalator, and walking on an escalator.&#xd;
The motion mode recognition module involves the following steps: data input reading, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and post-classification refining techniques.&#xd;
During the data input reading step, signal readings from a group of sensors, are simply obtained. In the second step, pre-processing, such raw signals are processed and fused to obtain more meaningful variables. Feature extraction involves grouping the variables into a window, and extracting a group of features from that window. Classification is the final step where the feature vector is fed to predict the motion mode. &#xd;
To train and evaluate the classifier models, more than 2400 tests were conducted using various portable navigation devices, such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and head mounted systems.  The training tests involved more than 35 users of various genders, weights, heights, and ages, and covering various device usages and orientations.</description>

   <description>This qualitative case study explores the use of lesson study over a ten-week period with six Ontario middle school science teachers. The research questions guiding this study were: (1) How does participation in science-based lesson study influence these teachers’: (a) science subject matter knowledge (science SMK), (b) science pedagogical content knowledge (science PCK), and (c) confidence in teaching science?, and (2) What benefits and challenges do they associate with lesson study? &#xd;
	Data sources for this study were: teacher questionnaires, surveys, reflections, pre-and post- interviews, and follow-up emails; researcher field notes and reflections; pre- and post- administration of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument; and audio recordings of group meetings.&#xd;
        The teachers demonstrated limited gains in science SMK. There was evidence for an overall improvement in teacher knowledge of forces and simple machines, and two teachers demonstrated improvement in over half of the five scenarios assessing teacher science SMK. Modest gains in teacher science PCK were found. One teacher expressed more accurate understanding of students’ knowledge of forces and a better knowledge of effective science teaching strategies. The majority of teachers reported that they would be using three-part lessons and hands-on activities more in their science teaching. Gains in teacher pedagogical knowledge (PK) were found in four areas: greater emphasis on anticipation of student thinking and responses, recognition of the importance of observing students, more intentional teaching, and anticipated future use of student video data. Most teachers reported feeling more confident in teaching structures and mechanisms, and attributed this increase in confidence to collaboration and seeing evidence of student learning and engagement during the lesson teachings. &#xd;
         Teacher benefits included: learning how to increase student engagement and collaboration, observing students, including video data, observing colleagues teach, time to collaborate, plan, and reflect, teaching the same lesson to two classes, more intentional teaching, and increasing social interactions. Teacher challenges included: teacher unfamiliarity with the students being taught, time spent taking part in lesson study, teachers in the role of observers, and impact of observers and videotaping on students and teachers during lesson enactments.</description>

These students are tuition-paying adolescents coming to Ontario unaccompanied, living with Canadian families, and studying in English-speaking high schools. Although few studies have examined adolescent international students, many studies have been conducted on mobile students and immigrant students who face many similar challenges. These studies provided the starting point for defining the kinds of supports that could be present in programs designed for unaccompanied adolescent international students. One purpose of this current research was to assess the range and scope of this educational phenomenon by looking at International Student Programs (ISPs) offered in Ontario by publicly-funded school boards. After surveying the school board web sites, I determined which publicly-funded English-language school boards accepted international students. I compared the size of 18 programs. I invited the 16 school boards that were members of Ontario Association of School Districts International (OASDI) to participate in the study. I conducted one set of telephone interviews with the managers of eight of the 16 international student programs (ISPs), and received two written responses to the interview questions. I then conducted three longer face-to-face interviews with the managers from three diverse school boards. Two orientation manuals were analyzed as a part of this study. I examined the supports that 10 programs provided for international students. Some of the participating boards had well-developed ISPs that provided academic supports, well-monitored homestays, comprehensive orientation, social activities, and had procedures to monitor student well-being. A few of the larger boards with higher enrolment were not able to offer social activities and did not provide their own homestay. &#xd;
The results of this study reveal that it was difficult to find accurate data concerning the number of international students in Ontario high schools. However, it was clear that ISPs are run as businesses and contribute to the economy in Ontario. More boards have started ISPs since 2012 and have joined the provincial and national associations. The results show that many supports such as language assessment, academic tutoring, well-monitored homestays, and social events varied widely across the province.</description>

   <description>The advent of the Suzuki–Miyaura cross–coupling reaction and its significance to the synthesis of new carbon–carbon bonds has increased the demand for efficient routes to organoboron starting materials. C–H borylation (activation) has provided an interesting approach to alleviate the requirement for prefunctionalized molecules such as aryl halides to obtain these desired organoboron substrates.&#xd;
We report the first use of a rhodium N–heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex for the catalytic C–H borylation. The reaction is found to proceed under very mild conditions (room temperature, short reaction times) and is applicable to a variety of 2–phenylpyridine (2–Ph–pyr) derivatives. Additionally, exclusive selectivity for the monoborylated product is observed with no bisborylation occurring in the reaction, which was found to be attributable to the key nitrogen–boron coordination.&#xd;
The selective monoborylation was further united with a Suzuki–Miyaura cross–coupling in a one–pot reaction to produce monoarylated phenylpyridines in good overall yields with no formation of the bisarylated compounds. Commonly, metal–catalyzed direct arylations require the use of steric blocking groups in order to obtain the desired monoselectivity and prevent bisarylation from occurring. However, these sterically biased substrates are avoided with the system described herein.&#xd;
Further, the chemoselectivity of the Suzuki–Miyaura cross–coupling of secondary boronic esters was investigated in intermolecular competition reactions with Mizoroki–Heck acceptors.&#xd;
Interestingly, the conditions of the reaction could be easily tuned to chemoselectively produce either the Suzuki–Miyaura or the Mizoroki–Heck cross–coupled product in good yields. This knowledge was then applied to an intramolecular competition reaction on a substrate containing both Suzuki–Miyaura and Mizoroki–Heck acceptor sites. Excitingly, the Suzuki–Miyaura cross–coupled product was obtained in good yield leaving the alkene substituent unreacted in the reaction. This chemoselectivity pathway opens the door for the preparation of polysubstituted aromatic compounds without the additional need for protection and deprotection steps which could result in a reduced overall yield of the desired product.</description>

   <description>The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) is an American fuel standard that sets regulations on fuel economy in vehicles. This law ultimately shapes the development and design research for automakers. Reducing the weight of conventional cars offers a way to improve fuel efficiency. This research investigated the optimality of an automobile's ladder frame chassis (LFC) by conducting multi-objective optimization on the LFC in order to reduce the weight of the chassis. The focus of the design and optimization was a ladder frame chassis commonly used for mass production light motor vehicles with an open-top rear cargo area. This thesis is comprised of two major sections. The first looked to perform thickness optimization in the outer walls of the ladder frame. In the second section, many multi-material distributions, including steel and aluminium varieties, were investigated. A simplified model was used to do an initial hand calculation analysis of the problem. This was used to create a baseline validation to compare the theory with the modeling. A CAD model of the LFC was designed. From the CAD model, a finite element model was extracted and joined using weld and bolt connectors. Following this, a linear static analysis was performed to look at displacement and stresses when subjected to loading conditions that simulate harsh driving conditions. The analysis showed significant values of stress and displacement on the ends of the rails, suggesting improvements could be made elsewhere. An optimization scheme was used to find the values of an all steel frame an optimal thickness distribution was found. This provided a 13% weight reduction over the initial model. To advance the analysis a multi-material approach was used to push the weight savings even further. Several material distributions were analyzed and the lightest utilized aluminium in all but the most strenuous subjected components. This enabled a reduction in weight of 15% over the initial model, equivalent to approximately 1 mile per gallon (MPG) in fuel economy.</description>

   <description>Focusing on the uses of interactive and immersive technologies in Canadian exhibits from 1967 to the present, this dissertation investigates how embodied rites of cultural citizenship summon subjects to interface with nation and heritage in supposedly postcolonial and multicultural frameworks. The technologies I examine encompass the diverse processes and materials that render abstract notions of nation, heritage and citizenship into tangible archives that we encounter directly through our bodies. The first chapter centres on Iris Häussler’s immersive installation, He Named Her Amber, staged in Toronto’s historic Grange manor in 2008. This work elucidates the processes through which settler colonial history is rebranded through neoliberal Creative City discourses, and the audience is affectively positioned as naturalized settler who, unlike displaced Indigenous communities, is endowed with the right to occupy the home. Following this, the National Gallery of Canada’s introduction of the audio guide for its monumental 1967 Centennial exhibit provides the historical context from which to investigate the celebration and consecration of Canada’s technological modernity. This chapter analyzes how the construction of an interactive art-historical audio-scape facilitated the citizen’s entrance into national modernity through technological access and participation. The next chapter surveys the implementation of digital touchscreens at UBC’s Museum of Anthropology, arguing that the expanded haptic interface is drafted as both material and rhetorical apparatus to strategically proclaim inclusive, multicultural paradigms. Concurrently, this interface reveals the very limits of interaction, and the paradoxes of the liberal public sphere. Lastly, the dissertation turns to the visitor-generated projections at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump (a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Alberta) in order to illustrate how motion-sensored, phantasmagoric projections work to locate but also unsettle the visitor’s body within official national—and “universal”—heritage frameworks. Here, I demonstrate how cultural citizenship is secured through the substantiating buttresses of heritage and archaeology, which emplace the visitor within an “ancient” landscape and narratology of nation which depends on inscription as much as erasure.  Ultimately, this dissertation argues that these technological overtures of nation facilitate the everyday, quotidian encounters with violence which seduce subjects into—and out of—narratives of belonging.</description>

   <description>In industry and academia, the palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reaction is one of the most often used methods for the synthesis of new C-C bonds. Recent advancements in this area have expanded the scope of this reaction to include nucleophiles with defined stereochemistry, resulting in enantioenriched, non-racemic products. Prior to this work, the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction was only applicable to processes which formed bonds between sp2 and primary sp3 hybridized carbons. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first successful example of the cross-coupling of enantioenriched secondary boronic esters was published by our group in 2009. The key components in this reaction were the incorporation of silver oxide and excess triphenylphosphine. Not only did these conditions prove effective for the coupling of these substrates, they also showed selectivity for branched benzylic species in the presence of linear alkyl boronic esters.&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to further probe this selectivity, di and tri substrates were prepared that incorporated aryl, secondary benzylic and linear boronic esters. Interestingly, cross-coupling at the secondary benzylic and linear boronic ester requires specialized conditions for the reaction to proceed. This allows introduction of two different substituents in place of the boron groups, based solely off reaction conditions, eliminating the need of protecting groups. In further expansion of the scope, we have prepared the respective enantioenriched substrates and examined their stereoretention. Herein, we discuss the successful iterative Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of both racemic and enantioenriched substrates that contain an aryl sp2 and secondary benzylic sp3 boronic (di boronic ester) or, an aryl sp2, secondary benzylic sp3, and alkyl linear boronic ester (tri boronic ester) with high retention of stereochemistry.</description>

   <description>The identification of sports related paediatric concussive injuries has become an important general public health issue, as current neurocognitive computer based assessments are unable to measure baseline changes in executive decision making (EDM) in children that result following a concussion. This is because the brain areas associated with EDM vulnerable to pediatric concussion are also maturing and improving with time. &#xd;
&#xd;
The feasibility of the Object Hit task to detect change in EDM attributes with respect to age was assessed. The Object Hit task was implemented on the virtual reality assessment platform of the KINARM exoskeleton robot. Twenty children aged five to eighteen years with typical health and development that completed the Object Hit task between three to five times over the past three years were included in the analysis. Five attributes of the Object Hit task were selected (targets hit, median error, mean hand speed, hand movement area, and hand selection overlap) for assessing distinctive components of EDM; processing time, reaction time, working memory, and action planning. Linear regression analysis was calculated for each of the five selected performance attributes with respect to age. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results from this study indicate that overall measures of performance on the Object Hit task are responsive to longitudinal age related changes in EDM from five to eighteen years of age. The overall performance measures were able to identify age related improvements over the entire age range with 84% of the change in targets hit accounted for by age, and 72% of the change in median error accounted for by age. Performance attributes specific to working memory (hand movement area), reaction time (hand speed), and action planning (hand selection overlap), were not responsive to age. &#xd;
&#xd;
The regression trend line with 95% confidence boundaries calculated for targets hit results has characteristics that allow it to establish a normative profile of change in EDM with age; however the results would benefit from a study including greater participant numbers. Future research should be completed evaluating the sensitivity of task to detect declined EDM following a concussion.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2015-03-31 17:10:00.725</description>
   <description>Nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-MS) has become an important analytical tool due to its high sensitivity through improved desolvation from smaller droplet production as well as high sample utilization due to reduced solvent and sample consumption. The reliability and sensitivity of nano-ESI-MS is largely dependent on the properties of the emitter. However, the standard single-aperture, tapered nano-ESI emitters have some serious limitations including high clogging tendency, poor robustness, and narrow flow rate range.&#xd;
To address these problems, emitters generating multiple electrosprays (MESs) have been explored, offering significantly improved sensitivity by splitting the flow into smaller streams and higher clogging resistance from multiple paths. The objective of this thesis is to develop MES emitters based on microstructured fibers (MSFs) to conquer the limitations associated with the standard emitters meanwhile to maintain higher flow rates more compatible with front-end separation techniques. &#xd;
MSF, a fiber having many hollow channels running along its length was chosen to develop nano-ESI emitters because of its dimensional compatibility, structural consistency, design diversity, and feasibility for surface modification, providing a convenient and customizable template material. First, a multi-nozzle emitter was developed using a commercial MSF with an array of polymer nozzles fabricated by optimized procedures involving in-situ polymerization of microtubes in the channels and wet chemical etching of the silica at the tip to form the nozzles. However, no MES behaviour was observed due to the densely packed channel pattern. Custom MSFs were subsequently designed and fabricated with nine or six channels arranged in a radial pattern to promote MES. While the MSFs themselves did not support MES, the formation of nozzles made by either polymer or silica at the tip face enables independent electrospray from each nozzle, showing MES behaviour with significant signal enhancement relative to a standard emitter at the same total flow rate. Furthermore, a variety of MSFs were used as templates to fabricate one-dimensional polymer microstructures including tubes, wires and porous monoliths. Because of the properties of the MSFs, the structures formed from these template channels share their low polydispersity, ultrahigh aspect ratio and axial alignment, showing great applicability in diverse fields.</description>

   <description>Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is complex IV of the electron transport chain and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. It also simultaneously translocates protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the inter-membrane space, creating the driving force of ATP synthesis. The COX holoenzyme is made of ten nuclear-encoded subunits, the largest of which is COX4. The tissue distribution of the COX4 paralogs was expected to be similar in mammals and teleosts, with a ubiquitously transcribed COX4-1 and COX4-2 expression more abundant in brain and respiratory tissue. However, I found that in general, teleosts appear to have a greater expression of COX4-2 across all tissues compared to mammals. Where interspecies differences were observed in the relative abundance of COX4-2, the differences were not readily attributable to phylogeny or hypoxia-tolerance. Additionally, I looked at hypoxia responses of COX4 on tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) because hypoxia stimulates transcription of COX4-2 in mammalian tissues. I found that neither COX4-2 nor the transcription factors that regulate COX4-2 in mammals (RBPJ, CHCHD2, and CXXC5) respond to physiological hypoxia. Finally, investigating the relationship between mRNA and protein, it appeared that protein is well predicted by mRNA at normoxic and hypoxic levels, with the exception of heart tissue (70% relative COX4-2 mRNA and 99% relative COX4-2 protein). Overall, the evidence suggests that although COX4-2 plays a more constitutive role in fish, it may not respond to hypoxia the same way it does in mammalian tissues.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-07 14:25:49.356</description>
   <description>Portable navigation may seem similar to other navigation problems where system availability, reliability, and accuracy are the objectives. However, more challenges arise due to the portability side of the problem such as having no constraints on the usage of the portable devices and its orientation or position relative to the user or platform. Sensors’ cost, computation capabilities, and battery life are additional challenges. An example of some of these challenges is when the designer tries to use more computation power to enhance the accuracy, even if the device’s computation capability tolerate this increase, it may shorten the battery life of the device. &#xd;
This research targets the development of methods to enhance portable navigation for portable and wearable devices in all environments, even in the absence of wireless positioning technologies (like GNSS and WiFi). The enhancement is through benefiting from the presence of multiple connected devices, each including at least one inertial sensor assembly. &#xd;
This research proposes new methods involving the integration of multiple devices and investigates how it can enhance portable navigation. The proposed methods have a computational demand sufficient to meet battery life constraints for portable devices. In addition, the integrated solution can scale to any number of devices at any point of time. Moreover, the method does not assume any predefined configurations of the devices or relative orientations among them and with respect to each other.&#xd;
The contributions of this research are achieved through three methods. The first enhances the accuracy of step length estimation. The second method was developed to accurately estimate the misalignment angle between the portable devices and the hosting platform, for example a person while walking or a vehicle while driving. Finally, the overall accuracy of the estimated position and velocity is enhanced while maintaining an efficient computational cost by developing a new method utilizing a new source of Kalman filtering update. &#xd;
The proposed methods were tested on a large number of real world trajectories collected using several portable/wearable devices during walking, running, and driving. The proposed methods resulted in significantly improving the accuracy of the portable navigation solution.</description>

   <description>Rhomboid protease genes have been found in the majority of sequenced genomes. Rhomboid proteins control various cellular mechanisms such as cellular development, quorum-sensing, immune system evasion, and mitochondrial membrane remodelling. Although there are no verified rhomboid-mediated mechanisms within plants, the emerging situation appears to be complex. Investigations into an Arabidopsis At1g74130 knockout line in Chapter 2 revealed a novel phenotype for proteolytically inactive rhomboids. The phenotype displayed lower chlorophyll content, under developed chloroplasts, and plants containing one less leaf throughout development. In chapter 3, the expression levels were initially investigated in order to understand the relationship with At1g74130 and Arabidopsis development. This study revealed evidence for alternative splicing, containing their own relative expression levels between young and mature leaf tissue, as well as in response to altered Tic40 expression. Each variant contained a unique relative ability to interact with Tic40 (the only verified plant rhomboid substrate) using protein pull-down methods, and demonstrated an ability to alter Mgm1 (a yeast rhomboid substrate) cleavage ratios when expressed in yeast. Chapter 4 was designed to further investigate protein-protein interactions between At1g74130 and known substrates. While investigating the ability of variant proteins to interact with Tic40 and Mgm1, an apparent physiological role within bacterial and yeast cells was uncovered. Bacterial At1g74130 expression assays revealed decreased β-lactimase secretion. With limited active β-lactimase protein, E. coli cells were observed to have increased sensitivity to ampicillin. Similarly, in S. cerevisiae cells, the expression of At1g74130 increased sensitivity to the fungicide Nystatin. The increased sensitivity within both bacterial and yeast cells were also observed through exogenously applied At1g74130 extract cocktails. Chapter 5 revealed that the Arabidopsis plastid rhomboid gene, At1g25290, also contains alternative splicing. The two transcripts that were discovered have altered relative expression in response to development and manipulated Tic40 levels. The variant At1g25290 protein contains an introduced RVL motif. Chapter 6 was designed to survey model species databases in order to uncover evidence for alternative splicing within rhomboid transcripts. This chapter suggests alternative splicing may serve a means to diversify the functions of rhomboid proteins. This thesis comprises the majority of known plant rhomboid-mediated processes.</description>

   <title>Unikkaaqtuat: Traditional Inuit Stories</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Cultural Studies) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-12 16:43:06.724</description>
   <description>Commentary on Inuit language, culture and traditions, has a long history, stretching at least as far back as 1576 when Martin Frobisher encountered Inuit on the southern shores of Baffin Island. The overwhelming majority of this vast collection of observations has been made by non-Inuit, many of whom spent limited time getting acquainted with the customs and history of their objects of study. It is not surprising, therefore, that the lack of Inuit voice in all this literature, raises serious questions about the credibility of the descriptions and the validity of the information. The Unikkaaqtuat: Traditional Inuit Stories project is presented in complete opposition to this trend and endeavours to foreground the stories, opinions and beliefs of Inuit, as told by them.&#xd;
The unikkaaqtuat were recorded and translated by professional Inuit translators over a five day period before an audience of Inuit students at Nunavut Arctic College, Iqaluit, Nunavut in October 2001. Eight Inuit elders from five different Nunavut communities told stories, discussed possible meanings and offered reflections on a broad range of Inuit customs and beliefs. What emerges, therefore, is not only a collection of stories, but also, a substantial body of knowledge about Inuit by Inuit, without the intervention of other voices. Editorial commentary is intentionally confined to correction of spellings and redundant repetitions. &#xd;
A detailed account of the editing process highlights some of the problems of translating from Inuktitut to English. This is followed by a discussion on the possibility of developing a theory of Inuit literature, based on remarks about unikkaaqtuat made by the elders. The appendices provide background information on the subject of traditional stories and the development of Inuktitut in written form.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
Objectives: To determine whether work and non-work physical activity (PA) modifies the relationship between pregnancy-related complications and future increased blood pressure (BP) in adult working women.  &#xd;
Methods: Female full-time and part-time employees from a tertiary care hospital in South East Ontario (n = 330) provided demographic, PA and history of pregnancy complications information, and participated in anthropometric examination.  Participants were classified according to BP status: 1) normal, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 120 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt; 80 mmHg; and increased, defined as SBP ≥120 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg or taking antihypertensive medication for BP control.  Levels of PA and sedentary behaviour were calculated using the validated Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, which evaluates PA in the domains of work, transportation, and recreation. &#xd;
Results: Nineteen percent of the sample reported having a pregnancy-related complication.  Thirty five percent of participants were classified as having increased BP.  Logistic regression analysis determined that working women with a history of pregnancy complications had an increased risk of having elevated BP, after controlling for covariates such as age, waist circumference, family history of high BP, and marital status (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.4-10.6).  Although 49% of the sample met the World Health Organization’s PA recommendations, self-reported health-enhancing PA levels did not modify this association.  &#xd;
Conclusion:  Women with a history of pregnancy-related complications are at risk for future cardiovascular disease in the form of increased BP.  While health-enhancing PA is known to decrease BP, we were unable to determine if self-reported PA modified the association between pregnancy complications and future elevated BP.  Future studies with larger sample sizes and objective measures of the different domains of PA are needed.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-22 09:06:28.462</description>
   <description>Terrain visibility analysis is a challenging task that is currently supported by complex tools with cumbersome user interfaces. In this thesis, we present TerraGuide, a novel multi-surface environment for exploratory terrain and visibility analysis. TerraGuide is based around a large interactive tabletop that displays a digital map from the top-down perspective. TerraGuide provides three tightly coupled visibility analysis techniques: a viewshed shows visibility in a cone drawn from the user’s touch point on the table, a panoramic view provides a 3D first-person view on a separate display, and a helicopter view allows the user to see terrain in 3D on a handheld tablet positioned over the table.&#xd;
We designed TerraGuide using three principles: TerraGuide computes views in real-time, TerraGuide couples views on different surfaces tightly, and users can easily switch between different views. These design principles affect the participants’ strategies and preference among techniques when using the TerraGuide system for terrain analysis tasks.&#xd;
A two-part user study compared these techniques and identified users’ strategies in solving a complex terrain analysis problem. The first part of the study compared the three techniques and measured performance, preference, confidence, and cognitive load during a simple analysis task. We found that the helicopter view improved participants’ completion time and accuracy when identifying the highest and lowest points on the terrain. In addition, the use of the 3D panoramic view worsened task completion time, yet increased participants’ confidence in their analysis. The second part of the study determined participants’ strategies when performing a more complex task. We identified three strategies used by participants and found they overwhelmingly adopted a bi-manual use of the tabletop viewshed and tablet-based helicopter techniques. This thesis gives insight into how multi-surface environments can be designed to allow for complementary use of techniques and fluid switching between them.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the measurement of acculturation, and the effects of acculturation on obesity, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, among Canadian youth. It consists of four manuscripts.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first manuscript developed a short, 16-item questionnaire that measures acculturation among youth in Canada; named the “Bicultural Youth Acculturation Questionnaire.” The questionnaire was pilot tested on a sample of Canadian young people aged 18-25. The BYAQ demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alphas > .75), and convergent validity with immigrant generation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second manuscript examined the relationship between immigrant generation and race/ethnic group on BMI, using data from the 2009/10 Canadian Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC) study. This study found that foreign-born youth had lower mean BMI percentiles than youth born in Canada, and this did not differ by time since immigration. Within the same ethnic group, foreign-born Arab/West Asian and East Indian/South Asian youth had lower BMIs than peers born in Canada.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third manuscript examined the relationship between time since immigration and ethnic group with physical activity using the Canadian HSBC study data. Youth who immigrated within the last 1-2 years were less likely to meet the physical activity guidelines of 7 days a week of at least 60 minutes of MVPA compared to peers born in Canada. Conversely, no differences were observed between youth who immigrated 6+ years previously and Canadian born peers. Finally, East and South-East Asian youth were less likely to meet the physical activity guidelines than Canadian host culture peers, regardless of time since immigration.&#xd;
&#xd;
The fourth manuscript examined the relationship between immigrant generation and ethnic group on screen time, and how screen time changed over two years of follow-up, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Screen time increased in all groups over follow-up. The unique finding of this study was that 1st generation immigrants reported the largest increase in screen time. This increase was enough that the low levels of screen time observed among 1st generation immigrants at baseline was consistent with 3rd generation peers at follow up.</description>

   <description>This thesis discusses and documents findings from an investigation of low temperature testing of asphalt mixes and rheological testing of binders. A number of asphalt mixes from the different Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) and the City of Kingston construction contracts were investigated for their compliance with conventional Superpave® test methods such as indirect tensile test (IDT), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR) as well as additional specification tests such as extended BBR and double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test. To investigate the presence of polymer additives and waste engine oil in the binder X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) tests were conducted. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Official’s Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (AASHTO MEPDG) software was used to predict long term low temperature performance of the mixtures in various regions of Ontario. The quality and durability of the binders recovered from some mixes were determined. Quality means the capacity of asphalt binder to reach a set of specific properties whereas durability is the measure of how well the asphalt resists change from its original characteristics when exposed to normal weathering and aging. &#xd;
Tested contracts from the City of Kingston showed grade excesses when stored isothermally for three days at low temperatures according to Ontario’s extended bending beam rheometer (BBR) protocol (LS-308) whereas most of the MTO  contracts showed grade deficits. Few of the studied recovered asphalt samples showed deficient strain tolerance as measured in Ontario’s double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test (LS-299). &#xd;
The City of Kingston samples showed predicted times to failure from 9 to 15 years or greater whereas most MTO samples resulted in predicted times to failure of 1 to 5 years. X-ray fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that most of the samples designed according to MTO specifications included waste engine oil and/or oxidized residues, both shown to reduce the performance of asphalt.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-19 13:01:09.929</description>
   <description>Adolescent delinquency is a common phenomenon that has been studied extensively for decades. Much is known about the factors which influence youth involvement in activities such as underage drinking, smoking, and drug use. However, to this point, there exists only limited theoretical and empirical research which focuses on the personal and social characteristics of adolescents who abstain from antisocial behaviour altogether. This study seeks to examine the personal attributes, impact of peers, and social bonds that influence refrainment from delinquency. This study uses the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, Cycle 3, conducted in 1998-1999 to investigate the correlates of abstention.&#xd;
   Prior research has established causal links between certain variables and abstention (such as few associations with delinquent peers, less autonomy, and strong academic inclinations). Moffitt (1993) argues that abstainers are more likely to be socially excluded from deviant peer groups based on their unappealing personal characteristics. This study attempts to ground the mixed results garnered from several studies regarding Moffitt’s abstention hypotheses. Further, this study examines in more depth the direct, mediating, and interaction effects of several individual and social correlates of delinquency abstention.&#xd;
   The results of this thesis indicate that negative traits are not consistently associated with abstention. As well, the strongest direct correlates of abstention are school commitment and relationship with parents. These appear to be mediated by delinquent peer associations. Suggestions for future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>What purpose does outdoor education (OE) serve? What are the overall objectives of outdoor education programs, and are these objectives helping students connect with the environment around them? These are fundamental questions that need to be raised in order to provide outdoor education opportunities that are meaningful and enjoyable, and that encourage environmental sustainability among students. &#xd;
Currently, in Ontario, there is no official Ontario Ministry of Education curriculum document for OE. In order for schools to offer OE, they must draw expectations from the physical education curriculum at the desired grade level. Thus, since there is no specific OE curriculum, students may not be receiving the teachings of OE such as being made aware of and learning how to appreciate the local environment, which may in turn prevent understandings of environmental sustainability. This thesis uses policy analysis to examine two curriculum documents that address the following research questions: &#xd;
1.	Does the course PPL30 in the Health and Physical Education (OME, 2000a) curriculum policy document include Overall Expectations that encourage knowledge about the practice of environmental sustainability? &#xd;
2.	Does the Native Studies (OME, 2000b) curriculum policy document, specifically the course within this document titled “Aboriginal Beliefs, Values, and Aspirations in Contemporary Society, Grade 11, College Preparation,” include Overall Expectations that encourage knowledge about the practice of environmental sustainability? &#xd;
Furthermore, this thesis references two Ontario policy documents that provide additional information about incorporating environmental sustainability throughout the curriculum: Acting Today, Shaping Tomorrow: A Policy Framework for Environmental Education in Ontario Schools (2009) and Ontario First Nation, Metis, and Inuit Education Policy Framework (2007).</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I broadly explore how the globalization of financial markets affects the valuation of international securities on the U.S. market. My first essay explores the evolution of firms’ valuation, before, during, and after firms cross-listing in the U.S., and provides novel evidence of industry effects in determinants and consequences of cross-listing. My second essay explores how U.S. litigation environment affects the valuation of U.S. listed foreign firms, and documents that firms experience negative return spillovers when their country peers are targeted by U.S. class action lawsuits. My third essay focuses on how trading location affects the return dynamics of international ETFs, the intraday pattern of the impact, as well as the characteristics of trading markets that contribute to the impact.</description>

   <description>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) can occur when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy. The full spectrum of adverse effects on the brain induced by prenatal alcohol exposure ranges from mild to severe brain dysfunction in executive functions, learning, memory, social communication, and sensory-motor skills. The goals of this thesis were to assess the functional outcomes of children with FASD using psychometric testing and eye movement control tasks and relate these to measures obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results from the eye movement studies successfully differentiated those with FASD from controls on both sensory-motor and behavioural outcomes. Children with FASD showed deficits in response inhibition, working memory, saccadic reaction time, and saccade metrics on three eye movement tasks. A sexually dimorphic impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on eye movement control was also found. The psychometric tests revealed deficits in set shifting, response inhibition, selective and sustained attention, working memory, and visuospatial processing. The DTI results revealed significantly higher mean diffusivity in the splenium of the corpus callosum. These measures were then correlated to one another to search for common brain pathways utilized to complete these tasks. Working memory measures obtained from the memory-guided eye movement task significantly correlated with three psychometric tests which measured working memory in the FASD group. The prosaccade eye movement task which measures basic sensory-motor processing was also correlated with a visuospatial processing psychometric task in the FASD group. Finally, response inhibition measures from the eye movement tasks correlated with response inhibition measures obtained from the psychometric testing in the FASD group. Additionally, eye movement inhibition measures correlated negatively to fractional anisotropy and positively to mean diffusivity of the splenium in the control, but not the FASD group. Therefore, brain function of typically developing controls and children with FASD can be successfully assessed using eye movement tasks, psychometric testing and DTI. These functional measures help identify specific brain regions affected by prenatal alcohol exposure which can lead to more specific interventions. These findings can also help streamline the diagnostic process by pointing to efficient and effective tools that differentiates children with FASD from controls.</description>

   <description>Government spends a lot of money on the reconstruction and rehabilitation of road pavements in any given year due to various distresses and eventual failure. Low temperature (thermal) cracking, one of the main types of pavement distress, contributes partly to this economic loss, and comes about as a result of accumulated tensile strains exceeding the threshold tensile strain capacity of the pavement. This pavement distress leads to a drastic reduction of the pavement’s service life and performance. In this study, the severity of low temperature (thermal) cracking on road pavements selected across the Province of Ontario and its predicted time to failure was assessed using the AASTHO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) and AASHTOWARE™ software, with inputs such as creep compliance and tensile strength from laboratory test. Highway 400, K1, K2, Y1, Sasobit, Rediset LQ, and Rediset WMX were predicted to have a pavement in-service life above 15 years. Additionally, the rheological performance of the recovered asphalt binders was assessed using Superpave™ tests such as the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR). Further tests using modified standard protocols such as the extended bending beam rheometer (eBBR) (LS-308) test method and double-edge notched tension (DENT) test (LS-299) were employed to evaluate the failure properties associated with in service performance. The various rheological tests showed K1 to be the least susceptible to low temperature cracking compared to the remaining samples whiles Highway 24 will be highly susceptible to low temperature cracking. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was performed on the recovered asphalt binders to determine the presence of metals such as zinc (Zn) and molybdenum (Mo) believed to originate from waste engine oil, which is often added to asphalt binders. Finally, the severity of oxidative aging (hardening) of the recovered asphalt binders was also evaluated using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to determine the abundance of functional groups such as the carbonyl (CO) and sulfoxide (SO). Functional groups such as styrene and butadiene were also evaluated to determine the polymer modifier content in recovered asphalt binders.</description>

   <description>Metastasis is the leading cause of death for breast cancer patients and poses significant clinical challenges in the successful treatment of breast cancer. The cytoskeleton crosslinker protein ezrin, is frequently over-expressed in invasive cancers, including breast, and is correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis. Ezrin is often associated with an invasive and metastatic phenotype; however, the mechanisms by which ezrin regulates metastatic progression remain unclear. Thus, investigation of the functional role of ezrin in specific processes that promote tumour cell invasion, and the different stages of tumour cell dissemination, is key to understanding the biology of ezrin in cancer progression. Here, I demonstrate a regulatory role of ezrin in promoting focal adhesion and invadopodia turnover, two key structures that are necessary for effective cancer cell invasion. I also show that ezrin interacts with, and regulates the activity of the cysteine protease calpain, which cleaves several focal adhesion and invadopodia-associated proteins to promote their disassembly. Ezrin-mediated regulation of calpain requires the fully open and active conformation of ezrin, and is shown in this study to be specific for the calpain-1 isoform. In vivo assessment of ezrin function reveals that this protein is primarily required for late stage disease events, including organ seeding and colonization, but not primary tumour growth or intravasation, as measured by circulating tumour cell levels. Furthermore, ezrin is important for Src-induced lymph node metastasis, and correlates with high Src expression and the presence of lymphovascular invasion in a cohort of 63 primary invasive breast cancers. Collectively, these findings provide novel and much needed insight into the molecular and functional role of ezrin as a pro-metastatic regulator in breast cancer.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Cultural Studies) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-23 15:53:26.302</description>
   <description>In this dissertation, I show how the high profile media story of a pandemic outbreak was a product of active societal agents and forces that fed off each other to shape, generate and exploit crises. Using media articles and interviews with public health leaders, public relations practitioners, and journalists who covered the 2009 H1N1 story in Canada, I combine media and communications studies, cultural studies and science and technology studies to explore how relevant social actors–in this case members of the media and public health officials–constructed the H1N1 pandemic as a public health crisis. &#xd;
	I argue that the media used the circumstance of widespread health danger to invigorate their role and importance in the public sphere, to produce what they saw as sound discourse for the public, whom they believed were eager for balanced and objective information. In doing so, the media promoted the idea of their audiences being bound together in bodily risk, and I argue that this tendency encouraged the idea of “biological citizenship” to create value in their news stories. I also contend that public health officials set up critical limitations by failing to recognize the news media as a complex mediator. The media response included strong elements of this failure. Public health and state leaders thought that journalists and their work could be controlled, yet had few tools to constrain the media or transmit a version of their messages. A breakdown in the management of the crisis ensued. Finally, I describe how public health and the media furthered a discourse that an ill and endangered body could be made resilient by a restored nation. This argument came to life with the H1N1 pandemic, when stability hinged on a nationalist frame and the population was invited to find comfort by sharing ways to reduce the global and invisible threat. I conclude by suggesting alternative approaches to the use of the news media in public health work, arguing that the extreme volume and intensity of media coverage during this outbreak should act as the catalyst for new thinking and approaches.</description>

   <description>Functional MRI of the human spinal cord and brainstem has tremendous potential to enhance our basic understanding of healthy subcortical function, and impact our ability to accurately diagnose and treat injury and disease. Despite this potential, there are many challenges and limitations that must be overcome before this technique can be of clinical use. &#xd;
The objectives of this thesis are to develop spinal cord and brainstem functional imaging methods in order to sensitively characterize sensory and pain processing in healthy humans, and to assess changes in the function of these structures that arise from a prevalent chronic pain condition, fibromyalgia (FM). Therefore, we first conducted a rigorous assessment of acquisition parameters and analytical approaches in order to reduce the impact of physiological noise and optimize our sensitivity for detecting neural function in the spinal cord and brainstem. These methodological developments were then applied to characterize the fMRI response to sensory stimuli presented in block and stepwise paradigms designed to probe different aspects of the sensory response. Results of this study confirmed the sensitivity of our fMRI methods for detecting subtle changes in sensory processing and highlight the importance of careful paradigm selection. &#xd;
Building on these findings, we probed central pain processing mechanisms using a temporal summation of second pain (TSSP) paradigm in both healthy adults and patients with FM. Our results characterized the spinal cord and brainstem fMRI response to TSSP and revealed alterations to this response in the descending control pathways in FM patients. This is the first investigation of spinal cord functioning in a chronic pain population, specifically with FM, and we provide insight into the aberrant neural mechanisms that may underlie this disorder. Altogether the work presented in this thesis details the current state-of-the-art in spinal cord/brainstem imaging methods and provides an unprecedented view of pain processing in humans.</description>

   <title>The Evolving Role of Music in Theodor Storm's Novellas</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, German) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-24 14:26:25.248</description>
   <description>The texts of Theodor Storm (1817-88) engage with the role of the artist and works of art in society during the latter half of the nineteenth century. While the role of painting and writing has already been analyzed in this regard, the function of music in Storm’s work has not been hitherto researched to any great degree. Musicians, however, feature prominently among the artists he portrays. They encounter various artistic and personal difficulties that this dissertation analyzes both through close readings and from a literary-historical perspective. &#xd;
The analysis focuses on three novellas entitled Ein stiller Musikant (1875), Zur “Wald- und Wasserfreude” (1879), and Es waren zwei Königskinder (1884), which illustrate the changing role of music in the lives of the protagonists. In order to show the development of economic and social changes that took place after the 1848 Revolution and during the Gründerzeit, the texts are analyzed in chronological order. This thematic study argues that the reflection on music can be interpreted as a specialized reflection on the topic of the artist in general, which, in itself, is a prominent theme in Romanticism. Taking into account how Romantic notions of life and art lost their appeal both during and as a result of the forces of industrialization, the study shows how music, first presented as a nurturing and comforting force in the Biedermeier era, becomes progressively less important, and, in the end, loses its appeal as artistic salvation. &#xd;
The novellas use music as a literary technique in order to comment on education, both musical and academic, with particular emphasis on girls’ education. In addition to transcending gender and social barriers, as well as establishing a continuity of sorts between the past and the present, music also serve as a psychological tool to suggest or express feelings or a state of mind. In the same vein, physical features and instruments are used in the characterization of the protagonists, while also reflecting ethnic stereotypes common to both literature and greater society at the time.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-26 11:33:27.012</description>
   <description>This thesis consists of three essays that use modern econometric methods to empirically study earnings dynamics in the United States using samples drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). &#xd;
In Chapter 2, I study a non-linear parametric model that allows an agent's future earning to depend on the earning quantile he occupies in the current period. Such dynamics reflect a different set of opportunities opened up to an agent once he changes position in the earning distribution. Chapter 3 extends the model presented in Chapter 2 to take into account the accumulation of agents' past experiences by allowing an agent's earning process to depend on both his current quantile position and the average of his previous quantiles. The current quantile position represents an agent's current opportunity or luck whereas the average of his previous quantiles assumes the role of his past experiences.&#xd;
I estimate the models using a method of indirect inference called simulated minimum distance. I find that the underlying process differs across the earning distribution. In particular, individuals in the bottom quantile have a unit root process whereas individuals in upper quantiles have a stationary process with the top quantile workers having the lowest autoregressive coefficients. &#xd;
Chapter 3 shows that a model specification with a higher weight assigned to luck, the current quantile position, has better predictions for the earning mobility presented from the data. This result implies that luck certainly plays a role in the earning process.&#xd;
In Chapter 4, I study the earning mobility of US households using nonparametric quantile regressions. I estimate future earning quantiles for individuals from every initial earning level. I find that earning mobility tends to improve in more recent years or over a longer time span. Moreover, the substantial non-linearity found in upper earning distribution suggests that relatively higher earners face more earning uncertainty than others. In addition, the slopes of quantiles as a function of initial earnings are flatter in the long run. Therefore, more than half of high earners experience an earning decline whereas the majority of low earners experience an earning increase in the long run.</description>

   <description>Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by maternal systemic endothelial dysfunction. While the clinical manifestations resolve soon after delivery, a large body of epidemiological evidence indicates significant long-term maternal risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) after PE. The mechanisms by which PE and future CVD are associated are unclear, although shared constitutional risk factors likely contribute to the features of endothelial dysfunction characteristic to both. We postulate that PE offers a window of opportunity for the identification of unique markers of dysfunction in the earliest stages of disease that may be used to validate cardiovascular risk screening in the early postpartum period.                         &#xd;
The studies presented in this thesis provide evidence of changes in circulating factors in women with a recent history of PE. Using blood samples collected within the first year of pregnancy, unique patterns of microRNA expression, enrichment of coagulation system proteins and endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction were described. Many of the described changes appear to be independent of cardiovascular risk. In addition to alterations in circulating factors however, longitudinal postpartum assessments demonstrated that microvascular and cardiac abnormalities were evident in the early periods postpartum after a pre-eclamptic pregnancy.&#xd;
Collectively, the data presented in this thesis reveal that physiological alterations in women with a recent history of PE are not necessarily dependent on clinical parameters of cardiovascular risk, and that resulting dysfunction may be demonstrated within the first year postpartum. Importantly, the biomarkers presented herein are all demonstrated elsewhere in the literature to benefit from lifestyle modification and risk reduction. In closing, the findings of this thesis support a need for cardiovascular risk screening based on obstetrical history, namely after pregnancies complicated by PE.</description>

   <description>It is challenging to obtain a final lead concentrate from copper-lead-zinc ores due to the complex mineralogy of the ore and the similar flotation behaviour of minerals within the ore. This study was carried out to investigate a new method of separating lead, found in the form of galena, through the use of the polyamine chelating agent triethylenetetramine (TETA).&#xd;
Fundamental micro-flotation, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and leaching tests were conducted on pure galena to investigate the ability of TETA to reactivate galena previously depressed using sulphite or dichromate ions. From the micro-flotation and XPS experiments it was found that when galena was depressed using sulphite ions, the addition of TETA resulted in the reactivation of galena and an increase in recovery. However when galena was depressed using dichromate ions, the addition of TETA caused a further decrease in recovery. Leaching experiments showed that lead dichromate is not easily leached by TETA.&#xd;
Bench scale studies were conducted to verify whether TETA could be used to reactivate galena from complex copper-lead-zinc ores. Results for the bench scale experiments were consistent with the fundamental studies. When sulphite ions were used to depress galena, TETA was able to effectively reactivate the galena. However when dichromate was used as the depressant, the addition of TETA did not result in the reactivation and flotation of galena. These findings further suggested that the addition of TETA in the sulphite system resulted in the removal of lead sulphite from the mineral surface. It is believed that this is lead xanthate, being more stable than lead sulphite, remained on the mineral surface, resulting in an increase in hydrophobicity and a subsequent increase in recovery. In the dichromate system, TETA did not remove the lead dichromate bearing hydrophilic product, which is believed to act as a barrier for required xanthate interaction. Interestingly, action of TETA at this stage caused reactivation of other sulphides co-existing with galena. Residual xanthate, which cannot be utilized by depressed galena, promoted stage flotation of sphalerite, pyrite and copper bearing minerals. Removal of these minerals was helpful for further upgrading of galena in the tailings fraction.</description>

   <description>Pregnancy induces a myriad of time-dependent changes to the maternal cardiovascular (CV) system and correct orchestration of these adaptations is vital for pregnancy success and future health of both mother and offspring. Complications in human pregnancy such as preeclampsia (PE) and gestational diabetes are associated with aberrant gestation-induced adaptations of the maternal CV system and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This thesis explores how several pre-existing conditions affect pregnancy. It is hypothesized that the response of the rodent maternal CV system to the burden of pregnancy will be impaired when challenged with preexisting metabolic distress, impaired angiogenesis or underlying, subclinical congenital heart defects, and these stressors will compromise fetal health.&#xd;
To study the effects of metabolic distress on pregnancy, the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse was used as a model of human diabetes. Diabetic mice exhibited a blunted maternal cardiac response to pregnancy with concomitant renal pathologies. Offspring were afflicted with CV abnormalities and decreased body weight. The link between PE and reduced maternal serum levels of placental growth factor (PGF) prompted the study of Pgf-/- mice. Knockout mice exhibited altered gestation-induced hemodynamic and CV responses, suggestive of a cardioprotective role of PGF during pregnancy. This altered maternal phenotype did not affect fetal blood flow but resulted in decreased fetal weights. Although congenital heart defects are the most common birth anomaly, their impact on postnatal adaptation to pregnancy is unknown. To investigate this, dimethadione (DMO), the N-demethylated metabolite of the anticonvulsant trimethadione, was administered to pregnant rats to produce offspring with ventricular septal defects. These deficits resolved as animals matured, reflecting a similar clinical phenomenon. Despite absence of persistent structural or functional abnormalities, treated rats exhibited altered CV and hemodynamic responses to pregnancy, suggesting latent CV dysfunction. Offspring of&#xd;
these previously treated dams presented with increased body and placental weight. ii&#xd;
Together, work performed in this thesis emphasizes the importance of maternal CV adaptions not only for pregnancy success but health of the offspring. Results also underscore the role of PGF in gestational CV adaptations and the impact of in utero chemical exposures on the postnatal capacity to adapt to pregnancy.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis was to determine whether the establishment and operation of an archives services by the Hudson's Bay Company had an effect on the company's ability to carry out document repairs. Data collection methods included reviews of published material, archival records of the Hudson's Bay Company, and semi-structured interviews. The study found that the Hudson's Bay Company's commitment to operating a modern archives service in accordance with accepted archive administration practices had a substantial effect on its ability to carry out document repairs. The principled approach to repair, as practiced by the Public Record Office, was a major influence. A review of secondary sources placed this development squarely within the context of archival developments in 20th century England. Overall, the thesis findings add to the growing conversation about conservation history in England, in particular, archive conservation history as it occurred outside of the Public Record Office in the 20th century, by discussing how some methods of repair that were devised, adopted and extended by the Public Record Office in the 19th and 20th centuries were adopted and applied in the 20th century by a well-established business corporation.</description>

   <title>Till Geochemical and Heavy Mineral Signatures of the Kiggavik Uranium Deposit, Nunavut, Canada</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-28 09:35:07.019</description>
   <description>Mineral exploration in glaciated terrain has successfully utilized till geochemistry and indicator mineral methods for diamonds and gold. More recently, methods for base metals and other commodities have been developed, however, few published cased studies have documented the glacial dispersal from uranium (U) deposits using indicator minerals and till geochemistry. In response to the need to develop surficial exploration methods to help discover drift covered U deposits, this study was conducted to document and interpret the mineralogical and geochemical signature of the Kiggavik U deposit and its glacial dispersal.&#xd;
			The study area is within the zone affected by the migration of the Keewatin Ice Divide of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Surface till samples (n=71) were collected directly overlying, up-ice and down-ice from the deposit with respect to the dominant north-northwest, northwest, and west ice flow directions. Till samples containing the highest metal contents were located directly to the west of the deposit in locally derived, basement-dominated grey till. Till geochemistry exhibits a polymetallic dispersal signature down-ice of the Kiggavik Main Zone (KMZ) outcrop. Uranium, Bi, Mo, Au, Ag, Co, Cs, Pb and W range from elevated to anomalously high concentrations up to 1 km down-ice of the KMZ and thus can be utilized as pathfinder elements. These pathfinder elements are also present down-ice from other U deposits within the Kiggavik camp, demonstrating their broad applicability to U exploration in basement rocks near the Thelon Basin. Laboratory gamma-ray spectrometry and Pb isotopic analysis were conducted on the till samples and show that eU and Pb isotope ratios in the till matrix share a strong correlation with U content in till.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Heavy mineral picking of the sand-sized till fraction did not return any U bearing minerals as they are not physically and chemically resistant to post glacial weathering. However, elevated gold grains counts were encountered and can be used as an indicator for U mineralization. Lead rich apatites grains (up to 8% Pb) were discovered in mineralized bedrock and these are of particular interest due to their rarity and potential to be a an indicator mineral for such deposits, provided that new techniques to quantitatively separate and analyze the finer fraction of the HMC be can be developed.</description>

   <description>The products of d6-ethane decomposition following charge-transfer ionization by Ar+ are studied in the present thesis to understand the reaction mechanisms that occur in the electron bombardment matrix isolation apparatus.  Gas mixtures of 1:1600 d6-ethane:Ar were electron bombarded and the resulting ionization products, as well as  remaining reagent molecules, were collected in a condensed matrix of argon.  The products of ionization include the neutral dehydrogenation products C2D5, C2D4, C2D3, C2D2, and C2D.  These products are all observed in other studies completed at the same energy of 15.8 eV, save C2D, but differ in their relative yields.  Experimental parameters were explored in the present work, including relative flux of electrons, as well as relative density of electrons in the reaction zone.  &#xd;
	Using two anodes of differing geometries, the density of electrons in the reaction zone was changed, creating either a low or high ion-density environment.  Altering this parameter changed the observed product distributions.  C2D4 and C2D2, were the sole two products observed under low ion-density conditions, whereas all of the products listed previously were observed under the high ion-density conditions, most notably the C2D product.  It is discussed that the observation of C2D, following ionization of ethane at 15.8 eV, is indicative of the occurrence of dissociative recombination processes.  The other reaction processes that occur from dissociative recombination are discussed.  Under low ion-density conditions, where dissociative recombination does not occur, the distribution of products is more similar to other research at an ionization energy of 15.8 eV, however differ in the relative product ratios.  This is justified based on differences in reaction timescales between the present experimental work and other work on the ionization of ethane.&#xd;
 	Another experimental parameter, electron-flux, is investigated here and found to have a similar effect whether in low or high ion-density experimental conditions.  The general trend is that as electron-flux increases, the extent of d6-ethane precursor consumption increases as well.  Increasing the electron-flux parameter under the high ion-density conditions causes a more significant increase in reagent consumption, as compared to the same increase in the same experiment completed using low ion-density conditions.</description>

   <description>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and high spatial resolution data combined with advanced statistical techniques have, within the last decade, contributed significantly to advances in the development of enhanced Forest Resource Inventories (FRI). The goal of this research was to explore how these data sources and statistical techniques could be utilized for predicting successional stages and species composition within a complex temperate forest ecosystem in Ontario.  This research also explored the possibility of generating tree lists from these same data sources that would forecast equivalent future forest conditions compared to in situ collected FRI data. &#xd;
For the characterization of vertical structure within forest stands a new LiDAR metric was developed, i.e., the Vertical Complexity Index (VCI). Logistic regressions were then applied to predict successional stages while boosted regression trees were adopted for the quantification of relative abundance of upper canopy species using LiDAR and high spatial resolution data. k-Nearest Neighbor imputation was used for generating individual juvenile tree information from LiDAR whereas adult tree information was generated from: i) an individual tree crown (ITC) classification; and ii) from predicted stem density and species’ relative abundance. Successional stages were well predicted using LiDAR variables (i.e., VCI, Lorey’s height and standard deviation of height) with a classification accuracy (Khat) of 86%. Average prediction accuracy was 0.71 when LiDAR variables related to biotic and disturbance processes were included. Correlations between in situ and imputed juvenile tree information were moderate, ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Stem density model fit (adj. R2) was 0.51 for conifer and 0.74 for hardwood stands. As for generating adult tree lists, ITC significantly underestimated stem density while both approaches underestimated species composition. &#xd;
This research clearly demonstrated that LIDAR variables that capture structural forest attributes can successfully be used to characterize structurally distinct successional stages and upper canopy species’ abundances in landscapes with limited topographical variation. Juvenile trees were more difficult to characterize with LiDAR variables as was the ability to generate tree lists. However, this research provides insights how to advance the characterization of juvenile trees and develop tree lists from LiDAR and high spatial resolution data.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis is to shed light on the socio-political ideology of the warrior-aristocracy of Ruvo di Puglia and the inhabitants of the Greek polis of Metaponto through observation of the motifs on the figured vessels placed in wealthy tombs. By examining the mortuary deposits of the Ruvo tombs alongside those from Metaponto, we will be able to see some similarities between the two cities. While these similarities imply a level of cultural sharing, they more succinctly show that the indigenous inhabitants of Ruvo were quite selective in borrowing from the Greeks. However, the differences provide the best insight into the fascinating practices of the Apulians. I show that the Apulian chieftains coveted a warrior-hero status and were not hesitant to liken themselves to the legendary Achilles or Herakles, while the Greeks saw such practices as a breach of the fundamental principles of their polis-centered egalitarianism. This is significant for the understanding of the cultural environment of Magna Graecia since only little remains in terms of primary sources on the subject.</description>

   <title>French Immersion for All: A Resource to Inspire, Support and Engage Parents of Students with Learning Difficulties in the French Immersion Program in Ontario</title>

   <description>The purpose of this project was to design an accessible, research-based resource for parents1 of children with learning difficulties in the French Immersion (FI) program in Ontario. The resource aimed to provide parents with current, empirical information relevant to the topic of students with learning difficulties in the FI program; to identify the most effective, pedagogically sound remediation strategies for parents to use at home to support their children’s learning; and, to provide a compilation of resources to enhance parents’ involvement and confidence in their ability to support their children’s special learning needs in the FI program.&#xd;
The Overlapping Spheres of Influence model was used as the framework for this project; the model indicates that a child’s development at home and at school overlap and a strong, positive relationship between parents and a school can have a positive impact on student achievement (Epstein, 2001). Information for this resource was collected through a careful selection and analysis of documents, including a variety of handbooks for parents of children in the French Immersion program in Ontario and relevant Ontario Ministry of Education documents. The Backwards Design model was used to inform the structure and design of the resource. Components for the resource were modelled after parent engagement kits developed by the Council of Ontario Directors in Education (C.O.D.E), and include elements such as a parent resource guide, a workshop template and accompanying Blackline master activity sheets, a reproducible fact sheet, and a list of online resources to support parents of students with learning difficulties in the FI program.&#xd;
This resource intends to fill a gap in the current literature for parents of children in the FI program in Ontario, by addressing concerns related to the learning needs of students with&#xd;

learning difficulties, because at the present time, no such document for parents in Ontario exists. This project may be presented to the local school board and will be available to share widely through networks for FI teachers and parents to support their goal to improve parent involvement and the support of students with learning difficulties in the FI programs across Ontario.</description>

   <description>Since its inception in the early 1990s, Two-Spirit has become an identity category that many Indigenous LGBTQ people have taken up as a way to signal both their Indigeneity and their queerness. In the emerging field of Queer Indigenous Studies, Two-Spirit people have become increasingly visible, however, the engagement with youth has been limited and largely confined to the social service sector. Stepping outside of these narrow confines, my research has sought to document how Two-Spirit youth envision their day-to-day lives in relation to their communities. Using an Indigenous methodology to guide the research, I conducted sharing circles in conjunction with the Native Youth Sexual Health Network in order to engage Two-Spirit youth living in Toronto. The sharing circles revealed the limits of Two-Spirit youth’s connections to the idea of Two-Spirit community. Two-Spirit youth called for an end to homophobia and transphobia within their Indigenous communities and expressed their desire to directly participate in nation-building activities as guided by their communities’ elders. The thesis analyzes the ways that Two-Spirit identity gets used in both oppressive and decolonial ways in the context of non-profit and Two-Spirit organizations to show how cultures are built around Two-Spirit identity. However, Two-Spirit youth resist narratives of victimhood created through racist ideas about Indigenous people in their stories as they search for spaces that open up dialogue about the radical ways in which Two-Spirit people can manifest their own futures rooted in Indigenous principles.</description>

   <description>This thesis is a discussion, reconstruction, and analysis of Euripides’ lost Antiope. Based on metrical studies which suggest a date much earlier than its usual date of 410 or 408 B.C., I specifically focus on the possibility that Antiope might be part of a larger Theban trilogy, produced together with Suppliant Women and one other play. I begin with a thorough look at the mythological material existing before Euripides’ version of the story, as well as the tragedy’s effect on later versions. From there I provide a translation of the existing fragments arranged in the order I believe they were written for the tragedy, and a reconstruction with discussion. The latter half of the thesis I devote to reading Antiope as part of a trilogy. I compare the similarities between the proposed Theban trilogy with the more firmly established Trojan trilogy, and I provide a discussion on Antiope and Suppliant Women, commenting on how reading the two plays together can drastically change an analysis of either. I conclude that even if Euripides did not have “trilogy” in mind when he wrote Antiope and Suppliant Women, the connection between the two tragedies is both too important and too subtle for them to have been produced in separate years and still have been appreciated by an ancient audience.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-29 21:57:36.816</description>
   <description>Models of care released over a decade ago advocate for an early and concurrent adoption of disease-modifying and palliative care approaches to address the needs of patients with a life-limiting illness, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, research suggests patients with COPD continue to receive insufficient palliative care. While endorsing these models of care is justified, no study has demonstrated their adoption by physicians caring for patients with COPD. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which resident and attending physicians adopt a palliative care approach in patients with COPD.&#xd;
A qualitative design with an exploratory approach was used. Semi-structured interviews conducted over a 5-month period involved 7 residents and 7 attending physicians from internal medicine, respirology, emergency medicine and family medicine. Following verbatim transcription and member checking, the data were inductively analyzed with the aid of the computer software Atlas.ti to identify recurrent themes.&#xd;
Results showed that interviewed physicians unknowingly practice some elements of a palliative care approach with their patients with COPD. Residents repeatedly describe influences from attending physicians’ practices. Physicians’ misperceptions of palliative care and its role in COPD limit their full adoption of this approach, creating disparity on its timely introduction.&#xd;
In conclusion, physicians delay the adoption of palliative care simultaneously with disease-modifying therapies, largely due to three barriers: 1) physicians misperceive palliative care as an approach focused on comfort, 2) physicians fear the negative perceptions held by patients about palliative care; and 3) physicians use a reactive approach to palliative care rather than a proactive approach. However, they hold a propensity to concurrently adopt a palliative care approach with disease-modifying therapies, albeit delayed, suggesting a shift in medical culture.&#xd;
Residency education about the role of palliative care in the management of patients with COPD is lacking. This should be complemented by providing targeted education for attending physicians to meet the needs of patients with COPD.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-29 22:26:55.519</description>
   <description>Open pit mining operations typically rely upon data from a Fleet Management Systems (FMS) in order to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s). For production and maintenance planning and reporting purposes, these KPI’s typically include Mechanical Availability, Physical Availability, Utilization, Production Utilization, Effective Utilization, and Capital Effectiveness, as well as Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). &#xd;
This thesis examined the datasets from FMS’s from two different software vendors. For each FMS, haul truck fleet data from a separate mine site was analyzed. Both mine sites had similar haul trucks, and similar fleet sizes. From a qualitative perspective, it was observed that inconsistent labelling (assignment) of activities to time categories is a major impediment to FMS data quality. From a quantitative perspective, it was observed that the datasets from both FMS vendors contained a surprisingly high proportion of very short duration states, which are indicative of either data corruption (software / hardware issues) or human error (operator input issues) – which further compromised data quality. &#xd;
In addition, the datasets exhibited a mismatch (i.e. lack of one-to-one correspondence) between Repair events and Unscheduled Maintenance Down Time states, as well between Functional-Failure events and Production states. A technique for processing FMS data, to yield valid Functional Failure events and valid Repair events was developed, to enable accurate calculation of MTBF and MTTR. &#xd;
A concept for identifying data quality issues in FMS data, based upon an examination of feasible durations for Production states (TBF’s) and Unscheduled Maintenance states (TTR’s), was developed and implemented through the duration-based filtering of both these categories of state. The sensitivity of the KPI’s in question to duration based filtering was thoroughly investigated, for both TBF and TTR filtering, and the consistent trends in the behavior of these KPI’s in response to the filtering were demonstrated. These results have direct relevance to continuous improvement processes applied to haul truck fleets.</description>

   <description>Champlain Sea Clay, also known as Leda Clay, is a glaciomarine clay that was deposited between 12,500 and 10,000 BP within the limits of the Champlain Sea transgression during the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet.  Isostatic rebounding of the region raised the deposits above sea level, leading to the development of deep river valleys throughout watersheds in the Ottawa region.  The river banks comprised of Champlain Sea Clay have been shown to be highly susceptible to retrogressive failures due to the soil’s sensitivity.  A long term monitoring campaign was conducted to quantify slope deformation prior to the  initial failure and successive retrogressive failures of a slope in the Ottawa region.  Digital photogrammetry (DPG) was selected to create five 3D models of the site with varying temporal resolutions.  A helium filled blimp unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) followed by a Cinestar8 octocopter UAV were used as low altitude camera platforms to carry a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera for image acquisition of the slope. A total station was used for the collection of ground control point (GCP) coordinate information.  A unique dataset detailing the evolution of a retrogressive failure was obtained and orthographic images, site cross sections, GCP displacements and digital elevation models were created.  The results displayed how monitoring methods capable of accurately capturing sub 10cm ground surface movements can be used to capture the onset of progressive failure in sensitive soils such as Champlain Sea Clays.  With the addition of subsurface soil layering geometry, soil layer properties and hydrogeological monitoring data to the DPG data, a full investigation into slope failure can be conducted to further understand the development of retrogressive landslides in Champlain Sea Clay slopes.</description>

   <description>Mathematics is much more than a formal system of procedures and formulae; it is also a way of thinking built on creativity, precision, reasoning, and representation.  I present a model for framing the process of doing mathematics within a constructivist ideology, and I discuss two fundamental parts to this process: mathematical thinking and the design of undergraduate mathematics problems.  I highlight the mathematical content and the structuredness of the problem statement and I explain why the initial work of re-formulating an ill-structured problem is especially important in learning mathematics as a mental activity.  Furthermore, I propose three fundamental processes of mathematical thinking: Discovery (acts of creation), Structuring (acts of arranging), and Justification (acts of reflection).  In the empirical portion of the study, pairs of university students, initially characterized by certain affective variables, were observed working on carefully constructed problems.  Their physical and verbal actions, considered as proxies of their mental processes, were recorded and analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative measurement.  The results of this research indicate that ill-structured problems provide opportunities for a concentration of Discovery and Structuring.  Though all of the identified processes of mathematical thinking were observed, students who are highly metacognitive appear to engage in more frequent and advanced mathematical thinking than their less metacognitive peers.  This study highlights pedagogical opportunities, for both highly metacognitive students as well as for those who demonstrate fewer metacognitive actions, arising from the activity of doing ill-structured problems.  The implications of this work are both theoretical, providing insight into the relationship between metacognition and student “performance,” and practical, by providing a simple tool for identifying processes of mathematical thinking.</description>

   <description>Research in bilingual education, including immersion education, has received increasing attention; yet such research does not have an empirical grounding in Central America, a geographic area of the world with an increasing number of schools employing a Spanish-English immersion model. In Honduras, students in bilingual schools typically outperform their monolingual peers on national university admission examinations, yet there are identified issues within these programs pertaining to English achievement. This study was conducted at The Pines Bilingual School (TPBS) and explored the relationships between mediating variables, including TPBS’ program, teacher and learner characteristics, and the process of teaching and learning English within the TPBS immersion program from both teachers’ and students’ perspectives. This study was guided by Lapkin, Swain and Shapson’s (1990) and Genesee’s (2004) frameworks drawing from research on French immersion programs in Canada, as well as studies from the developing field of elite bilingual education in South America. Four types of data were gathered for this study: 1) student reflections, 2) student focus group interviews, 3) teacher focus group and individual interviews, and 4) classroom observations. The data were then analyzed inductively by assigning codes and establishing themes. Four themes emerged from the data: 1) teacher and student characteristics, 2) program characteristics, 3) classroom practice, and 4) use of Spanish and English, which were used to answer the research questions. &#xd;
To summarize the major findings, first, teachers were inexperienced and untrained which led to a sense of professional incompetence. Second, students were highly motivated to learn English, but lacked engagement in class. Third, the English program lacked clear goals which led to doubts regarding the current immersion model and uncertainty regarding student achievement. Finally, while instructional practices included some key elements of an immersion program, the approach was primarily teacher-centred and included little integration of content and language and limited opportunities for comprehensible input and extended output. This study is crucial because it addresses essential issues faced by TPBS and similar immersion schools in Honduras. It also contributes to an important research gap in the field of immersion education in Central America.</description>

   <description>Smart Cities, enabled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), have emerged as one of the most promising applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). These Smart City environments require that the underlying sensor network infrastructure be enriched with smart devices, so that the network can understand and respond to requests from multiple users with diverse information requirements. Now, the use of artificial intelligence has enabled some amount of user-requirement awareness in sensor networks. However, there is no architectural framework around how cognition is incorporated in the network, or where the smart decision making is implemented. In addition, WSN implementations are mostly address-centric, where users must specify the location from where data must be gathered. But this is counter-intuitive to how users would like to access information in a smart city environment, especially in applications such as smart parking, where the network needs to provide the location of free parking spots to the user. Moreover, managing the large IP address space becomes problematic as the network size expands to vast counts of sensor nodes. &#xd;
In this thesis, we propose an architectural framework called Cognitive Information Centric Sensor Network (CICSN), to introduce cognition in WSNs. Cognitive nodes, capable of knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning, along with an information-centric approach to data delivery, are central to the idea of the CICSN. We propose a deployment strategy for cognitive nodes in the network such that connectivity of sensor nodes with the sink is maintained, and the number of cognitive nodes is minimized as well. Knowledge representation is done using attribute-value pairs. In addition, a Quality of Information (QoI) aware data delivery strategy, with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as the reasoning technique, is used to identify data delivery paths that dynamically adapt to changing network conditions and user requirements. Latency, reliability, and throughput are the attributes used to identify the QoI along the delivery path. Further, heuristic learning techniques are explored to improve the success rate of data delivery to the sink. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture significantly improves the QoI as well as the success rate of data delivered by the network.</description>

   <description>Mitochondrial biogenesis permits tissues to increase mitochondrial content in response to environmental and physiological stressors. In many species of fish mitochondrial biogenesis is triggered by cold exposure. The greater capacity to produce ATP may compensate for energy shortages when body temperature decreases. In goldfish, cold acclimation increases COX activity (and content), paralleled by increases in COX4-1 transcript levels. These transcriptional changes are accompanied by increases in nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) mRNA and nuclear protein levels. Since NRF-1 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals, my thesis explored whether the increase in NRF-1 caused the change in COX4-1 mRNA that is associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. I used reporter genes under the control of the goldfish COX4-1 proximal promoter to characterize the COX4-1 gene in an effort to identify cold responsive elements. Preliminary analysis of the promoter sequence suggested that there was a putative NRF-1 site at -444/-414 on the proximal promoter, and a second putative NRF-1 element in the 5’UTR. I created a series of reporters that differed in length and analyzed these promoters in several cell types. In mouse myoblasts (C2C12), a decrement in promoter activity was seen when a critical region from 230 bp to 159 bp was deleted. In C2C12 myotubes, deletion of a region of the promoter from -452 to -312 led to a 30% loss in activity. The 1592bp reporter gene transfected into rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2) cells was unaffected by deletions until shortened to 114 bp, and promoter activity was not affected by temperature. When plasmids were transfected into goldfish white muscle, no increase in luciferase expression was seen in cold-acclimated fish that showed a 6.5-fold increase in COX4-1 mRNA. This goldfish in vivo model also created an opportunity to determine if species that differ in thermal tolerance possessed promoters that differed in thermal sensitivity. COX4-1 promoters from the eurythermal goldfish and the stenothermal zebrafish showed the same magnitude of change in promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was conducted on goldfish white muscle to assess if acclimation affected the amount of NRF-1 bound to the COX4-1 promoter. I saw no significant change in binding of NRF-1 to the promoter. While I found no evidence of NRF-1 binding to the proximal promoter of COX4-1, it remains possible that the up-regulation of COX4-1 transcript is a result of NRF-1 binding to an upstream distal promoter region or in an indirect manner through regulating other transcription factors.</description>

   <title>Comparing the Responsiveness of two Health-Related Quality of Life Instruments in a Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial of Men With Prostate Cancer (NCIC CTG PR.3): the EORTC QLQ-C30+3 With PR17 Trial Specific Checklist Versus the FACT-P</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2015-04-30 14:29:23.85</description>
   <description>Background:  The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the FACT are two commonly used Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) instruments in cancer clinical trials, but there is limited data comparing them. The NCIC CTG PR.3 clinical trial compared Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) alone with ADT plus radiation therapy (ADT + RT) in prostate cancer patients. In a PR.3 sub-study, we conducted a comparison of the EORTC QLQ-C30+3 and prostate module (PR17) to FACT-P by employing a cluster randomization of 29 participating North American centers to HRQL instrument used on the PR.3 clinical trial.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Purpose:  To compare the responsiveness of two HRQL instruments to short-term radiation effects and long-term hormone effects in men treated for locally advanced prostate cancer on a clinical trial.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods:  311 patients randomized to the PR.3 sub-study were included for analysis. HRQL was assessed at baseline, 6 monthly (for 2 years), then annually; compliance exceeded 85% to three years.  The ability of each HRQL instrument to detect RT toxicity was determined by comparing mean change scores (ADT vs. ADT + RT arms) at 6 months by HRQL instrument (Wilcoxon rank-sum). The ability of each instrument to detect proportions changed (at 6 or 36 months) was determined by calculating proportions (clinically meaningful change defined as 10% change from baseline) then comparing between instrument groups (chi-square).  Finally, we compared instruments on time to clinically meaningful worsening of HRQL using Kaplan-Meier survival curves/Cox regression. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results:  The FACT-P detected significant between-treatment arm differences in urinary symptom change scores at 6 months. The EORTC QLQ-C30+3/PR17 detected significant between-treatment arm differences in diarrhea and bowel/rectum symptom changes at 6 months. For functional domains and fatigue, no significant between-instrument differences were observed in proportions of patients improved/stable and worsened at and up to 36 months. However, the FACT-P reported a faster rate of clinically meaningful HRQL decline for physical and role/functional domains.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions:  When randomly assigned to patients participating in a clinical trial, the FACT-P and EORTC QLQ-C30+3/PR17 instruments differed in responsiveness to changes in urinary and bowel symptoms attributable to radiotherapy.  The FACT-P was more responsive to change in physical and role function over time.</description>

   <description>Laser keyhole welding is an emerging materials processing technique offering many advantages over more conventional joining methods. High intensity laser light is applied to a sample, melting and evaporating the metal in its path. The resulting recoil pressure drives a narrow capillary (a 'keyhole') of vapour into the metal, allowing delivery of laser energy deep beneath the surface. The resulting weld seams are deep, narrow, precisely positioned, and often require no filler material. However, the process is inherently unstable and its underlying physics are not straightforward. The keyhole has traditionally proven difficult to measure, which hinders efforts to model, understand, and control this process. Inline coherent imaging (ICI), a laser-based ranging technique, has previously been demonstrated as an effective tool for in-situ measurement of the keyhole depth. In this work, I seek to improve our understanding of ICI's measurement of the keyhole, and enhance its utility. A new algorithm that tracks keyhole depth with zero resolution loss is demonstrated. Mechanisms responsible for signal losses in the weld image are explored, and a modified ICI system producing doubled line-rates near 600 kHz is realized. Active imaging beam scanning is implemented, increasing the resolving capability of the ICI system to three spatial dimensions. With this new capability, I measure keyhole morphology in-situ--an entirely novel way of observing this elusive and volatile physical system.</description>

   <description>Immigration to Canadian cities is a growing phenomenon. While much previous international migration research has focused on states and borders, cities are receiving increasing attention as a scale at which the lived experiences of international migrants can be better understood. Three Canadian cities – Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver – serve as Canada’s top destinations and receive a disproportionate number of Canada’s newcomers. In recent decades, flows of newcomers have diverted to other cities such as Ottawa, which is now home to the fifth largest concentration of foreign-born individuals in Canadian cities. Cities like Ottawa wherein increasing immigration rates are a relatively recent phenomenon can lack settlement services such as language training in comparison to more established gateway cities. With an increasing number of newcomers from countries where English is not an official language, there is growing concern over newcomers’ abilities to integrate both economically and socially. This research uses a mixed methods approach to combine census data, fourteen semi-structured interviews, and GIS analyses to provide a quantitative needs assessment without neglecting the qualitative aspects of service accessibility. English programs in Ottawa range from federally funded language classes to community-run conversation groups. Changing settlement patterns and growing numbers of newcomers in Ottawa raise the question whether these programs are accessible to the very groups they are intended to reach. This research assesses how English language instruction is provided for and accessed by the foreign-born population in Ottawa. Moreover, it asserts the importance of the language classroom as a space in which international migrants negotiate their identities and find their place within mainstream Canadian society. This thesis concludes by making recommendations for future action, discussing the limitations of this study, and exploring areas of future research.</description>
