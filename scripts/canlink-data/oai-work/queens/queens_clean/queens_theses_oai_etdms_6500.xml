   <description>Introduction: While external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has always been a standard of care for localized prostate cancer patients, hypofractionated EBRT has now become a standard EBRT approach. We aimed to elicit the relative weight patients place on various aspects of EBRT and to compare these findings to clinical trials results, with a goal of informing clinical practice.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: A discrete choice experiment was designed in which men had to choose between two EBRT profiles that differed in five treatment attributes: effectiveness, acute toxicity, late toxicity, length, and fiducial marker implantation. We recruited prostate cancer patients with localized disease who had completed or were undergoing EBRT at our institution. Conditional (multinomial) logit regression (MNL), mixed multinomial logit (MXL), and latent class (LC) models were used to analyze the relative importance of treatment attributes, and the trade-offs this patient population were willing to make between attributes. These results were compared to explicit ranking and rating scores the participants completed for internal validation, as well as to clinical trials findings for interpretation. The MXL and LC models were used to compare realistic EBRT scenarios that corresponded to conventional fractionation, moderate hypofractionation, and stereotactic body radiotherapy, and determine what characteristics resulted in individuals preferring certain scenarios.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: All treatment attributes’ parameter estimates were significantly different from zero, and across the MNL and MXL models the most important attributes were risks of PSA recurrence and late toxicity. The rating exercises agreed with the quantitative results. Preference heterogeneity was present, largely due to age and distance patients traveled to the cancer centre. One latent class (the “convenience group”) were not willing to lengthen EBRT to reduce risk of toxicity at any level within the model. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Prostate cancer patients with localized disease place importance on convenience of EBRT. Older participants tend to be willing to accept a risk of increased toxicity to be treated with hypofractionated regimens. This risk is well within the expected risk based on clinical trial results. Participants had a good understanding of the DCE, and the responses were internally valid.</description>

   <title>Relational Leadership: Exploring the Doctoral Supervisor–Student Context in Higher Education in Canada</title>

   <description>Review of research literature revealed that doctoral students’ well-being and performance are influenced by the leadership style their supervisors exhibit. The purpose of this research was to explore the nature of relational leadership and the leadership competencies that influence the supervisor–doctoral student relationship within the Canadian university context. I conducted an interpretive phenomenological study and I interviewed 19 doctoral students and 16 supervisors from Canadian universities across all disciplines. &#xd;
My findings suggest that relational leadership is connected to positive leadership in a symbiotic relationship—they are two sides of the same coin. The relational/positive leadership model (RPL) that emerged from the data analysis can be instrumental for ensuring that doctoral students maintain their well-being and enhance their performance. Data analysis suggests that relational/positive leadership is a spectrum spanning highly relational/positive leaders and non-relational/negative or toxic leaders. Relational/positive supervisors are student-oriented, and they create uplifting experiences for their students with possible negative aspects—normal in any social relationship. However, these negative aspects are few and manageable: the positives outweigh the negatives on this side of the positive spectrum. The RPL side is the optimistic side of the spectrum, comprising realistic supervisors who know that a doctoral program is complex and demanding, requiring their presence, understanding, empathy, compassion and wisdom. Non-relational/toxic supervisors are less people-oriented, valuing self-interest over their students’ interest, and some are absent, or overly authoritarian. They display negative attitudes and create undesirable experiences for their students. &#xd;
This model can be significant for improving doctoral supervision. The relational/positive leadership approach to doctoral supervision is supported by four influential factors: accessibility, approachability, and psychological presence (AAPP); trust; efficacy; and mentorship. These influential factors are, in turn, nourished by core leadership competencies: ethical, cognitive, emotional, and social. The findings can be used to inform further research and also policy and practice at different levels. At the individual level, supervisors and students can use the RPL model to evaluate and enhance their practices. At the group level, relational/positive supervisors can collaborate and utilize the findings to create a positive culture in each department. At the departmental/institutional level, current policies and programs can be reviewed and improved using this study’s findings.</description>

   <description>The objective of this research was to systematically investigate the dynamics of flowing subsurface gases, leading to understanding of mass loading of stray gas in unconsolidated sands, then couple this knowledge to multicomponent mass transfer in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. To do this, high spatial and temporal resolution visual techniques along with analytical methods were used to study multiphase flow, mass transfer, and surface expression of subsurface gases. Air injections in a small (25 × 25 × 1 cm3) and a large (150 × 150 × 2 cm3) two-dimensional flow cell were performed to quantify gas movement and understand the source architecture resulting from varying leak conditions. This knowledge of free-phase gas migration was then used to better understand mass transfer resulting from flowing gases. A novel visual technique to quantify gas-to-water mass transfer in the flow cells was developed. This technique was then used to quantify mass transfer from flowing carbon dioxide gas under varying aqueous flow velocities and gas injection rates. Finally, experiments were performed in which methane was injected into homogeneous and heterogeneous sand packs in the large flow cell and both aqueous and surface expression were measured. &#xd;
The results of the experiments performed have allowed for the refinement of the conceptual model for stray gas migration under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Empirical insight on the transport and fate of stray gas has been developed, enhancing our understanding of free-phase gas migration, source architecture of free-phase gas, the complex coupling between gas flow and mass transfer, and the impact of gas dynamics on the surface expression of stray gas. The combined results of this research are intended to allow for the development of sound monitoring techniques, validate numerical modelling efforts, and educate future mitigation solutions for stray gas migration. This work has provided a unique suite of data that can be applied across a variety of applications including gas migration, carbon sequestration, groundwater remediation, and waste disposal.</description>

   <description>Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical folded motifs of DNA and RNA which have received growing attention in the past 30 years as they appear to participate in the regulation of cell senescence, the production of proteins, and RNA functions. Specifically, guanine quadruplexes are often more frequently encountered in the gene promoter regions of many human cancer oncogenes. The stabilization of a guanine quadruplex using a small molecular ligand has shown to inhibit transcription, affecting the cancerous activity of the cell. &#xd;
Chemists can play a significant role through the tuning of ligands. The chemical nature of the binding platform of small molecules can be adjusted in order to improve selectivity towards guanine quadruplex over duplex DNA, which recently has been very effectively achieved in our group, in the development of a platinum-based complex which is highly selective towards guanine quadruplexes. &#xd;
In this work, the efforts towards synthesizing a luminescent BODIPY ligand to be used for cellular visualization, as well as a potentially bioactive 15-carbon urea fatty acid moiety, which has previously been shown to target the mitochondria and induce apoptosis are described. &#xd;
The end-goal of this research is to increase the selectivity for G4 motifs, to improve the effectiveness of the platinum complex towards cancerous cells, and importantly to eventually translate this technology in vivo.&#xd;
In order to effectively study the platinum complexes in cells, an imaging method is required to visualize cell entry and locate these agents. To this end, BODIPY dyes have been synthesized and attached to the G4-targeting Pt complex, and the efficient syntheses of these conjugates are detailed in Chapter 2. Their luminescent properties have been explored in the absence and presence of G4s, and their use as a reference dye for biophysical assays is discussed. The focus of the second ligand is the synthesis of a 15-carbon potentially bioactive urea fatty acid, as well as a 10-carbon test urea fatty acid molecule, and their incorporation into the platinum complex. Their synthesis are described in Chapter 3.</description>

   <title>To Transport and Ravish: Material Manifestations of the Tropes of Transcendental Sublimity in  Wollstonecraft, Wordsworth, Radcliffe, and Austen</title>

   <description>Tropes that romanticize loss of control and violent violation, most frequently of a feminized soul or mind, are pervasive in the discourse arising from the Longinian tradition of transcendental sublime theory. The fundamental premise of this study is that the conceits of sublimity – and most particularly, the echoing trope of transport and ravishment – bear a different social burden in the works of Romantic women as opposed to those of their male contemporaries. The non-fiction writings of Mary Wollstonecraft and Dorothy Wordsworth are illustrative of a disjuncture between the romanticization of lost control and the necessity for almost super-human self control required for women of the era to successfully negotiate their &#xd;
surroundings. Their travel writings in particular offer an insightful juxtaposition between literal and figurative transport, and they betray an increasing skepticism regarding the practicability, or even the desirability, of the sublime as an aesthetic ideal. The fiction of Ann Radcliffe and Jane Austen likewise capitalizes on the correlation between literal and figurative transport and ravishment in order to criticize the aesthetic hierarchy of their artistic and intellectual environment, as their novels, in differing ways, work to literalize and thereby deromanticize the oppressive aspects of sublime rhetoric. For women of the era, living in a socially encoded state of vulnerability, dependence, and exacting moral culpability, the idea of violent transport culminating in a forceful consummation would not have been the substance of transcendent vision, but of annihilation. This study explores the point of tension between these tropes of gendered oppression codified in the traditionally privileged transcendental discourse and the writing of women who problematized and challenged this rhetoric.</description>

   <description>The PICO-40L bubble chamber for direct dark matter detection is finishing the commissioning phase at SNOLAB. The detector will operate for 1 live year before being replaced by the next-generation detector, PICO-500. The elastic scattering of dark matter with the nuclei in the superheated liquid will nucleate bubbles if the energy deposited in the detector is above the threshold energy. Particle identification is achieved using the acoustic and imaging data collected. Other signals may mimic the signature of dark matter. Understanding and eliminating these background signals are critical in the future discovery of dark matter. &#xd;
&#xd;
Electron recoil induced bubbles have similar signatures as dark matter. However, they are extremely inefficient in bubble nucleation. The electron recoil background levels for PICO-40L and PICO-500 are studied in detail. In order to operate at a threshold that simultaneously maximizes the nuclear recoil acceptance and the electron recoil rejection, limiting the number of expected electron recoil events to $&lt;$1 per live year, both detectors should operate at 13.1$^o$C and 25 psi with a threshold of 2.95 keV. At this threshold, a 141 Bq Cf-252 neutron source and a 33 MBq Co-60 gamma source can be used to calibrate the nuclear and electron recoil response of PICO-40L. Existing sources have sufficient strengths to calibrate PICO-500 to the statistical accuracy required, provided that the calibrations start by the end of 2021.</description>

   <title>Cardiorespiratory Fitness as a Clinically Relevant Risk Factor</title>

   <description>The purpose of this dissertation was to provide evidence in support of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a clinically relevant tool to manage lifestyle-based disease. The objective of Study 1 was to determine whether there is a difference in all-cause mortality risk between CRF achieved through physical activity (PA) (active; CRF-A) compared to the same CRF achieved without (inactive; CRF-I). The main finding of this study was that while both CRF-A and CRF-I were associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, there was no difference in mortality risk between CRF-A and CRF-I. That those with CRF-A achieved the same risk reduction as those with CRF-I underscores the unique importance of PA as the primary determinant of CRF.  The objective of Study 2 was to determine whether the association between CRF and long-term outcomes is explained by changes in cardiometabolic risk (CMR) by exploring whether exercise-induced improvement in CRF and/or waist circumference (WC) is associated with change in CMR. The main finding of this study was that exercise-induced change in CRF was not associated with change in CMR, whereas the greater the exercise-induced change in WC, the greater the change in CMR. The objective of Study 3 was to determine whether submaximal CRF (sCRF) is inversely associated with all-cause mortality risk in adult men and women.  The main finding of this study was that adults who maintained of improved sCRF were less likely to die from all causes during follow-up than were adults whose sCRF decreased. This test provides a unique reflection of cardiovascular health that is a pragmatic alternative to maximal CRF tests. The objective of Study 4 was to determine whether change in estimated CRF (eCRF) is associated with change in measured CRF independent of exercise amount and intensity over 24 weeks. The main finding of this study was that change in eCRF is associated with change in measured CRF over 24 weeks independent of exercise amount but not intensity. In addition, systematic variation was observed between eCRF and measured CRF, highlighting a principal limitation when using eCRF to follow exercise-induced change in measured CRF.</description>

   <description>Sockeye salmon (Oncorhyncus nerka) are a heavily exploited species. Owing to their large geographical distribution and use of both freshwater and oceanic habitats, sockeye salmon are exposed to various stressors at the local, regional and Pacific-wide scale. As such, assessing the relative influence of these stressors on sockeye salmon populations can be challenging. The goal of this thesis was to further develop our understanding of the influence of local anthropogenic and climate factors on the freshwater nursery lakes upon which sockeye salmon depend. This was accomplished by investigating the impact of watershed disturbances in three large and highly valued sockeye salmon nursery lakes: Seton, Anderson and Babine lakes (British Columbia, Canada). The results indicate that anthropogenic disturbances in the watershed of these nursery lakes changed the pelagic producer communities, which may indirectly and/or directly reduce the capacity of the lake to sustain populations of sockeye salmon. The results also highlighted the importance of the local ecosystems responses to climate change which can modify the nursery ecosystem and indirectly influence the freshwater survival of juveniles O. nerka. This&#xd;
thesis also investigates the long-term variations in inferred sockeye salmon population dynamics. The reconstruction of the salmon population of Seton Lake over the last ~600 years indicate that the sockeye salmon population of Seton Lake was much larger prior to the onset of commercial harvesting. The low frequency (~300 year), high-amplitude (~3‰ oscillation in δ15N) fluctuations displayed by the Seton Lake records appeared in anti-phase with some Alaskan populations, which may indicate that coastal oceanic processes at the mouth of the Fraser River regulates the Seton Lake sockeye salmon population through a regional mechanism, other than the Alaskan Gyre and California current. Together, the findings of these studies suggest that predicting O. nerka production in the future may become increasingly challenging because of the simultaneous and potentially additive effects of local and Pacific-wide changes in climate and anthropogenic stressors.</description>

   <description>Ever-increasing environmental regulations and competition within industry to create the best performing, most cost-effective product has driven the development of computational design, analysis and optimization tools. Many tools exist which allow engineers to optimize specific aspects of their designs, but there are few optimization tools that can inform system level design. The complexity of system level design is a product of the many interactions, functional requirements and the layout of constituent parts and assemblies. System layout and packaging can have significant effect on the overall system performance, affecting metrics such as cost, and overall efficiency. Due to the complexity and scope of system design, there is significant benefit that could be realized from an optimization tool informing the packaging and layout of components and assemblies within a system.   &#xd;
This thesis presents a novel method for solving packing, packaging and layout optimization problems. This method, the Dynamic Vector Fields method, solves packing and packaging optimization problems by dynamically simulating the translation and rotation of components and assemblies over time. The final layout of objects/components is determined by dynamic vector fields, which impart acceleration onto objects. These dynamic vector fields represent the problem’s objectives, constraints, and different physical interactions between objects and their environment. Using the Dynamic Vector Fields method presents several advantages; multi-objective problems can be solved by using dynamic vector fields representing different objectives, various physical effects can be represented using dynamic vector fields, relaxation of object collisions and overlap can help reduce initial condition dependence, and the scalability of the method allows it to be applied in various contexts. &#xd;
The development of the theory, mathematics and algorithms behind the Dynamic Vector Fields method is detailed in this thesis. Capabilities to pack non-convex geometry, and pack objects into non-convex design domains are developed, allowing practical problems to be solved. Various test cases are presented, demonstrating the capabilities and efficacy of the method in solving packing type problems.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines Québec Premier Honoré Mercier's (1887-1891) critique of imperial federalism from 1885-1893 and its impact on public opinion in Montreal by analysing press coverage. Hostility to imperial federalism was nurtured and maintained by Mercier's continuous, multi-pronged and organised critique. This opposition to imperial federalism has been overlooked as a key issue in Mercier's political strategy. Disappointment with Confederation and the centralising tendencies of the federal government, coupled with surging French-Canadian nationalism, allowed Mercier to successfully frame imperial federation as a threat to provincial autonomy and to French-Canadian survival. Mercier's strategy relied on rhetoric, spectacle and political savvy in a successful example of elite opinion formation. An 1890 motion in the Quebec Assembly condemning imperial federation and an 1892 oratory contest on Canada's future at Sohmer Park, in Montreal, are examined through Montreal press coverage to illustrate the effectiveness of Mercier's critique that transcended partisan and ethnic divisions.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I develop and apply a structural framework to analyze the impacts of public transportation infrastructure expansions. In the second chapter, we incorporate rapid transportation access into an equilibrium residential location model and estimate the model with microdata from Vancouver. Simulating an expansion of Vancouver's rapid transportation network, we find dwelling prices increase in both newly connected neighbourhoods and neighbourhoods with pre-existing access to the network. In the third chapter, I develop and estimate a model of households simultaneously choosing their commute mode and residential location. Using geographic information system (GIS) data, I calculate public transportation times between each neighbourhood. Using the estimated model, I simulate households' residential and commute mode choices under counterfactual public transportation times, and analyze the changes in public transportation use, travel time, and consumer surplus across income groups.</description>

   <description>This MA thesis is a bundle that weaves time, space, and form. It includes personal narrative, considerations and reflections on creation and research as well as the production/ performance script, stage directions, and processes used for the ceremony-performance "Wani’/Lost."   Supported by the theoretical and cultural context that gave rise to this work, this bundle includes reflections on a week-long practice-based research devising process that contributed to the "Wani’/Lost" performance staged at the Ka’tarohkwi Festival of Indigenous Arts. This bundle also reflects on the devising process and the performance work ahead. These strands of reflection along with the embedment of spatial and performative theory, propose an evolving set of actions and resurgent framework for Indigenous theatrical performance. The writing also serves to disrupt the MA entity and offers ideas on how one might begin to unsettle the colonial history of theatre and the state apparatus known as ‘Canadian’ theatre. Rather than dictating instructions for readers to follow, these entwined notions serve as interventions and prompts to unravel how loss makes us not see ourselves. This bundle also asks how we can embody intimate acts of defiance, reclamation, and a call to Mino Bimaadiziwin/ the Good Life.</description>

   <description>Welfare chauvinism – the barring of minority groups from access to social benefits – is a major issue affecting many welfare states around the world. Although at first glance Canada appears to be an “exception” to this exclusionary sentiment, more recent evidence suggests that Canadians are increasingly inclined to restrict both immigrants’ and Indigenous peoples’ access to social assistance in Canada. &#xd;
This dissertation examines how perceptions of immigrants’ and Indigenous peoples’ deservingness are codified and transmitted through public discourse in Canada, specifically analyzing the ways that they are framed in news media. Exploring coverage of welfare recipients in Canadian major dailies, this dissertation analyzes the ways that immigrant and Indigenous beneficiaries of social assistance are depicted differently from non-Indigenous, native-born Canadians when it comes to a variety of deservingness perceptions, and asks how these deservingness frames affect public opinion about redistribution more generally. Utilizing three original data sets, this dissertation includes: &#xd;
1)	A framing analysis that compares the framing of immigrant, Indigenous, and general recipients of welfare across a number of deservingness markers in print media. &#xd;
2)	A public opinion survey that analyzes perceptions of deservingness for immigrant, Indigenous, and general Canadians. &#xd;
3)	A news framing experiment that tests how the deservingness frames found in news coverage of welfare recipients affect readers’ attitudes toward Indigenous, immigrant, and general beneficiaries of social assistance. &#xd;
&#xd;
This project principally finds that immigrants are framed as significantly more deserving than general Canadians and Indigenous peoples when it comes to perceptions of reciprocity – assumptions about economic contributions to Canada – in news coverage of welfare, while Indigenous peoples are framed as slightly more lazy than non-Indigenous and immigrant beneficiaries. The results of the experiment suggest that the deservingness frames elicit substantive effects on support for recipients’ access to welfare but are conditioned by the recipients’ identity. In effect, the results of the study suggest that deservingness cues in news coverage can affect public perceptions about who ought to benefit from social assistance that may have larger effects on attitudes toward redistribution more generally in Canada.</description>

   <description>Multifunction radio frequency (RF) systems provide a general-purpose hardware platform for designers to implement arbitrary waveform transmission and reception. In this thesis, a multifunction RF transceiver is designed, simulated and tested. The transceiver was designed for radar applications operating at X-band (8 to 12 GHz) and is wideband, thereby providing the designer with a wide wireless window through which they can simultaneously transmit and receive multiple signals. The system is constructed entirely using commercial off-the-shelf components; the design therefore&#xd;
consists of frequency planning, specifying a system architecture and selecting appropriate components.&#xd;
&#xd;
The final transceiver design was constructed using a homodyne architecture, which contains a mixer in the transmitter and the receiver in order to perform frequency translation between baseband and X-band. Using a mixer in the system design requires that a frequency plan be developed in order to ensure that image and sideband overlaps do not occur at the mixer outputs. Frequency planning rules were therefore developed for wideband applications and were used to specify an instantaneous bandwidth of 1.1 GHz, the largest for a multifunction system. A new criterion, called the radar metric, was then developed to quantify the design specifications of the RF system.&#xd;
&#xd;
The frequency plan and radar metric were used to specify the  final system design, which could then be simulated. In order to acquire accurate simulation results, each component was individually measured and characterized. The amplifiers in the&#xd;
system were characterized using nonlinear models so that their harmonic behaviour could be accounted for. Wideband systems are particularly susceptible to harmonic interference since it is possible for harmonics to enter the large frequency window provided by the system, hence the need for accurate nonlinear modeling. Finally, a prototype was constructed which showed that the system was able to generate a maximum transmit power of 13.56 dBm, with a receiver noise figure of 2.33 dB. Moreover, simultaneous signals were transmitted and received through the system, thereby verifying the multifunctional capabilities of the transceiver.</description>

   <description>Participation in youth sport programming has been shown to influence many outcomes associated with positive development in children and young adult populations. Despite this, the waning accessibility of youth sport programs through more expensive and time-intensive activities has made participation increasingly difficult for many children and their families. While many young athletes undoubtedly make important choices when it comes to facilitating their involvement within youth sport, parents could be seen as ultimately responsible for the final selection of youth sport program type and intensity due to their role as primary caregivers and financers. Although previous work has explored the ways in which the parents of young athletes behave within the youth sport context as well as how these behaviours may influence their children’s sport participation in various ways, little research appears to examine how sport parents make decisions about the types of sport activities in which their children participate. As such, the present study sought to conduct 15 semi-structured interviews with the parents of children participating in recreational, competitive, as well as a high-performance minor ice hockey programs in Canada with the intention of examining what factors might influence their youth sport program choices and what the decision-making processes behind these choices might look like.&#xd;
It was found that parents encouraged their children to participate in ice hockey programs as they saw the activity as a positive means to foster athletic as well as non-athletic development, to make friends, and because it was something that their children enjoyed. Parents also recognized that, within the Canadian context, ice hockey held specific benefits for their young athletes due to the sport’s popularity when compared to other extra-curricular activities. Despite these benefits however, parents also discussed barriers to participation highlighting the social climate within organizations, excessive travel, and high cost as factors in their unwillingness to remain involved in particular sport organizations. This thesis discusses the practical and theoretical implications of these findings within the context of the extant sport parent and sport psychology literature, potential study limitations, and future directions in the continued exploration of this area.</description>

   <description>The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 mediates the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier current (IKur) in the heart, important for human atrial repolarization. In physiological conditions cardiomyocytes continuously undergo mechanical load, a parameter influenced by blood pressure and fluid retention. Dysfunction of Kv1.5 has been associated with atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia linked to hypertension and atrial dilation, risk factors that involve cardiomyocyte stretch. In the current project, the effects of mechanical stretch on Kv1.5 channels were investigated. Mechanical stretch was induced by centrifuging cells at 70 × g for 5 minutes or subjecting HEK 293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes expressing Kv1.5 to low osmolarity cell culture medium (LO) leading to a 33% increase in cell size. The results demonstrated mechanical stretch induced by LO increased Kv1.5 current (IKv1.5) at 20 mV and above (P &lt; 0.01) without altering membrane expression and such an increase required the long, proline-rich S1-S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel to be intact. The LO effect also required the N-terminus, which contains the binding domain for endogenous Src tyrosine kinase that mediates IKv1.5 inhibition. Disrupting the Src binding domain of Kv1.5 through N-terminal deletion or point mutations abolished the mechanical stretch-mediated effect on IKv1.5. The results further revealed that the S1-S2 linker is coupled with the N-terminus; deletion of the N-terminus up to amino acid residue 209 altered the conformation of the S1-S2 linker such that S1-S2 linker was no longer susceptible to proteinase K (PK) cleavage. The Kv1.5 voltage dependence of inactivation which is regulated by the N-terminus was also altered by PK cleavage of the S1-S2 linker, revealing an indirect link between the N-terminus and S1-S2 linker. It is concluded that the S1-S2 linker of Kv1.5 represents a mechanosensor; when targeted by mechanical stretch, a change in N-terminal conformation occurs, relieving Src-mediated tonic channel inhibition, resulting in an increase in IKv1.5. This study reveals a signalling pathway linking mechanical stretch and Kv1.5 activity, providing a potential mechanism for stretch-induced atrial fibrillation.</description>

   <title>Multiple Perspectives on Teaching Excellence: a Case Study</title>

   <description>Teacher compensation is the largest part of the monies spent by school boards in Ontario annually and currently all teachers are paid following a grid system that rewards teachers for time spent in the system rather than the quality of their work. For example, in 2018-19, the York Region District School Board’s instructional costs were 59% of their total budget at over 800 million dollars. An exemplary teacher costs the province and its school boards just as much as a poor one. Consider the possibility that teachers could be paid on a merit based model. There is currently no way to differentiate between poor and exemplary (or any other part of the spectrum) teachers. This research attempted to utilize an existing set of characteristics of excellence (Grieve 2010) to prepare a foundation upon which a methodology could be built to standardize a method to identify exemplary educators. The goal of this study was to understand the long-term perceived effect that George Turcotte has had on his students. Mr. Turcotte has been teaching elementary school in Kingston since 1966 and has taught in the public, the separate, and private systems over those years. He is widely acknowledged locally as an excellent teacher if not entirely unique. Any attempt to create a methodology of measuring excellence would need to include unique educators such as Mr. Turcotte.</description>

   <description>Purpose: The breast cancer diagnostic process is complex. Patients can receive various tests including mammograms, ultrasounds, MRI scans and biopsies. A protracted time to diagnosis can affect a patient’s prognosis and mental well-being. This thesis examined the association between high diagnostic testing and diagnostic delay and described high testing differences across Ontario Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs).&#xd;
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of symptom-detected patients diagnosed in Ontario from 2007 to 2015 (N=38,590) using data from linked administrative datasets. Patients diagnosed from 2012 to 2015 were included in the LHIN-specific analyses. High testing was defined as patients having received > 2 days of mammogram appointments, > 2 days of ultrasound appointments, > 1 day of MRI appointments, or > 2 days of biopsy appointments. The outcome studied was whether patients had a specialist interval (time from first specialist test or consultation to diagnosis) longer than 30 or 90 days. Hierarchical logistic regression controlled for potential confounders and clustering by diagnosing institution.&#xd;
Results: High diagnostic testing occurred in 13.4% of patients. Patients with high testing had higher odds of having a specialist interval longer than 30 days (adjusted OR=9.9; 95% CI: 9.2-10.7) and 90 days (adjusted OR=8.0; 95% CI: 7.4-8.7) compared to patients who received standard testing. High diagnostic testing varied by LHIN, ranging from 4.0% to 31.6%. Studying the LHINs indicated variation in high testing after controlling for potential confounders and that repeat breast ultrasound appeared to be driving the high testing rate.&#xd;
Conclusions: This thesis provides evidence that there is a strong association between receiving a high amount of diagnostic testing and the time to a breast cancer diagnosis in symptomatic patients. Additionally, ultrasound is the diagnostic test repeated most often and the test that explains high test variation across LHINs. This information could help Ontario and other health care jurisdictions develop models of high-quality breast cancer care that also aim to reduce repeat diagnostic testing with the goal of shortening the time to diagnosis.</description>

   <description>Many scholars agree that creative music making can facilitate student agency development, increase a sense of belonging and foster creative expression. Creative music making allows students to bring their perspectives to the learning context through their own creations and explorations. In my own teaching practice, I have had difficulty implementing creative music making in a community music setting. Using a two-phase approach of multiple qualitative case studies, and action research, I examined teachers’ perspectives of creative music making, and ways I can improve my own teaching of creative music making. Findings revealed that teachers’ experiences with creative music making in their own music education played a crucial role in preparing them to teach creative music. Instructors conceptualized creative music making as activities that develop people’s agency through collaborative music creation, that have the benefit of creating a sense of belonging, while giving students the opportunity to contribute to their community. The implementation of creative music making seems to rely on connecting students to their wider community, which is achieved in part through incorporating their own musical tastes and experiences. Instructors indicated that balancing the learning goals of technical development with creative music making and exploration was an ongoing challenge.</description>

   <description>Tailings dams are constructed in stages, exhibit sediment deposits located in the reservoir upstream of the dam crest (beaches) generated from slurry deposition, and are commonly designed with shallower upstream slopes in contrast with conventional water storage dams. Current breach models for the failure mode of overtopping, used to inform flood routing and emergency preparedness plans, have been developed for water storage dams and have not been calibrated to the tailings dam case. This thesis presents the results of eleven 1m high homogeneous fine sand dams brought to failure by overtopping to investigate the influence of dam geometries varying from water storage dams to tailings dams on the outflow hydrograph. Laboratory observations indicate that the breach crest geometry can be described as a semi-ellipse, and that the size and shape of the breach crest controls instantaneous discharge during breach. This geometric relationship, coupled with an observed linear breach crest growth rate and a discharge equation were shown to permit an estimation of discharge from the onset of breach to peak discharge. Peak discharge was demonstrated to occur when the combination of breach crest length and depth of water flowing over the crest were at their maximum, given a finite reservoir volume. The reservoir storage function was shown to limit breach discharge when the reservoir elevation fell below the sum of the dam height below the breach crest location and maximum potential depth of water flowing over the breach crest. These findings enabled calculation of the maximum discharge rate and time to reach peak discharge, based on reservoir and dam upstream geometry. The presence of a shallowly sloping beach in the reservoir impacted peak discharge only in the case where the beach was intersected by the breach crest while the discharge rate was on the rising limb of the outflow hydrograph.

   <description>In 2016 Colin Kaepernick captured the attention of America when he did not stand for the playing of the national anthem before a National Football League preseason game to protest racist police violence. Shortly thereafter, Megan Rapinoe a female professional soccer player chose to support Kaepernick and knelt during the national anthem as well in protest. The media and public reaction towards the athletes was influenced by the racial landscape of the United States in 2016. This thesis is a critical discourse analysis of user generated comments on the social media platform Instagram in response to Kaepernick’s and Rapinoe’s protest to determine public perception of athlete activism, racism, and other social issues. Utilizing critical race theory, I argue that dominant discourses in opposition towards the athletes reflect colourblind ideologies and appear race-neutral, but in reality reinforce a white racial hierarchy. In addition, I contend that online social media platforms can function as spaces where hegemonic ideologies around race can be contested.</description>

   <description>The demand for air conditioning is estimated to increase rapidly due to rising world population and the effects of climate change. It is expected that the use of air conditioners will increase by a factor of five by 2050, which stresses the need for more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient systems. In many locations, dehumidification is an important aspect of air conditioning, increasing energy consumption.  An alternative to conventional vapour-compression cooling systems are systems where the outdoor-air is dehumidified by a liquid desiccant solution. &#xd;
Typical liquid desiccant dehumidifiers (LDD) pass building-air over a concentrated liquid desiccant solution that absorbs moisture from the air stream, decreasing the solution concentration. The solution is subsequently heated to drive off the moisture allowing it to be regenerated. The design of an efficient and compact dehumidifier section is crucial. To achieve this goal, a thorough understanding of the heat and mass transfer processes is required.&#xd;
Therefore, this thesis presents an analysis of the heat and mass transfer in an idealized section of a LDD.  This was accomplished by modelling the flow of water and air in an adiabatic, vertical, parallel-plate channel. The effects of the inlet mass flow rate and temperature were investigated. The results show that the water temperature and inlet flow rate have a significant effect on the condensation processes. The inlet air flow rate was found to have the least impact on the performance.&#xd;
Three cases were studied for a water/lithium-chloride liquid desiccant dehumidifier, i.e.  internally cooled parallel-flow and counter-flow, and adiabatic counter-flow. A parametric study indicated the best performance for the internally cooled (isothermal) case, however, for long channels, a uniform heat flux boundary condition should be better.</description>

   <description>Water is a valuable resource for society, but it is not always used sustainably. In various cities across the globe, a great deal of water has been leaking from pipe networks, for example, due to corrosion-induced leakage, poor installation, and the distortion and opening of joints resulting from ground deformation. In recent years, PVC pipes have often been the choice for buried water mains. These pipes generally use gasketed bell-and-spigot joints to connect many segments into a watertight infrastructure. The presence of joints, however, presents a challenge to the ability of these structures to remain sealed when subjected to permanent ground settlements. This research project evaluates the leakage performance, deformations, and loads that develop across the joint of two segments of 150-mm-diameter DR-18 PVC pipes connected by a bell-and-spigot joint, when subject to permanent ground deformation. A Four-Point Bending apparatus was designed and used to determine the flexural rigidity (EI) of the PVC pipes, and two different apparatuses – the Split-box and the Joint Testing Frame – were used to produce controlled differential distortion of the pipe joint and barrels. One experiment, which simulated a buried PVC pipe subject to a normal ground fault (as a proxy for various kinds of permanent ground motion), was executed using the Split-box. While the pipe joint did not leak under internal water pressure of 1034 kPa, demands on the joint, the rotations and shear forces, were identified and quantified up to maxima of 0.95° and 14 kN respectively for maximum fault offset of 120 mm. A series of tests was then executed using the Joint Testing Frame, examining the joint in a commonly used PVC pipe product. The pipe samples were pressurized to internal water pressures of from 15 kPa to 400 kPa and then tested up to joint leakage or the deformation limits of the pipe or testing frame. Novel shear force versus rotation envelopes for leakage were developed for the pipe product. These envelopes reveal a range of water pressures and shear and rotation demands that induce joint leakage and permit the further understanding of why the buried pipe joint did not leak.</description>

   <description>In the near future, IoT ecosystems will enable billions of smart things to interconnect and communicate information about themselves and their physical environments. The high density of smart things in these environments allows for fine-grained data acquisition, enabling the development of advanced services and new kinds of applications ranging from wearable devices to air conditioners to fully automated cars. However, the dense and pervasive collection, processing and dissemination of data can unleash sensitive information about individuals, raising non-trivial security and privacy concerns. One solution for IoT security and privacy is to restrict access to sensitive data using access control and authorization techniques. Although many basic principles of standard access control models continue to apply, the high dynamic nature of IoT environments,  resources limitation of IoT devices and vulnerability to physical and virtual attacks present unique challenges that render existing access control schemes unfit for IoT. This research introduces a holistic and dynamic access control framework for IoT environments. The framework consists of three components: an automatic and context-aware policy specification method, continuous policy enforcement mechanism and an adaptive policy adjustment technique. In response to access requests, the automatic policy specification component dynamically generates access control rules that grant access permissions based on predefined primitive facts. The primitive facts describe the attributes of the IoT devices registered to the system and the operational contexts under which these devices can interact. The continuous policy enforcement mechanism constantly monitors the compliance of the operational context while resource is in use, and re-evaluates ongoing access sessions in response to changes in operational contexts and/or access policies. The adaptive policy adjustment component assesses the access behavior of the IoT devices, adjusts the access control policies based on device behavioral patterns and recommends policy adjustments to the policy administrator for final approval. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides higher adaptability to the dynamic security and privacy requirements of IoT deployments as well as better flexibility in access control policy management.</description>

   <title>Emotion regulation success and strategy choice during adolescence</title>
   <creator>DeFrance, Kalee</creator>

   <subject>Adolescence</subject>
   <subject>Emotion Regulation</subject>
   <description>Emotion regulation (ER) involves the ways individuals influence which emotions they have, when these emotions occur, and how they are experienced and expressed. During adolescence, youth transition from a child-like form of ER to one that is more likely to resemble the ER tendencies of an adult. This maturation is essential for many aspects of development, as strong ER skills are critical for mental health, relationship quality, and academic success, especially in the emotionally volatile developmental period of adolescence. However, several questions remain regarding how ER is implemented, and how it changes, during adolescence. Specifically, it remains unclear which situational (e.g., controllability) and psychological (e.g., intensity) factors influence youth to choose specific ER strategies or contribute to a youth’s success when regulating their emotions. Moreover, it is also unclear how ER success and strategy choice change during adolescence, and which factors are associated with these changes. The proposed dissertation used experience sampling (Study 1) and longitudinal methodologies (Study 2) to examine the associations between ER success and strategy choice, and several candidate factors in order to begin to illuminate which situational and psychological factors contribute to ER success and strategy choice during adolescence. Study 1 results showed that situational factors influenced strategy choice and the likelihood of experiencing success. Situational factors also influenced the association between some strategies (reappraisal, suppression, and engagement) and success, meaning that the effectiveness of these strategies may be contingent on the situation within which they are implemented. Study 2 results showed that most ER variables did not show group-level significant change over time. However, individual-level analyses revealed that slope values for change in regulatory success were associated with changes in parental support, perceived stress, and mindset. Moreover, individual level changes in ER success were strongly predictive of later depression and anxiety symptom levels. Discussions focus on the general themes of the dissertation, such as the importance of the micro- and macro-level environment when conceptualizing and assessing ER, individual differences that emerge during development of ER, and the ambiguity of what constitutes healthy regulation.</description>

   <description>Context. Software defect prediction aims to find defect prone source code, and thus reduce the effort, time and cost involved with ensuring the quality of software systems. Both code and non-code metrics are commonly used in this process to train machine learning algorithms to predict software defects. Studies have shown that such metrics-based approaches are failing to give satisfactory results, and have reached a performance ceiling. This thesis explores the idea of using code profiles as an alternative to traditional metrics to predict software defects. This code profile-based method proves to be more promising than traditional metrics-based approaches.&#xd;
Aims. This thesis aims to improve software defect prediction using code profiles as feature variables in place of traditional metrics. Software code profiles encode the density of language feature use and the context of such use in Rich Contextualized Language Use Vectors (RCLUVs) by analysing the parse tree of the source code. This thesis explores whether code profiles can be used to train machine learning algorithms, and compares the performance of the derived models to traditional metrics-based approaches.&#xd;
Methods. To achieve these aims the learning curves of several machine learning algorithms are analyzed, and the performance of the derived models are evaluated against traditional metrics-based approaches. Two benchmark bug datasets, the Eclipse bug dataset and the Github bug database, are used to train the models.&#xd;
Results. The learning curves of the models show machine learning algorithms can learn from RCLUV-based code profiles. Performance evaluation against existing metrics-based approaches reveals that the code profile-based approach is more promising than traditional metrics-based approaches. However, the predictive performance of both metrics and code profile-based approaches drops in cross-version predictions.&#xd;
Conclusions. Unlike traditional metrics-based approaches, this thesis uses vectors generated by analyzing language feature use from the parse trees of source code as feature variables to train machine learning algorithms. Experimental results using learning algorithms encourages us to use software code profiles as an alternative to traditional metrics to predict software defects.</description>

   <description>Over the course of a football season the athletes are subject to a large number of impacts ranging in magnitude. With these impacts failing to cause any clinical signs of concussion, they often get disregarded as non-injurious. Recent evidence shows that the cumulative effects of these impacts may cause microstructural damage within the brain. This study set out to examine the effects of these subconcussive impacts on two specific white matter tracts in the brain: the corpus callosum (CC) and the corticospinal tract (CST). 20 Canadian Univeristy level football players were followed for one season. These players were examined using diffusion tensor imaging at three time points: prior to any team sessions (preseason), following training camp (post-training camp), and following the last session of the season (post-season). Four DTI measures were analyzed: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), in order to asses white matter integrity. Players were separated into two groups based on impact exposure throughout the season. Results showed that the high exposure group had significantly lower FA (main effect of Group) in the CC and the bottom-left section of the CST. There was a significant decrease in FA over time in the top section of the left CST. There were no observed changes in MD, AD or RD. The changes found in this study indicate that despite no outward symptoms of injury (SRC), “silent” changes are occurring within the brain’s microstructures as a result of receiving numerous subconcussive impacts during a season of football.</description>

   <description>Germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancer are rare, with approximately 10% and 13% being hereditary in origin, respectively. In 2001, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC), in an effort to contain costs, defined criteria to determine an individual’s eligibility for BRCA genetic screening. Using real-world data from Kingston General Hospital (KGH) and Mt. Sinai Hospital (Toronto), we assessed if the long-standing program that has been in use in Ontario for nearly two decades provides real-world evidence for their effectiveness. From our studies we have produced the following recommendations to expand and/or improve the existing eligibility guidelines:&#xd;
1. Clinical geneticists and genetic counselors should adhere strictly to risk criteria guidelines as this appears to be an economical approach that should not reduce the effectiveness of screening;&#xd;
2. Add an additional criterion to include probands who do not themselves have ovarian cancer but who have first degree relatives with ovarian cancer, may be useful.&#xd;
3. Change the risk criteria #10 requirements to include an age cut-off that maximizes the capture rate of carriers while reducing noncarriers. Our data show this value to potentially be 60 years old;&#xd;
4. Risk assessment tools should be applied rigorously and consistently for all patients. Standardizing these practices ensure a normalized approach for all patients;&#xd;
5. Do not test individuals that fail to meet eligibility criteria nor risk assessment tool risk thresholds;&#xd;
6. Objectively describing what constitutes “clinical suspicion” RC#13 may help standardize how this risk criteria is assigned across institutions.&#xd;
7. Information collection and exchange of patient data within the context of BRCA1/2 screening should be standardized across all institutions in Ontario.</description>

   <title>Understanding sources of variation in advertisement call attributes in spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer)</title>

   <description>The mate recognition system is the foundation of biological speciation in frogs and toads. Sexual selection has been suggested to cause male call evolution, population divergence, and ultimately reproductive isolation. It is generally assumed that a significant fraction of variation in male call has an underlying genetic basis and that there is a link between call attributes and fitness. Yet these are largely unproved assertions in anurans, with many other factors contributing to diversity of calls within a male chorus. Anuran advertisement calls are important in studies of sexual selection, speciation, community acoustic partitioning, as well as phenological studies. In all of these, understanding heritability of calls is prerequisite to understanding evolutionary patterns and potential responses to selection. However, few studies have examined the heritability of advertisement calls in anurans. In general, we know that key aspects of anuran calls, including both temporal and spatial attributes, vary with body size, age, abiotic factors such as temperature and habitat type, and social context, including inter-male competition. In my thesis, I attempt to estimate the heritability of call attributes within a calling assemblage of a temperate treefrog, Pseudacris crucifer, and to quantify the relative contributions of different factors: body size, age, calling temperature and genetics. I used sonographic analysis to assess call variation, skeletochronology to estimate age, and a dataset comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate the relatedness of calling males. I used the animal model to evaluate those factors that may affect call variation. I found that body temperature to be the most important&#xd;
factor, influencing all six call attributes, and that body size predicted variation in some call attributes. I had insufficient power to derive robust estimates of heritability. By investigating the genetic basis as well as environmental components of variation in advertisement calls, I gained insights on within-population variation and how selection might impact the evolution of anuran calls.</description>

   <description>Electromagnetic interference produced by multirotor UAVs has the potential to compromise the integrity of&#xd;
UAV-borne total magnetic field (TMI) measurements collected with high-resolution optically pumped magnetometers. One&#xd;
method to overcome this challenge involves suspending the magnetometer sensor below the zone of electromagnetic&#xd;
interference via a semi-rigid mount. The semi-rigid mount allows the magnetometer payload to freely move in the pitch&#xd;
and roll axes, while rigidly fixing the yaw of the magnetometer to that of the multi-rotor UAV. The swinging motions of the&#xd;
magnetometer suspended below the UAV have the potential to introduce periodic variations in the collected magnetic field&#xd;
data. Within this study, spectral analysis was applied to UAVborne TMI measurements to assess contributions to the signal&#xd;
from the swinging, semi-rigidly mounted magnetometer payload. Overall, it was concluded that when the&#xd;
magnetometer was placed outside the zone of electromagnetic interference created by the UAV, compensation and filtering was not required to achieve industry standard measurements. This result was due to the magnetometer swinging through the relatively low-amplitude geomagnetic field gradient. However, when the magnetometer was placed within the zone of UAVinduced electromagnetic interference, a periodic, highfrequency signal was apparent in the TMI  measurements. This was determined to be caused by the swinging of the suspended magnetometer payload within the high-gradient electromagnetic field produced by the multi-rotor UAV. The periodic signal (~0.35 Hz) was successfully identified and removed with a low-pass filter in the frequency domain, resulting in TMI measurements of industry standard quality. Filtering is a necessary step to avoid contaminating the magnetic field signals originating from sub-surface targets with unwanted signals related to the swinging of the magnetometer. Filtering can be applied when the targeted signal frequencies and the swinging signal frequencies do not spectrally overlap. This relationship must be considered in order to avoid removing important target signals during the filtering process.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation, I explore the theory of political instrumentalism and its application to the justification of democracy. I suggest that because of the dominance of intrinsic accounts of the justification of democracy in contemporary democratic theory, political instrumentalism has been wrongly dismissed or neglected. The result is that serious investigation into the foundations of political instrumentalism has not been widely pursued. I argue that we can find a compelling basis for political instrumentalism in a moralized view of political power as a public trust. I thus argue for a distinctive version of political instrumentalism which I call ‘public trust instrumentalism’. Public trust instrumentalism supports a broadly sufficientarian approach to justifying the distribution of political power, and therefore has important implications for our thinking about the justification of democracy.</description>

   <description>In 2010, less than 48 hours after the first release of a new Health and Physical Education curriculum (HPE), Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty revoked the update, claiming the Liberal government, had ‘listened to the parents.’ In 2015, the Liberal government would eventually implement a revised HPE curriculum, much to the same social and cultural dissonance faced by the McGuinty government in 2010. Nine years later, and these curriculum concerns are still present. In August 2018, Conservative Premier Doug Ford, repealed the 2015 HPE curriculum, vowing to ‘put the rights of the parent first.’ Before the start of the 2019 school year, Ford’s second Minister of Education Stephen Lecce unveiled a ‘new’ HPE curriculum that largely mirrors the vilified 2015 document. During the history of Ontario’s curriculum controversy, Evangelical Christians have been frequently represented in mainstream media accounts of the conflict as a united opposition to comprehensive sexuality education. However, it is currently unknown whether the informal sexuality education that plays out across an Evangelical Christian’s life course is as categorically opposed to Ontario’s HPE curriculum as media representations suggest. This study explores how sexuality emerges in the ways Ontario Christians narrate their life stories.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this dissertation is to help fill a long-standing gap in the field of history of education with respect to studies on the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantium. In particular, this study examines a crucial episode in the thousand-year tension between the exothen (pagan/secular) and kath’imas (Christian/spiritual) educational traditions within Byzantium. Gregory Palamas, the Orthodox Christian saint and theologian, emerges from the mid-fourteenth century Hesychast Controversy with a clear principle for balancing the relationship of exothen and kath’imas education, which in theory, is ratified as the official position of the Orthodox Church in Byzantium thereafter.&#xd;
    &#xd;
There are four studies in this work representing the interplay of the three areas of academic specialization required for a comprehensive examination of this topic: historical, theological, and educational. Study 1 is an educational history of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and of Gregory Palamas and his detractors, which situates the historical and educational context of the entire topic. Study 2 examines the theoretical framework of a dual-epistemology that Palamas is employing when examining the purpose of education, the two types of Byzantine education—exothen and kath’imas, and the respective methodologies pertaining to their distinct areas of competency. Study 3 applies the principles of Palamas’s theoretical framework through examining the three aspects of Palamas’s educational philosophy. It also provides a description of the content of the exothen and kath’imas educational traditions of Byzantium. Study 4 provides the model for a hybrid curriculum theory based on two dominant schools of late twentieth century curricular thought in order to illustrate the parallel tensions in modern discussions with that of Palamas’s fourteenth century exothen and kath’imas traditions. The study highlights the perennial nature of the questions and tensions that surround education and curriculum theory.</description>

   <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) are often included as an endpoint in prospective studies. Clinicians use the study results to help individuals with cancer make informed decisions about treatment. Missing PRO data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and can undermine scientific credibility of PRO-specific conclusions. The thesis goal was to use quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify causes of missing PRO data. &#xd;
&#xd;
A systematic review of the literature identified 46 unique categories of factors reported to have an association with missing PRO data. These factors were organized into a framework having five main components: Instrument, Participant, Centre, Staff, and Study.&#xd;

Cox regression examined the association of 15 factors with time to the first missing instrument in data from three RCTs: MA17 (breast cancer), PR7 (prostate cancer), and LY12 (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). Most factors did not have significant independent association with outcome, but a few did, depending on the RCT. Centre presence of a post-graduate residency training program (MA17, PR7) and geographic location (PR7, LY12) had a stronger association. Participant age (PR7) and baseline level of well-being (LY12), and centre level of activity (LY12) had a weaker association. &#xd;
&#xd;
Interviews were conducted with 11 Clinical Research Associates (CRAs). Ten themes were identified in analysis based on descriptive phenomenology. The CRAs described their experience with different patterns of missing PRO data. PROs for routine clinical care compete with PROs for RCTs. Several important influences of missing PRO data were inherent to the instruments (quantity, repetition, wording of questions, and format), patients (characteristics, attributes of the cancer, and toxicity from the treatment), centres (deficiencies in research infrastructure), staff (developing relationships with patients), and RCTs (data capture in electronic versus paper format). Adapting the assessment schedule and providing sufficient time for the patient to complete the instrument were challenging for the CRAs, particularly at disease progression. There is a need for field guidance, and a motivation and knowledge base among CRAs to develop such guidance.&#xd;
&#xd;
This dissertation provides evidence to facilitate understanding of which factors influence missing PRO data, so that steps can be taken to improve the quality of PROs by minimizing missing data.</description>

   <description>In the mining industry, there is interest in the use of spatial processes to model spatially collected data. For the multivariate observations, we should model associations at a specific location and between locations, but also among variables. Common methods for multivariate modeling rely on the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LCM), which is limited in higher dimensions and generates models that do not properly reproduce the features of the original multivariate samples.&#xd;
In this thesis we present a simple methodology for multivariate geostatistical modeling of compositional data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). According to the methodology, grades are, first, transformed to log-ratios. Then, these log-ratios are linearly transformed to Principal Components (PCs). PCA tends to spatially decorrelate the factors, allowing for the independent simulation of each PCs, instead of requiring a co-simulation. Sequential Gaussian Simulation is performed independently on each Principal Component and the simulated factors are then back-transformed to simulated log-ratios, and these are finally back-transformed to grades. &#xd;
Using a 6-dimensional data set from a Nickel-Laterite deposit, we demonstrate the difference between the proposed methodology and classical co-simulation. The statistics and the further validation of the back-transformed grades after PCA and Sequential Gaussian Simulation showed that the proposed methodology tends to respect the relationships between the variables whereas co-simulation of the grades tends to respect the statistics but the reproduced relationships are not representative.</description>

   <description>Haptic simulation systems enable the perception of virtual environments through the sense of touch. These systems are composed of a haptic device through which an operator interacts with the virtual environment that is graphically and dynamically rendered in a computer. The stability of haptic simulation systems is compromised by the data acquisition sample and hold process that connects continuous and virtual worlds. Typically in these systems, the haptic device position is sampled and the velocity is estimated in discrete-time from the position samples in order to simulate the real environment dynamics and generate the environment force feedback. Velocity estimation in discrete-time domain limits the range of virtual environment dynamics that can be implemented in stable way. In order to increase the range, two velocity acquisition methods are investigated. First, sampling velocity directly from an analog gyro. Second, sampling analog  velocity approximation obtained from passing analog position through a high-pass  lter. Uncoupled stability and passivity criteria, considered as the most stringent stability conditions, are employed to analytically and experimentally evaluate the system stability and robustness of the proposed methods. Results indicate that the direct velocity measurement improves the stability, while the analog velocity approximation method offers a wide range of virtual environments that can be stably simulated.</description>

   <description>Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of chronic vulvar pain and cause of painful sexual intercourse in pre-menopausal women. Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction is thought to play a role in the development and/or maintenance of PVD, and physical therapy is considered the best treatment approach to target PFM dysfunction. &#xd;
The aims of this thesis work were (i) to use three-dimensional (3D) transperineal ultrasound imaging (TPUSI) to study PFM morphology and function in women with and without PVD in order to better understand how the PFMs may be involved in PVD and (ii) to understand the relevance of using 3D TPUSI in comparison with intra-vaginal palpation, for PFM assessment in women.&#xd;
	Three studies were conducted. The first study established that there is very good inter-examiner reliability when using 3D TPUSI for measuring levator hiatal dimensions at rest, during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the PFMs, and during maximal Valsalva maneuver (MVM), when trained examiners perform independent image acquisition and analyses. The second study compared levator hiatal dimensions at rest, on MVC, and on MVM, and transient changes in dimensions from rest to MVC and from rest to MVM, between women with and without PVD. Results revealed that women with PVD had smaller levator hiatus’ and less hiatal enlargement on MVM, in comparison to controls. Results also suggested that levator hiatal dimensions at rest may have an influence on the transient changes in dimensions on MVC and on MVM. The third study investigated the relationships among levator hiatal dimensions assessed using 3D TPUSI and PFM outcomes assessed using digital intra-vaginal palpation. Results revealed significant weak to moderate correlations between ultrasound and palpation outcomes, highlighting that 3D TPUSI and intra-vaginal palpation provide related but distinct information.&#xd;
This thesis provides new information on the utility of 3D TPUSI for PFM assessment in women and on the differences in PFM morphological and functional characteristics between women with and without PVD. Future work may extend these findings to study the effects of physical therapy in the treatment of PVD using 3D TPUSI to determine if improvements in symptoms are associated with post-treatment changes in PFM morphological and functional characteristics.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I use both structural- and reduced-form econometric models to analyze economic issues relating to the mortgage and labour markets. In chapter 2, I use a dynamic discrete choice model to quantify the impact of the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) in the United States during the Great Recession, on mortgage default rates, as well as its monetary benefit to the government. I find that HARP led to a 71.6\% reduction in the total number of defaults and has saved the government US\$ 800 million. Furthermore, I also use the structural model to evaluate HARP under a counterfactual scenario of prolonged depression of house prices instead of the V-shaped recovery of house values we observed after the crisis. In chapter 3, I use a differences-in-differences (DiD) approach to establish the causal link between securitization and screening standards in the U.S. mortgage market. The estimation strategy exploits the discrete set of policy changes in the conforming loan limits that set the maximum loan size (conforming loans) that government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) can purchase and securitize. I find that GSEs' purchase eligibility has increased the probability of loan origination by $\sim3\%$. Chapter 4, co-authored with Jason Adams and David Ros\'{e}, investigates the efficacy of the Ontario Works' (OW) active labour market programs (ALMPs) in helping welfare recipients find and retain employment using an instrumental variables (IV) approach. We find that structured job search activities and other skills-enhancing ALMPs reduce spells by between 1.6 and 3.1 months, whereas programs such as placement services increase spell lengths considerably, but lead to lower return rates to OW one and two years after the end of their welfare spells.</description>

   <description>Although many scholars have written about the relationships&#xd;
between land, mapping, power relations, and sovereignty, very few have&#xd;
explored the relationship between the imbricated fields of Aboriginal&#xd;
mapping, Indigenous aesthetics and placemaking, and the ways in&#xd;
which Aboriginal maps, both customary and contemporary, contribute&#xd;
to the conversation about remembering, Indigenous knowledge&#xd;
production, and cultural survivance.1 If maps construct rather than&#xd;
reproduce the world (Wood 2008: 92), how can the documentation&#xd;
and creation of an Indigenous mapping archive assist in bringing&#xd;
forward Indigenous worldviews, in particular those that emphasize the&#xd;
significant interrelationships between land, aesthetics, and Indigenous&#xd;
senses of place? To date no such archive exists. This doctoral project sets&#xd;
out to conceptualize and design a mobile Indigenous mapping archive&#xd;
that will carry within its walls an exhibition of Indigenous artists’ maps,&#xd;
a mapping library, two digital interfaces, Indigenous teachings, and&#xd;
ceremonial artifacts. The importance of this archive lies in its ability to&#xd;
assist settler and Indigenous communities to mutually grapple with how&#xd;
land matters to Indigenous Peoples in what is now known as Canada,&#xd;
and specifically with the gap between “what is known and what is&#xd;
merely seen” (Wood 2008: 92).</description>

   <description>A common practice in sport is to “play up” youth athletes with exceptional sport-specific skills against older players with similar skill sets. Playing up is believed to facilitate expertise by exposing athletes to high intensities of practice and competition (Malina, 2010). However, the effects of playing up on youth’s athletic and personal development have not been evaluated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate athletes’ experiences of playing up in soccer and their perceptions of how it may have influenced their sport-specific skill and psychosocial development. Seventeen athletes from four soccer clubs in Ontario, Canada, participated in semi-structured interviews in which they described their playing up experiences. Athletes discussed the decision for them to play up, their transition into a new team culture, and perceived changes in their development as athletes and as people. I performed an inductive thematic analysis of athletes’ interview transcripts to capture their playing up experiences (Braun et al., 2017). Athletes perceived playing up to involve a balance between challenge and progress that was facilitated by the social dynamics within their respective teams. Athletes struggled the most when coping with intensity, making mistakes, fighting for trust and respect, and fitting in. They also felt a sense of progress through being recognized, experiencing success, and pursuing professional aspirations. Overall, athletes desired playing up experiences that involved engaging in an inspiring learning environment, establishing quality relationships, and contributing to team learning. Future research is needed to evaluate playing up across contexts and explore ways to mobilize knowledge for sport practitioners.</description>

   <description>Traditional traffic monitoring relies on availability of unencrypted payload data inside of network packets, on which pattern match analysis is performed. With the growth in network traffic encryption, user behavioral monitoring has been severely hindered. Therefore, alternative methods are explored, such as machine learning for encrypted traffic classification which does not require decryption prior to analysis. In my study, I analyze encrypted Remote Desktop Protocol traffic from behavioral perspective on a network traffic dataset I generate. I develop a heterogeneous ensemble classification model that performs multi-label classification for five common RDP behaviors – Download, Browsing, Notepad, YouTube and Clipboard. The task is complicated as the data samples I generate may belong to one or more classes at the same time. I use Shapley Values to determine significant features and perform classification using the following techniques: SVM, KNN, Neural Network, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Random Forest and XGBoost. The final model achieves a cross-validated minimum Precision of 97% and a minimum Recall of 94% for each of the five behavioral classes. Finally, I discuss some of the risks to privacy associated with the Remote Desktop Protocol traffic.</description>

   <description>Radiation treatments have become increasingly complex, making quality assurance (QA) of radiation therapy deliveries of vital importance. In order to measure complex dose deliveries, it is crucial to have the proper dosimetric, readout, and analysis tools that can accurately report the delivered dose. While clinics generally perform a wide array of quality assurance testing on specific steps of the planning and delivery of the radiation, they seldom perform routine end-to-end testing of the entire treatment planning and delivery process. Such end-to-end tests are a valuable QA tool to help ensure that all individual components are working together to deliver the planned dose. Using an anthropomorphic phantom that incorporates several dosimeters (with fiducials for localization) for end-to-end QA can help to mimic a patient treatment and to study the overall geometric and dosimetric accuracy of an entire treatment process.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we look to perform comprehensive end-to-end quality assurance of radiation therapy treatments using point detectors, and two-dimensional (2D) and 3D dosimeters. Specifically, this work examines: (i) improving film dosimetry readout methods by testing the capabilities of our inhouse diffuse light field and camera film imaging system, as well as developing a new point source film scanner to eliminate stray light issues present in the diffuse light system, (ii) developing a streamlined gel dosimetry workflow and validating new gel dosimetry analysis software, (iii) using multiple dosimeters, coupled with commercial and in-house developed phantoms, to inform and verify clinical protocols and to commission new treatment&#xd;
techniques, (iv) characterizing and benchmarking various 3D printing materials (for applications in 3D printed patient bolus and custom phantom manufacturing), (v) and developing an anthropomorphic head phantom that accommodates multiple dosimeters, using it to test a complete clinical treatment process from beginning to end (exactly like an actual patient would be treated), and involving clinical staff at each step of the process.</description>

   <description>The study of career development pathways and support for the population of university employees who do not hold an academic appointment is lacking. Many departments across one eastern Ontario institution are coming to rely on non-academic professionals to help drive strategic objectives within their respective faculties. The goal of this study is to gain insight into the experiences of the career growth of this group in an effort to understand their career journeys. University environments have become more complex, there are higher expectations from stakeholder groups, and changes to funding models and international competition for the best students and faculty is continually on the rise. All of this change has resulted in increased performance pressure for not just the senior administration, but also for the professional staff who do not hold academic contracts but contribute in many areas to the institution’s success. An increase in postings for non-academic professional administrators to assume leadership roles in program management, strategic projects and many of the more functional areas of the university gives weight to the value that this particular population can bring to the environment. The challenge then becomes how can the institution best support the growth and development of this population, given that the human resource infrastructure currently in place in most higher education institutions has been structured around the support of academic faculty holding many of these leadership roles. Additionally, what changes are needed to meet the needs of this new generation of leaders?  Reflecting on my experiences in navigating my own career path is the catalyst for this research project, but with a specific goal of flushing out both the consistencies and differences between staff members across one university in Eastern Ontario in terms of their growth and development.</description>

   <description>Research into how nurses form their professional identity is crucial to the development of the nursing profession as well as to understanding the factors that contribute to transition to practice and retention of new nurses. The purpose of this research was to explore the stories nurses tell to describe experiences of professional identity formation and transition to practice. Narrative methodology was used to understand transition to practice for newly graduated nurses and their experience of professional identity formation. This dissertation begins with an autobiographical reflection of my own journey of becoming and being a nurse. The research study includes the stories of five nurses who shared their unique experiences of becoming and being nurses. Participants were interviewed twice, and data was analysed using a three-dimensional narrative inquiry space of time, sociality, and place. Each story was organized by plotlines of beginning, becoming, and being nurses. Resonating narrative threads emerged and are presented as understandings across the five narrative accounts. In addition to the interpretations of each individual’s story of beginning, becoming, and being a nurse, threads that resonated across the stories include entering into the world of nursing, the journey to become a nurse, learning alongside others, and embodying nursing. The findings of this inquiry offer a new context for understanding professional identity formation and transition to practice in a way that preserves, values, and respects the voices and stories of the nurses themselves, while offering insight for nursing education, practice, and research.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the impact of the 1973 oil shock, its sequel in 1979, and the counter-shock of the mid-1980s on Canada’s socio-economy. Over a decade of uncertainty, beginning when members of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries rapidly increased the price of oil in the autumn of 1973, challenged the federal government’s ability to understand novel socioeconomic conditions and implement remedial policies. Chapter one examines socioeconomic projections developed in the early 1970s and offers an explanation as to how years of tranquility in global energy markets framed projections and decision-making. Chapter two reviews publications by various branches of the federal government to reveal the difficulty of reconciling political, economic, energy, and environmental concerns against the backdrop of global political and economic volatility. Chapter three examines the National Energy Program of 1980 that was partly premised on the global price of oil continuing to increase and capturing this windfall to fund various federal programs, only for the price of oil to rapidly deteriorate shortly after the program’s implementation. This thesis uses these cases to reflect upon how uncertainty is generated and the role of socioeconomic beliefs in shaping decision-making within a complex environment.</description>

   <title>Coupling reactions and hydrogenations catalyzed by abundant transition metal complexes</title>

   <description>The field of homogeneous catalysis in the laboratory and on an industrial scale is dominated by transition metal catalysts. Most of these transformations require precious metal (PM) catalysts. However, due to their cost, toxicity, scarcity, and risk of depletion, research is underway to find chemistry that enables the replacement of PMs with abundant metal catalysts.&#xd;
	Palladium (0) compounds have long been established as the catalyst of choice for most cross-coupling reactions. Lagging considerably behind the development of palladium-based systems, certain nickel-based compounds (particularly nickel compounds in (II) and (0) oxidation states) can also catalyze these reactions, potentially offering a lower cost and access to radical pathways. In this regard, the first half of the thesis describes the cross-coupling reactions by nickel-based catalysts. The study involves the comparison of Ni(0), Ni(I) and Ni(II) complexes containing triphenylphosphine (PPh3) ligands for their abilities to effect the various cross-coupling reactions. The Ni(0) complex was found to be catalytically active for representative Suzuki-Miyaura and Heck-Mizoroki reactions, and demonstrated comparable yields with many palladium-based catalysts. However, the Ni(I) complex seemed to convert to catalytically active Ni(0) species under Suzuki−Miyaura reaction conditions and it was found to be ineffective for Heck−Mizoroki cross-coupling. During this investigation, the paramagnetic Ni(I) complexes NiX(PPh3)3 (X = Cl, Br, I) were characterized for the first time by 1H NMR spectroscopy. &#xd;
	The focus of the second half of the thesis is on the development of abundant-metal based homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of amides. Catalysts were formed in–situ from abundant-metal salts and phosphine ligands, and these were screened for the deoxygenative hydrogenation of amides.  It was found that Co(BF4)2·6H2O with triphos (1,1,1-tris-(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane) and Yb(OTf)3·H2O as co-catalyst were found to be efficient for the hydrogenation of various amides. &#xd;
	In the final chapter, 1st and 2nd row transition abundant-metal complexes, generated in-situ, were tested as catalysts for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. MoCl3 and MoCl5 in combination with tetraphos ligand resulted in hydrogenation of 2-phenoxyacetic acid in higher yields (> 95 %). Cobalt precursors Co(acac)2 and Co(OAc)2, in combination with dcpe ligand, and Co(BF4)2·6H2O with triphos ligand hydrogenated 3-phenylpropionic in greater yields.</description>

   <title>The Spectacular Environmentalism of Cecil the Lion</title>

   <description>In July 2015, Cecil the lion’s death sparked international furore over the practice of lion trophy hunting. Interest in the Cecil story was truly spectacular. The story cut across space and scale ensnaring actors from southern Africa, the United Kingdom, and North America, from rural African villagers and Western publics to an American celebrity and a billionaire philanthropist. This dissertation investigates the Cecil story - how it unfolded, and its implications for lion conservation – as a window through which to explore broader questions relevant to human-environment geography, particularly the fields of political ecology and animal geography. Broadly, it is concerned with how spectacular discourses of global environmental crises take shape, (mis)represent environmental problems, and (re)produce power in particular ways. This dissertation draws on reading across political ecology and animal geography. Through analysis of media, documents, events, and interviews using actor-network theory and discourse analysis, this dissertation traces the Cecil Moment, the Cecil Movement, and the dissonance between the two. It also connects insights from the Cecil story to conservation politics more broadly through comparative analysis. Ultimately, the research uncovers a shift in the politics of the Cecil story. It finds that the Cecil Moment operated to dismiss the anti-trophy hunting politics that sparked and fuelled it in the first place; yet, the momentum of the Cecil Moment was grasped and re-directed toward other lion conservation priorities. I argue that this re-direction was not neutral; rather, the Cecil Movement altered the politics of the Cecil Moment in a way that reproduced longstanding patterns of conservation injustice, wherein blame for biodiversity loss is directed away from powerful forces onto the racialized, rural poor from the Global South and wherein concern for individual animals is dismissed in favour of concern for species and populations. This research suggests that spectacular environmentalisms operate through more-than-human networks and mutable narratives that are not necessarily conducive to progressive transformation of environmental politics. Rather, they can entrench familiar patterns of conservation injustice, reproducing the power of already-empowered claims to authority, forms of knowledge, identities, and types of human-animal relationships.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I question the use of a majority voting rule (hereinafter 'majority rule') to control the constitutionality of legislation. This thesis mainly applies to jurisdictions that are generally considered 'well-functioning constitutional democracies,' such as Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and the US in the Americas; Japan, Mongolia, and Taiwan in Asia; and Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Portugal, Lithuania, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Sweden in Europe. Specifically, I contend two things. First, constitutional courts' use of majority rule to control legislation's constitutionality is justified. Second, there are definitive reasons to contend that constitutional courts should use supermajority voting rules (hereinafter 'supermajority rules') to control such constitutionality.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis is divided into eight chapters plus an appendix. In the first two chapters, I introduce this thesis and delineate its scope. In the third chapter, I present a brief history of voting rules in Western civilisation, from Ancient Greece to the Enlightenment. In the fourth chapter, I introduce the main features, properties, or characteristics of voting rules, with an emphasis on comparing majority rule with supermajority rules. In the fifth chapter, I analyse whether majority rule's properties provide conclusive reasons for using this voting rule to control statutes' constitutionality. (I conclude that they do not.) In the sixth chapter, I analyse whether the main constitutional adjudication theories provide conclusive reasons for using majority rule to control legislation's constitutionality. (I also conclude that they do not.) In the seventh chapter, I formulate a 'core case' for replacing majority rule with supermajority rules to control legislation's constitutionality. In the eight chapter, I address some practical issues related to the implementation of supermajority rules in constitutional adjudication. Finally, I formulate my general conclusion, along with presenting in the appendix information about the kinds of constitutional courts—and the kinds of societies—to which this thesis applies.</description>

   <description>Starch nanoparticles (SNP) are a new class of innovative biopolymers that can be obtained from native starch using different methods. Interest in bio-synthetic hybrid materials based on polysaccharides has been increasing in academia and industry in recent years. Previous studies have explored the modification of polysaccharides using different techniques to broaden their applications. Grafting from and grafting to with synthetic polymers, as well as etherification with small molecules were chosen in this work to modify the SNP. This work demonstrates the first successful nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) grafting of SNP using both, the grafting from and the grafting to approaches. To graft synthetic polymers from the surface of the SNP, three steps were followed: 1) functionalization of SNP with vinyl benzyl chloride (VBC); 2) reaction of SNP-VBC with BlocBuilder MA (BB) to form an SNP-macroinitiator (SNP-BB); and 3) graft copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) with styrene (S), acrylic acid (AA) and methyl acrylate (MA) with SNP-BB. To graft synthetic polymers to the surface of SNP, again three steps were followed: 1) similar to the grafting from, functionalization of SNP with VBC; 2) synthesis of SG1-capped copolymers (macroalkoxyamines) via NMP using BB: P(MMA-co-S), poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate-co-styrene), P(DMAEMA-co-S), and poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate-co-styrene), P(DEAEMA-co-S); and 3) reaction of the double bond of SNP-VBC with SG1-terminated macroalkoxyamines. 1H NMR, FTIR, TGA and elemental analysis were used to characterize the grafted SNP and confirm the success of the grafting from and grafting to reactions. The grafting of synthetic polymers such as P(MMA-co-S), PAA, PMA, P(DMAEMA-co-S) and P(DEAEMA-co-S) on hydrophilic SNP yields new bio-synthetic hybrid materials that could find use in paper coating latexes and other industrial applications. SNP were also modified with small molecules, such as octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) and styrene oxide (STO), to change their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance to make them Pickering stabilizers. Miniemulsion stability tests, emulsion polymerizations and miniemulsion polymerizations were conducted with SNP-STO for the first time. These new modified SNP showed the ability to partition at the oil-water interface, thereby providing stabilization to the system, which was not possible without the modification.</description>

   <title>A Historical Analysis on Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) and Abed's Reception of Paulo Freire's Critical Literacy in Designing BRAC's Functional Education Curriculum in Bangladesh From 1972 to 1981</title>

   <description>In this study, I examine the characteristics of the reception of Brazilian pedagogue Paulo Freire’s critical literacy by Building Resources Across Communities in Bangladesh (BRAC) from 1972 to 1981.The central questions of this study are: (1) how Dr. Fazle Hasan Abed, founding member of BRAC, read Freire within the context of his political intentionality and what he perceived were BRAC’s needs; and, (2) how Freire’s adult literacy theory was integrated in BRAC’s functional education curriculum design and practice. I argue that Abed was inspired by Paulo Freire’s pedagogical tenets in the planning and enactment of BRAC’s development initiatives to help the rural poor; however, Abed depoliticized and de-radicalized Freirean concepts when designing its functional education curriculum. Furthermore, his efforts at organizing the rural poor to generate income opportunities may have helped make the rural poor naïvely conscious. I also argue that although BRAC adapted Freire in its adult literacy curriculum, the program did not aim at the conscientization of its learners to challenge the oppressive social structure. Abed considered education as a tool of development within the frame of capitalism, not as an instrument for radical social transformation as Freire did. The political and social implications of specific processes of reception are illustrated through this comprehensive study on why and how Freire’s pedagogical principles were adopted and adapted by BRAC to develop their functional literacy curriculum. Development educators as well as popular educators, social reformers and social business entrepreneurs may gain a new perspective on the reception of Freirean pedagogical ideas.</description>

   <title>Not a Joke: Women's work and feminist laughter in stand-up comedy</title>

   <description>Live feminist stand-up comedy, and the shared laughter it generates, is a potent form of popular cultural performance that has become increasingly politically relevant and commercially successful in contemporary North America. In this thesis, I take an interdisciplinary, mixed-method approach to studying the cultural and political work done by Ontario-based, women-identified stand-up comics and comedy producers. I engage with and extend the emerging field of critical comedy studies by drawing on a range of disciplines to analyze the affective politics of live feminist stand-up comedy. My position is informed by, and my writing integrates, the voices of contemporary and historical women-identified stand-up comics whom I have encountered through a variety of cultural texts, including: live and mediated performances, memoirs, interviews, histories, and anthologies. I interview a range of Ontario-based women-identified comics and critically reflect on performances I attended, recorded, and/or helped to produce. I focus in particular on explicitly feminist comedy events both produced and populated by women. These include: Yas Kween and SHADE, and those produced by the Hysterics Collective. &#xd;
I argue that in writing and performing live comedy, comics claim positions of epistemic authority and affective and discursive power. They position themselves as experts on their own lives and subject positions, and they claim to know what will (and how to) make an audience laugh. On stage, in these spaces of authority, comics maintain discursive control over how they present themselves and their experiences. This is a powerful position that counters processes of cultural and political abjection. In generating laughter, comics affect (and are affected by) their audiences. I theorize this circulation of affect as politically powerful and personally meaningful. I reject the notion that a joke could be objectively funny or a comic universally appealing, and instead problematize social constructions of women as unfunny. Through autoethnography and reception studies, I argue that “getting” the joke and finding it funny (or not) depends on our interpretive repertoires. Additionally, I show that generating laughter takes work—work that is at once alienating and affirming, and almost always precarious.</description>

   <description>This thesis studies sheaves of phi-principal parts, a modification of the well-known sequence of sheaves of principal parts. In Chapter 1, we construct the sheaves of phi-principal-parts, and undertake their general study. Then, in Chapter 2, we apply these sheaves to the problem of counting how many Weierstrass points (counted according to their Weierstrass weight) are absorbed into a singularity in a curve degeneration, and, in Chapter 3, we apply these sheaves to the problem of counting lines in a linear system in a Grassmannian.</description>

   <description>Ontario parks were born out of an oligarchic political structure in the 19th century that employed an enclosure-reserve practice to take control of wilderness lands for the preservation of lucrative timber resources, and bring those lands into a liberal order that functioned to help facilitate industrialization and build a home market. Economic resource interests were not the only motivations for park creation, as anxieties about climate and Indigenous land-use also motivated enclosure and land management. Bureaucrats had remarkable power to convince governments to create parks and reshape the land to meet British and Western European ideals, borrowing political practices (enclosure) and environmental ideas (e.g. regarding climate) from British colonial and European experiences. A form of climate control was employed to manipulate and re-construct parks and exclude certain people(s). This political-environmental interplay reveals Ontario parks as a form of early ‘Indian policy,’ as park creation relied on ethnocentric ideas about Indigenous land-use and ultimately led to the result that enfranchisement and civilization policies were designed to achieve: Indigenous land dispossession. Settler authorities’ ethnocentric disregard for Indigenous peoples and their relationship to the land created the conditions to construct parks as a settler colonial environmental institution designed to serve a liberal order and environmental ethnocentrism.</description>

   <description>Les recueils de poésie publiés par René Lapierre de 1990 à 2008 participent d’un questionnement de la forme poétique, laquelle, en plus d’interroger la posture énonciative mise en scène par le texte, propose comme moteur dominant la juxtaposition et la multiplication des instances narratives et se construit en grande partie de fragments narratifs le plus souvent indépendants les uns des autres. Cette mise en présence des formes et de discours hétérogènes est elle-même productrice de sens. Les théories du philosophe slovène Slavoj Žižek, telles qu’elles sont formulées dans son ouvrage The Sublime Object of Ideology (1989), et notamment en ce qui a trait à l’idéologie, permettent d’éclairer certains des enjeux cachés de la représentation. La présente analyse se construit autour de trois notions centrales, empruntées par Žižek au théoricien français de la psychanalyse, Jacques Lacan, qui permettent d’explorer la façon dont le discours et son organisation sont constitutifs d’un horizon de sens unique à Lapierre. Dans un premier temps, la notion du Réel lacanien permettra de souligner la façon dont le discours poétique se bute toujours, dans les recueils étudiés, à un indicible autour duquel le texte se construit, un noyau déjà-toujours présent par rapport à la posture énonciative et impossible à approcher autrement que comme un vide au sein du discours. Dans un deuxième temps, la notion de la Chose (das Ding), issue des théories freudiennes, sera proposée comme moteur du sens et comme principe d’organisation du texte. La Chose, en effet, est identifiée comme étant centrale à la production du sens et à la représentation : elle participe à l’échelle du texte et du recueil à l’articulation des structures de sens qui, chez Lapierre, passent par une élimination de tout surplus. À la fin de ce parcours, par le biais de la notion de Sublime, l’analyse démontrera que la poésie de Lapierre cherche à dire sa propre limite, à mettre en scène un échec de la représentation.</description>

   <description>Testimonial literature bears witness to collective experiences of injustice and human rights violations, and it emphasizes the relationship between context and collective suffering.  The trauma memoir, in contrast, focuses on an individual experience of suffering and unfolds in a linear progression towards rescue, redemption, and recovery.  This study brings to the fore the generic hybridity of Ishmael Beah’s life narrative, A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier (2007), as both trauma memoir and testimonial witness narrative, and, consequently, it addresses aspects of the text that are overlooked and understudied.  Taking up A Long Way Gone for its status as the exemplar of child soldier life narratives, this study highlights the narrative’s specificities in relation to this emergent body of literature.  &#xd;
Current scholarship on child soldier narratives focuses almost exclusively on fiction; if consideration is given to life narratives, they tend to serve a secondary comparative function or are used as contextual evidence.  Responding to this gap in literary studies, this study offers a sustained analysis of the rhetorical strategies and representational practices employed in Beah’s life narrative, examining how it mobilizes, on the one hand, humanitarian readings in appeals to sympathy and empathy, and, on the other hand, narrative acts of witnessing and ethical appeals that reveal the limits of affective responses. &#xd;
This study is structured in two parts.  Part One establishes pertinent historical, cultural, and socio-political background and introduces the methodological framework.  Chapter One provides an historical and contemporary overview of child soldiery, including literary and cultural representations.  The second chapter explains the theoretical approach applied in this study, which hybridizes theories of the trauma memoir and testimonial literature.  Part Two is comprised of four chapters of in-depth analysis of A Long Way Gone.  Chapter Three locates the text within the context of civil conflict in Sierra Leone and considers how dominant representations and discourses of African child soldiers inform its marketing and reception in the West.  Chapters Four through Six offer a detailed textual analysis of Beah’s narrative of his pre-conflict childhood, experiences of child soldiery, and the post-conflict challenges of demobilization, rehabilitation, and reintegration.</description>

   <description>Next-generation intelligent transportation systems of future road traffic monitoring will be required to provide reports of road conditions. Monitoring road surface conditions benefits drivers and the community. Road surface anomalies contribute to increased risk of traffic accidents, reduced driver comfort and increased wear of vehicles. Municipalities usually inspect the road surface quality through manual eye inspection that is inefficient, exhausting and consumes resources.  &#xd;
    Motivated by the growing demand for efficient road information services for connected and automated vehicles, this thesis proposes a comprehensive framework for monitoring road surface conditions.  An intelligent and robust road surface monitoring system integrating vehicular and smart devices’ inertial sensors and GNSS receivers within and amongst vehicles is designed and developed in this research. &#xd;
    To ensure rich data collections, land vehicles of different types are used in the road tests. A wavelet packet analysis was applied to the sensor measurements to separate the road anomalies’ signatures from both the vehicle motion dynamics and the sensor noise. Various feature extraction techniques were used to identify several types of road anomalies. The constructed features were utilized in building datasets of these road anomalies. The datasets were leveraged to build and assess the performance of a support vector machine classifier to detect and categorize multiple road anomalies of different severity levels. &#xd;
   &#xd;
    In order to overcome the GNSS receivers' challenges in geo-referencing the monitored anomalies,. In this framework, the vehicles’ onboard motion sensors are integrated with GNSS receivers to provide accurate, continuous, and adaptive resolution geo-referencing to the monitored anomalies. The road anomaly information is then utilized to provide assessment for the average quality of the road segments using a fuzzy inference system. The developed road segment quality database was then used by another fuzzy classifier that can be utilized in route planning to evaluate all possible routes and suggest the one of highest road quality. &#xd;
    The future deployment of the system developed in this research will contribute to reducing congestion and accidents along the roads, enabling road labelling based on accessibility and conditions, providing personalized alerts and route recommendations, and improving road safety for all drivers.</description>

   <description>The primary driver for technological advancement in design methods is increasing part performance and reducing manufacturing cost. Design optimization tools such as topology optimization, provide a mathematical approach to generate efficient and lightweight designs; however, integration of design tools into industry has been hindered most notably by manufacturability. Innovative processes such as additive manufacturing (AM), have significantly more design freedom than traditional manufacturing methods providing a means to develop the complex designs produced by topology optimization. The layer-wise nature of AM leads to new design challenges such as the need for support structures that are influenced by part topology and build orientation. Reducing support structures will limit manufacturing time and cost, allowing industry to further utilize the benefits of topology optimization.&#xd;
Previous works addressing approaches to limit supported surface area and support material often rely on the finite element discretization scheme, leading to a gap between solving academic and practical problems. Focusing on a practical design tool, this study presents an approach to simultaneously optimize part topology and build orientation with AM considerations. Utilizing the spatial density gradient in the topology optimization formulation, dependence on the finite element discretization scheme is mitigated. Both 2D and 3D academic test problems as well as an aerospace industry example, demonstrate the proposed methodology is capable of generating high quality designs. Depending on build orientation initialization and the test problem, support material reduction was on the order of 80%, with a tradeoff of less than 5% in structural performance.</description>

   <description>The goal of this research is to investigate two trenchless rehabilitation techniques, with the objective of developing a better understanding of potential failure mechanisms. The first experimental study involved the testing of two spray-on polymer liner materials (epoxy and polyurethane) that are applied to a concrete substrate to prevent leakage. The concrete specimens had circular plastic sheets attached to simulate areas of de-bonding before being sprayed with the liner. External water pressure was applied to the underside of the polymer liners to investigate the effect that the areas of ‘de-bond’ had on the failure pressure needed to induce tensile fracture of the polymer or peeling failure between the liner and substrate. The epoxy liner failed in tensile fracture while the polyurethane liner underwent peeling failure. Regardless of the failure mode, increasing the de-bonded area resulted in a lower failure pressure. It was also found that the tensile fracture strength can be conservatively estimated using flat plate theory. Additionally, it is suggested that peeling force can be related to adhesion strength, but only for similar liner-substrate systems.  &#xd;
The second experimental study investigated the response of a slip-liner to increasing fluid pressure, as would be experienced in a grouted slip-liner procedure. An experimental apparatus that enabled fluid pressure to be applied to the liner was developed and used to complete two tests on a PVC liner. The liner was tested in a vertical orientation to investigate the liner’s response to axi-symmetric fluid pressure while a horizontal test investigated the response to buoyancy loading coupled with fluid pressure. Each test was run until the critical buckling pressure was reached, marked by the formation of a buckling lobe. Bending moments were positive at the springlines and negative at the crown and invert as expected, and increases in thrusts at each 25 kPa load step showed good agreement with theory. Hydrostatic buckling pressures of the PVC liner were within -7% of the theoretical buckling models (using mean thickness), while peak critical liner buckling pressures were overestimated by +16% to +25%, implying that further work is required to extend the design theory to cover more geometries.</description>

   <description>An evaluation procedure for newly discovered deposits at brownfield underground mines has been developed and was tested with a case study. A review of current underground mining methods, rock mass classification systems, mining method selection tools and production rates was undertaken to determine the current state of knowledge. An evaluation procedure was then developed to guide on site engineers in selecting feasible underground mining method(s) and identifying a preferred method(s) based on economic analysis.&#xd;
The procedure was calibrated with information from the literature review and then tested with a case study of the Bonanza Ledge deposit, recently mined by Barkerville Gold Mines, an exploration and mining company based in Wells, British Columbia. The procedure was then applied to the BC Vein deposit, currently under development by Barkerville Gold Mines. Application of the procedure to the BC Vein deposit allowed estimation of productivity rates and cashflows for technically feasible mining methods.&#xd;
Based on analysis of productivity rates and cashflows, a recommended mining method was identified. This case application has demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed procedure for evaluation of brownfield projects.</description>

   <description>To reach to visual targets, we need to transform the visual representation into the coordinate system of the moving arm, i.e. coordinate transformations. Varying body postures such as lying or rolling the head leads to higher movement variability.  However, it is unknown how uncertainty in body posture estimations propagates to reaching movements. It has been speculated that higher movement variability is a by-product of noisy coordinate transformations stemming from the uncertainty in estimating the body posture.  In the first study, we investigated how uncertainty of body posture estimations effects action by our novel head roll and neck load paradigm. We showed that both rolling the head and loading the neck resulted in biased and more variable movements. Using our 3D computational model, we showed that higher movement variabilities resulted from uncertainties in coordinate transformations caused by head roll and neck load. In the second study, we asked whether the brain accounts for the increased movement variability caused by varying body postures. We showed that, rolling the head results in adapted movements, such as increased safety margins while passing an obstacle. In the third study we asked how humans incorporate information about surrounding visual objects, i.e. allocentric information, when reaching to a memorized object location.  &#xd;
We showed that the brain uses clustering mechanisms to efficiently memorize scene configurations, i.e. code allocentric information. By including the clustered allocentric information in reaching, our model predicts shifted reaching end points in the direction of shifted objects, comparable to human data. Lastly, we investigated the role of coordinate transformations in performing multisensory integrations at the neuronal level. We showed that a neural network trained to perform multisensory integrations replicates the neuronal activation associated with multisensory integrations. Our model behave comparable to a divisive normalization model but in a neurophysiologically feasible manner.  Together these studies suggest that coordinate transformations must be considered as noisy processes which have tangible effect on reaching movements. Since coordinate transformations are ubiquitous, this work represents a significant advance in our understanding of how the brain performs one of its most fundamental functions.</description>

   <description>In the first two decades of decolonization in India, the slogan ‘Hum Do Hamare Do’ (we two, our two) and its associated symbol ‘red triangle’ became synonymous with the nuclear family. This project traces the creation and circulation of this campaign in the postcolonial era of 1954-77. People remembered the first decades of modernity through this mythical small and happy family. &#xd;
India was one of the first Asian countries to embark on a national population control programme in 1951. It embarked on non-aligned economic development with a firm belief in Malthusianism — the belief that unchecked population growth will outstrip the growth of resources leading to scarcity of and overcrowding. I argue that the resulting attempts at population control conjured up a family that existed only in the bureaucrat’s policy document, and ‘trickled-down’ to the masses. The notional small family ultimately extended beyond the bureaucrat’s policy papers. Through propaganda campaigns, counselling centers, demographic studies and urban architecture, this bureaucratic ideal of the small family was transmitted through to the masses. The counselling centers and the advocacy campaigns of the period not only focused on the medical aspects of human fertility, but also linked the very question of fertility to the socio-economic development of the recently decolonized nation. &#xd;
Common people responded to Malthusianism through attempts to reduce family size, but their choices were not commensurable with the state’s desires. While people were accepting the symbol and its meaning slowly, the state encouraged contraception and eventually sterilizations, through the offer of monetary incentives or by coercive means. The statist push towards contraceptives must be understood as a response to the transnational context of the population programme, set within the power bloc politics of the Cold War. As family planning emerged as the central feature of governmental efforts to modernize the country, people were confronted with contradictory meanings of modernity. This project will trace the history of population control as it unfolded between the state’s five year plans and the people’s own desire for smaller families, through a focus on the  inverted red triangle and its popularity during this era.</description>

   <description>Few evidence-informed coach development programs are available for coaches of athletes with a disability (CAWAD; Cheon et al., 2015). Additionally, there is a general need to use behaviour change theories in designing and evaluating these programs (Allan, Vierimaa, et al., 2018). The Transformational Coaching Workshop (TCW) is one program designed through behaviour change theories that is effective in changing coaches’ leadership behaviours (Lawrason et al., 2019). However, the TCW has not been evaluated in the Para sport context. Thus, the study’s purpose was to assess the impact and delivery of the TCW for CAWAD. &#xd;
&#xd;
Two workshops were delivered to CAWAD and 17 coaches participated in this study. Sixteen participants completed the capability-opportunity-motivation-behaviour (COM-B; Michie et al. 2011) questionnaire which assessed coaches’ perceptions of demonstrating transformational coaching behaviours and facilitating athletes’ quality experiences. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate workshop delivery. Six Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess the differences in coaches’ COM-B measures from pre- to post-workshop. A thematic analysis was conducted to explore coaches’ feedback on the workshop delivery.&#xd;
&#xd;
Generally, the workshops were positively received from coaches and were delivered as intended. Findings showed significantly higher differences in coaches’ perceived capability and opportunity to demonstrate transformational coaching behaviours, and coaches’ perceived capability to facilitate athletes’ quality experiences after attending the TCW. However, there were no significant differences in coaches’ perceived motivation to demonstrate transformational coaching behaviours, and coaches’ perceived opportunity and motivation to facilitate athletes’ quality experiences between pre- and post-workshop. Two themes developed from the coach feedback regarding (1) the workshop’s strengths, limitations, and areas to improve, and (2) the strengths and barrier of transformational coaching. The TCW’s strengths were that it was highly engaging, unique from other programs, and worth disseminating to others. However, the workshop was limited by coaches that were already transformational and could potentially benefit from further improving content and activities. The strengths of transformational coaching were that the behaviours matched coaches’ values and are easy to implement but can be limited by the barrier of time. Taken together, these study findings suggest the TCW could offer an evidence-informed program for CAWAD.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates high power density power converters from two approaches: electrical circuit and module design, and thermal management and mitigation. Three specific topics are studied in this thesis: Point-of-Load (POL) power module packaging, thermomechanical structures for high power density power converters, and single-stage resonant converters with Power Factor Correction (PFC) for the Electric Vehicle (EV) On-Board Charging (OBC) application.&#xd;
A new POL power module packaging structure called Power-System-in-Inductor (PSI2) is analyzed against traditional plastic packaging. PSI2 promises lower loss and higher package thermal conductivity by replacing a traditional plastic casing with the magnetic inductor core. Thermal analysis and FEA thermal simulation are conducted to verify the new packaging technology. Identical buck power modules are developed and tested experimentally. Simulation and experimentation show the PSI2 package achieves 2.68% greater efficiency, 0.51W less loss, and 26˚C lower top temperature compared to the traditionally plastic packaged module. Thermal conductivity of the PSI2 package accounts for about 33% of the improved thermal performance.&#xd;
A new thermomechanical structure is proposed named Integrated Multi-Layer Cooling (IMLC). The IMLC structure uses multiple-PCB layers, integrated active liquid cooling, and component sorting to achieve increased power density while maintaining thermal performance compared to a traditional single-PCB liquid cooled structure. FEA thermal simulation and experimentation with an EV Low-Voltage DC converter (LDC) show the IMLC structure achieves a 46°C peak temperature rise decrease and 0.6% improved efficiency over air cooled designs. Additionally, power density is improved by 31% compared to a single-PCB liquid cooled design.&#xd;
A single-stage LLC converter with PFC is designed for use in the EV OBC application. This topology promises improved power density, lower loss, and less complexity compared to traditional two-stage PFC designs by removing one switching converter stage. The circuit schematic and PCB layout are designed to achieve maximum power density and minimum loss. Simulation and experimental verification are conducted to verify the electrical performance and high-power density of 2.3kW/L of this topology. A high-power density, 1.65kW single-stage LLC OBC experimental prototype is designed which achieves 99.1% power factor and 96.9% efficiency at 1.47kW operation.</description>

   <description>Many forms of chronic pelvic pain have no specific etiology or curative treatment. Catastrophizing, behavioural coping strategies, and depressive symptoms have all been noted in the chronic pain literature for their negative impact on multiple patient outcomes. The primary aim of this dissertation was to examine the predictive or mediating effect of catastrophizing, behavioural coping strategies, and depressive symptoms on pain among women with chronic pelvic pain.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Study 1, women with Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (a chronic pelvic pain condition) completed questionnaires at three time points spanning 12 months. The directionality of the catastrophizing-pain relationship was tested using a cross-lagged panel analysis. Results suggest that changes in catastrophizing precede changes in pain but not vice versa.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Study 2, which used the same sample as Study 1, mediators and moderators of the catastrophizing-pain relationship were examined using a moderated multiple mediation model. Catastrophizing was found to directly affect pain. However, this direct catastrophizing-pain relationship was significant only for women with a clinically significant level of depressive symptoms. Additionally, catastrophizing indirectly affected pain through illness-focused coping strategies. Women with a greater tendency to catastrophize were more likely to engage in illness-focused coping and women who used more illness-focused coping strategies were more likely to experience greater levels of pain severity.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Study 3, which involved recruiting women with any diagnosed chronic pelvic pain condition, an experimental manipulation of induced negative mood (a proxy for depressive symptoms) was used to examine the effect of negative mood on pain tolerance for acute pain. No significant differences were found between participants who experienced induced negative mood and participants who experienced a neutral mood with regard to acute pain tolerance.&#xd;
&#xd;
The clinical implications of these findings for the management of chronic pelvic pain are discussed, particularly with regard to the identification and targeting of catastrophizing, illness-focused coping strategies, and depressive symptoms.</description>

   <description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most challenging malignancies to treat clinically. The current standard of care for a possible cure requires surgery; however, only a small subset of patients is eligible for potentially curable surgery, and chemotherapy or radiation therapy are typically used in a palliative fashion. Although modest improvements are observed for a short period of time, treatment failure inevitably results. This lack of success has been attributed to the highly mutagenic and adaptive nature of pancreatic cancer. As a possible solution to this, we hypothesize that supplementing conventional chemotherapeutics with agents that broadly target multiple pathways implicated in multistage tumorigenesis may lead to improvements in treatment outcomes. &#xd;
&#xd;
We propose to investigate the efficacy of a triple combination of metformin (Met), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and oseltamivir phosphate (OP) together with gemcitabine and paclitaxel to treat pancreatic cancer. Owing to the broad applicability of this combination, we also investigated its translatability to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is characterized by its poor prognosis, early relapse, and a shorter progression-free survival period following recurrence. The development of chemoresistance is another common clinical challenge with breast cancer in that conventional treatments could select for resistant subpopulation leading to a more aggressive malignancy challenging to treat. &#xd;
&#xd;
Engineering of a “smart” drug delivery system to specifically target tumour cells has been at the forefront of cancer research. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a functionalized folic acid-conjugated amphiphilic alternating copolymer (FA-DABA-SMA) to target three-dimensional avascular human pancreatic and breast tumour spheroids in culture and deliver hydrophobic agents. The findings of this research provide supporting evidence for the efficacy and translatability of this combination treatment approach in offering improved survival outcomes in patients with pancreatic and breast cancer.</description>

   <description>Numerous studies have reported that, compared to an equivalent period of wakefulness, post-training sleep (overnight or daytime naps) benefits memory consolidation (Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010; Mednick, Nakayama, &amp; Stickgold, 2003; Plihal &amp; Born, 1999; Walker et al., 2003). However, most investigations have employed various forms of “active wakefulness” (e.g., sensorimotor and cognitive tasks) as a comparison condition for sleep, while few studies have examined the role of “quiet wakefulness” in memory consolidation, even though some of the EEG oscillations during quiet waking resemble those present in sleep (e.g., increased activity in the theta-alpha range) (Brokaw et al., 2016).&#xd;
This study aimed to examine the consolidation of declarative (word-pair associates) and non-declarative (marble maze visuo-motor task) learning over a 60-minutes time interval (with continuous EEG monitoring) filled with either (A) napping; (B) active-waking (watching a video); or (C) quiet-waking (self-guided meditation).&#xd;
The results of the current study suggested that memory consolidation may not be a sleep-specific- phenomenon. In fact, quiet wakefulness appeared to be more advantageous than a short nap for the consolidation of declarative memories. This study also found that SWS exerts significant effects on the retention of non-declarative memory. For nappers, the absence of SWS resulted in noticeable performance enhancements compared to participants who entered SWS. Thus, it is possible that SWS plays a disadvantageous role in the consolidation of procedural memory. It is thought that sleep inertia caused by SWS is partly responsible for the impairments in tasks procedural memory.&#xd;
The findings of current study contribute to the  understanding of memory consolidation and provide insights about the role of waking states for future studies.</description>

   <description>The development of an angiogenic drug delivery system requires in vitro and in vivo testing before the system can used to treat a disease or condition. The zebrafish embryo is a promising animal model for screening potential angiogenic drug delivery systems due to their optical transparency, which allows for the live imaging of tissues and biological responses. Following establishment of injection protocols, the trunk and yolk sac of 2 - 3 day post-fertilization (dpf) embryos were investigated as potential implant sites for evaluating angiogenic responses due to the highly ordered and easily visualized vasculature at these locations. Bolus injections of vascular endothelial growth factor A(VEGF-A) was carried out into the yolk sac of Tg[fli1a:DsRED] zebrafish embryos and the survival rate and angiogenic response in the neighboring gut vasculature was evaluated, and microparticle retention rates within the trunk and yolk sac were analyzed. Embryos that received the VEGF-A bolus injections had a survival rate of 100%, and the survival rate of embryos that received a vehicle only injection was also 100%.&#xd;
No angiogenic response was detected in the surrounding vasculature. The microparticle retention rate of 25 μm PE microparticles injected into the yolk sac was poor, where only 7% of injected microparticles were retained in the yolk sac after 2 days. The trunk injection model was evaluated for microparticle retention rates using 10 μm polystyrene microparticles and 3 dpf Tg[fli1a:DsRED] embryos. At 2 days post-injection (dpi), 56% of the injected microparticles remained within the injection sites. A simple VEGF-A delivery system was made by adsorbing the protein to the surface of 15 μm PLGA microparticles. In vitro release studies showed that this system released 0.042 μg VEGF-A/mg microparticle/hr and that 100% of the loaded protein was released after 48 hours. The VEGF-A-loaded microparticles were injected into the trunk of 3 dpf (Tg[fli1a:DsRED]) embryos. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the intersegmental vessels in proximity to the injection site showed no change in the vasculature between the VEGF-A injection groups and the two control groups injected with either 15 μm PLGA particles and a solution of PBS.</description>

   <description>Climate change is influencing the biogeochemical dynamics of lake systems in northern Canada. These changes may affect the loading and cycling of naturally occurring metal(loid)s and the long-term stability of mining-derived contaminants in sub-Arctic lakes. Arsenic (As) concentrations of lakes in the Courageous Lake Greenstone Belt (CLGB), Northwest Territories, Canada, are elevated from the weathering of mineralized bedrock and/or the operation of historical gold mines (Tundra and Salmita mines). In this region, the cumulative effects of resource extraction and modern climate warming make it difficult to discern between anthropogenic impacts and baseline geochemistry. This study integrates As geochemistry, organic petrography, paleoclimate proxies (particle size, organic matter (OM) type and quantity), and radiometric dating (14C and 210Pb) to determine the influence of past and present climate warming on the long-term stability of As in lakes surrounding Tundra Mine. The findings of this study demonstrate baseline As concentrations in lake sediments ranging from 28 to 170 mg·kg−1 (median: 40 mg·kg−1; n = 102) and provide evidence that weathering of mineralized bedrock and terrigenous material provides an ongoing source of naturally derived As to some lakes of the CLGB. An increased accumulation of OM in the near-surface sediment, as a result of climate warming, influences redox dynamics and results in As release from minerals to pore waters via reductive dissolution of As-bearing minerals (i.e. scorodite and Fe-(oxy)hydroxides). Under these changing redox conditions, solid phase OM mediates the diffusion of dissolved As to overlying surface waters by providing a substrate for As sequestration and facilitating the precipitation of authigenic As-bearing minerals (i.e. framboidal pyrite, As-sulphides, Fe-(oxy)hydroxides). However, the effect of these changes will differ between lakes as the long-term stability of As is influenced by the source and primary hosts of As in lake sediments. Knowledge from this study will help predict future climate-driven changes to metal(loid) cycling in sub-Arctic lakes and improve environmental monitoring and remediation strategies at northern metal mines.&#xd;

The possibilities and benefits of weaving traditional knowledge with our research and teaching of geological sciences and engineering are also explored in this thesis, based on hands-on experience gained through this study.</description>

   <description>The pattern of genetic variation across a species range may give insight into geographic variation in adaptive capacity and hence, conservation priority. For this reason, determining the factors that may influence range-wide genetic structure is vital, but remains relatively understudied. Demography has long been viewed as the dominant factor influencing species’ genetic structure, but non-demographic processes must be considered as well. In this study, we investigated the effects of peripherality, hybridization and mating system on the range wide genetic structure of Abronia umbellata, a pink-flowered Pacific coastal dune endemic and that ranges from San Quintin, Baja California to Coos Bay, Oregon and occurs as disjunct populations in Washington and on Vancouver Island in Canada. The species exhibits striking mating system differentiation across the range with obligately outcrossing populations south of San Francisco and highly selfing populations to the north. Abronia umbellata also has two congeners that it co-occurs and creates putative phenotypic hybrids with, yellow-flowered A. latifolia and magenta-flowered A. maritima. Genetic analyses of sequence variation at nine single-copy genes revealed that outcrossing and selfing populations of A. umbellata are genetically differentiated from each other and northern disjunct populations of A. umbellata are genetically similar to selfing populations. Furthermore, the northern disjunct populations contain little unique variation and thus, likely arose through a recent long-distance dispersal event or fragmentation of a recent expansion. Southern edge populations in Baja California, on the other hand, are genetically unique and significantly higher in genetic variation than other outcrossing populations. Extensive searches in 37 populations across the range of A. umbellata in 2017 and 2018, revealed that phenotypic hybrids occurred in 100% of locations where outcrossing populations of A. umbellata were sympatric with a congener and sequence variation at five single-copy genes indicate that phenotypic hybrids are in fact hybrids. However, during the same searches we did not find any phenotypic hybrids with selfing populations of A. umbellata and quantitative analyses showed that hybrids were only found in 2.6% of 695 3-m radius plots across all 37 populations.</description>

   <title>Environmental Characterization of Waste Rock and Tailings from a Carbonatite- Hosted Niobium and Rare Earth Element Deposit</title>

   <description>Rare earth elements (REEs) have become essential in green energy and high-tech applications and the development of new REE mines is expected in the coming years. There is currently little published research on the behaviour of REE-bearing mine wastes in the environment. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the mobility of elements of environmental concern from mine wastes derived from REE-enriched carbonatite deposits.&#xd;
One of the primary sources of REEs are carbonatite intrusions. The St. Lawrence Columbium Mine in Oka, Quebec is the only carbonatite deposit in Canada with untreated niobium (Nb)- and REE-enriched mine wastes. This former Nb mine contains waste rock and tailings that have been weathering in situ for several decades. Drainage from these wastes could carry potentially harmful elements into the environment. This site provides a unique opportunity to determine the long-term mobility of these elements from carbonatitic mine wastes.&#xd;
In 2017 and 2018 waste rock and tailings were collected from the mine site. Field observations indicate that most waste rock is calcite-rich sövite, which has deeply weathered in some areas forming piles of loose grains. Also present are areas of secondary mineralization including crusts of manganese oxides and sulphide-rich lenses weathered to iron oxides. Mine wastes collected from the site were characterized using chemical and mineralogical analysis. Analyses show that mine wastes have elevated levels of REEs, Nb, uranium (U), thorium (Th), and fluorine (F). EPMA and LA-ICP-MS analyses indicate that the main hosts of these elements are pyrochlore, apatite, biotite, calcite and various REE-carbonates.&#xd;
Shake flask tests were used to predict which elements would be easily mobilized from particular rock types. The results show that Nb and Th are relatively immobile, while some REEs, U and F are likely to be released into drainage derived from the mine wastes. Most of the U and F is leached from sövite. However, the rare sulphide-rich lenses are the most important sources of easily leached REEs. Manganese oxides will sequester a portion of the REEs. The results of this study will help guide waste management strategies during the development of similar carbonatite-hosted REE deposits.</description>

   <description>Model-driven development (MDD) advocates using models as the primary software development artifacts in place of source code. Automatic synthesis and verification of models are essential to simplify the process of creation and design of high-quality models. Despite its importance, support for synthesis and verification of models remains less than ideal, and it is still the case that no existing MDD tool or technique supports automatic synthesis of models based on the system properties, or handles the verification of models directly, without leveraging program verification tools.&#xd;
The key idea in this thesis is the use of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers to boost the synthesis and verification capabilities of existing MDD tools. The scope of this work is twofold. First, we propose a synthesis approach using SMT that takes as input a structural model of a system and its desired system properties, and automatically synthesizes executable state machines for its components. To this end, it first generates a synthesis formula for each component consistent with the system properties, and then performs a state space exploration of each component based on its synthesis formula. The result of the state space exploration is saved in a labeled transition system (LTS). Finally, we transform the LTSs into UML-RT (UML for real-time) state machines and integrate them with the original structural models. Unlike any other method, our approach synthesizes detailed actions for the transitions of the synthesized state machines. With action code, synthesized state machines can be executed and tested.&#xd;
Second, we propose a bounded verification approach for hierarchical state machines, which is the main formalism for the description of behavior in many MDD tools. Our approach takes as input the behavior of a system, a depth bound, and the system properties (as invariants), and then automatically verifies models of systems in a four-phase process: (1) It first generates all possible execution paths of the model to the specified bound; (2) it encodes each of the execution paths as SMT formulas; (3) it instruments the SMT formulas with the negation of given invariants; and (4) finally, it uses SMT solvers to check the satisfiability of the instrumented formula.</description>

   <description>Polyelectrolytes (PELs) are a special class of charged water-soluble polymers utilized in both consumer and industrial applications such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, waste-water treatment, flocculating agents, oil drilling and enhanced oil recovery. While their unique solution properties are controlled by the polymer microstructure, studies on the (co)polymerization kinetics are relatively rare due to complexities that arise from polymerization in aqueous phase and electrostatic effects. The knowledge gained from application of specialized experimental techniques such as Pulsed Laser Polymerization (PLP) and in-situ NMR to measure the rate coefficients and study (co)polymerization behavior can aid PEL process and product development efforts.&#xd;
          In the present study, cationic monomers, 2-(methacryloyloxyethyl)trimethylammonium chloride (TMAEMC) and	3-(Methacrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC) are copolymerized with nonionized (AA) and fully ionized acrylic acid (NaA) in aqueous solution by radical copolymerization to obtain cationic PELs and polyampholytes. The in-situ NMR technique, and in some cases, semi-batch reactor systems, were utilized to obtain the rates of polymerization and monomer composition drifts across the full range of comonomer compositions, for initial monomer weight fraction up to 0.40, and at varying ionic strengths and pHs. Comonomer and copolymer solution properties such as counterion activity, conductivity, pH and viscosity were measured to further understand how the copolymerization kinetics could be affected by reaction conditions.&#xd;
          The experimental findings were combined with the rate coefficients measured by our collaborators and implemented into the Predici software to develop of TMAEMC and MAPTAC homopolymerization and their copolymerization with AA and NaA. It is demonstrated that a standard model of copolymerization kinetics can be used to successfully describe rates of monomer conversion, polymer MWs and copolymer compositions for these systems once the influence of the charged monomer on the propagation and termination rate coefficients are accounted for.</description>

   <description>The repair and replacement of bridge decks represents a large portion of infrastructure spending. Gaining a better understanding of bridge deck behaviour through more representative vehicular loading can lead to a reduction in the costs, time and environmental impacts associated with construction. Past studies have most often used fixed pulsating loads to represent cyclic loading on a bridge deck. However, it has been shown that these types of loading do not induce the most critical conditions when compared with moving loads. This thesis is the first part of a long-term study intended to compare the loading effects of fixed pulsating cyclic loads against moving wheel loads, up to 3000 load cycles. The study also compares different types of deck reinforcement and construction methods, namely conventional steel reinforcing bar, glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebar and GFRP stay-in-place (SIP) structural forms for rapid construction. A slab-on-girder reinforced concrete bridge deck with dimensions of 15.24 m x 3.89 m x 210 mm and a girder spacing of 3.05 m was designed according to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) and constructed in the laboratory. Detailing and construction procedures have also been proposed for the new GFRP SIP structural form system. The deck was conceptually divided into four sections but all were monolithically cast. Sections 1 and 4, at either ends of the deck, were identical and reinforced with GFRP bars, Section 2 incorporated the novel GFRP SIP form system and Section 3 was reinforced with conventional steel rebar. Section 1 was subjected to pulsating loads and Sections 2-4 were subjected to moving wheel loads. Monotonic load tests were performed at various cycling intervals to establish stiffness degradation. After 3000 load cycles, the maximum values of reinforcement and concrete strain were well within their ultimate limits, signifying the deck was not at risk of failure. Section 4 experienced a larger reduction in stiffness than Section 1, suggesting that the moving loads were more damaging than the pulsating loads. It is important to note that observations could change at higher levels of cyclic loading, which is beyond the scope of this thesis.</description>

   <description>I investigate how social movements enact emotional culture to advance an ideology of local production in the context of local food initiatives in a small city in Canada. In Localtown, a local food movement conducts initiatives to rebuild the city’s local food system after decades of agricultural consolidation had reduced the availability of local food. Starting with feasts in 2004 that drew attention to the issue, movement members began making active use of events to attract external audiences to local food initiatives. After 2007, the movement's focus went from generating awareness to building infrastructure. Farmers’ markets then became the main vehicles for mobilization. Adopting a qualitative methodology to build theory inductively, I conducted participant observation in the two main markets in Localtown, and I interviewed market vendors, consumers, and members of the broader local food movement. I found that movement members build an emotional culture that emphasizes fun and community experiences while mobilizing movement members despite a lack of agreement on how to enact shared ideals of community resilience and ecological conservation. In building this emotional culture, movement members make frequent use of cultural performances that celebrate the movement’s shared ideals and generate a fun and vibrant community spirit in farmers’ markets. A natural mise-en-scene displayed by the setting and by market products, reinforces the community and ecological meanings of the performance, attracting community audiences whose presence further reinforces perceptions of markets as a community space. But neither the meaning nor the emotionality of performances become necessarily associated with markets, as performances may ignore market products, or the emotional culture may blend into the vibrancy of other surrounding performances.  My findings contribute to the literature on social movements by showing that a coherent, positive and vibrant emotional culture helps movements to mobilize external audiences despite the existence of conflicting ideologies or despite the lack of ideological affiliation. I also unveil that a positive emotional culture is often described as in opposition to the ascetic emotionality of modern institutions, revealing deeper meanings of movement-sponsored emotions. My dissertation also offers contributions to literatures on cultural performances, communities, and crafts.</description>

   <description>In the Big Data era, data is emerging dramatically and the structure of data is becoming increasingly flexible. Non-Relational databases, such as the NoSQL class of Databases, are playing a major role as an enabler technology to manipulate such data. Non-Relational databases, have overcome many of the limitations of the relational databases especially those that relate to enable systems to scale up to serve more customers producing terabytes of data. More businesses are willing to migrate their legacy relational database systems to ones that use NoSQL Databases. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we present a semi-automated approach to migrate highly dynamic SQL-based web applications to ones that use document-oriented NoSQL databases such as MongoDB using source analysis and transformation techniques. We outline a set of source transformation steps that can be used to migrate existing web applications database from SQL  one to document-oriented NoSQL database. We demonstrate our semi-automated framework on the analysis and migration of three existing web applications to extract, classify, translate, migrate and optimize the queries and migrate the PHP code to interact with the migrated database.&#xd;
&#xd;
There are two parts to this approach; the migration of schema and data, and the migration of the actual application code with embedded queries. Our approach provides contributions to the second part, migrating and optimizing the embedded  SQL queries to interact with the new database system and changing the application code to use the translated queries.</description>

   <description>Background: Unnecessary treatment of thyroid cancer as a result of increased surveillance may be associated with substantial side effects, including infertility, often without improvements in survival rates.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objective: To examine the association between thyroid cancer treatment and subsequent infertility diagnosis.&#xd;
&#xd;
Study Design:  Population-based cohort study of female Adolescent and Young Adults (AYAs, 15-39 years) who have been treated for thyroid cancer between 1992 and 2011 in Ontario and lived at least 5 years after cancer diagnosis. Exposure data were obtained through the CIHI/DAD, which was linked to several health care data sources through ICES. Thyroid cancer treatment, from less invasive to more aggressive, was categorized as: less than total thyroidectomy-LTT, total thyroidectomy-TOT, or TOT accompanied with radioactive iodine therapy-TOT+RAI. Women were followed in the cohort until December 31, 2016. Infertility diagnosis was identified using information on physician billed claims through the OHIP database (ICD-9 628). Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine associations between type of thyroid cancer treatment and infertility diagnosis, adjusting for confounding factors.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: From 4,926 female AYAs with thyroid cancer during the study period, 849 (17%) received LTT, 2457 (50%) TOT, 1620 (33%) TOT + RAI. Mean age at cancer diagnosis was 31.04 years (SD=5.99).  The median follow-up time for cancer survivors was 10.78 years (IQR=6.96-15.77). A total of 563 (11%) had a subsequent diagnosis of infertility. The frequency of infertility diagnosis was similar among treatments (p=0.99), with a similar mean time to infertility diagnosis (p=0.69). Mean age at infertility diagnosis was 35.26 years (SD=5.48). Compared to women with LTT, women who received TOT or TOT+RAI did not have a higher risk of subsequent infertility diagnosis (RR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.24, p=0.86; RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.20, p=0.55 respectively).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: More aggressive types of thyroid cancer treatment are not associated with an increased risk of infertility diagnosis when compared to the least aggressive type of treatment. Findings of this study are similar to those of others that have examined treatment effects on female reproductive outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate whether ICD-9 628 code for female infertility is a valid measure of female infertility.</description>

   <description>Track geometry irregularities may induce travelling discomfort for passengers, vibration and noise, and critically redistribution of wheel loads causing derailments. To better understand the track deterioration mechanisms and to quantitively evaluate the success of remediation methods, a new technology is needed to enable long-term measurements of track geometry. The objectives of this thesis are to use a novel sensing technology known as a ShapeAccelArray (SAA) to measure the profile and rate of long-term vertical track displacement in real-time to a) understand the track deterioration and b) quantify the success of remediation methods.&#xd;
This research was conducted at a site where the section of track being monitored is known to be susceptible to long-term displacements. One SAA was installed horizontally on each side of the track to monitor the track displacement over eight months prior to rehabilitation. The SAA measurements were compared with a series of LIDAR scans taken at three different times during the SAA monitoring period to assess the accuracy of the SAA measurements. The measurements from the two systems were in good agreement and showed that the SAA can be used to measure the displacement of the track as well as the displacement rate. The rate was seasonal with slower rates of motion in dry warm summer periods and accelerated rates in wetter fall and spring seasons. The failure mechanism at the site is believed to be an asymmetrical bearing capacity failure based on the track and soil movement measured by the LIDAR scans. &#xd;
The section of track was then rehabilitated with rammed aggregate piers, which were installed in pairs between every other tie in the settlement zone. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and SAAs were used to measure the instantaneous and long-term displacement of the track, respectively, in order to assess the effectiveness of the piers. It was found that the instantaneous displacements of the track were reduced at all four monitored sleepers after the pier installation. It was also found that after an initial bedding-in period of the re-ballasted and tamped construction zone, the rate of vertical track displacement decreased by an order of magnitude from the average rate of track displacement during the pre-remediation baseline monitoring, indicating the effectiveness of the installed piers at reducing long-term ground displacements.</description>

   <description>Introduction: In recent years, Ontario has witnessed a dramatic rise in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs); however, the spatial patterning and causal factors contributing to this increase are not fully understood. The objectives of this thesis were: 1) to map the rates of commonly diagnosed STIs at a fine level of spatial aggregation; 2) to characterize global and local trends in the spatial patterning of STIs to inform the identification of priority locations for STI initiatives; and 3) to explore the influence healthcare accessibility and other community-level socio-economic characteristics have on STI incidence.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: The residential location of Ontario chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis case data reported to the integrated Public Health Information System from 2005 through 2016 were geocoded on a tailored geography of census tracts and census subdivisions. One global (Moran’s I) and three local tests (local indicators of spatial association, Kulldorff's circular spatial scan statistic, and Tango and Takahashi’s flexible scan statistic) for spatial patterning were applied to the case data. The association between healthcare accessibility and the 12-year cumulative incidence rate ratio of chlamydia diagnosis in Ontario was assessed through Poisson geographically weighted regression, and Besag-York-Mollie Bayesian hierarchical model. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Findings suggest that each STI exerts spatial patterning. Temporal autocorrelation trends for gonorrhoea and syphilis remained consistent over the study period, while the autocorrelation for chlamydia cases decreased by greater than two-fold. Both the geographically weighted regression and Besag-York-Mollie model identified an increase in healthcare accessibility to be positively associated with the incidence chlamydia diagnosis. Findings also identify locations experiencing a high incidence of chlamydia.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Spatial findings suggest that mapping STI rates at a finer level of spatial resolution is feasible for epidemiologists and needed to better inform geographically-targeted interventions. Although there are localized clusters of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis throughout Ontario, programming efforts should be directed towards addressing a college-aged demographic of young adults in the City of Toronto, and other high chlamydia incidence locations. With greater diagnosis in highly accessible areas, this research also supports the necessity for improved access to healthcare services, screening campaigns, and educational initiatives in rural Ontario.</description>

   <description>Quantitative measures of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) can be derived from structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study the cerebral cortex and WM projections. Previous multimodal research in patient populations suggests that changes in GM or WM properties propagate to the other tissue type in anatomically connected regions. The association between GM and WM measures is poorly understood, especially in healthy subjects.  Addressing this gap is important because the relationship between GM and WM measures may vary over the lifespan where MRI measures may reflect different underlying mechanisms. The primary purpose of this research was to determine the relationship between GM and associated WM in healthy young adults. It was hypothesized that lower cortical morphometric measures would be associated with lower tract volume and WM micro-structural integrity. &#xd;
&#xd;
These relationships were examined using a surface and tract based approach with a subset of the Human Connectome Project dataset. The cortical surface and 16 known WM pathways were reconstructed. The two WM tract endings for each pathway were projected onto the cortical surface to identify associated GM regions. The WM volume and average fractional anisotropy (FA) were computed for each reconstructed tract of interest (TOI). The cortical thickness, surface area, GM volume and curvature measures were extracted for each corresponding GM region of interest (ROI). The magnitude, direction and significance of the Spearman's Rank Correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the association between GM and WM measures from structurally connected TOIs and ROIs. &#xd;
&#xd;
The most noteworthy findings were the relationships between surface area and WM properties and GM volume and WM properties. Surface area and GM volume were consistently positively correlated with WM volume. These correlations varied from weak to strong and reached significance in nearly all regions examined across the brain. Surface area and GM volume also demonstrated a weak to moderate negative correlation with tract average FA which was significant in over 40\% of the brain regions examined. The relationships between other GM and WM measures were inconclusive with a lack of supporting evidence. Characterizing these relationships may lead to easier detection of abnormal relationships.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to improve the properties of thermoplastic biopolyesters by reactive modification and blending, and to develop thermoplastic biopolyester compounds with suitable rheological, thermal and mechanical properties for processing by 3D bioplotting. As a first step the effects of the structure of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (MCL-PHAs) on their thermal properties and crystallization kinetics were investigated. The predominantly homopolymeric poly(3-hydroxydecanoate), P(3HD)-98 (98 mol% HD), as well as poly(3-hydroxydodecanoate), P(3HDD), exhibited sharp crystallization peaks upon cooling, with the latter exhibiting faster crystallization rates. A chemical modification strategy involving reaction with dicumyl peroxide and triallyl trimesate coagent was implemented to introduce branching and improve the crystallization kinetics of P(3HD-98). Increases in the exothermic crystallization temperature by 8°C and in the overall crystallinity, and lower crystallization half-times were achieved upon chemical modification.&#xd;
Furthermore, blends containing various amounts of polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) P(3HO) were prepared by melt compounding. Even though addition of the amorphous P(3HO) resulted in a decrease in the crystallinity of PCL, the crystallization temperature of the blends increased, and the blends exhibited faster crystallization rates up to blend compositions of 30wt% P(3HO).&#xd;
3D printing of these compounds requires detailed understanding of the viscosity, residence time and the forces encountered in a 3D bioplotter device. A model study was undertaken to investigate the effects of needle diameter and dispensing pressure on the shear rates, shear stresses, pressure drops and die swell of extruded miscible polycaprolactone (PCL) blends having a range of viscosities. Assuming simple capillary flow, flow curves were constructed. Relevant dimensionless numbers that reflected the material rheological properties and processing conditions including the capillary number (Ca), Bond number (Bo), Weissenberg number (Wi) and Elasticity number (El) were estimated. Based on the findings above, it was determined that the viscosity of the PCL/P(3HO) blend system was suitable for processing using the 3D bioplotter. Compositions ranging from 10-30 wt.% P(3HO) were ideal for processing, because of their faster crystallization kinetics, reduced stickiness and good flow properties. Owing to its favourable thermal and mechanical properties this blend system has promising potential in biomedical applications.</description>

   <description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and with shifting demographics, the number of affected individuals is estimated to increase dramatically. While a great deal of resources has been dedicated to researching new therapeutic strategies, most of the promising rodent results have failed to translate to clinical success, suggesting that perhaps inter-species differences represent a major obstacle. As such, there is an urgent need for more translationally relevant animal models of disease, and non-human primates (NHPs), a phylogenetically closer species, are promising candidates. In order to validate these NHP models of disease, it requires demonstration that similar behavioral and cognitive deficits are observed in both the model and the disease it seeks to emulate. To maximize the translational value of these models, the same neural correlates and processes underlying the behavioral deficits should be measured, which necessitates using tasks and experimental procedures that have cross-species translational validity. In this thesis we detail a collection of 4 studies that describe a behavioral testing platform for NHP models of neurodegenerative diseases. The first 2 studies describe the training, performance, and response time profiles of control NHPs on a series of cognitive tasks included in the Cambridge neuropsychological testing automated battery (CANTAB). The third study examines the use of the actical, a 3-D accelerometer, to characterize the daily activity patterns of a colony of control NHPs. Additionally, this study describes a number of environmental factors that influence and disrupt normal behavioral patterning in NHPs. In the final study, we used this developed behavioral platform of CANTAB and actigaphy/accelerometry approaches to characterize the effects of intracerebroventricular injected amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs) as an NHP model of AD. Using the CANTAB, we noted that AβO-injected NHPs displayed decreased task performance and lengthened response times suggesting impaired spatial, object- based, and associative working memory capabilities.&#xd;
Using accelerometry, we also found that global activity levels were diminished in AβO-injected NHPs, but that proper circadian patterning was still intact.</description>

   <title>Robotic Sanding of Wooden Bowls with Hybrid Force/Position Impedance Control</title>

   <description>This thesis set out to determine whether a serial robot could be used to sand a wooden bowl, in order to free a human operator from what is considered a hazardous task. The process of sanding wood is similar to the polishing of metal, both set out to eliminate scratches. There are robot-based commercial systems available for the polishing of metal, for example aluminum, as employed by the aerospace industry. However, unlike aluminum, wood is a non-homogeneous material. In the case of wooden bowls, each has a unique geometry, and to a degree, unique material properties. The hypothesis posed by this thesis is that a hybrid force/position impedance controller can sand the inside of a wooden bowl and mimic the motions and technique of a human operator, and yet be able to deal with conditions of unknown bowl geometry.&#xd;
&#xd;
A CRS A465 robotic arm was used to mimic the arm motion of a human operator. The bowl was held in place by a vacuum chuck. A pneumatic orbital sander was used for the sanding process. A 3-axis force sensor mounted on the end effector measured the applied force. The arm was programmed to follow a radial line from the rim of the bowl to its center and then back to the rim. A hybrid force/position impedance controller was implemented. A forward and inverse kinematic model of the robot was developed to enable trajectory generation. The effect of sander angle and the nature of the trajectory was tested. PD action was adopted for the position controller. Four different force controllers were tested: First Order (FO) filter, Butterworth filter, PI action and combined FO/PI. Tuning tests were conducted to obtain the best values for the controller gains. The conclusion is that a FO filter for the force controller and PD action for the position controller, with an appropriate settings for the impedance, gave the best control performance. This performance was obtained with only a rough estimation of the bowl geometry as based on the bowl’s diameter and depth. A precise CAD/CAM model of the bowl was not employed.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, an analytical based design tool has been proposed for the multi-elements resonant converters. A computer program has been written using the generalized equations in MATLAB App Designer. The MATLAB App Designer provides a graphical user interface (GUI) features to this tool. The time-domain analysis of CLL resonant converter has been introduced in the literature. An alternative time-domain analysis of LLC resonant converter has been proposed.This generalized analysis is used to model LLC resonant, CLL resonant and LC series resonant converter in time-domain. State-plane analysis has been also introduced for both LLC and CLL resonant converters. The performance curves for DC power, voltage gain, peak switch current, RMS value of switch current, peak capacitor voltage and zero voltage switching (ZVS) angle are presented as a function of the frequency and the load. State-of-the-art design examples have been shown.&#xd;
This work also proposes a novel Push-Pull resonant converter.  The CLL resonant tank has been find to be best fit for secondary side resonance with push-pull configuration. A steady-state analysis of Push-Pull CLL resonant converter has been done in time-domain. The CLL resonant tank has been designed to provide both series and parallel resonance characteristic based on proper selection of inductance ratio and quality factor. A computer program has been written using the generalized equations in MATLAB App Designer for study and optimization of CLL resonant tank. Experimentation has been done to verify the soft-switching features of Push-Pull resonant converter.&#xd;
A comparative analysis is shown between LLC and CLL resonant tanks using design curves. Experimentation has been done to verify the theoretical findings from this tool on the experimental prototype of 400V/320W for LLC and CLL resonant converters operating between input voltage 20V-40V.</description>

   <description>Total cover (100 % coverage) presents a challenge for mineral explorers, with the effectiveness of traditional geochemical techniques greatly reduced. Hydromorphic mobilization of solutes can produce geochemical footprints much larger than the ore deposits. However, mainstream adoption of hydrogeochemistry has yet to occur, presumably due to a perception that data interpretation is complicated, and targets generated are of low confidence. Therefore, the development of reliable “direct detection” geochemical tools is needed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Groundwaters were sampled from three case study sites, including porphyry, epithermal, and iron oxide copper gold (IOCG) deposits. Significant geochemical footprints (~ 5 kilometres) were identified. However, results also demonstrate the potential for the contribution of trace elements from endmember mixing and variation in anomalous element concentrations of up to ten times the order of magnitude, relating to contrasting groundwater endmember compositions. In order to quantify this variation, this project proposes a seven-source regional model for the Atacama region of Chile, with the aim of aiding geochemists to interpret hydrogeochemical data. &#xd;
&#xd;
This project also tests a number of emerging, yet highly promising isotopic systems (S, Sr, Mo, and Cu), and reports the first use of δ98Mo in hydrogeochemical mineral exploration. Mineral exploration requires relatively low costs and high throughput, which form the main barriers to the mainstream use of metal stable isotopes. To that end, this project yields an automated chromatography procedure for δ65Cu suitable for high Na and low Cu concentration samples, yielding precise measurements and low blank contributions.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This work reports that large fractionation factors for δ65Cu and δ98Mo have been observed in case studies between samples proximal to mineralization and distal samples downflow from the source. Following the example of previous work, the processes controlling fractionation in this project are constrained to be oxidation, sorption, and precipitation. These controls appear robust in the oxygenated and sub-alkaline groundwaters often encountered in nature. Strontium isotopes show a clear tracer of water-rock interactions and mixing of endmembers, potentially facilitating geological mapping in the covered environment. All isotopic analysis undertaken in this project demonstrated use for the identification of metal sources, mixing between multiple water sources, and water-sulfide interaction.</description>

   <description>This interdisciplinary study reconceptualizes the dominant vision of how genocides begin, and the role civilians play in both cultural and physical forms of genocide. I coined the term “genocide culture” and reconceptualize the terms “civilian actors” and “civilian actors and ethnic engineering” to present an alternative hypothesis of how civilians become involved in genocide through their participation in a range of cultural habitus and doxa. I argue that the socio-cultural aspects of a genocidal process develop prior to the murderous events of a state-led genocide. The concept of genocide culture draws attention to the cultural practices and core beliefs that make genocide possible. The concept highlights how a society normalizes violence against a targeted group, rationalizes the ideology of the dominant group, and legitimizes its authority. The term civilian actors describes the dispositions of ordinary people and non-state actors in the reproduction of cultural practices and behaviours that foster the state’s genocidal actions. Finally, reconceptualization of the term ethnic engineering is to include the “reconstruction” and “destruction” of a subjected group’s identity by a dominant group.  The dissertation applies the sociological theories of Pierre Bourdieu to the study of genocide in order to develop socio-cultural discourses concerning genocide culture. The history of genocide against the Kurds in Iraq is examined as a case study. While Saddam Hussein and the Ba’ath Party are often invoked when responsibility for late twentieth-century genocides in Iraq is assigned, this dissertation argues against personalizing or individualizing the history of genocide in Iraq by assigning responsibility to a single agent or a single political organization. Thus, it avoids detaching the present from the past and argues that macro-events in the present are accumulations of the micro-processes of past events, which also cannot be disassociated from civilians. The first part of the dissertation outlines the theoretical apparatus that is used to conceptualize the cultural practices of the general population in Iraq prior to Saddam Hussein’s rule. The second part consists of empirical case studies and analysis of semi-structured interviews that were conducted to contextualize the experiences of individuals.</description>

   <description>Predicting the geomechanical behaviour of rockmasses is key to the economic success and safety of rock engineering projects such as surface and underground excavations. For these projects, unconfined compressive stress (UCS) laboratory testing provides fundamental geomechanical properties of intact rocks. It is currently standard practice for UCS testing to consider only homogeneous samples and discard heterogeneous samples such as those that are affected by hydrothermal alteration and veining. Understanding the complexities of heterogeneous rocks and rockmasses is critical for excavation projects such as deep block cave mines where extensive tunnel networks are regularly excavated through heterogeneous rockmasses. During this research project, UCS tests were conducted on 29 homogeneous (matrix-type) and 21 heterogeneous (vein-type) core samples from the Legacy Skarn Deposit located in northern New Brunswick, Canada. These samples are sorted into five lithological units: beige, red, and black varieties of quartz-plagioclase granodiorite, calcareous mudstone, and garnet-pyroxene skarn. Mineralogical compositions of these units were determined using hand sample field identification techniques and microscopic laboratory methods including petrographic thin section analysis, X-Ray Diffraction, and micro-X-ray Fluorescence. Significant effects of hydrothermal veining on the UCS test results were observed in the tested samples. Vein mineralogy dominated by calcite weakens the granodiorites but strengthens the calcareous mudstone. Vein mineralogy dominated by quartz in the skarn has a mixed influence on geomechanical properties. Vein thickness primarily influences geomechanical properties of samples with single veins, whereas vein density is more useful to characterize samples that contain vein networks or stockwork. The effects of vein orientation only partially agree with an established model for shear failure through critically oriented foliations. The disseminated alteration in the granodiorites (plagioclase phenocrysts) and skarn (garnet crystals) typically increase stiffness and strength, since the large grains arrest cracks under load. Lastly, the effects of sample selection on reported UCS test results were also investigated using four sample selection methods to the tested core samples. The results demonstrate the importance of including heterogeneous veined samples in a UCS testing program.</description>

   <description>Rock fragmentation by blasting has been in practice in civil and mining industries for centuries. The controlled use of explosives is considered the dominant approach for the purpose of breaking the rock material in any hard rock mining. The fracturing process of rock material, when subjected to blast loading, is a complex phenomenon and requires substantial study. Obtaining desired results in any rock blasting project demands for extensive understanding in two separate engineering fields. The first field of study should focus on the mechanics of dynamic fracturing of brittle rock material in response to blast loading. Given the inherent nature of the blast phenomenon, care should be given in the rock mechanics studies, and the analysis should be handled considering the dynamic behavior of the material. The second field comprises the study of the behavior of stress waves in brittle materials, the controlling parameters of wave attenuation, and the effect of stress wave interactions on dynamic fracturing of rock mass. In this thesis, the strain rate dependency of dynamic tensile strength of Laurentian granite is investigated by the aid of different experimental methods i.e. Hopkinson bar experiments and Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) experiments. The obtained results were combined and implemented as Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF) in the RHT material model using LS-DYNA numerical code. Using the modified RHT material model, two distinct rock blasting problems are studied numerically. First, the effect of stress wave interaction on the resulted rock damage and fragmentation is investigated using a range of initiation delay times. Different scenarios of wave superposition are examined and an optimum delay window is introduced based on the elastic stress wave theory. Second, the effectiveness of current destress blasting practices in burst prone deep underground excavations is studied. The capability of the conventional destressing patterns in alleviating the burst potential is explored by damage investigation and stress studies ahead of a tunnel face before and after destressing. A new destressing pattern is introduced which is successfully capable of transforming the stress states ahead of a tunnel face, reducing the rockburst potential.</description>

   <description>Background: Consequences of paralytic polio may adversely affect the quality of life (QoL) of polio survivors. The promotion of QoL is the ultimate goal of rehabilitation interventions. Thus, QoL evaluation is essential for monitoring success. Researchers have employed a range of assessment instruments to evaluate the QoL of polio survivors in western settings. It is unclear whether those instruments are suitable for the measurement of QoL among polio survivors in northwest Nigeria. Purpose: To identify and select a pre-existing QoL measurement instrument that is appropriate for polio survivors in northwest Nigeria. Method: This dissertation employed three inter-related phases of studies. In the first phase, a scoping review of literature was conducted to identify available instruments, which are used to evaluate the QoL of polio survivors globally. In the second phase, a qualitative exploration of the perception of QoL among polio survivors in northwest Nigeria was done using a qualitative descriptive study. In the third phase, an integrative review of literature was performed using the findings of the first and second phase of the dissertation to select a QoL instrument that reflects the perspectives of polio survivors in northwest Nigeria and at the same time exhibits good psychometric properties. Result: Eleven QoL assessment instruments were identified in the scoping review. Most of the instruments are generic, self-reported, and multidimensional. Despite having good measurement properties, these properties were mostly not evaluated among polio survivors. The qualitative description showed that polio survivors in northwest Nigeria perceived QoL as a blend of satisfaction of needs, happiness, spirituality, and self-perception. Subsequently, the integrative review reveals that the Quality of Life Index is consistent with the perspectives of the polio survivors in northwest Nigeria and has satisfactory measurement properties. Conclusion: Most instruments that are employed to evaluate QoL among polio survivors are not primarily designed as QoL scales. It is imperative to consider and reflect on the perspectives of the polio survivors to select a scale that is conceptually and contextually relevant. This dissertation demonstrated how the perspectives of polio survivors could be integrated to select the appropriate instrument. The dissertation also recommends the Quality of Life Index for future cross-cultural adaptation and validation in the northwest Nigerian context.</description>

   <description>The Lanczos algorithm was used to determine J=0 and J=1 ro-vibrational energy&#xd;
levels for CO-CO2 . The fundamental transition energies have good agreement with&#xd;
previous experiments for both the C-bound and O-bound isomers. Likewise, we ob-&#xd;
served and confirmed a previously unlabeled in-plane state, now labeled a geared&#xd;
state. Other states were labeled and confirmed, such as the CO-libration state. Ro-&#xd;
tational constants obtained from J = 1 energy levels also have good agreement with&#xd;
previous experiments.&#xd;
There is strong coupling between the bends and torsion, which makes the in-plane&#xd;
Potential Energy Surface (PES) cuts different from the out-of-plane cuts. There is&#xd;
an out-of-plane path, however its barrier is still higher than its geared counterpart.&#xd;
When close to equilibrium, a T-shape, a vibration on the torsional coordinate does&#xd;
not significantly change the geometry of the molecule, making vibration along this&#xd;
coordinate very floppy.</description>

   <description>The use of underground repositories known as deep geological repositories (DGR) is globally accepted to be the best solution for long term storage of nuclear waste. In combination with different types of engineered barriers, the final layer is the host rock providing a natural geological barrier to radio nuclide migration. In the context of the Canadian nuclear waste management efforts, the emphasis has been on sedimentary and crystalline rock formations to host the DGR. Construction of the underground spaces within such hard rocks induces irreversible brittle damage around the excavation. The prediction of the Excavation Damage Zone (EDZ) is paramount for the design process of DGR, since it can provide a potential leakage pathway for contaminants. This thesis includes a discontinuum and continuum numerical study to improve the understanding of the fracture development process associated with EDZ in massive rock masses.&#xd;
A two-dimensional discontinuum grain-based modeling (GBM) approach is implemented to characterize the mechanics of EDZ by explicitly simulating the process of fracture initiation and propagation. While the potential of GBMs in capturing field scale behavior is largely unexplored, this study bridges the gap through the development of a new methodology for generation and calibration of large scale models, which when applied narrows the computation efforts. This research confirms the nature of key subdivisions within the generalized EDZ, which includes four zones depending on the intensity of damage, and provides new insights into fracture evolution behavior within these zones. Key impacts of rock type and stress field on the micro mechanics of crack damage within EDZ are illustrated. Capabilities and limitations of the continuum based modeling approaches to predict discontinuum nature of brittle failure are addressed. &#xd;
The predictive numerical tools implemented in this study rely firmly on rockmass strength properties, which are always subject to a great deal of uncertainty. Such uncertainty can pose a challenge for obtaining reliable predictions. Given the low-risk tolerance for DGR, it is essential to quantitatively describe the impact of these uncertainties on predicted EDZ. A reliability-based approach is implemented with both discontinuum and continuum models to address the issue of uncertainty in rock mass strength.</description>

   <title>An Encounter between East and West: The Notion of Truth in William James and Swami Vivekananda</title>

   <description>William James considered Swami Vivekananda the exemplary example of a monist, and he comes to reject Vivekananda’s philosophy because it ultimately did not suit his active temperament. However, judging from his assessment of Vivekananda’s philosophy, it appears James had a limited understanding of Vedanta. It can be speculated that James’s understanding of Vedanta was mainly the aspect of Raja Yoga (the science of psychic control) – which is evinced by the fact that he disagrees with what he perceives as a lack of ability to justify meliorism and a zestful life. But this understanding leaves out of account Karma Yoga or the active principle of Vedanta – which advocates work as the means to realize the divine. Contra James’s conception, it is more illustrative to understand Vedanta not as a doctrine of extreme ‘monism’, but rather an attitude which cultivates every particular temperament and disposition.</description>

   <description>Over the past 25 years, research, policies, programming and news reports have proactively tackled the evolving bullying problem, trying to remain ahead of the issue and provide relevant solutions for all educational community members. As of now, the majority of the literature written on the subject focuses on the changing rates of bullying, the different forms of bullying and lastly the negative impact bullying has on victims, offenders, bystanders and the larger school community.&#xd;
These three areas of research are all predicated on the “bullying” word being understood by different players in the educational community; however, as preliminarily research has started to demonstrate there is a growing and concerning trend of the “bullying” word not being commonly understand, which has the potential to cause problems as they relate to communication, assessment and problem solving. The intent of this study was to use a multiple case study approach to explore how students, teachers, parents and administrators understand the word bullying and how they arrived at their conceptualization. In order to accomplish this goal, individual interviews of each case study group were conducted at two southeastern Ontario elementary schools, specifically working with participants in or associated with the junior grades. The findings reveal that across and within different case study groups the definition of bullying has notable commonalities not yet documented in collective discourse, as well as problematic areas of vast subjectivity. In my study, I introduce the phrase “bullying word phenomenon” to describe the occurrence of the term “bullying” not being commonly understood by members of the school community, which has the potential to make problem solving more difficult and inhibit different research findings (i.e. the difficulties of assessing “bullying” rates if the term itself is not commonly understood). As this is an exploratory case study, my findings are based on my literature review and qualitative case study.&#xd;
With that said, awareness of these trends needs to spread, and more research needs to be done on the “bullying word phenomenon,” so as to assist with school problem solving and inclusion.</description>

   <description>Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) allows for hyperspectral analysis of tissue samples non-destructively under ambient conditions. A downside of such a bountiful source of data is that the high dimensional images suffer from the curse of dimensionality, often requiring substantial pre-processing and complex algorithmic approaches to extract meaningful interpretations of the data. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a cardiac arrhythmia that can occur after heart surgery,  resulting in poorer recovery and higher treatment costs. We proposed a stacked learning system using a combination of DESI-MS and patient demographic information to classify POAF in a set of patients. This stacked learning system was composed of three stages. First, a CNN was trained to identify nuclear hypertrophy in DESI-MS images.&#xd;
Second, the CNN’s output was combined with patient demographic information and dimensionally reduced. Finally, a support vector machine was used to classify POAF on the resulting dataset. Our study showed that the full stacked learning system outperformed the individual components and also provided a preliminary step toward predicting POAF in patients.</description>

   <title>Optimization of spherical proportional counter backgrounds and response for low mass dark matter search</title>

   <description>The NEWS-G collaboration uses Spherical Proportional Counters to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP). The first detector developed for this goal is a 60 cm diameter sphere installed at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane in France. In 2015, the collaboration took a run  with neon as the target material for an exposure of 9.7 $\mathrm{kg\cdot days}$. This run allowed new limits to be set on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-sections with $\mathrm{90\%}$ confidence upper limit of $\mathrm{\sigma_{SI} &lt; 4.4 \times 10^{-37}  cm^{2}}$ for a $\mathrm{0.5\, GeV/c^{2}}$ WIMP. The study of the background events observed during this run shows that it is dominated by the presence of the $\mathrm{^{210}Pb}$ decay chain in the different materials composing the detector, its shielding, and on the inner surface of the sphere. The experiences acquired during the utilization of SEDINE and the analysis of its data allowed a procedure to be developed to avoid radioactive contaminations and minimize the background of the experiment. The background of the next detector was estimated by a stringent selection of the materials, the measurements of their radioactive contaminations and the simulation of the different components. The development of new sensors allows a better homogeneity of the detector response and good data acquisition in large detector. The new detector is a 140 cm diameter sphere, to be installed at SNOLAB in Canada in 2020. Its performance will be also enhanced by the development of methods of signal characterisation and calibration.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a novel Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique for photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. The proposed method eliminates the need for current sensing by injecting high-frequency perturbations and monitoring the behavior of the system. The method takes advantage of the increase in the non-linearity of the I-V curve of the solar panel in order to find the maximum power point (MPP). Current sensors are a costly component in the design of a power converter. They also require a signal conditioning circuitry to reduce the noise and prepare the signal to be sampled and used by the controller. This elimination can reduce the cost of MPPT circuitry. The proposed method also shows a very fast tracking response due to the use of high-frequency signals instead of relying on low frequency and DC signals which are used in the traditional methods. Numerical analysis, simulation results, and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed technique. &#xd;
An FPGA controlled converter is designed for the experimental implementation of this technique. The board is designed to be expandable and versatile in order to be used as a development board for power electronics applications.</description>

   <description>This multi-manuscript dissertation integrated a systematic literature review, interviews, and a developed survey instrument to investigate the expectancies, values, and costs that are involved in motivating current Canadian innovators.  Using the Expectancy-Value-Cost framework, the research investigated individual innovators' motivations, but also considered the relationship between individual motivations and the environments (e.g., climates, contexts, and the surroundings of innovators) and strategies (e.g., approaches, interventions, and decisions made by figures of importance within contexts) that they experience. This research offers unique insights in alignment with innovation education that address paucities within the innovation literature at large, particularly the relative lack of research addressing motivations of the innovative individual.  The findings of this research nuance and advance the knowledge of promotive and hindering motivational factors that can inform the design of innovation promotion efforts.  Innovator participants also identified specific strategies that they use to make their innovating more likely and gave advice to future innovators regarding maximizing expectancies and values, whilst mitigating perceived costs of innovation.  Innovators also reflected on their educational experiences to identify the mechanisms that formal and informal education can provide in increasing the prevalence of innovation among Canadian students.</description>

   <title>High sensitivity of freshwater zooplankton to low chloride concentrations is unaltered by nutrient level</title>

   <subject>Road Salt</subject>
   <description>Driven by decades of road salt use, freshwater salinization is prevalent across North America. Increasing chloride concentrations threaten freshwater species, and zooplankton are particularly sensitive. In Canada, the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life (CWQG) set the chronic limit for chloride in freshwater at 120 mg/L. The ability of this guideline to protect zooplankton is questionable, given that: it is based on only five species of zooplankton, it relies on controlled laboratory studies that can miss indirect effects of contaminants on complex species interactions, and it does not account for factors that modify response to chloride. Increased food availability is one factor that has been shown to increase chloride tolerance in zooplankton species Daphnia pulex/pulicaria. It follows that differences in nutrient concentration, via their influence on phytoplankton biomass and availability of prey, could drive variation in response to chloride. Our main objectives were to understand how freshwater zooplankton respond to chloride, how nutrients could potentially modify response to chloride, and to determine if the CWQG chronic limit of 120 mg Cl-/L adequately protects zooplankton. We exposed a freshwater zooplankton community to thirty increasing increments of chloride concentrations (ambient to 1500 mg/L) for six weeks, crossed with either ambient or high nutrient treatments. Total biomass, richness and abundance of all zooplankton taxa, genera and species declined with increasing chloride, except for two rotifer genera, Keratella spp. and Lecane spp. Higher nutrients did not reduce the impact of chloride in any group, genus or species. Additionally, we observed 27.7–70.9% loss in abundance by the CWQG of 120 mg Cl-/L, suggesting that these guidelines should be revisited.</description>

   <description>Microalgae-based wastewater treatment has shown promise in the removal of contaminants such as nutrients and heavy metals. Municipal wastewaters could be used as low-cost cultivation media as they provide the necessary nutrients for microalgal growth. This technology could represent a viable and sustainable option to implement as part of biological wastewater treatment. However, microalgal culturing requirements and conditions must be more clearly understood. &#xd;
At a number of wastewater treatment facilities, centrate (CW) is produced from the dewatering process of biosolids following anaerobic digestion. CW exhibits high nutrient concentrations, generally much higher than the initial influent wastewater. Therefore, CW represents a potential nutrient-rich cultivation medium for microalgal growth, but it can also be toxic for their metabolism. &#xd;
This study evaluated the acclimation of microalgae culture to CW diluted with secondary wastewater (SW) as a growth media following a 16-week acclimation period. Monoculture C. vulgaris and a native consortium sampled from Amhertsview water pollution facility were used. This consortium was maintained in two conditions –Bold´s Basal Medium (BBMC); and 50% CW (CWC). The initial ammonia (NH4-N) and phosphate (PO43--P) concentrations were 451.67 ± 7.82 mg/L and  22.33± 0.69 mg/L for CW, and 0.65 ± 0.10 mg/L and 1.38 ± 0.04 mg/L for SW, respectively. &#xd;
Results showed that the acclimation process of microalgal cultures increased their tolerance by the fifth cycle, after 75 days of cultivation. Afterward, acclimated and non-acclimated cultures were cultivated in 30%, 50% and 100% dilution of CW to compare and evaluate nutrient removal and biomass production in CW. In terms of biomass productivity, 30% CW resulted in low values, while in 100%, nutrient toxicity leads to physiological stress on cellular metabolism, increasing lag phases. The 50% CW had the highest biomass production with continuous growth. Moreover, nutrients removal was dependant on the dilution of CW used, resulting in a significant removal (> 80%) for ammonium and phosphate when microalgae were cultivated in 50%CW. These results demonstrate the feasibility of microalgae to acclimatize, adapt, and grow under high nutrient loadings while providing efficient constituent removals.</description>
