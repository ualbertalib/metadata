A study was carried out on the closely linked mutants miniature, dusky and miniature-dominant in Drosophila melanogaster. 2. The viability of miniature-dominant was measured for homozygous and heterozygous females and for hemizygous males. Evidence is presented that the death of such zygotes oceurs before hatching of the eggs. 3. Crossing over experiments showed a probable cross over between miniature and dusky but no crossing over between miniature-dominant and miniature or miniature-dominant and dusky. 4. Allelism was found to be shown between miniature-dominant and dusky, miniature-dominant and miniature, miniature-dominant and miniature259- 4, and miniature and miniature259- 4 5. The phenotypes of miniature dusky/+ + and miniature +/+dusky were found to differ and a position effect apparently occurs. 6. These mutants are compared to those at the lozenge, Star, and bithorax loci and the possibility that miniature and dusky represent repeated loci is considered.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qr133.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085q09s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Biology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720h90v"><dcterms:title>an Approach to Personality Through the Investigation of Perceptual Behaviour.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wigdor, Blossom T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The past decade has witnessed a renewal of interest in the psychology of perception.
