In vitro hardening methods for micropropagated 'Norland' were investigated, involving full and half strength Murashige and Skoog (1962) based propagation medium supplemented with NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, polyethyleneglycol, or paclobutrazol. Ten different media treatments were compared for their effect on stomatal function and early transplant performance using porometry, microscopy, and direct ex vitro transplanting. PEG, NaCl and 1/2 MS + 3 mM Ca treatments did lead to decreased leaf water losses. However, these treatments did not improve ex vitro transplant performance compared to controls. Minituber production was investigated using ex vitro plantlets in a rockwool-based hydroponic system. Productivity was evaluated for treatments involving photoperiod pretreatment, planting orientation, planting density, and hilling. No difference in total yield was detected when plantlets were exposed to 12 compared with 16 hour photoperiod pretreatments. However, short photoperiod pretreatment increased the number of minitubers in the most desirable size range. Increased planting density reduced yield per plant. However, small increases in yield per m2 occurred with increased planting density. Hilling, pinching, and planting orientation had no effect upon minituber size, number, or overall fresh weight yield. Significant differences in minituber yield occurred in field experiments. Larger minitubers (10--40 g) had larger yields compared with smaller minitubers (1--5 g). These results will contribute to improved minituber production technology for the Canadian certified potato seed tuber industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Donnelly, Danielle (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t685.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jt36m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Seed potatoes -- Certification.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potatoes -- Micropropagation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dx505"><dcterms:title>Genetic variation of a P-glycoprotein gene in unselected and ivermectin- and moxidectin-selected strains of Haemonchus contortus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liu, Hao Yuan, 1961-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Anthelmintics, antiparasitic agents, have been developed as a main weapon to control parasitic nematodes of domestic ruminants. Unfortunately, the intensive use of anthelmintics leads to the development of drug resistance in parasite populations. Anthelmintic resistance has compromised the control of nematode parasites and has become a major problem in many countries of the world. Resistance to the newest anthelmintics such as ivermectin (IVM) and related anthelmintics in Haemonchus contortus in sheep has been developing rapidly in recent years. The development of drug resistance is an evolutionary process that leads to genetic changes in parasite populations in response to drug exposure. However, the mechanism of ivermectin resistance in nematode parasites is unknown. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been well documented in mammalian cells as a membrane transporter by actively extruding a variety of structurally and functionally unrelated hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs out of the cell. This study was to determine whether there is an association between specific alleles at the Pgp locus and IVM or moxidectin (MOX) selection in H. contortus, by investigating the genetic variation of the Pgp homologue in unselected and IVM- and MOX-selected strains of H. contortus.

Cell death at the osteolytic interface of failed total hip arthroplasties (THAs) may occur via one of two modes---Apoptosis (programmed cell death/cellular suicide) vs. Necrosis. Apoptosis (PCD) is an active form of cell death that results in---among other things---orderly fragmentation of DNA and specific protein synthesis. The purpose of this study was to determine the mode of cell death at this interface. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) stain and immunodetection of terminin protein were used to identify apoptosis. Our studies demonstrated that 31% (range 7--56%) of cells of pseudomembrane were positive for TUNEL stain. Moreover, the presence of apoptosis was the same at both the femoral and acetabular sides of the prostheses. In addition, pseudomembrane (PM) specimens stained for the 30 kDa terminin protein, an apoptosis-specific protein. The results demonstrate that apoptosis is occurring at the PM-bone interface of THAs suggesting that apoptosis, related events may be associated with periprosthetic osteolysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zukor, David (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Huk, Olga (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032512p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm55z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w1897"><dcterms:title>Keyword spotting in continuous speech utterances</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ling, Yong, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The work in this thesis constructed a word spotting system, which managed to spot an amount of pre-defined keywords out of unconstrained running conversational speech utterances.

The techniques are applied in the context of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) approach to keyword spotting. The word spotting system uses context-dependent acoustic triphone to model both keyword and non-keyword speech utterances. To enhance the true keyword spotting rate, sophisticated keyword-filler network topology models are defined in two different orthographic ways, individual phonemic filler models and individual syllabic filler models. To introduce more lexical constraints, a bigram language model is used. Better performance is obtained in the system with more lexical constraints. A background acoustic model is paralleled to the system network to account for the acoustic variety. The results of the experiments show that the word spotting rate of the overall performance increased by 84% when more lexical constraints applied, and the merge of the background model helps to increase the spotting rate by 5.73%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, Gerald (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hx559.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w1897</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language, Linguistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zs72r"><dcterms:title>Prevention of cyclophosphamide-accelerated diabetes in NOD mice with the phosphodiesterase inhibitors Pentoxifylinne and Rolipram</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liang, Lijin, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and other inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice, and inhibition of these cytokines is likely to be beneficial. In this study, we found that Pentoxifylline (PTX) and Rolipram (phosphodiesterase [PDE] inhibitors that induce increased intracellular cAMP) can block inflammatory cytokine production. Inhibition of IL-12 and IFN-gamma secretion was demonstrated in macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide or T-cells stimulated through the CD3/T-cell receptor complex, respectively. Moreover, strong inhibition of IL-12 was demonstrated in vivo in superantigen-immunized mice. Rolipram was inhibitory at concentrations as low as 10-8 to 10-7 mol/l, and on molar basis, it was 100-fold more effective than PTX. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was also inhibited, but IL-4 was less sensitive to suppression. In NOD mice, both PTX and Rolipram reduced the severity of insulitis and prevented cyclophosphamide-accelerated diabetes. It appears that blocking the activity of type IV PDE is sufficient to mediate the effects reported in this study, since Rolipram inhibits only this isoform, unlike PTX (a general inhibitor). Significance. PTX and Rolipram may be effective in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes or other conditions characterized by excessive production of inflammatory cytokines.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Prud'homme, G.

The lowest level of detection by this method was 40 cfu/ml in PBS or milk for both pathogens. The whole detection procedure could be completed within 7 h. Moreover, this detection method is simple and easy to handle for a large number of samples. Using multiplex PCR (amplification of two different bacterial DNA in the same PCR tube) and slot blot, simultaneous detection of both bacteria was also assessed. The detection sensitivities of 103 cfu/ml for both bacteria were the same as when PCR and slot blot were used for each bacterium separately.

Three wetland soil classes account for the variation in the hydraulic characteristics of organic soils. Saturated hydraulic conductivity varies from a median of 1.0 x 10-7 m/s in deeply humidified sapric peat to 2.8 x 10-4 m/s in relatively undecomposed fibric peat. Average pore volume fraction ranges from 0.83 to 0.93. Parameters are derived for the soil moisture characteristic curves of fibric, hemic and sapric peat, using the Campbell (1974) equation employed in CLASS, and the van Genuchten (1980) formulation. Validation of modelled water table depth and peat temperature is performed for a fen in northern Quebec and a bog in north-central Minnesota. The new parameterization results in more realistic simulation than the previous version of CLASS, which was constrained to using mineral soil properties to approximate those of organic soils. Two approaches are used to model methane emissions from northern peatlands using the new soil climate parameterization in CLASS. In the first module, the multiple regression equation of Dise et al. (1993) is used to simulate daily methane emissions from water table depth and peat temperature. In the process-based module, methane flux is divided into its component parts: plant transport, diffusion and ebullition. Each of these transport mechanisms is determined by methane concentrations, which are calculated from a series of processes related to peat temperature, water table level and rooting depth. The daily methane emissions predicted by the two models are similar and correlate reasonably with observations from a bog in north-central Minnesota.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roulet, Nigel T.

The four known genes making up this class are believed to be involved in a general mechanism acting to coordinate the time-dependent processes in the organism. Mutation of these genes alter the timing of many disparate processes. This results in the mean lengthening of embryonic and post-embryonic development, as well as in a lengthening of the periods of a number of adult behaviours including pharyngeal pumping, swimming and the defecation cycle. These mutants also exhibit a significantly increased life span. The gene gro-1 has been cloned and encodes a metazoan N6-(Delta2) isopentenyl PPi: tRNA isopentenyl transferase. In S. cerevisiae and bacteria this enzyme has been shown to modify tRNAs that code for codons begining with U. This modification consists of the isopentenylation of the adenine residue at position 37, adjacent to the anti-codon. Interestingly, gro-1 is the fifth member of an operon. Preliminary expression studies with GFP reporter constructs suggest that as in yeast, GRO-1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, as well as in the nucleus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hekimi, S.

In order to translocate cytosolic proteins into mitochondria a protein import system is located in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. The genetic composition of this complex has been well characterized in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae and N. crassa. However, little is known about the components of the import machinery in higher eukaryotes. Until today only homologues of Tom20 and Tom17 as well as two new proteins Metaxin and hTom34 have been identified. Nevertheless, none of the proteins forming the outer membrane translocation pore have been identified so far. We have cloned a 35 kDa protein from a mouse cDNA library with a 25% overall aminoacid identity to yTom40 and 27% identity to nTom40. mTom40 contains two possible start codons 36 amino acids apart from each other. Interestingly, both the long and the short version of mTom40 can be imported in vitro into mouse mitochondria. This data suggests that the first 36 amino acids are not important for the import process of the protein. The identified protein was shown to be deeply embedded into the outer membrane of mitochondria, although it is partially exposed to the intermembrane space. It possesses a sequence with very high homology to a similar region on both previously described homologues of N. crassa and S. cerevisiae. It is proposed that this region may be of physiological importance. To further characterize mTom40 we generated a yeast strain with a deletion of yTom40, and tried to rescue the lethal phenotype with the mammalian homologue. Finally we describe a bacterial overexpression system for mTom40 and a purification protocol for the fusion protein overproduced.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shone, Gordon (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676x885.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vd625</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892d04w"><dcterms:title>The effect of recombinant human interleukin-1b and interleukin-8 on bovine neutrophil migration and degranulation /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Jai-Wei, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of recombinant human interleukin-1beta (rHIL-1beta) and interleukin-8 (rHIL-8) on bovine neutrophil migration and degranulation. An in vitro co-culture system was used to study bovine neutrophil migration. This simulative system allowed studying neutrophil migration across endothelium (bovine aorta endothelial cells), extracellular matrix (ECM), and epithelium (MAC-T) in the correct sequences and directions. Quantification of neutrophil migration was carried out by assaying the activity of myeloperoxidase, a major enzyme of neutrophils. Degranulation of azurophilic, specific, and tertiary granules was studied by measuring releases of myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, and gelatinase, respectively. The results showed that bovine neutrophils were able to migrate across the simulative co-culture system in response to zymosan activated serum. Recombinant HIL-8 was demonstrated to have a dose-dependent effect on bovine neutrophil migration. Furthermore, rHIL-8 had a dose-dependent effect directly on degranulation of azurophilic and specific granules, but not on tertiary granules. On the other hand, rHIL-1beta only had a significant effect on degranulation of azurophilic granules when the concentration of 100 ng/ml was used. The dose effect of rHIL-1beta on specific degranulation was much stronger. Moreover, the effect of 100 ng/ml rHIL-1beta was augmented when the rHIL-1beta containing solution was preincubated with MAC-T monolayers for four hours. This indicated that MAC-T cells might generate other degranulating factors in response to the stimulation of rHIL-1beta. These MAC-T-derived degranulating factors did not have effect on the release of tertiary granule contents.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zhao, Xin (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vj88j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892d04w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neutrophils -- Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interleukin-8.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interleukin-1.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mastitis -- Immunological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf95g"><dcterms:title>Willow : extending Herby's semantic tree theorem-proving heuristics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lapierre, Patrice.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes a first-order logic automated theorem prover named Willow.

At higher temperatures we observed for the first time a peak below Tc in the thermal conductivity of Pr1.85Ce 0.15CuO4.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taillefer, Louis (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd97h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66345800</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zq69k"><dcterms:title>The functional role of 5-HT7 receptors in rat hippocampal neurons : glucocorticoid receptor regulation and therapeutic action of amitriptyline</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laplante, Patricia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Handling for the first week of life has been observed to increase glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels selectively in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The handling effect is specific to GR, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) levels are not altered. Handling results in a high turnover of serotonin. In vitro, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) treatment markedly increases cAMP formation and GR expression in hippocampal neurons. We wanted to explore the cellular mechanism involved in GR regulation. Primary hippocampal cell cultures treated with 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) or 5-HT for five days resulted in an increase in GR levels as measured by receptor binding and Western blotting. This effect was abolished by methiothepin and H8, a protein kinase A inhibitor, but not by pindolol. Cyclic AMP formation was enhanced with 5-CT treatment and was blocked by methiothepin and ritanserin, but not by pindolol. These results led us to examine the possibility of a 5-HT7 receptor mediating the effect of 5-HT on GR expression. We also investigated the therapeutic action of amitriptyline on GR expression.

The rate and temporal pattern of Cu mobility from in-ground Cu-treated growing baskets, and the fate of this Cu, was studied. In a field experiment involving Acer platanoides, an alternative Cu formulation consisting of Cu metal powder was determined to move slightly more slowly from the basket fabric than Cu(OH)2 over the first season while providing adequate root control. Addition of Glomus intraradices inoculum to the basket system increased the mobility of Cu metal and had no effect on Cu(OH) 2. This suggests that VAM fungi can actively solubilize Cu metal. These results also confirm that the chemistry of the Cu, possibly in addition to the chemistry of the resin, determines Cu movement from the treated surface. The fate of Cu from in-ground baskets planted with Acer jinnala was elucidated in a second field experiment. After one field season, the majority of Cu initially on the basket fabric had been deposited in the soil both in- and outside the basket. While Cu recovered in leachate represented only a tiny fraction of basket Cu, the concentration of Cu in leachate exceeded acceptable limits in the majority of samples. This indicates that the use of Cu(OH) 2-treated baskets in the field may have a negative impact on groundwater quality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamel, C.

Previous work has demonstrated that lesions to the cholinergic pathways originating in the basal forebrain, namely the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM), have profound effects on the working memory function. The present experiments were designed to assess the manner in which nicotine, a nicotinic cholinergic agonist, administration reverses the cognitive deficits resulting from lesions to the NBM. The first experiment used the radial arm maze to examine working versus reference memory. Next, delays were imposed between the first four radial arm maze choices and the last, in order to examine short-term memory. Finally, pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle was assessed to determine the effects of nicotine on sensorimotor gating in NBM lesioned animals. The results convincingly show that the cognitive and sensory motor gating impairments of MBN lesions are reversed by nicotine administration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rochford, Joseph (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Welner, Sharon (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd63f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cs64x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Toxicology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62fb49p"><dcterms:title>Re-evaluation of energy requirements in Canadian women over fifty years using doubly-labelled water and multimedia diet records</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kaczkowski, Crystal H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Dietary assessment methods are often plagued with inconsistent or inaccurate data. Self-reported intakes are particularly susceptible to error as research has shown that humans habitually report food intake inappropriately. Self-reported intakes have been used to create energy recommendations for populations. In order to assess energy intake, a novel 4 day multimedia dietary assessment method was developed utilizing a tape-recorder and camera in an attempt to more accurately quantify energy intake than traditional methods. The Recommended Nutrient Intakes for Canadians ( RNIC) provide population mean energy estimations. An objective was to determine whether the RNIC provides an accurate index of energy requirements. Current literature suggests that the RNIC is inadequate in some populations to meet energy needs when validated against methods such as doubly-labelled water (DLW). Total energy expenditure (TEE) and body composition were determined through the use of DLW in 76 women (49--93 years) over 13 days. The multimedia diet records did not reflect true intake in these subjects as demonstrated by a mean 24% underreporting rate when compared to TEE. Mean energy expenditure (MJ/day) as determined by doubly-labelled water was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) in each stratified age range when compared to reported energy intake by multimedia diet records. The use of tabulated RNIC's underestimated true energy requirements by a mean of 29%. Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization energy predictions closely estimated actual TEE in the study population. This research agrees with current literature questioning the validity of self-reported dietary intake data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, Peter J. H.

In this study, food and water intakes of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were measured during pre-treatment (days 1 to 5) and during treatment (days 6 to 10) with gentamicin (80 mg/kg/day, i.p.) injected at 1300 h or 0100 h. A significantly higher level of serum creatinine was observed when gentamicin was administered at 1300 h compared to 0100 h, and a significantly lower creatinine clearance was found in rats treated with gentamicin at 1300 h compared to those treated with saline at the same time. Gentamicin treatment at 1300 h or 0100 h resulted in a decrease in the 24 h food intake. In addition, in the gentamicin-treated group at 0100 h, the maximal food intake observed at late dark during the pre-treatment period decreased during treatment, and early dark rather than late dark maximal intake occurred. Our data demonstrate that gentamicin induces a nephrotoxicity that varies temporally, and that gentamicin treatment inhibits food intake and alters its nocturnal variations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thibault, Louise (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft56b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623f73j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nephrotoxicology -- Nutritional aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gentamicin.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv805"><dcterms:title>The Laguerre-Samuelson inequality with extensions and applications in statistics and matrix theory /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jensen, Shane Tyler.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We examine an 1880 theorem of Laguerre concerning polynomials with all real roots and a 1968 inequality of Samuelson for the maximum and minimum deviation from the mean, and establish their equivalence and present several proofs.

Various treatments for ADHD have been used, but no long-term maintenance of gains have been documented once treatment was discontinued. This has led to the development of multimodal treatment. Diverse interventions are potentially beneficial to ADHD patients. Objective. To determine whether any differences exist between the multimodal treatment group, and the two control groups, 4--7 years after completion of the program. This study examines the subjects' social, academic and behavioral functioning. Method. A parental telephone interview was used to conduct this follow-up. Results. At follow-up, mean age was 15.02 years. There were no significant differences between the groups, on any measure. Many subjects showed language difficulties and deteriorated upon entry into high school. Conclusions. No differences between treatment groups emerged over time. Multimodal treatment did not significantly improve outcome over stimulant treatment alone. Language difficulties and greater risk for failure upon entry into high school are apparent in this population. Overall, despite difficulties, parental reports indicate most of the subjects are functioning reasonably well: 33.3% of parents reported improvement, 41.6% reported stability of their child's behavior, and 25.1% reported deterioration. This may be due to the fact that 60% were still on medication.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hechtman, Lily (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580p714.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c480m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
