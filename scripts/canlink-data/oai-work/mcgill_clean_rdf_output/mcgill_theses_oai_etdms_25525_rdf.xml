They are important building blocks for any form of human activity.  Property rights in standards, provided by the laws of intellectual property, can  foster their development by giving incentives to create technologies or works that  are capable to become standards; but property rights can also impede further  innovation since they allow the owner to exclude others from the use of the  protected standard. Furthermore, standards are perceived to offer higher returns in  form of royalties than "regular" technologies. In this context,  standardization has been used as an argument to reduce the scope of protection for  standard technologies with respect to computer user interfaces. The thesis evaluates the soundness of a general argument of  standardization for weaker protection in intellectual property law. It elaborates  the arguments that are put forward to justify weaker protection in standards  regarding the characteristics of standards and standardization as well as the  justifications for intellectual property. It analyses the applicability of  trademark, copyright and patent law to both already existing as well as developing  standards. In particular, the concepts of genericness and descriptiveness in  trademark law, the merger and scenes a faire doctrines in copyright law and the  doctrines of patent misuse and patent abuse in patent law are  discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lametti, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386j86f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr048</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Industrial property</dc:subject><dc:subject>Standardization -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Standardization</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tc63m"><dcterms:title>The iatrogenic effects of intervention with sexual abuse victims from a retrospective position /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ryan, Eithne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following qualitative study explored self-reported  iatrogenic effects of intervention with data collected through semi-structured  interviews.

The findings indicated  significant iatrogenic effects particularly for the victims who disclosed in  childhood that included a strong theme of betrayal by the systems that were supposed  to protect them. One woman continued to be sexually abused, while another woman was  returned to the home where she had been physically abused, following no intervention  and/or protection by child protection services. Although other services such as  police, crown attorney, medical and therapeutic systems were involved in some of  these situations, the survivors perceived these as inadequate and leading to strong  distrust of intervention. In contrast, those survivors who disclosed again in  adulthood reported a significantly improved experience with less iatrogenic effects.  The iatrogenic effects of intervention require further research with a larger and  diversified sample in order to identify current iatrogenic effects of each  intervention for children and survivors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, Ingrid (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064668n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc63m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sexual abuse victims</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child welfare</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d035t"><dcterms:title>Families in today's health care system : the experience of families during pediatric admission</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>O'Reilly, Glenda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences and  needs of families during the admission of a child to a paediatric ward in an acute  care hospital.

This examination of White  racial identity is an attempt to engage in a discussion of a different  sort---exploring racism at its source.

The critical concentration of hydroxypropylcellulose needed for anisotropic phase separation is dependent upon the solvent and is much greater than that expected for rod-like species in solution. The flexibility of the cellulosic chains in a particular solvent is believed to be the main factor governing the critical hydroxypropylcellulose volume fraction at phase separation. The anisotropic phase exhibits birefringence, iridescence, and very high optical activity, properties characteristic of cholesteric liquid crystals. The helicoidal pitch for most of these cholesteric samples in water and organic solvents varies from 280 to 700 nm, but in certain organic solvents the helicoidal pitch ranges up to 6000 nm. The latter samples exhibit fingerprint-like periodicity lines in the light microscope and distinctive "shimmering" colors. For both types of samples the helicoidal pitch is found to vary inversely with the third power of the hydroxypropylcellulose volume fraction. A model is proposed for the cholesteric structure in which the average separation, d, between the chain molecules varies with (phi)(,2)('- 1/2), where (phi)(,2) is the polymer volume fraction. The experimental x-ray diffraction data are in accord with this relationship. The angular twist between the molecules in adjacent cholesteric layers is calculated to vary from 0.30 to 1.8(DEGREES) over the mesophase concentration range investigated. Light scattering measurements give twice the weight average molar mass for hydroxypropylcellulose as do sedimentation equilibrium measurements. Viscosity measurements in organic solvents show that the hydroxypropylcellulose conformation in dilute solution is neither that of a random coil nor that of a rigid rod. All aqueous hydroxypropylcellulose solutions show a lower consolute temperature that varies more with the sample molar substitution than with its molar mass. A qualitative "phase" diagram for aqueous hydroxypropylcellulose solutions is also included.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx16p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv75c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Polymers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquid crystals.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558d93g"><dcterms:title>2, 21-biphenyl diols : synthesis and reaction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mullins, Dennis F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The behavior of biphenyl and naphthyl sulfinate and sulfoxylate esters under flash vacuum thermolytic and photolytic conditions was studied and a new tetrasubstituted dihydrophenanthrene was isolated.

These diols were cyclized to give symmetrically substituted as well as cis-/trans- unsymmetrically substituted dibenzoxepins. The dynamic NMR properties of these dibenzoxepins were studied and the free energy barriers of conformational inversion were measured and related to the steric interactions of the alkyl substituents.

A fatigue threshold relation was found between the Pdi/Pdi(' )max and the T(,I)/T(,TOT). This fatigue threshold corresponds to a quadratic hyperbola function given by the product (Pdi/Pdi(' )max) times (T(,I)/T(,TOT)). This product was termed the diaphragmatic tension-time index (TTdi) and at the fatigue threshold is equal to .15 (TTdi crit). Above TTdi crit the endurance time is limited and is accompanied by a progressive shift of the EMG power spectrum towards lower frequencies. The rate of shift of the EMG power spectrum is proportional to the endurance time. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease breathe at rest closer to the fatigue threshold than normals secondary to an increased airway resistance and a decreased Pdi max. Minor modifications of the breathing cycle in those patients were found to cause diaphragmatic fatigue.

Migrational processes associated with the development of commitment are therefore central to the industrialization and urbanization of the North. Exploratory field research in a Northern Quebec mining town was carried out over a 3 1/2 year period, in which commitment was studied through an ethnoscientific study of migrants' social identities. Conceptualization emphasized two theoretical perspectives that have been employed in psychological anthropology, interactionist social psychology and ethnoscience (or cognition). Conceptual relationships between these fields have been noted by many authors, but unfortunately interconnections have not been exploited in most applications of either theoretical base. Research focused on one small sector of the area of overlap, concerned with what Wallerstein has called 'social definition'. The project centers around a concept of 'social identity' which denotes one social psychological factor that (along with others) influences social interaction in a given society. At the same time, 'conceptual systems' of social categories (which are, Stone informs us, social identities) are examined through 'ethnosociology'--the ethnoscientific study of social knowledge as a cultural phenomenon. Migrants and their commitment are scrutinized in migrants' self-definitions and in their social understandings that signal the possession of certain social identities associated with commitment to their new home. The development of commitment, then, is viewed as a change in social identity--a change that is accompanied by changes in 'perspective' bearing on the social make-up of one's social universe. Formal and conventional anthropological methods were employed in the collection and analysis of data. Formal ethnoscientific eliciting was carried out in interviews with a primary sample of six French-Canadian residents and two Cree Indian residents. Conventional interviewing and ethnography rounded out the final analysis and provided cross-checks by which the use of formal methods could be evaluated. Social terminologies were analyzed in order to discover foci and structuring principles central to informants' constructions of their social worlds. Qualitative analysis of self-attitudes, images of their town, migration experiences, and background factors provided insight into recurrent patterns in migration to this Northern town. A cross-tabulation of various factors permitted an exploration into the operation of migrational and assimilative processes associated with the development of commitment. Both factors connected with the migrant's background and factors related to his reception in town must be taken into account to make sense of observed patterns of migration. Native townsmen not permitted to assimilate fully into the new community are unlikely to develop commitment because to do so would place them in a position of 'marginality'. French-Canadians who do not feel called upon to assimilate to a new order also do not develop commitment to the town. Other observed patterns may be explained by reference to the same cognitive and social-psychological processes, though the importance of symbolic anchors for identity in such processes must also be recognized. Observations and findings add to our knowledge of Cree Indian culture, French Canada, and Northern towns and also to our understanding of migration and related phenomena.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655h26g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v8381219</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chibougamau (Quebec) -- Social conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social participation -- Québec (Province) -- Chibougamou.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Identity (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Community development -- Québec (Province) -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397893w"><dcterms:title>Studies on site selection in some gastrointestinal nematodes of mammals</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sukhdeo, Michael Vinoba Krishna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study has investigated the early establishment of Trichinella spiralis and Nematospiroides dubius in the gastrointestinal tracts of their hosts. By using different vehicles of infection, different pre-treatments of the infective stages, by changing intestinal motility and by implantation of the infective stages directly into the intestine, significant changes in the longitudinal distribution were obtained. Surgical procedures, including gastrectomy, duodenal by-pass, ligation of the pancreatic duct and ligation or relocation of the bile duct, performed on rats prior to infection, have elucidated the central roles of bile, chloride and enterokinase. In vitro studies have corroborated in vivo studies. New categories of movement were observed in T. spiralis and new activity patterns were found to be stimulated in N. dubius exposed to bile. These observations are discussed in the context of site selection by intestinal nematodes with emphasis on critical factors which activate infective larval stages during their passive transport down the intestinal tract.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g32q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397893w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Zoology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dw186"><dcterms:title>Francis Bacon, the ideology of utopia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McKay, Allyson.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation explores the social and political thought of Francis Bacon. While Bacon's contribution to the philosophy of science is recognized, his work is seen as having been focused primarily on the reform of the human estate. Bacon's Great Instauration, his programme for the advancement of learning and the restoration of mankind to pre-lapsarian dominion over nature, is examined for the influence of four main Renaissance perspectives: humanism, Christianity, millenarianism and historical optimism. Bacon wedded Renaissance humanism to millenarian-eschatology to provide an alternative to the classically-oriented interpretation of universal history. Despite the frequent use of millenarian-eschatological metaphors, Bacon's proposed reforms were based on human endeavour, not on divine will. The New Atlantis, Bacon's utopian portrayal of ideal social order, expresses his vision of the advancement of learning and its relation to politics. There the principal problem he confronts is resolving the contradiction between the mutability of all things, human and natural, and the inexorable progress promised by the new learning. Bacon's solution in the New Atlantis is ultimately unsatisfactory for it is based on a radical separation of the active will from the public sphere, and is thus achieved only at the expense of politics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d486v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw186</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626.

This is seen through time as a corporate organisation of domains of externally oriented activity variably integrated with a decision-making core as an involute structure. Through examination of recruitment practices, administrative allocation and decision-making it is shown how integrated processes of decision-making (means of choice) constitute a framework for political action, where individuals have differential access to and control over critical events and modes of communication within that framework. Deriving from this, political activity in local government is analysed in terms of a categorisation of means and dimensional properties of power in local government. A link is made to a theoretical enquiry of the nature of social classes and the state and their implications for community politics. This provides the basis for an examination of class relations in Gottingen.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv61s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz204</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Municipal
