This leads to a massive and fatal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the neurons of affected patients. Mouse models of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, created via targeted disruption of the Hexa and Hexb genes, revealed that while Hexb -/- mice suffer a profound, fatal neurodegenerative disease as expected, Hexa -/- mice escape disease to about one year. This protection is conferred by an ability to degrade GM2 ganglioside by means of a lysosomal sialidase mediated metabolic bypass. To determine if such a bypass could be made to function in humans, a series of experiments were performed to examine and compare the activity of mouse and human lysosomal sialidases in their ability to promote GM2 catabolism. The results suggest that human lysosomal sialidase, though sluggish, can indeed degrade GM2 when induced sufficiently.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gravel, Roy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h6403.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q30g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tay-Sachs disease.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gangliosides.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cs35g"><dcterms:title>A critique of the biomedical model : the clash between physician and patient expectations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Flamenbaum, Jaime.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Biomedicine evolved from art to science.

Analysis is based on the measured characteristics of incompletely processed QCSE devices. The characterization of these devices involved the measurement of their absorption characteristics, which was achieved with an experimental test station that could measure the photocurrent generated in the device through controlled optical stimulus and device parameters such as wavelength, device bias, and device temperature. The results of these characterizations are then used to calculate selected figures of merit for QCSE modulators and detectors flip-chipped onto silicon CMOS circuitry. These calculations are based on the structural geometry of typical fully processed QCSE devices. Subsequently, the sensitivity of each type of device to temperature is quantified by identifying temperature ranges for which its figure of merit remains sufficiently high. Techniques that can be used to achieve minimum temperature sensitivity are also discussed, and the benefits of their implementation are quantified.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Plant, David V.

We can initialize Text attributes directly, from data files, text files or from HTML documents. We view text as an unordered sequence of strings, choosing different definitions of the string making up the base unit. We define textview as a relation of two attributes. The values of the attributes are strings into which Text is divided and their sequence numbers. We provide four pre-defined textviews: character, word, sentence, and paragraph. We can also define textviews using regular expressions. We allow multiple textviews to be defined for a single Text attribute. We apply search and replacement operations to textviews defined for Text attributes. We use regular expressions to specify the strings to be matched. The result of a search operation is a nested relation which has a Relation attribute that contains the tuples of the corresponding textview which satisfy the search conditions. We store the values of Text attributes in text files outside relations. We use one text file per Text attribute in a relation. We use trie methods, which proved to be the most efficient with text retrieval on secondary storage, to index text data in relations and to search for patterns in search and replacement operations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T.

In this study, 33 analogues were synthesized and assessed. The compounds were derived from 3 parent aldehydes: pyridoxal (100 series), salicylaldehyde (200 series) and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde (300 series) in combination with the ortho-, meta -, and para-isomers of halogenated benzhydrazides: chloro (08), fluoro (09), bromo (10), and iodo (10.1). Fe chelators were evaluated on the basis of their ability to mobilize Fe59 in vitro from (i) murine reticulocytes with a high level of non-heme Fe59 and (ii) Fe59 loaded K562 cells. Following incubation of Fe59 loaded cells in the presence of chelators, we also determined the intracellular level of chelator-bound Fe59 that remains in solution following ethanol precipitation of cellular proteins.

In spite of its widespread use, a detailed experimental procedure has yet to be published. This study examined all practical aspects of pendant drop experiments with viscous polymer melts and establishes procedures for material preparation, syringe diameter selection, experimental protocol, determination of equilibrium, and the most accurate measurement of interfacial tension. In addition, the effects of both drop volume and unstable drops on interfacial tension measurements are discussed. Comparing the surface tension and interfacial tension values for several polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) resins to literature data tested the effectiveness of the experimental procedure. The values of surface tension of several experimental linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins were determined and related to the copolymer structural and material properties. It was determined that the surface tension of the LLDPE hexene copolymers is primarily a function of the chain branching density rather than number average molecular weight. This occurs because the properties of a branched end are believed to be similar to those of a chain end. Therefore, bulk polymer properties of a branched polymer should depend primarily on the concentration of branched ends. Studying the relationship between the surface tension and the free volume of the LLDPE copolymers corroborated the relationship between the surface tension and the branching density. The values of surface tension and surface tension temperature coefficients of the LLDPE copolymers were found to be similar to literature values of linear polyethylene of equal effective molecular weight. However, the findings are inconclusive due to inconsistencies in the literature data. Also, the effects of polydispersity were believed to have caused a significant surface tension reduction and increased the value of the surface tension temperature coefficient in one of the samples.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kamal, M.

In the later years, use of polymeric composite materials has proven to reduce cost and enhance reliability in several areas of oil operations. Several independent efforts, notably in Europe and in the US have targeted development of both spoolable and segmented fibre reinforced polymer pipe systems. These composite pipe systems have been designed for high internal pressure applications, with additional loads being both static and dynamic. In this research, the short-term, high strain, cyclic bending fatigue of spoolable glass-fibre reinforced epoxy pipes designed for high-pressure static chemical injection line service (SSI) was investigated. Bending and torsion fatigue loading may occur during pipe laying operations. Bending (static and fatigue) of composite pipe was simulated experimentally using a self-designed four-point bending jig on a 25 metric ton MTS hydraulic testing machine. Comparisons between experimental results, simple analytical and numerical static solutions were executed. Numerical solutions for static analysis were found using I-DEAS Master Series 5.0 finite element analysis software. The research effort also attempted to utilise a finite element software developed at McGill University to predict fatigue behaviour of the composite pipe. Findings in this research effort assist understanding of short-term, high strain, fatigue behaviour of spoolable composite pipes designed for static high pressure operations, as well as indicate the validity of the finite-element analysis efforts executed in this research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lessard, L.

The all-male subjects were 144 grade seven ESL learners at a French-language high school in Montreal. They were previously placed into 5 groups, ranging from beginner to bilingual, according to their English language ability as assessed by the school's English placement test. To study the extent of incidental acquisition through reading, a Vocabulary Levels Test (Nation, 1990) was administered to determine students' initial vocabulary knowledge which indicated that this knowledge correlated with their group placement level, and that the majority of the subjects were proficient at the 2000-word frequency level. A story having a vocabulary difficulty at this level, as analyzed by two computer programs, was chosen and a pretest and posttest were developed in the same format as Nation's test using words from the story. Two weeks after the pretest, the students heard the story on tape while following along with the written text. Posttests were administered 48 hours after the treatment. Further conditions were examined in post hoc analyses on the effects of contextual richness and number of appearances of a word.

However, the notion of oneness of being seems to be the basis of his mystical concepts as well as the goal to which other themes are directed. The notion of the transmigration of soul is therefore developed by Nu`aymah in the context of the idea of oneness of being.

After careful examination of the two cases in which Ministerial licensing has been used in Canada, this paper points problems with ministerial licensing. First, as our case studies will clearly show, Ministerial licensing is apparently incapable of providing any of the policy leadership or public accountability.

These approaches were aimed at (i) developing monitoring tools able to foresee operational problems, and (ii) providing the rationale to optimize the operation of bioreactors. The work presented is intended to first describe the community found in two reactors treating pulp and paper mill effluent, and second evaluate the possibilities of these techniques with respect to the development of new monitoring tools. Phylogenetic membrane hybridization showed that the bacterial communities were dominated by Alpha and Beta Proteobacteria, a structure probably linked to the low F:M ratio. Other important factors determining the community structure were the proportion of COD in the high molecular weight fraction, the sludge age, phosphate addition, and the concentration of specific compounds (alcohols, phenols, volatile fatty acids) in the influent. The community structure partly determined the sludge characteristics demonstrating its potential value in the assessment of reactor performance. The results obtained by phylogenetic membrane hybridization suggest that the probes used in a monitoring tool would not need to be targeted to the species level to provide relevant information. However, they also suggest that the technique is more sensitive to changes in population density as opposed to changes in bacterial metabolism. Phenotypic fingerprinting measured a smaller difference between the communities of the two reactors studied than what was measured by phylogenetic membrane hybridization.

In the first part of the present study we characterized a Type of persistent sodium conductance (INap) present in stellate cell neurons of the layer II medial entorhinal cortex area of the rat brain. To accomplish this task, we used the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique to record sodium currents in dissociated entorhinal neurons. It was found that INap represents 5 to 10% of the amplitude of the fast inactiuvating sodium conductance (INaF). In addition, I Nap activates at potentials 10mV more negative than INaF, and this persistent conductance is present at potentials more positive than those expected for a window current. These results show that INap in entorhinal neurons is due to a distinct subset of non-inactivating sodium channels, rather than a window current. In the second part of the study, we carried out a pharmacological characterization of the Type III sodium channel, which is a molecular model to study persistent conductances. We tested the actions of phenytoin, carbamazepine, tetracaine and topiramate on these channels when expressed in the Xenopus oocyte system using the two-electrode double-voltage recording technique. It was found that all the drugs except topiramate, block the Type III currents in a voltage dependent manner. The sensitivity of Type III currents to drugs was not affected by coexpression of auxiliary sodium channel beta subunits, and it was similar to the sensitivity of fast-inactivating Type IIA sodium channels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ragsdale, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hr58x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g4615</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amw22v744q"><dcterms:title>Toxicity and adsorbance abilities of Alcell lignin to bacteria</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sitnikov, Dmitri.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>AlcellRTMlignin has been used commercially in adhesive preparation and brake pad linings and experimentally in animal feeds to reduce or eliminate diarrheal attacks in farm animals. Our study dealt with elucidating the antibacterial effect of AlcellRTMlignin. It would appear that adsorbance of E. coli cells to AlcellRTMlignin particles is not essential for destruction of the organism. The antibacterial activity was delayed by the inclusion of Mg 2+ ions in the AlcellRTMlignin filtrate or in the enumeration medium (BHIA). Addition of bile salts to the enumeration medium (BHIA) enhanced the culturability loss of E. coli cells suspended in the filtrate of AlcellRTMlignin. Using FTIR methodology, it appears, that compounds of AlcellRTMlignin affect phospholipid-phospholipid and/or phospholipid-protein interactions in bacterial membranes, causing the patching of membrane phospholipids and proteins. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate interactions of compounds of AlcellRTMlignin with bacterial cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Idziak, Edmund S.

Its shifts in narrative voice, extensive use of stream of consciousness, and ostensible disorder make the book a daunting task for the first time reader. Fortunately, my age allowed me to consign my lack of understanding to naivete, rather than, as did many early critics, to authorial deficiencies. In addition to my ignorance regarding Ulysses itself, I was completely unaware of the extensive critical debates surrounding its myriad aspects, from the supposed "communion" between Stephen and Bloom in "Ithaca" to the fact that the very edition I was reading (the Gabler text) was the source of considerable controversy in the Joycean community. Having experienced frustrations common to many readers of the book, I can understand why so many readers "give up" on Ulysses. Obviously, I was drawn back to the book, but by neither its encyclopaedic nature, nor the various games it plays with literary traditions, nor any other "technical" aspect of the author's virtuosity; I was, of course, ignorant to these features. Rather, I found---and continue to find---Ulysses an extremely compelling work of art because of the manner in which it seems to be energized with "warm fullblooded life," in the words of Bloom. The impressive extent to which Joyce has successfully created ostensibly real human beings is both remarkable and often remarked upon. Less well documented are the underlying philosophical assumptions which inform Joyce's meticulous method of characterization. The present study of Ulysses aims to uncover these assumptions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ronsley, Joseph (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h371s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh93s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Joyce, James, 1882-1941.

A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the extent to which international trade law can serve as a means to enforce workers' rights in developing countries, considered from a human rights point of view. The first chapter examines the protection of the most important workers rights under international law. The basic problem in this protection is that workers' rights are limited in their enforcement. Therefore, international trade measures could be used to enforce these rights. A first way to use international trade law for the enforcement of workers' rights is by unilaterally imposing a set of workers' rights in the trade relations between two countries. This is the topic of the second chapter. These measures are used in both the United States and the European Community. Unilateral trade measures can be distinguished as non-reciprocal trade aid programs and reciprocal trade relations, the former being much less controversial that the latter from an international law point view. In the third chapter, multilateral trade measures, the second way to use international trade measures, are discussed. This discussion focuses on the social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade context and similar regimes. This study will demonstrate the position that a social clause is to be favoured, but only as an additional way to enforce workers' rights, and only if changes to the existing procedures are made. The thesis concludes by calling for a social dimension in international trade regulation, but warns that a social clause in a multilateral trade agreement should be approached with realism and prudence.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw35z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b308</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Industrial and Labor Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8061760"><dcterms:title>Minimizing the expectation gap through an independent board of directors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saulgrain, Julien.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The traditional model of corporate governance is comprised of three main players: the board of directors, the management, and the shareholders who own of the corporation. This model has received a wave of criticism. The two most important complaints were that the directors had little to do with the day-to-day business of the corporation, and in their decision making the interests of the shareholders were not being taken into account. This situation has led to the creation of what has been called the "expectation gap" which is defined as the gap which exists between the shareholder's expectation, and the performance and actions of the board of directors. To reduce this gap, the corporate governance actors have called for an increase in the independence of the board. The purpose of this study is to give advisors to the French government a comparative understanding of the way that corporate governance in general, and in particular, the way the issue of the independence of the board has been dealt within the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

A valid measure is the severity of differences between input and output that are audible to human listeners, measurement of which requires well-conducted subjective testing. Test sensitivity is improved through the use of "critical" audio program. Selection of such audio material has in the past been done by subjective listening. An objective method of selecting critical material could offer many advantages, including faster and simpler selection of new materials, the ability to evaluate a much larger number of potential materials, and the potential of much better critical materials as a larger portion of available music is explored. The use of perceptual models for selection of critical materials has been investigated. Prediction of criticality was found to be inadequate with the models used.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woszczyk, Wieslaw (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n059h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k9150</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Acoustical engineering.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Signal processing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97ks360"><dcterms:title>Intergenerational and intragenerational equity and transboundary movements of radioactive wastes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wu, Tung-Chieh Jansen, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to explore the distributional side of environmental risks and burdens and, more particularly, to explain the significance of including intergenerational and intragenerational equity concerns within the fashioning of a legal regime governing the transboundary movement of radioactive waste. The thesis focuses on fairness and equity considerations between generations (intergenerational equity) and within contemporary generations (intragenerational equity) in the context of transboundary movements of radioactive wastes. First, a detailed exploration of the emergence of intergenerational and intragenerational equity principles is conducted. Then, the implementing principles of intergenerational and intragenerational equity with regard to environmental risk and burden distribution are put forward. Further, sensitive to the equity dimensions of the transboundary movement of radioactive waste, the thesis explains transboundary movement within a broader political and economic framework, and illustrates the potential transboundary and transgenerational externalities arising from transboundary movement. Management strategies available to help prevent or reduce transboundary and transgenerational externalities are examined. In addition, the evolution of the legal regime governing transboundary movements is reviewed and proposals for reform of the current regime are presented. Finally, the thesis concludes with concrete observations and recommendations. Through the lens of intergenerational and intragenerational equity, the thesis evaluates the fairness of environmental risk and burden distribution, spatially and intertemporally, in the context of transboundary movements of radioactive wastes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, Stephen J.

Nevertheless, in order to have an effective choice of forum, there is one essential condition: the subject matter of the dispute must be similar or identical, and there must be some degree of subject matter overlap in both the NAFTA and WTO provisions. The relationship between NAFTA, the WTO and GATT is complex.
