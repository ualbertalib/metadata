Based on the latter meaning the term humus does not include any undecayed organic materials or micro-organisms in the soil. However, in the practical consideration of humus, the presence of microorganisms is usually neglected.

By 1948, there were enough data available to indicate that adipose tissue is not an inactive storehouse (2) as stressed by Wertheimer and Shapiro in their classic review. One of the most striking and the most studied functions of adipose tissue is the release of free fatty acids (FFA). The rate at which this occurs varies widely under the influence of numerous metabolic, hormonal, pharmacologioal and nervous stimuli. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.

Throughout his literary career, Johnson had frequently pondered over the components of genius, but never before had he given it so succinct a definition. Three immediate questions come to mind. What are the tools of genius? On what materials should they be used? To what ultimate purpose should the genius work? [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hemlow, J.

The species was first noted in the province of Quebec in 1929 by Dr. Lionel Daviault of Quebec City (Daviault, 1937) who observed it developing on seven birch species at Berthier.

Although the yolk and albumen are approximately equal in their content of proteins, carbohydrates and minerals, the yolk contains practically all the lipids. Consequently, very little is known about the lipids of the albumen whereas the lipids of the yolk have been studied extensively. Fresh egg yolk contains 33% lipids (66% on a moisture free basis) and about 16% protein (Romanoff and Romanoff, 1949). These lipids consist of neutral glycerides, phospholipids and sterols. The exact chemical structure of the egg yolk lipids is still uncertain mainly because of the extreme difficulty encountered in any attempt to isolate them in a pure state.

Typically, the low density solid may consist of hollow polyolefin spheres. Normally the solid phase would be fluidized when the upward gas velocity reaches the critical value. However, the simultaneous down-flow of the liquid phase increases the ease of fluidization. Over a wide range of flow rates a state of vigorous contacting between the gas and 1iquid phases is obtained as a result of the motion of the solid phase.
