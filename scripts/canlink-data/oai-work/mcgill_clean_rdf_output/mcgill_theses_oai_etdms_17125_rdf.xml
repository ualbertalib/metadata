Previous evidence suggests that some widely prescribed statins may inhibit the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel via competitive metabolism of its activating enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The objective was to investigate the possibility of an interaction post-PCI between statins and clopidogrel. We carried out a population-based cohort study identifying 10,491 patients using clopidogrel post-PCI (2001-2004). The outcome was a composite of death of any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, repeat revascularization, and cerebrovascular events. We found that co-prescription of CYP3A4-metabolized statins (hazard ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.15), or non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.07) with clopidogrel was not associated with increase in adverse outcomes. We observed no evidence of interaction between clopidogrel and statins in a large population cohort of PCI patients, suggesting unlikelihood of an important interaction.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm86n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bq19d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ticlopidine -- analogs &amp; derivatives.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coronary Disease -- therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors -- therapeutic use.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors -- therapeutic use.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Survival Rate -- trends.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary -- methods.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fq568"><dcterms:title>The insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulates protein synthesis in oligodendrocyte progenitors /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bibollet-Bahena, Olivia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is essential for oligodendrocyte (OL) development, promoting their survival, proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, IGF-1 null mutant mice have a decrease in CNS myelination and in the number of OL progenitors (OLPs). IGF-1 interacts with the Type I IGF receptor to activate two main downstream signalling pathways, the PI3K/Akt and the Ras-Raf-MEK/ERK cascades, which mediate survival or proliferation of OLPs. The objective of this study is to elucidate the transduction pathways involved in IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis, important for growth and differentiation of OLs. In other cellular systems, the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in protein translation. mTOR and the p70 S6 kinase are downstream effectors that phosphorylate translation initiation factors (e.g. eIF-4E) and their regulators (e.g. 4E-BP1). OLPs were obtained from primary cultures and were treated with IGF-1 with or without inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin (PI3K), rapamycin (mTOR), Akt III or IV, an adenovirus with a dominant negative form of Akt or PD98059 (ERK). Protein synthesis was assessed by metabolic labeling with [35S]-methionine, and protein phosphorylation by Western blotting. Results from the former showed that IGF-1 stimulates protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IGF-1 increases protein synthesis in OLPs through PI3K, mTOR, Akt and ERK activation. Concordantly, Western blot analysis reveals that IGF-1 stimulates phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, ERK, S6 and 4E-BP 1. Activation of S6 and inactivation of 4E-BP1 occur through phosphorylation and are required for protein synthesis to take place. These events are dependent on the upstream activation of PI3K, Akt and mTOR.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182p787.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fq568</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stem Cells -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oligodendroglia -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I -- physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55zc28n"><dcterms:title>Understanding the mechanisms of entry of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bertrand, Pascale, 1983-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is a simple betaretrovirus that causes a contagious lung adenocarcinoma in sheep. One unique feature of JSRV is that its envelope (Env) glycoprotein functions as an active oncogene that induces oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. While oncogenesis by JSRV Env protein has been extensively studied, the entry mechanism of JSRV has not been investigated. In this study, we showed that JSRV entry was specifically inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and bafilomycin Al (BafAl), indicating that JSRV is pH-dependent. Interestingly, oncoretroviral pseudotypes bearing JSRV Env protein were not inactivated by an acidic pH treatment, suggesting that additional factors besides low pH are involved in JSRV entry. Indeed, we found that JSRV entry was also blocked by dominant-negative mutants of dynamin and caveolin, raising the possibility that JSRV may use a dynamin-dependent, caveolae-associated pathway for entry. To determine a possible role of JSRV receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2), in JSRV entry, we replaced the glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor of Hyal2 with the membrane-spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G). We showed that although the transmembrane version of Hyal2 functioned efficiently as a JSRV receptor, JSRV entry mediated by the mutated Hyal2 was no longer inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and BafAl. Taken together, we conclude that JSRV entry is pH-dependent, but appears to use a non-classical pathway for entry. JSRV may provide an exciting novel model for a better understanding of retrovirus entry.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462890d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55zc28n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Products, env -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Virus Internalization.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js51t"><dcterms:title>Measurement of brain atrophy in pediatric patients with clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes and multiple sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Belzycki, Sari E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Brain atrophy has been used as a marker for disease progression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

SIENA remained accurate and precise with increasing slice thickness and gap presence. Furthermore, symmetric pre-registration was crucial for scans with larger slice-thickness and gaps.

Common musk turtles are habitat specialists and are selective of their habitats at the study-area and home-range scales. Beaver ( Castor canadensis) lodges were preferred at the study-area scale. Common musk turtles also preferred beaver lodges, emergent wetlands, aquatic beds with floating and submerged vegetation as well as rocky shores at the home-range scale. At the location scale, common musk turtles chose shallower and cooler sites that contained more logs and submerged vegetation than the sites available at random. There was no significant effect of sex on habitat use at the location scale. There was no significant difference in mean daily movements between the sexes during the active season. However, sex and month probably interact together to influence the mean distance traveled daily by common musk turtles in Norway Bay. Males appeared to move more than females in May, July, and October. Females appeared to move more daily than males in August and September. Neither sex appeared to move more daily in June. However, our small sample size did not allow us to conduct a conclusive analysis. The mean home-range area was 23.9 ha and was not different between sexes. I estimated a density of 4.1 turtles/ha and a sex ratio of 1.7M: 1F. The population includes 59.6% males, 35.8% females, and 4.6% juveniles.

The study finds no income inequities in GP access. In contrast, those in the highest income quintile are more likely to access consultants overall (OR:1.10, CI: 1.01,1.19), particularly private consultants (OR:2.49, CI:1.80,3.44). Not surprisingly, PHI is a strong predictor of private consultant access (OR:8.72 CI: 7.04,10.82), but a weak predictor of overall consultant access (OR:1.09, CI:1.01, 1.17). None of these findings exhibited significant time trends across the years of study, thus indicating that the existing inequities remained stable in the UK, despite the aforementioned reforms.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s6146.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50h0940</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Services Accessibility -- economics -- Great Britain.</dc:subject><dc:subject>State Medicine -- Great Britain.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insurance, Health -- Great Britain.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Longitudinal Studies -- Great Britain.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Income -- Great Britain.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj6731765j"><dcterms:title>Professional perceptions of psychiatric advance directives : a view of multiple stakeholders in Ontario and Québec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ambrosini, Daniele Lamberto.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) are legal documents allowing competent individuals to declare their treatment preferences in advance of a mental health crisis.

In order to block the proliferation of refractory tumors overexpressing EGFR, a novel strategy has been developed that sought to design molecules capable of not only blocking EGFR-TK, but also damaging DNA. These molecules, termed combi-molecules (CMs), have been shown to degrade under physical conditions to release another inhibitor of EGFR, and to be potent against tumor cells of various origins including breast, prostate and carcinoma of the vulva. However, despite their potency, their growth inhibitory IC50 values were still in the high micromolar range. In order to augment the potency of the CMs, here they were re-designed to contain two quinazoline moieties and a central N,N-bis(2-aminoethyl)methylamine spacer which, following degradation, could yield higher concentrations of free inhibitors and a more cytotoxic bifunctional DNA damaging species. Here, we describe the mechanism of action of the first prototype of this approach, JDE52, which we now classify as a double-arm CM, in comparison with ZRBA1, its closest single-arm counterpart. The results indicated that JDE52 was capable of inducing significant blockade of EGFR, DNA single-strand breaks and inter-strand cross-links. ZRBA1, its single-arm counterpart, was capable of only forming DNA single-strand breaks. The fluorescent property of FD105, the secondary inhibitor that both JDE52 and ZRBA1 are capable of releasing, has permitted the analysis of its levels in tumor cells by UV flowcytometry. It was found that JDE52 was indeed capable of significantly releasing higher levels of fluorescence (p&lt;0.05) in human tumor cells, compared with levels of fluorescence released by ZRBA1. More importantly, JDE52 induced higher levels of apoptosis and cell killing than ZRBA1. Apoptosis was triggered by JDE52 at a faster rate than ZRBA1. The results in toto suggest that the superior potency of JDE52, when compared with ZRBA1, may be imputed to mechanisms associated with the generation of higher levels of FD105 intracellularly, and the induction of DNA cross-links, which are known to be more cytotoxic. These combined mechanisms (blockade of EGFR-TK and formation of cross-links) contributed to an accelerated rate of apoptosis in cells treated with JDE52. This study conclusively demonstrated that designing molecules as prodrugs of high levels of quinazoline inhibitors of EGFR and bifunctional DNA cross-linking species is a valid strategy to enhance the potency of CMs against refractory tumors.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80j024w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp10m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quinazolines -- pharmacokinetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prostatic Neoplasms -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Triazenes -- pharmacokinetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rp86t"><dcterms:title>Measures of maternal tobacco smoke exposure and foetal growth</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Almeida, Nisha.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. Most biomarker studies of maternal smoking have been based on a single blood or urinary cotinine value, which is inadequate in capturing maternal tobacco exposure over the entire pregnancy. This thesis used maternal hair biomarkers to investigate the association between maternal active and passive smoking, and birthweight for gestational age (BW for GA). Methods. Subjects were 444 term controls drawn from 5,337 participants of a multi-centre nested case-control study of preterm birth in Montreal. Maternal hair, collected after delivery, was measured for average nicotine and cotinine concentration across the pregnancy, assuming hair growth of 1 cm/month. The BW for GA z-score used Canadian population-based standards. Multiple linear regression was used to assess effects on the z-score, after controlling for potential confounders. Results. In regression models for maternal active smoking analysis, the addition of hair nicotine to models containing either self-report or hair cotinine or both self-report and cotinine explained significantly more variance in the BW for GA z-score (p=0.009, p=0.017, and p=0.033, respectively). In maternal passive smoking analysis, no significant effect of ETS on BW for GA was found using hair biomarkers. Conclusion. These results indicate that hair biomarkers are sensitive tools capable of predicting reductions in birthweight for maternal active smoking. The stronger results obtained for nicotine are reflective of the fact that hair nicotine is a better measure of maternal smoking, but it could also suggest that nicotine plays an aetiologic role in affecting foetal growth.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z881t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rp86t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Smoking -- adverse effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tobacco Smoke Pollution -- adverse effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetal Growth Retardation -- etiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maternal Exposure -- adverse effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetal Weight -- drug effects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bn06g"><dcterms:title>Characterization of signal transduction pathways of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion rat model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Khairi, Irina.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neonatal ventral hippocampus (nVH) lesioned animals show molecular and behavioral abnormalities analogous to those described in schizophrenia. As an extension to previous studies that showed an increase in ligand binding of cortical alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (AR) and a dysfunction in alpha-1 AR regulation of mesolimbic dopamine functions in post-pubertal nVH lesioned rats, we investigated the subcellular expression and activity of protein kinase C (PKC)---a second messenger in alpha-1 AR signaling---in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of post-pubertal nVH lesioned rats. Western blot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions showed complex changes in lesioned animals in the expression of different PKC subtypes following saline or alpha-1 AR agonist (cirazoline i.p.) injection. Among these changes, nVH lesioned animals showed a significant increase in membrane bound PKC alpha and phospho-PKC, and a decrease in cytosolic PKC gamma and PKC betaII in the PFC in comparison to sham-lesioned controls following saline. Cirazoline increased membrane bound PKC alpha in controls but decreased it in lesioned animals. In the NAcc, lesioned animals showed an increase in membrane bound and cytosolic PKC epsilon and PKC lambda levels following saline. Following cirazoline, lesioned animals showed a decrease in membrane bound PKC epsilon and PKC lambda, while controls showed an increase in cytosolic and membrane fractions of PKC epsilon with no change in PKC lambda. In vitro PKC activity assays showed increased basal activity in PFC slices of lesioned animals compared to controls, with no difference in NAcc slices. alpha-1 AR stimulation by the agonist phenylephrine (PE) increased PKC activity in PFC of controls while decreasing activity substantially in lesioned animals. In the NAcc, high concentrations of PE increased activity in controls, but decreased activity in lesioned animals. This abnormal expression and activity of PKC in the PFC and NAcc of nVH lesioned animals may be related to abnormal alpha-1 AR functions and may modulate some of the abnormal neuronal functions in these animals, such as working memory deficits and hyper neuronal excitability of the PFC and the NAcc.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pk958.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bn06g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hippocampus -- injuries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Imidazoles.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adrenergic alpha-Agonists -- pharmacokinetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1 -- drug effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein Kinase C.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rz265"><dcterms:title>The efficacy of biodegradable mesh as a fixation device for support of autogenous onlay bone grafts : a radiographic and histomorphometric analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Jandan, Badr.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of the biodegradable mesh as an alternative fixation device to the titanium mesh for support of onlay particulate, bone and cancellous, marrow (PBCM) grafts. Two parameters were evaluated: (1) Bone graft volume maintenance; and (2) Calcified tissue surface area and distribution. Methods. 12 New Zealand white rabbits were used and divided equally into two groups. In both groups, endochondral, cancellous bone graft was harvested from the anterior ilium. The bone graft was then compressed and placed as an onlay onto the lateral aspect of the mandible using two chambers for each animal. In the control group, the chambers were made of titanium, however in the test group the chambers were made of poly L-lactide, polyglycolide and trimethylene carbonate mesh (Inion GTR(TM) Finland), and thereafter the chambers were fixed to the mandible. The animals were then sacrificed after eight weeks postoperatively, and then Micro-CT imaging was performed for the entire sample in order to determine the total volume of calcified tissue present under each chamber. In addition, Histologic sections were obtained from each chamber, and thereafter stained using Toluidine blue and Von Kossa for the purpose of histomorphometric analysis in order to determine the calcified tissue surface area. Results. When comparing the data from both the titanium (Ti) and the biodegradable mesh (PLA) groups, Micro CT analysis showed no significant statistical difference (P-value = 0.546) with regard to the percentage of bone found under the chambers (Ti 15.0% and PLA 13.83%). Interestingly, neither did the histomorphometric analysis show any significant statistical deference (P-value = 0.8272) with regard to the percentage of calcified tissue surface area (Ti 16.86% and PLA 16.17%). Moreover, this calcified tissue was also found to be evenly distributed in both groups. Conclusion. Biodegradable mesh made of poly L-lactic and polyglycolic acid copolymers appears to be an appropriate alternative to the Ti mesh for support of PBCM bone grafts. However, further clinical trails should be conducted to confirm these findings.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72pc01t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz265</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Absorbable Implants.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surgical Mesh.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone Regeneration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mandible -- surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816r16d"><dcterms:title>Is Bio-Oss an osteoconductive material when used as an onlay bone substitute? : an experimental study in the mandible of the rabbit</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Harkan, Abdullah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study was carried out to evaluate the osteoconductive nature of Bio-OssRTM (natural deproteinized bone mineral) when used as an onlay bone substitute in a Guided Bone Regeneration model.

In the test group, the newly generated bone was 18.41% and in the control group it was 5.31%. This difference was statistically significant. Thus, in this experiment, Bio-OssRTM was proven to be osteoconductive.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w342r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816r16d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bone Matrix.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone Regeneration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone Substitutes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mandible -- surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mr10h"><dcterms:title>Angiotensin II produces endothelial dysfunction by simultaneously activating eNOS and NAD(P)H oxidase</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Dhaher, Zainab.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system lowers the rate of cardiovascular events in patients at risk for vascular disease and also improves endothelial function but the mechanism remains unclear. HUVECs were stimulated with Ang II (100 nM). Ang II produced a 2-fold increase in O2- production, which was measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. This increase was blocked by NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor DPI, but not by eNOS inhibitor L-NAME. Ang II increased monocyte adhesion to ECs by 4.5-fold, and this increase was blocked by candesartan (AT1 receptor antagonist), DPI, L-NAME, wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), dominant negative-AKT, and p22phox siRNA. Dominant active-AKT increased adhesion by 1.5-fold. Our findings indicate that the simultaneous activation by Ang II of eNOS and NAD(P)H oxidase leads to endothelial activation.

This increase has been attributed to ASMC hyperplasia and hypertrophy. The distance between ASMC and the epithelium is reduced suggesting expansion of the muscle bundle towards the epithelium. Recent studies have suggested a role of epithelial derived chemokines in ASMC migration toward the epithelium. We hypothesized that chemokines (Eotaxin, RANTES, MIP-1alpha and IL-8) can directly influence ASMC mass by increasing the rate of proliferation or enhancing survival. ASMCs were exposed to different concentrations of eotaxin, RANTES, IL-8 or MIP-1alpha. To test for proliferation, stimulated ASMC were pulsed with 3H-thymidine or stained with BrdU and then analyzed with flow cytometry. Apoptosis was measured using Annexin V and flow cytometry. Expression of phosphorylated p42/p44 and MAPKinases was assessed by Western analysis. In a concentration-dependent manner, chemokines such as Eotaxin, RANTES, IL-8 and MIP-lalpha increased ASMCs 3H-thymidine incorporation and DNA synthesis. Eotaxin, RANTES and IL-8 decreased the number of apoptotic ASMCs compared to the matched controls. A significant increase in phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPKs was seen after treating ASMCs with RANTES and eotaxin. We conclude that chemokines might contribute to airway remodeling by increasing the number of ASMCs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc23h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rc62f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cell Proliferation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemokines, CC -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asthma -- physiopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epithelial Cells -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Myocytes, Smooth Muscle -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interleukin-8 -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn00b239f"><dcterms:title>Comparison of p53 and MAGI-3 regulation mediated by the E6 protein from high-risk human papillomavirus types 18 and 33</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ainsworth, Julia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The HPV E6-p53 interaction is well-understood, but not for all high-risk HPV types.

Thus, the aim of this study was two-fold: (1) to gain insight into the p53-E6 interaction for high-risk HPV-33 and, (2) to explore how high-risk HPV E6 proteins targets cellular MAGI-3 for degradation. In vivo and in vitro results indicated that E6 from HPV types 18 and 33 interacted similarly with p53 although, variants of the HPV-33 E6 prototype demonstrated interesting disparities. Of note was HPV-33 E6 variant 2, which degraded p53 more efficiently than prototype HPV-33 E6 and HPV-18 E6. The E6 protein from HPV types 18 and 33 also potently degraded MAGI-3 via a different pathway than that used for p53. Specifically, proteasome inhibition did not interfere with MAGI-3 degradation and MAGI-3 was not ubiquitinated in the presence of the E6 protein. Therefore, the results described herein enhance our understanding of high-risk HPV type 33 E6 and the E6-MAGI-3 interaction.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn27b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b239f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Papillomaviridae -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oncogene Proteins, Viral -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Membrane Proteins -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Viral Envelope Proteins -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mt54r"><dcterms:title>Non-deterministic communication complexity of regular languages</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ada, Anil.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The notion of communication complexity was introduced by Yao in his seminal paper [Yao79]. In [BFS86], Babai Frankl and Simon developed a rich structure of communication complexity classes to understand the relationships between various models of communication complexity. This made it apparent that communication complexity was a self-contained mini-world within complexity theory. In this thesis, we study the place of regular languages within this mini-world. In particular, we are interested in the non-deterministic communication complexity of regular languages. We show that a regular language has either O(1) or O(log n) non-deterministic complexity. We obtain several linear lower bound results which cover a wide range of regular languages having linear non-deterministic complexity. These lower bound results also imply a result in semigroup theory: we obtain sufficient conditions for not being in the positive variety Pol(Com). To obtain our results, we use algebraic techniques. In the study of regular languages, the algebraic point of view pioneered by Eilenberg ([Eil74]) has led to many interesting results. Viewing a semigroup as a computational device that recognizes languages has proven to be prolific from both semigroup theory and formal languages perspectives. In this thesis, we provide further instances of such mutualism.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/765374670.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mt54r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Formal languages.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Complexity (Linguistics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sequential machine theory.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999b32q"><dcterms:title>Gravity-based trust model for web-based social networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tang, Hon Cheong, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Web-based social networks have become one of the most popular applications on the Internet in recent years.

This thesis proposes a gravity-based trust model to enhance the aggregation of personal trust information into a subjective reputation system. This new model maps all users on the social network into n-dimensional Euclidean spaces based on their direct trust information, and creates a trust social neighborhood for each user. The reputation of a target user is determined by applying gravity model to the information from both target's and observer's trust social neighborhood. A prototype of this trust model is implemented in order to evaluate the effects of varying different parameters of the gravity-based trust model.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vx629.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999b32q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Online social networks.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trust -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139573h"><dcterms:title>Oribatid mite (Acari:Oribatida) assemblage response to changes in litter depth and habitat type in a beech-maple forest in southwestern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sylvain, Zachary A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I investigated oribatid mite assemblages in a beech-maple forest in southwestern Quebec.

Recent observations indicate rapid and abrupt changes in climate. These changes are thought to includes rising temperatures, increase storm activity, altered freshwater balance and a notable decrease in the concentration and extent of sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean. Increasing awareness of these changing conditions and our poor knowledge of how the physical environment influences carbon fluxes, planktonic productivity and biogeochemical cycling have lead to international efforts to address these questions. The data presented here addresses biogeochemical cycling and phytoplankton primary production in the pelagic ecosystem. Given the pace of environmental change in the arctic (rapid ice retreat, record minimum ice extents, and temperature rise) and the relatively little historical data that is available for the region, the data presented here can also be used as a baseline data set from which predictions can be made and future observations can be compared. Conducted as part of the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES), this thesis provides a current review of nutrient dynamics and cycling, and estimates of annual new and net primary production for the Mackenzie Shelf, the Amundsen Gulf and the Cape Bathurst polynya in the southeastern Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic Ocean.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526g86k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj4308299</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nutrient cycles -- Beaufort Sea.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marine productivity -- Beaufort Sea.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polynyas -- Beaufort Sea.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q524b"><dcterms:title>Investigating the natural history of human islet-derived duct-like structures transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Scott, Ryan, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Islet plasticity has proven to be an important platform for the engineering of alternative islet tissue for transplantation. In vitro studies have shown the ability of islets to transdifferentiate into duct-like epithelial structures (DLS) thought to possess progenitor cells capable of replenishing damaged tissue within the pancreas. The aim of this study was to investigate the natural history of human derived duct-like epithelial structures transplanted into nude mice. Human islet derived duct-like structures from three cadaver pancreases were subcutaneously transplanted into 6-8 week old male HSD athymic nude-Foxn1 mice. Six mice were sacrificed at day 3, 7, 14 and 21 from each time period. DLS were also placed in matrigel for in-vitro control samples. DLS were processed for immunohistochemistry for endocrine markers, epithelial markers, cell death and proliferation markers, islet maturation markers and angiogenic factors. Our results show that as DLS are transplanted, there is an increase in cell death and proliferation. This increase in cell death and proliferation causes an increase in PDX-1 expression as well as VEGF, an angiogenic factor. But over time, transplanted DLS do not show an increase in cell death and show a small decrease in cell proliferation from pre-transplanted DLS. At day 3 of engraftment, DLS show a significant expression of PDX-1. We see a small increase in endocrine tissue after 3 days of transplantation, then an increase in endocrine cell death, which returns the percentage of endocrine cells back to pre-transplantation levels at day 21. DLS were shown to express VEGF, and once transplanted into an initial hypoxic environment there is a substantial increase in expression, followed by a recruitment of microvessels. Although there is a dynamic change in expression of cell markers throughout engraftment, there is no significant change in DLS size, nuclei per DLS or cell morphology over time. DLS have been shown to survive subcutaneous transplantation and possess an initial increase in cell proliferation leading to increases in PDX-1 and VEGF expression. Transplanted DLS have shown to possess significant angiogenic properties with the recruitment of microvessels into subcutaneous DLS grafts. Subcutaneous DLS transplantation could be used in combination with islet transplantation to alleviate current problems with islet transplantation such as islet cell death and insufficient blood supply.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t9951.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q524b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Regeneration -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islets of Langerhans -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice, Nude.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pancreatic Ducts -- transplantation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pancreatic Ducts -- growth &amp; development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hg769"><dcterms:title>Reverse genetics of mucilage synthesis in the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schafhauser, James.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Arabidopsis, the mucilage secretory cells (MSC) of the seed coat produce a pectinaceous mucilage.

In crickets, for instance, a female will move towards a singing male only if she can recognize the appropriate pulse rate characteristic to its own species' song. Additionally, in order to evade predatory insectivorous bats, flying crickets must be able to track the predator's ultrasonic echolocation signals, which are emitted at a variety of pulse rates. In this thesis, the temporal processing, or the integration of stimulus through time, in the peripheral1 auditory system of the cricket will be investigated. The ON1 interneuron temporal processing was first examined and compared at high (bat-like) and low carrier (cricket-like) frequencies in three different experimental paradigms. First, integration time, which corresponds to the time it takes for a neuron to reach threshold when stimulated at the minimum effective intensity, was found to be significantly shorter at high carrier frequency than at low carrier frequency. Second, phase locking to sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) signals was more efficient at high frequency, especially at high modulation rates and low modulation depths. Finally, we examined the efficiency with which ON1 detects gaps in a constant tone. As reflected by the decrease in firing rate in the vicinity of the gap, ON1 is better at detecting gaps at low carrier frequency. Following a gap, firing rate increases beyond the pre-gap level. This "rebound" phenomenon is similar for low and high carrier frequencies. To determine the source of this differential temporal processing, the sensory afferents making synapses with ON1 were investigated. Low frequency (MT-type) and ultrasound auditory receptors were compared on the basis of latency, maximum firing rate, adaptation, information transmission, bursting and feature detection. Ultrasound receptors (HFs) were found to have a shorter latency, a higher maximum firing rate and stronger adaptation than low-frequency receptors (LFs). Individual HFs transmitted more linear (lower-bound) information than LFs. However, HFs' responses were more correlated than LFs' (i.e. they had larger mutual information), so that when superposing the spike trains of LFs, information transmission in the lowest amplitude modulation rates was greatly improved, and, in some cases, reached the level of HFs. Feature detection by spike in HFs was better than in LFs. Feature detection by bursts was better than for spikes, but equivalent in both types of receptors. The level of bursting in HFs, however, was much higher than in LFs, making them better feature detectors in general. 1Because it lies in the prothoracic ganglion, ON1 is technically part of the central nervous system. For the purpose of this thesis, however, because ON1 receives direct input from the receptors, it will be considered to be part of the peripheral auditory systems.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301507h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s83b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auditory pathways.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oceanic field cricket.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333600p"><dcterms:title>Development of a constant rate step test to assess exertional dyspnea in the primary care setting in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rycroft, Ashley McLean.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rationale. There is a need for the development of a field test to evaluate exertional dyspnea in the primary care setting. This study examined the applicability of a 3-minute constant rate step test in patients with COPD. Methods. This test involved 4 stepping rates (18, 22, 26, 32 steps.min-1) equivalent to approximately 4.5, 5.3, 6.0, and 7.2 MET with the ultimate goal that in its final development, the assessment will be made a single stepping rate based on disease severity. Stable COPD patients (N = 43; 65 +/- 6.5 years; FEV1 = 49 +/- 16% pred.; SpO2 (%) rest: 95 +/- 2) were equipped with a portable Jaeger Oxycon MobileRTM metabolic system and followed an audio signal for stepping up and down a single 20 cm step for 3 minutes. Borg dyspnea scores were obtained at the end each stepping bout. A 10-min rest was given between each stepping bout. Results. Of the 43 patients, 80% completed stages 1 and 2, 74 and 37% stages 3 and 4 while no patient of MRC class 4 or 5 (N = 8) completed stage 1. Breathing frequency (breaths.min-1) spanned from 26.5 +/- 4.1 to 39.0 +/- 6.4 but VT (L) remained unchanged (1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.4) from stage 1 to 4 while Borg scores were 3 +/- 1, 4 +/- 1, 5 +/- 2, 6 +/- 3 respectively and SpO2 (%) were 92 +/- 5, 91 +/- 4, 91 +/- 4 and 90 +/- 4. Conclusions. Preliminary findings indicate that a 3-minute constant rate step test may present a feasible alternative to laboratory testing to assess exertional dyspnea in moderately severe COPD. In this population, a stepping rate of 26 steps.min-1 could be sustained by the majority of patients while producing a level of dyspnea potentially amenable to therapy.
