Thirty-one subjects with fibromyalgia were recruited consecutively from referrals to rehabilitation programs in Montreal area centers. Assessments, including the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, were done before and after completion of the program, to provide baseline and outcome measures of self-efficacy and health status. Baseline correlations showed a mild-to-moderate association of self-efficacy with physical and mental health status. Baseline self-efficacy for function (FSE) showed a trend towards predicting physical functioning and bodily pain. Baseline self-efficacy for other symptoms (OSE) also showed a trend towards being predictive of bodily pain and mental health. Correlations of the changes showed that FSE and OSE were associated with physical functioning, vitality, social functioning and role-functioning emotional. This research contributes to the understanding of fibromyalgia patients' responses to rehabilitation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McKinley, Patricia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jg75c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dp26r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h147j"><dcterms:title>Identification and initial characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster clk-1 gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Levina, Antonina.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The clk-1 gene was found in the screen for the maternal effect viable mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans.

The CLK-1 homologue in yeast, COQ7, was shown to be involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis and gluconeogenic gene activation. The Drosophila clk-1 gene has been cloned. As a means to assay probable correlation between the timing mechanism of clk-1 and the circadian clocks, well studied in Drosophila, the clk-1 circadian mRNA expression has been monitored. At the middle of the dark phase, the level of clk-1 transcript decreases by approximately 30%. The Drosophila clk-1 mRNA expression during developmental stages was also analyzed. The amount of clk-1 mRNA is doubled during the larvae stage, the most metabolically active stage in the early Drosophila development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pollack, G.

The mothers' psychological adjustment was assessed in terms of reliable and valid measures of depression, sense of competence, self-esteem, and personal control. The adolescents' psychological adjustment was based on reliable and valid measures of sense of competence and self-esteem, and a measure of personal control. The mothers' perceived social competence was found to be significantly and positively related to the adolescents' perceived self-esteem (r (20) = .57, p = .00) and scholastic competence (r (20) = .40, p = .04), based on a one-way Pearson correlational analysis. The mothers' depression also was significantly and positively related to the adolescents' behavioural competence (r (20) = .38, p = .05) and approached significance in relationship to the adolescents' perceived poor levels of social acceptance (r (20) = -.33, p = .08). The study findings suggest significant relationships between the mothers' perceptions of their social competence and the adolescents' perceptions of their self-esteem and scholastic competence, and between the mothers' depression and the adolescents' behavioural competence after separation and divorce. The discussion of these findings raise a number of issues pertinent to separated and divorced families with adolescents.

We studied 10 polymorphisms, in the following 9 genes, which have previously been implicated in the development of IHD and/or ischemic stroke: angiotensinogen (M235T), angiotensin-converting enzyme (287 by I/D), angiotensin II type I receptor (A1166C), coagulating factor V (Leiden mutation), platelet glycoprotein IIIa (PLA1/PLA2 alleles), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (4G/5G), apolipoprotein E (E2, E3, and E4 isoforms), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C677T), and stromelysin-1 (5A/6A). In the first study, we investigated the relationship between the gene variants listed above and 150 IHD patients and 113 controls, who matched on age, gender, and ethnic background. In the second study, we investigated the relationship between these same genetic variants and 97 French-Canadians with cerebrovascular disease (59 ischemic strokes, 38 TIAs) and 134 age and gender matched French-Canadian controls.

Basin runoff was generated by groundwater discharge at the peatland margin, and groundwater discharge was controlled by hydraulic gradients and horizontal hydraulic conductivities (Kh). Flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measured at the basin outflow was 8.3 g C m-2 yr-1 and compared to within 23% of DOC flux estimated using a Dupuit approximation of seepage during the ice-free season. Annual DOC flux was 11% of the annual carbon sink. Flownet analysis showed that seasonal patterns of groundwater flow were controlled by boundary condition changes that resulted from precipitation and evapotranspiration events. A pattern of recharge was most common over the hydrological year, but a discharge pattern was observed during a 40 day groundwater flow reversal. Evaluation of the peatland recharge-discharge function using in situ sodium concentrations and a diffusion model revealed that the peatland is a long-term recharge system. It is hypothesized that peatland biogeochemical function is controlled by long-term recharge despite annual occurrence of groundwater flow reversals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roulet, Nigel T.

There was an initial decrease in dry matter intake by the heifers fed the negative dietary cation-anion difference. However this difference was not significant by the end of the two week period. It is unclear whether the reduced dry matter intake in the heifers fed the negative dietary cation-anion difference is the result of metabolic-acidosis caused by the anionic salts, poor palatability of the anionic salts or a combination of both. Heifers were induced into a nervous ketosis by feeding 1,3-butanediol. There was no difference in the incidence of ketosis between animals fed positive and negative dietary cation-anion difference.

One of the temperature-varying constituents of tissue is the change which occurs in the hydrogen-bound states of water. As the temperature is raised, there is an exchange of water species from the hydrogen-bound to non-hydrogen bonding. The aim of this thesis is to determine tissue temperature from NIR spectral profiles of tissue as temperature is increased. A NIR probe was used to obtain spectral profiles for a series of tissue measurements. Using the data sets obtained, in-vitro measurements conducted on bovine lung tissues show that temperature can be measured to 1.0°C. Likewise, in-vivo measurements conducted on the human finger also show that temperature can be measured to 2.1°C precision. These measurements suggest that tissue temperature can be measured in living systems using NIR temperature detection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burns, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795955h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j074v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biophysics, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52j9810"><dcterms:title>An instrument for studying the response of STACEE camera components to different lighting conditions /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fortin, Pascal.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes a new instrument used to study the response of the STACEE camera to different lighting conditions.

The authorities overseeing emission control in the vicinity of aluminum smelters have selected 15 to 20 PAHs for monitoring. To avoid having to analyze such a large number of compounds, a single PAH is usually selected as an indicator of overall PAH exposure. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) has been used for many years for this purpose despite the fact that it is not stable under environmental conditions, and as such is a poor choice as an indicator. The goal of this study was to confirm, with a new approach, that BaP is a poor choice, and to select an alternative to it as indicator for PAH exposure in the vicinity of aluminum smelters. The results obtained during sampling campaigns at two different sites showed that indeed, BaP is a poor choice as indicator.

Knowing that apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are the two main functions of p53, the objective of this project was to determine the difference in the capacity of these allelic variants of p53 to induce apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest in two different experimental model systems. The first experimental system was composed of non-transformed 10(1) cells and the second one was transformed Saos-2 cells. In the first experimental system, the two wildtype forms of p53 induced cell cycle arrest at the same level and did not induce apoptosis. On the other hand, in transformed cells, both p53Arg and p53Pro induced apoptosis at similar levels. No cell cycle arrest activity has been detected in Saos-2 cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that the induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depends more on the cell type than on the type of the p53 protein. Also, the intensity of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis is independent of which allelic variant of p53 is present under the experimental conditions used in this study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Matlashewski, Greg (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p9004.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967557n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Apoptosis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell cycle.</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA-binding proteins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>p53 antioncogene.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128ng55n"><dcterms:title>The physical oceanography of waters under the North Water Polynya /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bâcle, Julie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The North Water (NOW) is one of the largest polynyas in the Northern Hemisphere, occupying Smith Sound and the northern part of Baffin Bay, between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. While it has long been held that the North Water maintains itself by a southward drift of ice caused by winds and currents, the role of warm water advection by the West Greenland Current (WGC) is still heavily debated. Over 400 hydrographic CTD stations from the 1997 and 1998 NOW field programs were analysed using theta-S diagrams, property contouring and conservative property tracing in order to better understand the different water mass structures underlying the polynya, as well as their circulation and interaction. These data portray the North Water to be a crossroad in the Arctic Ocean, owing its complexity to the interaction of imported dissimilar water masses over a particularly influential terrain. Seasonal heat and freshwater budgets were also presented based on a volumetric theta-S census of the polynya domain and an elaboration of Muench's (1971) water mass definitions for northern Baffin Bay.

In radiation dosimetry calculations, many functions are employed to achieve this goal, and the Peak Scatter Factor (PSF) is one of the fundamental functions used in dosimetry. A brief background of some of the basic physics employed in external beam radiotherapy is given, illustrating some of the applications of the PSF in dosimetry. Also, the evolution of the definition of the PSF is discussed by presenting the PSF definitions quoted in several dosimetric references. In addition, concerns debated among physicists regarding the consistency of tabulated values of the PSF in dosimetric references with the definition of the PSF are presented. A practical method for measuring the PSF for megavoltage photon beams is developed. The method is applied to Co-60, 6 MV, 10 MV, and 18 MV photon beams using water, polytyrene, and solid water phantoms. The measured PSFs are compared to tabulated PSF and Normalized Peak Scatter Factors (NPSF) published in the British Journal of Radiology (BJR), supplement 25.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorsak, Erwin B.

From this observation, this thesis concludes that policy initiatives to establish international substantive competition rules are both desirable and feasible. They are desirable because they would avoid international trade disputes deriving from conflicting implementations of trade and competition policies. They are feasible trough the application of a methodology which balances efficiency, fairness and social objectives. Such a methodology is proposed by the author for the determination of common substantive competition rules. This set of proposals identifies changes that would be acceptable to most national participants in world trade and classifies trade practices into three categories: First, the trade practices prohibited per se, for which international standards can be reached in a short time; second, the trade practices examined under a rule-of-reason approach for which some common standards seem obtainable only in a mid-term frame given the existing divergent antitrust philosophies; third, international mergers and antidumping laws for which, given the strong industrial policy considerations, international substantive rules are not likely to emerge in the foreseeable future. Finally, as practical illustration, this thesis explores the long-run potential for replacing anti-competitive aspects of current antidumping laws with more efficient and more equitable competition-policy safeguards. The substitution of the international price discrimination standard commonly applied in antidumping review by the predatory pricing standard favoured under antitrust investigations can be achieved through the introduction of two criteria: determination of the "impact on the domestic economy, as a whole" and calculation of the variable cost standard.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c241r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634567f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Competition, Unfair.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition, International.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antitrust law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj38608797"><dcterms:title>Use of economic sanctions under international law : a contemporary assessment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Majlessi, M.

This thesis is an attempt to explore, from a legal point of view, the problems and restrictions associated with sanctions, and suggest ways in which economic sanctions can be rendered more legitimate in terms of international legal requirements. Unilateral and collective economic sanctions are based on different legal premises: the traditional theory of retaliation and treaty principles respectively. It will be argued that a breach of an erga omnes obligation is also a legitimate legal basis for economic sanctions. Key cases in which sanctions have been used will be reviewed and it will be contended that, in addition to traditional economic considerations, sanctions should be subject to other limitations such as respect for principles of international humanitarian law. Issues regarding the legitimacy of the Security Council's actions and authority will also be addressed and possible ways of controlling the actions of the Security Council will be put forth. After determining the restrictions on implementation of sanctions, proposals for refining current practices of imposing economic sanctions are submitted. In conclusion, it is submitted that unilateral sanctions are subject to serious legal constraints and that collective sanctions have the potential of being used in a more humane and institutionally coherent way.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, S.

This issue has been left open by the Supreme Court of Canada in the seminal case of Delgamuukw. The nature of aboriginal and treaty rights as well as the fiduciary relationship and duties of the Crown are briefly described. The basic constitutional context in which these rights evolve is also discussed, including the federal common law of aboriginal rights and the constitutional position of these rights in Canada. Having set the general context, the paper then reviews the legal principles governing the infringement of aboriginal and treaty rights, including the requirement for just compensation. Reviews of the legal principles applicable to compensation in cases of expropriation and of the experience in the United States in regards to compensation in cases of the taking of aboriginal lands are also carried out. Six basic legal principles relevant for determining appropriate compensation in cases of infringement to aboriginal and treaty rights are then suggested, justified and explained.

It was expected that the entry of investors and capital from abroad would aid in the strengthening of domestic intermediaries and would bolster the efficiency and depth of the markets in Mexico. In order to allow the entry of foreign investments, substantial amendments and additions to financial regulations have taken place within a relatively short period of time. Investment in domestic institutions is now open to foreign participants, irrespective of the country of origin. However, access to the Mexican markets through wholly owned subsidiaries is limited to investors from countries that have executed financial treaties with Mexico. This is the case of investors from the NAFTA countries. A number of reputable intermediaries worldwide have entered the Mexican markets. Nevertheless, the extent of the commitment to Mexican investments is limited by political, economical and legal concerns. It is expected that policies towards more open financial markets will continue to shape the actions of the Mexican government in the future.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevens, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n305h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pj22j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Investments, Foreign -- Mexico.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Investments, Foreign -- Law and legislation -- Mexico.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Investments, Foreign -- Government policy -- Mexico.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v043t"><dcterms:title>Creditor's use of the oppression remedy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Frank, Robert, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines creditors' use of the oppression remedy under the Canada Business Corporations Act and its provincial equivalents from historical and critical perspectives, assesses the consequences of the increasing willingness of Canadian courts to make the remedy available to creditors and concludes by offering some solutions to the problems that are identified. Part I traces the historical development of the oppression remedy, first in the United Kingdom and then in common law Canada. Next, the current state of the law relating to the oppression remedy is briefly examined, followed by a review of recent developments with respect to the use of the oppression remedy by creditors. Part II is a critical review of the evolving law with respect to creditors' use of the oppression remedy. This part of the thesis focuses on: (i) the relationship and potential conflict between the oppression remedy and other available remedies; and (ii) the impact of creditors' uses of the oppression remedy on the relationship between the corporation and its other stakeholders, including issues of shareholders' and directors' liability. In Part III, it is argued that the present use of the oppression remedy by creditors is not being developed in a coherent and principled manner. Certain guidelines are offered to provide the courts with reasonable controls on and principles to guide the use of the oppression remedy by creditors. In particular, it is argued that the oppression remedy should not be available to creditors when there are, either under corporate legislation or other, general legislation, appropriate remedies already available. The result would be that the oppression remedy should be available to creditors only in the limited category of cases where the creditor has no other effective remedy and the conditions for the use of the oppression remedy are met.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Swan, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515q29q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v043t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Debtor and creditor -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remedies (Law) -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stockholders -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corporation law -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bd55g"><dcterms:title>Women (Re)incorporated : a thesis examining the application of feminist theory to corporate structures and the legal framework of corporate law</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Egan, Sara Patricia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis is about the re-incorporation of women, on feminist terms, in corporate law and structure.

First, European Union law will be presented followed by the law of England and that of Germany. Second, the law of the United States and that of the two Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec will be discussed. While business-to-business contracts will easily retain the biggest volume share of international trade, the number of international business-to-individuals contracts will increase manifold thanks to the Internet. It is therefore important to take into account what impact consumer protection rules have on the private international law of contracts on the Internet. In this paper, relevant law of North American and European jurisdictions will be examined with regards to issues of contract formation, choice of jurisdiction and choice of law. On the basis of the findings, the thesis will finish with some suggestions as to what commercial entities have to pay attention to when they want to sell on the Internet.
