Three rock types are represented. They are, from lower to upper parts of the sills, metapyroxenite, metadiabase, and diabase-pegmatite. Comparison is made with “metadiorite” and “metagabbro” sills in an adjoining area. Chemical and planimetric analyses show that layering of the sills is the result of magmatic differentiation which is characterized by iron-enrichment. The metadiabase sills are similar to the intrusive phase of plateau-type basaltic magma in chemical composition and in trend of differentiation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kranck, E.

Bark is one of the major waste products of the pulp and paper industry. Although there are uses for minor amounts of certain species of bark, and a good deal is used as fuel on the west coast, bark in general constitutes a major disposal problem. White Spruce was chosen for the present study since it is one of the more important by-product barks in eastern Canada. The object of the work was to separate and identify as many individual chemical constituents of the bark as possible, and to find whether or not valuable materials were present in sufficient amounts to justify their isolation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

The increasing accumulation of life insurance gives evidence to the deep seated desire and to the search for economic security. One of the major twentieth-century objectives of labour unions, especially since the thirties, has been the economic security of wage earners and, consequently, in most industrial economies of today, Old Age Pension, Health and Welfare, Unemployment Compensation, and several other fringe benefit programmes have become firmly established measures for ensuring a greater degree of economic security to the industrial worker.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woods, H.

This type of x-ray spectrometer is the latest step in the evolution of energy measurement using crystal diffraction. Starting with the famous work of von Laue this method was further developed by Bragg in his single and double crystal spectrometers. During this time de Broglie, Gouy and Darbord suggested the possibility of curving a crystal to obtain focusing. But the first workable idea was advanced by Dumond and Kirkpatrick and the first two working models were built independently by Johann and Cauchois who used the same principle, in slightly different form, of focusing by a curved crystal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

Within a layer the carbon atoms are arranged in a continuous hexagonal array, each atom having three nearest neighbors at a distance of 1.42 A°. The distance between adjacent layers, on the other hand, is 3.3'/ A°. The interaction between the layers is thus very weak, a fact which results in large anisotropies in the properties of graphite. Thus the magnetic susceptibilities parallel and perpendicular to the graphite planes differ by a factor of 40, and the electrical conductivities in these directions differ by a factor of 10^4- 10^5.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, P.

Toute expérience religieuse vraie serait de nature mystique. Dans une première partie nous essayons d'établir cette définition très large du mysticisme. Après avoir distingué rapidement entre mysticisme philosophique et mysticisme chrétien, nous donnons les caractères marquant de ce dernier.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg85h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x2891</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Divinity.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nv54h"><dcterms:title>The social and political theories of Edward Hallett Carr.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1957</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Geist, Paul.

Since Carr is not the ivory-tower social philosopher, but very often descends into the arenas of journalism and radio, reaching a very wide audience, his views contribute to some extent to the moulding of British public opinion. During several debates in the British House of Commons his views were adduced as authoritative in support of post-war planning.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brecher, M.

Une telle situation se réflète dans le domaine de l’aviation civile où les droits essentiels à l’exploitation du transport aérien sont échangés sur une base bilatérale ou octroyés par des autorisations d’exploitation. Ceci permet aux États de proportionner l’octroi des droits de trafic à la sauvegarde des intérêts légitimes de leurs compagnies nationales.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pépin, E.

The early subsequent work was concerned mostly with gonadotropins secreted in large amounts by the human placenta. Pituitary gonadotropins, however, occur in much smaller amounts in human urine. They therefore must be concentrated from urine in order to be demonstrable by bioassay methods. The concentration of urinary extract, in turn, requires detoxification in order to allow the laboratory animals to survive several injections.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Venning, E.

This instrument, far from having been relegated to a museum shelf, is still indispensable in nuclear Physics laboratories. This is due to the unique amount of direct information which a single cloud chamber photograph can yield about a disintegration process. A cloud chamber has been in use at this university since the earliest days of the Radiation Laboratory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Terroux, F.

Calculated contours of constant phase and of constant intensity are presented in normalized coordinates independent of system geometry. For a particular lens system these contours are shown in physical coordinates and a comparison is made with corresponding phase contours measured at a wavelength of 3.2 cm. using a solid-dielectric lens. Results are shown of very detailed calculations and measurements made in the vicinity of certain interesting regions including the axis of the system and the intensity zeroes of the "focal plane". It is demonstrated that over most of the image space scalar Kirchhoff diffraction theory can be used to predict the phase near the focus of a microwave lens.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.
