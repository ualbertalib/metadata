These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that GABA$ rm sb{B}$ receptors in the NTS modulate the vagally mediated cardiorespiratory reflexes. Experiments were conducted on 53 spontaneously breathing, urethane-anesthetized (1.2-1.6 g/kg) and atropinized (0.2 mg/kg) rats. Tracheal pressure, tidal volume, mean arterial blood pressure, and the integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram (DiEMG) were recorded. The medulla was prepared for bilateral NTS injection of 110 nl of saline (vehicle), and 60 pmol baclofen, and 2.8 nmol CGP35348, a GABA$ rm sb{B}$ receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively. Injection sites were confirmed histologically. Results support the hypothesis, but suggest that the cardiorespiratory pattern and the vagally mediated reflexes are not tonically controlled by GABA$ rm sb{B}$ receptors under the present conditions. The different effects of baclofen on inspiratory time and expiratory time suggest a difference in the distribution of GABA$ rm sb{B}$ receptors in neuronal networks controlling each of these respiratory phases.

Fusion plasmids of luciferase and the 5$ sp prime$ flanking region of the human ET sc A gene were transfected into rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A10), primary cultures of porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (PSMC), a pluripotential embryonal cell (P19) induced to differentiate to a myocyte lineage, and COS7 cells. Binding studies showed no ET receptors in COS7 while the others expressed high levels of ET sc A. Mock transfected cells expressed negligible levels of luciferase activity (RLU). Transfection with the region $-$848 to +92 bp of ETA (relative to transcriptional initiation) resulted in several hundred fold increase in activity with the highest levels seen in cells expressing ET sc A (Mean $ pm$ SEM: PSMC = 4748 $ pm$ 521 RLU, A10 = 6670 $ pm$ 304 RLU, COS7 = 1268 $ pm$ 212; PSMC vs. COS7 p = 0.0035, A10 vs. COS7 p = 0.001). Deletion from $-$848 to $-$625 (including a CARG box) resulted in a 20-60% loss of promoter activity (p = 0.01). Further deletions to $-$116 increased activity 2 fold (p = 0.05) suggesting the presence of a weak negative regulatory element. Two strong positive regulatory elements: the first one whose deletion led to a loss of 80% of promoter activity, was identified between $-$116 and $-$38; and the second one was identified between +90 and +200 in an area which exhibited $&gt;$80% homology between the human and the murine gene. In conclusion: (1) The region between $-$848 bp and +92 bp of the human ET sc A directs the expression of a reporter gene to significantly higher levels in myocytes normally expressing the receptor compared to non-expressing cells, (2) weak negative and strong positive regulatory cis-acting elements have been identified in this region.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Magder, S.

Age structures, growth, and mutilation rates were compared between an agricultural population and a reference site in an undisturbed forest. Turtles in the 0-4 year age class were absent from samples taken at the agricultural site. Overall, 23% less juveniles were encountered at the agricultural site. In addition, relatively fewer adults were captured from the 20+ age class. Shell injuries were twice as common at the agricultural site when compared to the forest site; whereas, limb amputations were twice as frequent at the forest site. Although shell injuries inflicted by predators occurred with similar frequencies at both sites, there were 2.7 times more fractures resulting from anthropogenic sources at the agricultural site. Multiple limb loss occurred only at the forest site. Tail amputations occurred with similar frequencies at both sites. Casts of pleural scute annuli revealed that turtles at the agricultural site had significantly lower growth rates during their second decade of life. Females at the forest site were significantly larger for all measurements recorded; whereas, males differed only with respect to carapace and plastron lengths. Agricultural development may have resulted in reduced growth, recruitment, and predation rates, as well as increased adult mortality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bider, J.

Combining features from relational as well as object-oriented database systems, our data model is efficient for queries involving multiple access patterns. By maintaining symmetrical relationships between entities, we allow nesting to be formulated dynamically at the query level rather than the data model level, thus dissociating the data structure from the access method. In addition, we do not favor one access pattern over another by clustering data in one particular manner, giving therefore flexibility and performance to our system. In order to integrate nesting into the relational algebra, we propose an extension to Relix, which is an academic database management system. We then show how those modifications can be used in a wide variety of queries, provide an algorithm to translate nested queries into flat relational expressions, and finally show that similar improvements can be applied to SQL allowing nested queries to be expressed more naturally.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, Timothy H.

Immunofluorescent staining of transfected epithelial cells was carried out to demonstrate that constructs created for use in these HSV-based approaches were capable of a high level of expression of RIIA-myc. Measurements of $ beta$-galactosidase reporter gene expression observed in cultured cells infected with RIIA amplicon virus suggested successful packaging of amplicon DNA.

The input of such a system is the contour map of the region to be visualized. Several approaches to solve this problem can be found in the literature. Our approach is based on surface reconstruction or interpolation. We achieve the reconstruction of the terrain surface by pairwise triangulation of map contours in adjacent height levels. The large data size in this application dictated the use of an optimal triangulation algorithm. The algorithm we employed (by G. Toussaint) runs in $O(n(1+t sb0)$ time with $t sb0&lt;n$ (where n is the number of vertices of the polygon being triangulated, and $t sb0$ is a measure related to the shape complexity of the polygon). Also, we implemented several data processing steps to convert the map data from its original ASCII based format into a format that facilitates the application of the triangulation algorithm. Moreover, we employed line generalization techniques to get rid of redundant data and reduce its size. The output of the triangulation is a polyhedral terrain ready for visualization. Finally, we present an efficient output sensitive hidden-line removal algorithm (by Preparata and Vitter) designed specifically for terrain visualization. This algorithm is the final component of our terrain visualization system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, Timothy H.

Most notably, homozygotes have an increased rate of spina bifida with or without exencephaly. Retinoic acid (RA), which has been shown to be very important in the development of a number of systems, was shown to cause a selective mortality of the homozygous splotch embryos when administered maternally at day 9 p.c.

Since cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) is localized to the tissues which are affected by both the splotch gene, and retinoic acid teratogenesis, its expression patterns in the developing splotch embryo were examined. It was found that the distribution of CRABP mRNA is normal, but its expression levels are excessive in splotch homozygous day 9 mouse embryos.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trasler, D. G.

Commercial (small mesh) traps caught significantly more fish (by number and weight), caught significantly smaller fish, and caught a higher proportion of immature fish, than large mesh traps. Fishing power was significantly higher for commercial traps than for large mesh traps. These catch differences between trap types have serious implications for the management of the reef fish resource by the imposition of larger mesh sizes in the commercial fishery. The squeezability hypothesis and the visual image hypothesis were investigated as explanations for the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. The lower fishing power of large mesh traps results primarily from lower catch rates of fish in the 5.5-6.0 cm body depth size class. This result is strong support for the squeezability hypothesis as an explanation for the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. Differences in the visual images of traps created by structural differences and biotic differences did not produce definitive differences in ingress rates to traps, suggesting that the visual image hypothesis is an inadequate explanation for the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. The trappability of reef fish differed substantially between species, but trappability differences were not correlated with species mobility, activity of the species in traps, gregariousness, or capacity of the species to squeeze through meshes. Predator-prey effects on trappability were negligible, but trappability was negatively correlated with percent reef cover of the substratum and with substratum rugosity. This suggests that traps are more attractive to fishes in areas where natural structural complexity is lower.

To achieve a high spatial resolution, the crystal blocks have been finely pixelated using a diamond saw. In each detector, 36 x 36 1.9mm x 1.9mm crystal elements are coupled directly to the PMT window and, on the opposite face of the blocks, 35 x 35 elements are offset by 0.9mm along both the x- and y-axes of the PMT. Techniques developed for the successful machining and surface-preparation of the detector blocks are described. Results indicating the detector block performance in terms of spatial and energy resolution are presented. As part of a system calibration routine, a novel method for crystal element identification has been developed. This robust and reproducible algorithm succeeds in identifying 59 x 49 crystal elements on each detector face. The results are used to generate a Look-Up-Table (LUT) that is accessed during data acquisition for the effective correction of spatial distortion inherent in the detectors. Crystal identification also facilitates an improvement of the capability for accurate energy discrimination, since the detector gain and energy resolution are considered on an element-by-element basis by accessing an energy LUT. Employing a third LUT, which contains the relative efficiencies of individual crystal elements results in a significant improvement in detector uniformity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, C.

This thesis presents the results of research performed to determine whether the MAP technique can be further developed into a large-scale soil treatment process that overcomes the limitations of conventional remediation technologies. The dielectric properties of several mixtures of acetone and hexane over a temperature range from 25$ sp circ$C to 50$ sp circ$C were measured. The dielectric constants of these mixtures were found not to vary significantly with temperature. A study of microwave absorption by heterogeneous mixtures showed that adding a solid material to a low dielectric constant solvent resulted in energy being preferentially absorbed by the solid. The results of laboratory extraction tests showed that the ability of the MAP technique to extract contaminants was affected by the organic matter content of soil, particularly in the presence of water. Use of a closed-vessel system yielded a 60% to 175% increase in the extraction of PAHs from a low organic-content soil relative to that achieved in an open-vessel system.

The main two subjects of this thesis are: (1) the origin of the peak and (2) a detailed investigation of the anisotropy. In order to investigate the relative contribution of electrons and phonons to the heat conduction in YBCO, we have measured the thermal and electrical conductivities of high-quality twinned and detwinned crystals, with different levels of Zn-doping (from 0% to 3%). We found that the peak was rapidly suppressed by the impurities. Two scenarios are used to explain our results, attributing the effect to decrease in the carrier mean free path of either the electrons or the phonons. As for the anisotropy between the a-axis and the b-axis, only two previous studies had previously been done. We find some new striking features: (1) a peak appears in $ kappa sb{chain}$ below 50 K, revealed as a result of our using of higher purity samples.

Auditory and visual presentation, vocal and picture-pointing recall, and concurrent articulation conditions were included. Nonword recall was evaluated using stimuli varied in SL and PS was also evaluated using a repetition task. Word length effects were found for word stimuli varied in SL but were absent or reversed for stimuli varied in AD. A non-articulatory basis for rehearsal is suggested. The influence of long-term semantic and lexical knowledge in recall is inconclusive due to a lack of SR.

The strongest MHC-linked determinants of disease susceptibility have been associated with polymorphisms in both the $ alpha$ and $ beta$ chain subunits of HLA-DQ (human) and I-A (mouse) class II molecules. Specifically, protection against IDDM development is associated with the presence of aspartic acid at position 57 of the $ beta$ chain while non-aspartic acid residues are found in diabetogenic $ beta$ chains. In humans, the greatest risk of disease development is observed in individuals with Arg 52$ rm sp+ alpha/Asp 57 sp- beta$ heterodimers. The BB rat is a useful system in which one can identify and characterize the genes necessary for the onset of IDDM. Although sequence data have been reported for various alleles of these class II genes, the effect of polymorphisms in the rat MHC is not nearly as well characterized as it is in humans or the NOD mouse. The rat MHC (RT1) contains two expressed class II loci, RT1.B and RT1.D, each encoding two class II molecules: RT1.B $ alpha$ and $ beta,$ and RT1.D $ alpha$ and $ beta.$ This study determined the nucleotide sequences of relevant regions from the RT1.B and RT1.D $ alpha/ beta$ genes in five rat strains (ACI, BB, Buffalo, Lewis, and Wistar-Furth) of varying susceptibility to IDDM to examine the role of specific polymorphisms in predisposition to disease. The data show that BB and Wistar-Furth rats (RT1$ sp{ rm u}$ haplotype) have identical class II sequences at all of the regions examined. Although no unique $ alpha$ chain sequences were found to associate with IDDM, we did confirm the association of aspartic acid at position 57 of RT1.B$ beta$ with susceptibility to diabetes.

Soil was analyzed to determine the concentration of various soil nutrients, pH, and bulk density. It was found that trees from downtown Montreal grow in soils with lower phosphorus and magnesium, and higher copper, zinc, sodium, pH and bulk density than nursery trees. Downtown tree health, in terms of % dieback, was positively correlated with soil phosphorus, potassium, calcium, the phosphorus:copper ratio and negatively correlated with soil copper, zinc, bulk density and tree age. It is suggested that tree health and survival are associated with tree location. Older and healthier trees grow on streets that provide larger soil volumes. Downtown trees had significantly higher VAM colonization levels (44.9%) than those from the nursery (36.1%). The colonization level in downtown trees was positively correlated with the phosphorus:copper ratio and tree age, and negatively correlated with soil potassium. It is hypothesized that downtown trees living under the most stress will be those with the highest VAM colonization. Under controlled conditions 81.5% of the variability of % VAM infection of silver maple seedlings could be explained by soil zinc, phosphorus, copper, sodium, and potassium. Zinc, phosphorus and copper negatively affected VAM colonization, while a slight positive effect of sodium and potassium was found. This suggests that VAM colonization in downtown trees may be affected by soil factors, but the effects may be masked by other conditions, such as water stress, light, or size of root systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamel, Chantal (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Cote, Benoit (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676x728.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rq692</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant-fungus relationships -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maple -- Soils -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maple -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees in cities -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jt18p"><dcterms:title>Hydrologic modeling of an agricultural watershed in Quebec using AGNPS</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Perrone, Jim T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A research study was undertaken to determine the predictive capability of the AGNPS model with respect to surface runoff, peak flow, and sediment yield produced by rainfall-runoff events on a 26 km$ sp2$ watershed in Quebec. Precipitation, stream discharge, surface runoff, and suspended sediment concentrations were monitored for rainfall-runoff events occurring from 1994-96, inclusive. Data describing stream patterns, topography, soil type, and land use were collected and input to the model. Seven rainfall-runoff events were used for model calibration. Five storms were used to validate the model. Calibration curves were developed to correlate the antecedent precipitation index (API) to the SCS curve number. For model calibration, coefficients of performance of 0.05, 0.43, and 0.12 were obtained for surface runoff, sediment yield, and peak flow, respectively. For model validation, coefficients of performance (CP$ rm sp prime sb{A}$) of 0.02, and 0.01 were obtained for surface runoff, and sediment yield, respectively. Peak flow was generally overpredicted and yielded a CP$ rm sp prime sb{A}$ of 2.07. A sensitivity analysis showed API and associated curve numbers to be the most sensitive input parameters. USLE factors were also sensitive. The surface condition parameter and Manning's n had negligible influence on model output. The hydrograph shape factor toggle parameter showed extreme sensitivity. A simulation of best management practices on the basin estimated soil loss reductions of 15 to 25% for storms of varying magnitudes if a 4-year crop rotation implementing conservation tillage were to be adopted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C.

To identify these genes, lac Z gene fusions were generated in a strain of E. coli whose own nlp gene had been interrupted by a luxAB tet insertion. Each clone within this gene fusion collection had the lac Z gene integrated into a random location on the E. coli chromosome. Clones in which the lac Z gene had inserted within a gene regulated by Nlp were predicted to have a different lac Z phenotype on X-gal plates depending on the presence or absence of Nlp expressed from a plasmid borne copy of the nlp gene. Of the 3360 clones screened, 5 were found to have an altered lac phenotype in the presence of Nlp. Three of these clones were found to have lac Z expression induced by Nlp, one was found to be repressed by Nlp, and one clone died upon Nlp expression. These putative Nlp-responsive genes were subcloned into pBR322 to facilitate their identification. Restriction map analysis, double stranded DNA sequencing and single stranded DNA sequencing were used to identify the Nlp responsive genes. Genes that responded to Nlp overexpression were: o80 ('glycosol hydrol F5'), plsB (which encodes a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase), cscB (which encodes a sucrose permease), pgi (which encodes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), and nuoF (which encodes the F subunit of NADH dehydrogenase).

They involved freezing of pork loin and fish using cryogenic freezing and stored at $-$18, $-$12 and $-$7$ sp circ$C, and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) of pork loin using a combination of nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases, chitosan dip and stored at 5, 10, and 15$ sp circ$C. A production plan with similar layout and capacity was adopted for the Montreal area. The benefit-cost analysis (BCA) of each project was carried out assuming that each plant operated approximately 2000 hours per annum at full capacity. Net present value (NPV) and benefit cost ratio (B/C ratio) at 8% discount rate, and internal rate of return (IRR) were determined for each project. The calculations show the NPV of $2.4 million, $1.8 million, and $3.4 million; B/C ratio of 1.09, 1.09, and 1.10; IRR of 15 %, 13 %, and 18 % for frozen pork loin, frozen fish and MAP pork respectively. All IRRs were higher compared to the 1995 return rates of TSE of 9.7 % and the average return of capital of 8.8 % for some food and beverage industries. These economic values are sensitive to changes in working hours, price of raw materials and finished products. It is also found that MAP products could be stored at temperatures up to 15$ sp circ$C. Frozen products could be stored at temperatures of $-$12$ sp circ$C and below only if the length of distribution chain can be reduced. This would decrease electricity costs up to 36% at each level of distribution. It can be concluded that the three projects are economically profitable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gunjal, Kisan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977x01v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx802</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fishery processing -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pork industry and trade -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishery products -- Preservation -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pork -- Preservation -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720f920"><dcterms:title>Recycling of agro-industrial food wastes into feed for Pekin duck meat production towards a sustainable agriculture in the province of Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Normand, Luc.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two experiments were carried out to assess the nutritional potential of food wastes to be transformed into duck meat.

In both experiments, the ducks receiving food wastes had significantly ($ rm P&lt;0.05$) more total body fat than did the control. This was most likely due to the quantity of dietary fat ingested by the ducks. The results reported in this thesis indicate that it is possible to raise Pekin ducks to market weight using food wastes as the only source of feed. To meet the consumer demand of leaner carcasses, the food wastes with a high fat content should be included in a limited amount in the ration. The recycling of industrial food wastes into animal products could be considered an important step toward a sustainable agriculture system in Quebec.

This construct enabled researchers to explore: "why are there so many different kinds of organizations?". In that, evolutionary influences and adaptive firm behaviour were simultaneous forces that shape the survival of organizational forms over time. Such a notion was applied towards a dynamic programming context. This dynamic programming model was translated into a computer simulation such that an empirical representation of firm evolution was depicted. The results from four computer simulations confirmed the selection and adaptation propositions described in this research. The simulations found evolutionary forces to be significant determinants to differentiating firm survival. While, adaptive firm behaviour only served to prolong organizational survivability with in the confines of the selection forces of the market. Future organizational research should focus on expanding the dimensions of strategic adaptation, strategic, voluntarism, niche width dynamics, organizational inertia theory and organizational slack. By addressing these areas, a more comprehensive depiction of organizational evolution could be attained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goldsmith, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Westgren, Randall (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b533t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dr543</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organizational change -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microeconomics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organizational behavior -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wj018"><dcterms:title>Invasion and migration of clusters in oral carcinomas within three-dimensional collagen matrices : the effects of blocking b1 and a2b1 integrin function</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Muradali, Sheri.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cellular adhesion interactions involved in invasion and migration are crucial to cancer metastasis. Neoplastic tissue explants were cultivated in three-dimensional collagen lattices and monitored for the detachment of coordinated locomoting tumor cell clusters. Blocking monoclonal antibody treatment (10ug/mL) against the $ beta sb1$ and $ alpha sb2 beta sb1$ integrin receptors on cluster surfaces allowed the functional evaluation of these receptors during metastatic invasion. Clusters in treated wells exhibited a loss in migratory persistence, reduction in cluster motility and a greater amount of "stops" during migration as compared to control wells for both anti-$ beta sb1$ and anti-$ alpha sb2 beta sb1$ respectively. These results suggest that $ beta sb1$ integrins, and more specifically, $ alpha sb2 beta sb1$ play a significant role in maintaining normal cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during metastatic invasion. Preliminary investigations using the anti-cancer drug, Taxol, against clusters within collagen matrices revealed a significant decrease in the total distance traveled, average speed and persistence, implicating its efficiency against certain cancers. The use of 3-D collagen systems for cell communication studies on locomoting tumor cell clusters may reveal novel and potentially important mechanisms involved in metastatic invasion as well as facilitate future assessment of potential anti-neoplastic drugs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Noble, P.

Analysis was based on data gathered on 599 rural and 567 urban children, as part of a research program on childhood asthma focussing on the impact of urbanization. Atopy was more frequent in urban than rural children (22.9% vs 14.7%). The unadjusted odds ratio for urban rural differences in atopy was 1.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.36. Urban children were also younger, taller, weighed more and were breastfed for shorter periods compared to rural children. They were also more likely to have a family history of allergic disease but were less likely to share their bed, use allergenic mattresses and live in homes with pets and smokers. When the urban rural differences were adjusted for these differences in the distribution of personal, environmental and socio economic characteristics, the odds ratio fell to 0.81 and became nonsignificant (95% CI 0.50 to 1.33). Therefore, the urban rural difference in the prevalence of atopy in Kenyan children appear to be due to the differences in the distribution of the relevant risk factors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Becklake, M.
