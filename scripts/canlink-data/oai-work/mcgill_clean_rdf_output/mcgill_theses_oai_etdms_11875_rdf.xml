Due to the increasing back-log of cases before the courts, it is feit that many of these differenees could be settled quickly, amiably, equitably and cheaply, if submitted to impartial arbitrators.

We consider the ways these patients make or fail to make the necessary adjustments, showing always the role the psychiatric social worker has taken, or might possibly have taken, In her help with these adjustments. The problem has been approached by considering the salient aspects of placement in as far as possible in the same order that a worker might approach one case referred for placement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Judkins, B.E.

This thesis lays no such claim. In effect it is a re-test of an experiment on visual perception conducted recently at Harvard University by J. Bruner and C. Goodman. Our justification for this deviation from tradition rests in our agreement with our Research Director that an experiment which formulates tests, and validates hypotheses which are of importance to a science is certainly worth repeating.

This system we shall term the "Hyperbolic Complex Numbers", due to their connection with the hyperbola and the hyperbolic functions. The purpose of this paper will be to develop the number theory properties of this system. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, W.
