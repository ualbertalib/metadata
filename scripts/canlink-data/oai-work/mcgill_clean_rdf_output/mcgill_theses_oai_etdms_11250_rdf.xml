The lag could not be reduced by supplementation with purines, pyrimidines or ashed trypticase soy broth. Subsequently, it was found that the addition to the medium of various sideramines (iron-transporting growth factors) shortened the lag phase and increased the total cell crop. The sideramine requirement could be replaced by a number of chelating agents. It is postulated that these chelating agents may play a role in iron transport. Sodium chloride (up to 0.1 M) stimulated growth of A. citreus, but the nature of this stimulation has not been investigated. The vitamins and amino acids required for optimal growth of A. citreus at 25° C have been determined to be thiamine, biotin, nicotinic acid, tyrosine, cystine, methionine and glutamic acid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, E.

Sand cultures involving the use of twenty-seven different nutrient solutions, including three levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and their various combinations, were used. Certain of these treatments were selected and subjected to continuous illumination. Yield records of tops, trimmed heads, and roots, based on green weight and oven-dried weight values, were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Observations on development of tipburn were examined. It was shown that increasing the nitrogen concentration produced increases in yield up to a critical level, beyond which a deleterious effect was noted. Over a wide range of concentrations, additional phosphorus gave continued increases in yield. Additional potassium did not have a significantly positive effect on yield. In the tipburn studies, high levels of nutrients encouraged burning. Nitrogen appears to be the most important single element. Practically all the burning took place in darkness. Abnormal respiration is offered as a possible explanation for the physiology of tipburn.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, H.

The minimum amount of biotin required for normal growth and morphology was found to be 0.08 - 0.4 mug/ml in a chemically-defined medium. Morphological changes associated with biotin-nutrition were followed by light and electron microscopy. The aberrant form consisted of several protoplasts within a thick matrix, quite unlike the single-celled form of the organism. The matrix may consist of unpolymerized cell wall precursors or components. These protoplasts appeared to develop from division in the absence of normal cell wall synthesis. Both cell types resisted Iysis by osmotic shock but the aberrant forms demonstrated greater resistance to destruction by sonication. This could be attributed to the external matrix which may absorb the shock of ultrasonic treatment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, E.

In wheat the germ is readily distinguished as the small wrinkled portion of the grain on the opposite side of the crease. It makes up about 1.2 percent of the weight of wheat. Structurally, the scutellum is closely associated with the germ, both being separated from the endosperm by a layer of compressed cells, the hyaline layer. The scutellum and embryo together make up about 2.7 percent of the weight of the wheat kernel (27). Bailey (7) reports 2.23 percent in hard wheat. The embryo consists essentially of a plumule and a radicle portion, which become the leaves and roots respectively, of the new plant. Many analyses of wheat germ are to be found in the literature. Frequently, however, the source of the germ is not specified, nor is the degree of contamination with non-germ portions of the wheat indicated. Dissection of the wheat manually would be the ideal method of preparing samples, but this has not generally been undertaken, although Hinton has resorted to this method (27). Germ as produced by ordinary methods of milling contains a certain amount of the scutellum. It is always contaminated with some bran, although this may be reduced to a relatively low figure by careful screening and aspirating. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

Le thème de l'histrion, visible depuis la période parnassienne (1862-66), exprime d'abord la crise centrale du mythe: "l'antagonisme de rêve chez l'homme avec les fatalités h son existence départies par le Malheur”. Le thème de l'orphelin, qui correspond à la période d'Igitur (1869), manifeste une volonté de dépassement de cet antagonisme. Le mythe ne pourrait exister sans cet espoir de dépassement. C'est pourquoi, enfin, le thème du théatre, exposé dans divers écritsh partir de 1886, vient suggérer la nécessité de fonder en réalité ce rêve d'Hamlet. Or au terme de cette dernière phase l'antagonisme du Rêve et du Hasard s'avère irréductible; tout espoir est vain, c'est ce que révèle le poème, Un coup de dés, qui annonce ainsi la fin du mythe.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, H.

Changes of many kinds affected the Church of England during this period. Regarding most of them I have nothing to say. I have deliberately restricted myself to changes in thought, and the subtitle of this thesis indicates its scope and purpose. I have said nothing about the organized life of the church, or about its government or liturgy. I have even avoided any mention of the change in the favoured style of preaching, though this is closely related to the thought of the Restoration period. I have not discussed the ways in which the ministry of the church was recruited, nor the question of the social position of its clergy. I have not attempted to assess the influence it exercised, though it is nearly a century since Macaulay pointed out that the pulpit was one of the formative of all forces moulding public opinion. The limitation to changes in thought has consequently been deliberate; only a self-imposed restriction of this kind could keep the study within manageable bounds. At the same time, it is necessary to point out that the thesis is not concerned with the history of religious thought in general, but only with those aspects of it wherein changes can clearly be discerned. Consequently, the relatively static forms of Anglican theology have been ignored. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adair, E.

For this purpose, a monkey lung fragment technique was modified to incorporate the use of suspensions of lung tissue for passive sensitization. Serum fractions prepared by DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-200 chromatography of ragweed allergic sera were compared by hemagglutinating, Prausnitz-Kustner (P-K) and in vitro monkey lung suspension techniques. The results demonstrated a close correlation between the results of assays by P-K and in vitro anaphylaxis techniques. No relationship was observed between hemagglutination and either of the biological assay methods. The results provided evidence that passive sensitization of monkey lung tissue was mediated by human reaginic antibodies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goodfriend, L.

Cette étude a été provoquée d’abord par un cours de stylistique qui attire l’attention sur la vie mouvante et changeante des langues modernes. On trouve intéressantes les différences de valeur de deux “synonymes” dans deux langues modernes, les expressions qui se disent dans une langue et pas dans une autre, les termes archaïques d’une langue qui sont usuels dans une autre -- tout cela pose la question de la connaissance de la langue étrangère que les traducteurs américains doivent posséder pour leur travail.

Part of the work discussed in the is study was to investigate this problem and to show whether or not the biological activity associated with rat brain tissue is due solely to acetylcholine. It was suggested that acetyl-I-carnitylcholine could play a role in nerve metalolism. The cholinergic potency of synthetic acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was measured on the guinea pig ileum preparation and it was found to be one half as active as acetyl choline when determined by two procedures (i) “one-point" assay (ii) "multipoint" assay. Moreover, the index of discrimination for acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was unity on the guinea pig ileum and frog rectus preparations (muscarinic and nicotinic respectively). The "multipoint" assay was used to determine the effects of mixtures of acetylcholine and acetyl-I-carnitylcholine on a biological assay and it was concluded that potentiation of the acetylcholine activity occurred when these two substances were combined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.

Cellulose, especially when associated with lignin, makes up the bulk of the common feedstuffs supplied to cattle in the form of hay, straw and grain. None of the mammals is known, however, to produce an enzyme that will change cellulose and lignin into soluble compounds, but among the microbial associates of many animals are found, in some parts of the digestive tract, forms that can produce enzymes that attack these substances and prepare them for absorption through the blood stream. The close relationship existing between ruminant digestion and bacterial activity gives a strong indication that the nutrition of the ruminant animal is vitally linked with various products derived from bacterial metabolism. [...]The questions of prime interest [...]: 1. What are the agents responsible for the cellulose decomposition in the rumen? 2. What is their mode of action? 3. What are the end-products derived from their action? 4. Of what use to the ruminant animal is the cellulose attacked by the bacteria of the rumen? It is only with the elucidation of these problems that advances will be made in the field of ruminant nutrition and in the full appreciation of the important role played by the microflora of the rumen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray, P.

The results have been compared with those obtained using frozen tissue sections, and advantages and disadvantages of the methods discussed. Enzymes investigated were, adenosine triphosphatase, succinic and lactic dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and the cholinesterases. Because of the question of false localization, particularly at the node of Ranvier, two different histochemical methods were used (and compared) for acid phosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase, and some new observations of enzyme, activity in this area have been discussed. It has been concluded that the microdissection method is a particularly useful technique for peripheral nerve enzyme histochemistry, and some further possible applications of the method have been suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blennerhassett, J.

Sixty full term Wistar rats spontaneously delivered from 12 mothers were used, forty were given intraperitoneal injections of either 5% or 20% glucose at birth and at 2 hourly intervals up to 12 hours; the remaining animals served as controls. They were killed in groups at birth or at 6 to 12 hours postnatally. Liver tissue was obtained for electron microscopy and for chemical determinations of glycogen. In untreated controls the enormous hepatic glycogen store present at birth were almost totally mobilized by 12 hours. In treated rats the glycogen stores persisted and appeared undisturbed electron microscopically. The large increase in endoplasmic reticulum and in Golgi zones seen in controls was not observed in treated rats. Cytolysome formation was delayed. The hepatic fine structure of glucose treated rats at 6 and 12 hours was almost identical to that seen in normal rats at birth. Glucose administration results not only in the persistence of large hepatic glycogen stores but delays the normal developmental changes in the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles as well.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Phillips, M.

A sociometric test was given to 40 boys and 49 girls, who comprised three multiracial groups - Cubs and Brownies. This test was designed to show the degree of social interaction among racial subgroups. Results showed that the boys’ group tended toward racial self-preference; whereas, the girls' choices were fairly well distributed, although most were directed to the most prestigious subgroup. The mothers of these children (N=68) were also interviewed to elicit their views on Trinidadian race relations. Three major findings emerged: (1) the urban situation has tended to erase the acute rivalry among racial groups which may still exist in the rural areas; (2) politics in recent years have increased the rift between the East Indians and the Negroes, and between the Whites and the Negroes; (3) within all the racial categories, social class is a more important variable than racial origin in influencing interpersonal interaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henry, F.
