Metastatic prostate adenocarcinomas are associated with high mortality rates and represent a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among males. To study the host-tumor interactions underlying the predilection of prostate cancer cells for skeletal bone, an experimental model was developed using rat Dunning carcinoma Mat-LyLu cells. Inoculations of these cells into the left ventricle of the heart led to the development of spinal metastases in 100% of inoculated animals. A subline of Mat-LyLu (Mat-LyLu-B5) was subsequently selected through sequential inoculation of bone marrow derived carcinoma cells into the left ventricle of the heart and was found to have an increased metastatic potential compared to the parental line. The possible role of tumor cell adhesion to host cells in the process of bone marrow colonization was then investigated in vitro using the metastatic line and primary cultures of rat bone marrow-derived stromal cells. It was found that the adhesion of the metastatic Mat-LyLu cells to a bone marrow stromal cell culture highly enriched for endothelial cells (BMEC) was significantly higher than the adhesion to other bone-derived cells including non-endothelial BM stromal cells (3x) and osteoblasts (1.4x). It was also significantly higher than the adhesion to rat fibroblasts (5.5x) and to hepatic endothelial cells (7x). The results suggest that the adhesion of prostate carcinoma cells to the bone marrow endothelium may play a role in their metastasis to bone.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brodt, Pnina (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sb413.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xz525</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn107025x"><dcterms:title>Low income rental housing in Canada : policies, programs and livability</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fung, Annie H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The government has through many legislations initiated programs to provide housing for those who cannot afford housing in the private market. From 1945, the government has continuously tried to fulfill those housing needs and to improve living conditions. This thesis is an overview of the policies, programs and livability of low rental housing in Canada. This study is divided into three parts. In the first part, there is a factual description of the circumstances and policies that have influenced the development of low rental housing since 1945. The second part assesses the demand and tenant characteristics for such housing. Three types of low income housing: public housing, low rental housing and cooperatives, are compared to measure their merits. The third part analyses the design criteria for such housing with reference to projects built in Montreal, Quebec. Tenants' opinions on what is satisfactory in housing projects are discussed and appropriate management policies are suggested. In the conclusion, government policies of the past, and some recent developments are summarized, and future strategies suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Anderson, Bruce (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d780h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107025x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Housing -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poor -- Housing -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public housing -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nj33f"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of a three dimensional cloud chemistry model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lauzon, Louise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To evaluate the precision of a three dimensional cloud chemistry model, the ion concentrations of simulated clouds are compared with the chemical analysis of cloud water samples collected in the Muskoka, Ontario area.

We have first demonstrated that glucocorticoid agonists dexamethasone (10$ sp{-9}$ M) and cortisol (10$ sp{-7}$ M) can stimulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in de novo HIV-1-infected lymphoid cell lines, and that the magnitude of this induction correlated with relative levels of GR and GR message present in responder and non-responder cell lines. DNA sequence analysis has revealed the presence of a dozen conserved GRE-like motifs distributed throughout the HIV-1 genome. By using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have demonstrated that purified GR can specifically interact with at least two of these sequences: the first one is positioned in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), in a region referred to as the negative regulatory element (NRE); the second one is located intragenically, within the vif open reading frame. To assess the functional nature of these potential GREs, we subcloned then into a MMTV-LTR-luciferase construct from which endogenous GREs had been previously deleted. The activity of these recombinants was measured in a GR-negative cell line in presence and absence of co-transfected GR expression vector, and with or without glucocorticoid treatment. Our results showed that the two HIV-1 sequences we tested were capable of significantly enhancing the baseline transcription of the reporter gene, and conferred mild glucocorticoid inducibility to the recombinant MMTV promoter. These data suggest that HIV-1 contains discrete functional GREs that might serve to modulate the rate of viral transcription and replication, or control some aspects of latency.

This membrane enzyme is believed to be associated with elements of the endoplasmic reticulum. The membrane topology of the yeast $ alpha$-mannosidase was determined by cell-free transcription and translation in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes. It was demonstrated that the $ alpha$-mannosidase has a type II membrane topology in vesicles similar to that of all the Golgi glycosyltransferases and glycosidases cloned to date. The enzyme was expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli to produce antisera that will be used to immunolocalize the enzyme in yeast cells. The yeast $ alpha$-mannosidase gene lacking the NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal/anchor sequence was fused to the COOH-terminus of the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione-S-transferase gene through a thrombin-sensitive peptide, and expressed in E. coli. The fusion protein was inactive towards Man$ sb9$GlcNAc, both before and after cleavage with human thrombin. A large amount of recombinant $ alpha$-mannosidase was purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and used to produce antisera that could recognize the denatured $ alpha$-mannosidase by Western blot analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Herscovics, A.

Eighty-five per cent were able to recognize one or more of the common symptoms of malaria. Transmission was generally misunderstood and only 23% believed it could be prevented. More women preferred to obtain antimalarials from government clinics than from private drug shops, mission clinics, unofficial injectors, open markets or from leftover sources. Children under five were identified as the most malaria-vulnerable group and given priority for treatment. Severity of illness was the principal determinant in seeking treatment. Decisions were generally made jointly by both parents. As distance from a health unit increased, knowledge about transmissibility of malaria decreased (OR =.48; 95% CI.27,.86). Logistic regression analysis showed literacy and village to be the most important variables associated with knowledge of prevention.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gyorkos, Theresa W.

(Susan Catherine)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Additive and multiplicative statistical models in epidemiology invoke different assumptions regarding exposure-outcome relationships. While either may seem to provide an adequate fit in small data sets, a comparative parameter based on the correct set of assumptions will be more stable when applied in other contexts. Important implications of model selection and the scant literature on theoretical reasoning are presented. Given a lack of biological knowledge, a body of corroborative empirical knowledge would be helpful in choosing between statistical models. Traditionally, the fit of a multiplicative model is evaluated by a $ chi sp2$ test of homogeneity. However, this is a test rather than a measure and is sample-size dependent. In this thesis, the development of a new measure of heterogeneity of rate ratios, phi prime, is presented and applied to stomach cancer registry data. Results suggest homogeneity when comparing regions within countries, but some heterogeneity between continents.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hanley, James A.

This thesis is an attempt to reconstitute the multiple layers of interpretations which were grafted onto Rimbaud's life and works between 1883 and 1935 approximately. Successive readings keep a text alive and, in so doing, function also as prefaces. The concept of "preface" is thus expanded here to include the critical text. These strata consist of readings and commentaries influenced both by the historical and intellectual circumstances in which they were formed and by the progressive revelation of the text; added one to another without cancelling each other out, these layers continually enrich and transform the original, making both its meaning and its import denser, investing it with new significance and new values and thereby keeping it alive, in fact making it even more present with the passing of the years. Over the years, the focus of reflexion on Rimbaud has shifted from the study of his particular "case" to a more profound questioning, via Rimbaud, of poetry itself, its nature, its meaning, its scope. In the minds of the commentators, Rimbaud and poetry's destinies are intertwined; thus, they "read" them together as if the value and the meaning of the poetry's destiny were dependent on the destiny of Rimbaud.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k841d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz867</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rimbaud, Arthur, 1854-1891</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
