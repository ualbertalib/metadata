Although these stimulations have been carried on for twenty odd years, it has been only during the past four years that more especial attention has been directed towards speech. In 1946, Dr. Preston Robb summarized the effect on speech of excising various cortical areas. These patients had had previous cerebral injuries with resultant focal cerebral seizures. Dr. Robb also began to assist Dr.Penfield in the operating room during the period of stimulation. The examination of patients before and after operation and the assistance in the operating theater have been and will be continued by this writer. The results of cortical stimulation on speech or, better, electrical arrest of certain speech mechanisms are presented at this time in order to summarize the present data and give suggestions for future study. Electrical arrest of three, or possibly four discrete cortical regions produces disturbances in speech other than simple arrest of speech. Few definite conclusions have been reached by either Dr. Robb or this author, but the groundwork has been laid. It is hoped and expected that a real contribution to the localization of areas producing specific speech defects and to the physiology of speech will be forthcoming at the conclusion of this project on stimulations and excisions of the cortex.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Penfield, W.

Of the methods available for this purpose, the permeability method based on the Kozeny equation was selected as the most suitable. It has been found to provide reproducible results. The effective specific volume of the investigated material is an important factor in the Kozeny relationship and had to be determined. A procedure was employed which permitted the simultaneous evaluation of the specific surface and the apparent specific volume. Both of the quantities determined are of great practical and theoretical value in the investigation of the properties of fibrous materials. The specific surface of pulp fibres has been related to the properties of finished paper and the development of specific surface in the beater has been followed. The important application of specific volume measurement has been to assess the degree of swelling of pulp in various media and to determine the relation of swelling to the beating process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

Animal experiments and the results obtained from a variety of therapeutic procedures have provided indirect evidence which has set off many trains of thought and activity along a confusing number of tracks. A few valiant efforts have been made to establish order, but the fact still remains that the observations which have been made provide a very incomplete picture of a multifacetted problem. These considerations indicate that the sort of method needed is one which will give a composite picture of bronchial asthma by reflecting changes which occur in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, since these appear to be most affected. The technique of cardiac catheterization, supplemented by puncture of a systemic artery, measurements of oxygen intake and by certain other techniques to be described, would seem to fulfill the foregoing requirements more satisfactorily than the methods hitherto employed.

The development of the Cycle began with the systematic search by Thunberg (1) (1906-1920) for substances that could be metabolized by animal tissues. Using the acceleration of the decolorization of methylene blue by the tissue as the criterion that an added substrate was oxidized, Thunberg listed lactate, succinate, fumarate, malater citrate and glutamate, among many other substances, as metabolites. This work was confirmed and extended by Batelli and Stern (2). Enzymatic studies of the oxidation of the dicarboxylic acids revealed their close relationship in metabolism; the series of reactions.

Families in the above agency have consistently complained for several years of the system of clothing distribution. Many felt it degrading to be deprived of an opportunity to make a choice. Others were of the opinion that given the same amount of money spent by the agency they could have shopped to their own individual taste and made better investments. In other words, it was evident that families had not accepted the clothing room favourably. Clients and workers together were aware that clothing received through the agency was poor in quality and insufficient in quantity. The social case worker was also conscious of the clients’ emotional conflict which evolved from the necessity of clients visiting the agency’s clothing room to collect the needed items. Many clients were fearful of meeting friends or neighbours from whom they wished to conceal their association with the agency. There were always conflicting pressures in making decisions on clothing: the pressure of more important needs and wants, and the pressure of limitation of resources available by the agency for clothing.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.

It was found by a number of workers in this field that Morden bentonite, a clay mined at Morden, Manitoba, is an effective catalyst in a number of reactions; namely, the dealkylation of straight and branched chain hydrocarbons, and the dehydration of alcohols, ketones, and cyclic alcohols. Toluene was obtained in good yields from p-cymene. Ethylbenzene was found to give benzene, toluene, and small amounts of styrene. Butadiene was obtained from butanediol-2,3, butanone-2, and cyclohexanol. Styrene was produced by the pyrolysis of 1,1-diphenylethane. High yields of unsaturated hydrocarbons were obtained by dehydration of aliphatic alcohols such as amyl alcohol, and diethylcarbinol. In these studies mentioned above, activated Morden bentonite was found to be the best of the catalysts used. Since this aluminum hydrosilicate appeared to be a very versatile and efficient catalyst, it was decided to extend the investigations to other classes of organic compounds, and to determine aniline, and N,N-diethylaniline. Aniline has also been pyrolysed.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.

In some cases, the tomato plants are set out late in the season so that the vines and fruits are at their prime when frosts are likely to occur. The fruit is then harvested in the mature-green stage, stored for a short period and then ripened. This practice lengthens the period of availability of locally grown fresh tomatoes. Tomatoes for the winter and spring markets are grown in the South and shipped to northern cities for the retail trade. The fruit generally arrives in the mature-green stage, and therefore it is necessary to ripen this fruit before putting it on the wholesale or retail markets. The present experiments were therefore designed to determine the optimum ripening conditions of mature-green tomatoes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, H.

In the following pages an attempt is made to do this with respect to the St. Maurice Valley. There have been three main types of occupance in the valley since the founding of Three Rivers in 1634. At first the settlements were dependent mainly upon the fur-trade, and upon a few small local industries. This was a long period in the history of the St. Maurice Valley and did not end until 1852, mainly because of the treacherous character of the river. The second period was characterised by the exploitation of the forest wealth of the valley, and lasted from 1852—1898. It produced a different cultural landscape with new settlements growing up and older ones becoming redundant. Finally, in the period 1898 to the present, the power of the river has been harnessed to produce electricity. A new industrial region has come into being with new kinds of towns in new locations. The following work thus falls quite logically into three sections. In each of these periods the valley has had a distinctive geography, and although the transitions are not sharp they are clear enough to make such a division useful and valid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, K.

The Sherbrooke series occupies a triangular area, with its apex at McGoon Point, bounded on the west by Lake Memphremagog and then on the southeast by a line running from McGoon Point along Fitch Bay, Bunker Hill into Lake Massawippi, and on the north by the northwest shore of the latter lake to the eastern edge of the map sheet.

The seed samples are sent in by growers throughout the Ottawa district. Ascochyta spp. and Fusarium spp. are the dominant fungi isolated from pea seed originating in the Ottawa district. As shown by Jones in 1927 there are three Ascochyta fungi which cause disease on peas; Ascochyta pisi Lib., Mycosnhaerella pinodes (Berk, and Blox.) Stone and Ascochyta pinodella Jones. The percentage of seed infected with Ascochyta pisi in these samples varies from 0 to 100%. The percentage of seed infected with Ascochyta pinodes and Ascochyta pinodella does not usually run above 5%. Due to the high percentage of A. pisi in the seed and the importance of this fungus in causing reduced stands when infected seed is used for planting, investigations have been undertaken for a number of years in an effort to discover methods of controlling the organism. Most of the work on control at Ottawa is concerned with the effectiveness of seed dusting.[...] The importance of soil infestation and seed treatment studies have also been undertaken. The investigations were conducted during the summers of 1945, 1946, 1947 and 1948 at Ottawa and during the winter of 1947 - 1948 at Macdonald College.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coulson, J.

A. (Hugh A.)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the manner of Segre and Helmholz it has been possible using an expansion in spherical waves and elementary vector analysis methods to derive expressions for the field intensities resulting from electric and magnetic dipole radiation and electric quadrupole radiation in terms of the corresponding moments of the nucleus. These same methods however are not applicable to higher orders of multipole radiation. The form of the vector potential resulting from electric and magnetic 2l-pole radiation has been treated in a paper by Heitler. In this paper he considers the expression for the vector potential resulting from electric dipole radiation and then generalizes to obtain the vector potentials resulting from electric and magnetic 2 -pole radiation. A further discussion of these results is given by Dancoff and Morrison. A completely different approach to the problem is given here in which the total field intensities resulting from a nuclear radiation are broken into two parts, one resulting from electric multipole radiation, and the other resulting from magnetic multipole radiation. The parts are in turn written in the form of an expansion, the individual terms of which are the field intensities for the various orders of multipole radiation present.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, P.

These studies deal in part with the parallels and contrasts to be found in the work of the leading English and French Canadian poets of the period designated. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “English” and “French” stand throughout for English Canadian and French Canadian. Biographical and bibliographical material is presented more extensively in the case of the French poets since it is the aim of the writer to make a definite contribution to the meagre store of factual knowledge English Canadians have of the literary history of their French compatriots. The majority of Canada’s poets, both English and French, demonstrated in varying degree their powers of observation and detailed reportage as well as their emotional or aesthetic appreciation of their subject. The French poets, however, stopped considerably short of the philosophical approach; they had yet to show an awareness of the opportunity and the challenge in a philosophical view of nature.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Phelps, A.
