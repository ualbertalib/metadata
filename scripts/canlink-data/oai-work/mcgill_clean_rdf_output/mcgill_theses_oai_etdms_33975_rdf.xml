The receivers discussed here run at a moderate speed (100's Mb/s) and they need to be relatively sensitive. However, unlike a traditional fiber communication receiver, a low power and area consumption are very important design considerations. The challenge in designing these receivers comes from satisfying simultaneously all the above requirements. The design of VLSI optical transmitters based on reflection-mode modulators is also discussed. Three optoelectronic technologies, namely FET-SEED, MQW diodes flip-chipped onto CMOS, and epitaxy-on-electronic designs were used to design arrays of transceivers. Current-Mode and buffering techniques are introduced into the design of VLSI-optoelectronic receivers. These techniques enable the integration with the receiver of larger and hence more alignable detectors. The design of a misalignment tolerant array of receivers is proposed and discussed. A time-differential receiver is introduced. It provides the good dynamic range of a dual-rail encoded receiver, but with only half the number of beams. In addition transmitters are optimized to drive large alignable modulators (reflection devices). For this purpose, BiCMOS drivers are also considered and discussed. Low-power adiabatic modulator drivers are proposed. The designs discussed are multi-purpose and generic to all optical interconnect systems. However, the discussion is performed in the context of the design of a high-capacity free-space optical backplane. An overview of three demonstrator backplanes is given. To guide the design of optical interconnect systems such as a backplane, a model is proposed. It takes into account the important design parameters of the transmitter and receiver. The system model relates the bit error rate (BER) with the optical power of the interconnection (its sensitivity) at any given bit rate for a given design. The model also predicts the power consumption of the interconnect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tooley, Frank A. P.

These systems can also be used to reduce pesticide loadings from agricultural lands, since they tend to keep the discharging waters within farm boundaries for extended periods of time. This allows for greater pesticide microbial and chemical degradation. A three-year field lysimeter study was initiated to investigate the role of subirrigation systems in reducing the risk of water pollution from the three most commonly used herbicides in Quebec, namely atrazine (2-chloro-4[ethylamino]-6[isopropylamino]-1,3,5-triazine), metribuzin (4-am ino-6(1,1-di meth yl eth yl)-3-(meth yl thio)-1,2,4-tria zin-5(4H)-one), and meto lach lor (2-chlo ro-N-(2-eth yl-6-methyl phen yl)-N-(2-meth oxy-1-meth yl eth yl)acet amide). Eighteen PVC lysimeters, 1 m tall x 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy soil. Three water table management treatments, i.e. two subirrigation treatments with constant water table depths of 0.4 and 0.8 m, respectively, and a free drainage treatment in a completely randomized design with three replicates were used. Grain corn (Zea mays L.) and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) were grown on lysimeters, and herbicides were applied each year at the locally recommended rates at the beginning of each summer. Soil and water samples were collected at different time intervals after each natural or simulated rainfall event. Herbicides were extracted from soil and water samples and were analyzed using Gas Chromatography. From the three years results (1993--1995), it has been concluded that all three herbicides were quite mobile in this sandy soil, as they leached to the 0.85 m depth below the soil surface quite early in the growing season. This suggests that if the drainage effluent or seeping waters from sandy soils of agricultural lands in southern Quebec drain freely, they may be considered to be a serious non-point source of pollution to the water bodies. The results have also shown that herbicide concentration decreased with soil depth as well as with time, meaning that the higher herbicide residues were found at top layers, and soon after the herbicide application. The herbicide mass balance study revealed that when the drainage effluent was kept within the lysimeters under the subirrigation setup, there was a statistically significant reduction of atrazine and metribuzin residues (shorter half lives) in the adsorbed and liquid phases. However, the reduction in metolachlor concentration under the subirrigation system was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that subirrigation, combined with certain herbicides can significantly reduce the herbicide loadings from corn and potato farms in southwestern Quebec, and become environmentally beneficial. A computer simulation model (PRZM2), was used to simulate atrazine, metribuzin, and metolachlor leaching in the lysimeters, under subsurface drainage conditions. The simulated values for all three chemicals in most of the cases followed the leaching pattern of observed data. But the model either under- or over-estimated the herbicide concentrations in the soil. This could have been caused by simplistic instantaneous linear adsorption/desorption of herbicides, and inadequacy of conventional Darcian approach for the treatment of matrix flow.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Prasher, Shiv O.

More specifically, a detailed model compound investigation showed that 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane is an additional phosphitylation reagent which may provide further quantitative structural information about lignin. Correlation analysis using the Hammet principles revealed that the 31P chemical shifts of lignin- related phenolic hydroxyls with various substitution patterns strongly depend on the nature of the substitution. Such structure-chemical shift correlations led, for the first time, the development of a set of empirical parameters that permits the accurate prediction of 31P chemical shifts of lignin-related phenolic compounds. Furthermore, the 31P NMR technique was coupled with the Mannich reaction. This unique combination allowed the quantification of various types of phenolic hydroxyls in lignin such as para-hydroxyl phenols, catechols, guaiacols, and phenols bearing C 5 or C6 substituents in a novel and nondestructive manner. The 31P NMR technique was thus applied in order to reveal the structural changes that occur within lignin during kraft pulping and oxygen delignification. The major structural changes occurring on lignin, during the course of conventional kraft pulping were shown to be: (a) the progressive formation of carboxylic acids and condensed phenolic hydroxyl groups and (b) the progressive and stereoselective degradation of the arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether units. It was also discovered that condensed phenolic hydroxyl units are relatively stable toward oxygen delignification. Significant evidence was also supplied accounting for the enhanced delignification efficiency of modern modified pulping processes and the mechanism of xylanase prebleaching of kraft pulps. The 31P NMR technique was also applied to examine the effect of a lignin isolation process variable (batchwise versus continuous) on the structural details of dioxane acidolysis lignin isolated from kraft pulps. The structure of the dioxane acidolysis lignin, isolated from kraft pulps using batchwise and continuous processes, was shown to have similar functional group distributions and elemental compositions. These results confirmed that the structure of residual lignin in kraft pulps is not altered significantly during a dioxane acidolysis isolation process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Argyropoulos, D.

It was hypothesized that the left hemisphere prepotency for linguistic processing is based, in part, on specialized mechanisms within this hemisphere for the processing of acoustic transients relevant to speech. Evidence supporting this idea was obtained in a positron emission tomography study (PET). Since nonlinguistic stimuli were used, the observed left-hemispheric activation cannot be specific to the speech system, but must reflect a more general processing mechanism. A reanalysis of data from six auditory PET studies revealed that the peak focus of auditory activation was significantly posterior to Heschl's gyrus (HG) in the right hemisphere, while it encompassed HG in the left. The cause of this asymmetry is unknown, but it appears to hold true for other auditory functional imaging studies in the literature. Functional specialization in auditory regions was also explored by testing patients with anterior temporal-lobe resections from either the left (LT) or right (RT) hemisphere and normal volunteers on several linguistic and nonlinguistic auditory tasks. The excisions in these patients always included some secondary AC, and sometimes included primary AC (HG). I had speculated that anterior. secondary AC in the left hemisphere was specialized for processing word-sounds, but patients with excisions in this area were unimpaired in their ability to use such information to retrieve items from the mental lexicon. Furthermore these patients did not show a disproportionate impairment on a lexical decision task, when items were presented aurally instead of visually, compared to normal subjects. With few exceptions, a battery of psychophysical tests of auditory processes were performed normally by all groups.

The mechanisms that modulate these spike discharge properties of MNCs were hypothesised to involve Ca2+-dependent K+ currents, which have been documented to participate in firing frequency and patterns in other central neuronal populations. Electrophysiological experiments were used to characterize the current underlying the Ca2+-dependent AHP in MNCs, the activity-dependent requirements for its activation and its functional role in modulating MNC firing. IAHP is tonically activated in cells firing at frequencies of greater than 1 Hz and increases in amplitude with increases in frequency, up to 20 Hz. This represents the range of frequencies over which MNCs have been documented to fire in vivo suggesting that IAHP is poised to participate in the normal regulation of spike discharge. Indeed results in this thesis demonstrated that IAHP imparts an inhibitory tone on MNCs that modulates spike discharge frequency, and aspects of bursting behaviour. Given its contribution to the spike discharge properties of MNCs, IAHP was hypothesised to be an ideal target for neuromodulation of cell firing patterns. IAHP was found to be attenuated by the transmitter neurotensin. This peptide was also found to activate a non-selective cationic conductance that depolarizes MNCs and appears to be Ca2+-dependent. The results are discussed in the context of MNC physiology.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bourque, C. W.

It is focused on selected novels by four contemporary women writers whose works are representative of the phenomenon under study. They are: Carmen Laforet (Nada 1944), Ana Maria Matute (Primera memoria 1959), Esther Tusquets ( El mismo mar de todos los veranos 1979) and Carmen Martin Gaite (Caperucita en Manhattan 1990 and La reina de las nieves 1994). The first three chapters examine generic issues as a preliminary step towards the explanation of the significance of fairy tales to novelists today. To this end, the first chapter tackles the ambiguities surrounding current definitions of the fairy-tale genre to establish dearly the nature of the narrative substructure of the novels of the study. It proposes an alternative approach which lends a chronological dimension to present definitions that are based on stylistic and structural analysis alone. This is followed by a second chapter which explains the recurrence of fairy tales and fairy-tale motifs in the novels by underlining the structural and conceptual similarities between the two genres. The third chapter is devoted to a comparative analysis of the genres under study as a means of isolating minimal recurrent units of the children's narratives and explaining their transformation in the novels. The last three chapters, based primarily on the findings of the comparative analysis of the fairy tales and their novelistic versions, focus on two important fairy-tale motifs that appear to hold the key to the importance of fairy tales in the novels: The marginalization of the fairy-tale hero and the ambiguous image of the mother-figure as at once evil and benevolent. The fourth chapter therefore concentrates on the various conventions of marginality in the novels and the fifth is dedicated to a study of the structure of the contemporary novel against the backdrop of its transformation of the basic fairy-tale paradigm that traces the development of the hero from a marginalized position to his/her integration into society. The sixth chapter concludes the question of transformations by analyzing the image of the woman in the contemporary novel on the basis of the reworking of the evil stepmother/fairy godmother motif.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Magallon, Jesus (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q800j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429c004</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Martín Gaite, Carmen.

Participants were selected at random from published lists of university faculty. Questionnaires were mailed to 500 potential respondents asking them to recall and describe two memorable teaching incidents and then rate their response, using a Likert-type scale, to a series of items based on descriptions of teacher knowledge found in the literature. They indicated the extent to which they considered each item, and the extent to which they felt they had been influenced by knowledge of the item at the time of the incident. Finally, respondents answered questions about their teaching background. A total of 102 completed questionnaires were returned. Principal components analysis (PCA) resulted in a four factor solution describing the knowledge drawn upon. Factors were (1) pedagogical content knowledge, (2) current knowledge of learners, (3) knowledge of content, and (4) knowledge of learners' background and appropriate pedagogy.

Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine variables that best predict factor scores.

In each chapter I draw on comparative evidence from different Ethiopian Semitic languages, an approach which provides greater insight into how the languages vary with respect to these three issues, and how the issues themselves are best analyzed. The first issue is that of 'mobile morphology' a term I coin to describe the ability of a particular morphological category to be realized on various segments within a stem. The two major types in the South Ethio-Semitic languages are palatalization and labialization. I develop an analysis of palatalization in five different languages which relies on a hierarchy of preferred targets, along with a number of constraints regulating the appearance of palatalization within the stem. Ethio-Semitic languages have several different types of reduplication. I draw a distinction between phonological and morphological reduplication and argue that phonological reduplication should be viewed as copying rather long-distance geminate structures created by spreading. I also examine the interaction of reduplication with mobile morphology and I present an analysis of double reduplication, showing how languages will avoid the creation of double reduplication relationships. I develop an analysis of epenthesis which contrasts the behaviour of one set of languages which epenthesize following final consonant clusters with other languages which epenthesize between consonant clusters. I show that while all Ethio-Semitic languages follow the same general pattern, this may be overridden by templatic constraints and more importantly, by sonority considerations holding of adjacent syllables in coda-onset sequences. This last observation is important because it shows that while languages may on the whole violate heterosyllabic contact constraints, in particular circumstances, the constraints will be obeyed, giving rise to an emergence of the unmarked scenario.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Piggott, Glyne (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rq489.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333411s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ethiopian languages -- Morphology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethiopian languages -- Phonology, Comparative.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945s59j"><dcterms:title>The relationship between emotionality and in-session therapeutic phenomena /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Peternelli, Loris.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of emotionality during the psychotherapeutic hour has been extensively documented in the psychotherapy theory and research literature.

This thesis describes a systematic study into the retention and enantioselective separation capabilities of the tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbmate), tris (R-phenylethylcarbamate) and tris (S-phenylethylcarbamate) stationary phases. The underlying aim of this work was to obtain an understanding of the solute-stationary phase interactions which are responsible for the chromatographic retention and separation of enantiomers. By development of quantitative structure-enantioselective retention relationships (QSERR), it was possible to identify the primary components involved in the molecular interaction process and describe those interactions in terms of non-empirical solute descriptors. Results for several different series of racemic compounds indicate that multiple mechanisms are possible and that retention may be described by combinations of several key classes of interaction including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, lipophilic, charge transfer and steric interactions. Progressive development of these properties from classical point interactions to molecular interactions, supports a proposed theory of chiral recognition which extends from the basic three-point model to a more complex dynamic molecular model. This new model, derived to explain obtained experimental results, addresses issues in chirality which are not adequately covered by previous theory. It is proposed that the original theory is a static model which does not authentically reflect real systems and as such, cannot account for all experimentally observed molecular interactions of an enantiospecific nature. A modified and improved theory of chiral recognition has been fashioned, which includes the vital aspects of conformational adjustment and molecular fit. Finally, the first reported application of artificial neural networks in chiral chromatography is documented. Multi-layer feed forward neural networks, with error back propagation, have been used in combination with QSERR as a basis to development of chiral chromatographic expert systems. Resulting networks contained cross validated predictive ability ranging from 94 to 97%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainer, Irving W.

The first part of the study (Chapters I--III) develops the theoretical tools and historical parameters which are applied to the textual analyses carried out in the second part (Chapters IV--VII). In Chapter I the notion of literariness is examined against the background of recent criticism. The distinctiveness of the literary text is found to reside in the cognitive performance it makes possible. This performance is then analyzed relying on the categories of sense and reference developed by the theory of Possible Worlds. This leads to an examination of two strategies---realist and non-realist---for the articulation of reference, which in turn raises the issue of the role of literary genres in the dialogical interaction mediated by the text. The second chapter focuses on the producer of the text. A connection is established between the epistemic configuration of "modernity" and the emergence of a particular type of producer, namely the "intellectual," who is also the primary interlocutor of "modern" literature. This analysis is then brought to bear, via Gramsci, on the particular situation of twentieth-century intellectuals in Italy. The third chapter provides a panorama of postwar Italy, with an emphasis on the relationship between political events and cultural developments such as the emergence of neorealism as the dominant literary current. The chapters in the second part present a reading of the five novels written by Calvino between 1950 and 1963, namely: I giovani del Po, Il visconte dimezzato, Il barone rampante, Il cavaliere inesistente, and La giornata d'uno scrutatore.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Suvin, Darko (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t24v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gq053</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literary form.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calvino, Italo -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Italian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795946j"><dcterms:title>Observational studies of drug effectiveness in asthma : time-related issues</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Blais, Lucie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis relates to the study of drug effectiveness using observational designs. First, we investigate the ability of inhaled corticosteroids, an anti-asthma medication, in preventing hospitalization for asthma. We then address methodological issues related to temporal dimensions of drug exposure and to the estimation of time-dependent rate ratios in case-control studies. To examine these questions, a cohort of 19,168 newly treated asthmatics was selected from the computerized databases of Saskatchewan Health. Using a sub-cohort of 2,059 patients hospitalized for asthma, we found that regular users of inhaled corticosteroids were about 40 percent less likely to be readmitted to hospital for asthma than nonusers of these medications, and this after only 15 days of therapy. The beneficial effects lasted up to six months and waned thereafter. Using a case-control sample from the entire cohort, we found that therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, initiated early after the onset of symptoms of asthma, was more effective than theophylline in preventing the first hospitalization for asthma. When compared with anti-allergic agents, early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids was not found to significantly reduce the risk of asthma hospitalization, however. Finally, we showed that the common use of exposure time-windows defined solely in terms of the outcome produces biased estimates of rate ratios that vary over time. Application of principles based on time-related dimensions of exposure provides, however, valid case-control estimates of time-dependent rate ratios. In conclusion, we were able to show that regular use of inhaled corticosteroids is highly effective in preventing asthma hospitalizations. We also showed the importance of defining the exposure in terms of both the onset of therapy and the time of the outcome for the valid estimation of time-dependent rate ratios in case-control studies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ernst, Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Suissa, Samy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z017z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795946j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pp80z"><dcterms:title>Black holes and Dirichlet branes in the theory of strings</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Breckenridge, Jason C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research presented here is carried out along two related fronts.

The Dirichlet brane (D-brane) content of these black holes is then identified and this information is used to compute the microscopic statistical entropy, which is then shown to be identical to the classical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The symmetry techniques are then further exploited to create new low-energy background solutions describing different supersymmetric bound states of D-branes. In one case these D-brane bound states have constituent D-branes which differ in dimension by two. In the second case these bound states represent arbitrary numbers of D-branes which intersect at non-trivial angles.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Myers, Robert C.

This thesis reports on the changes occurring when acinar cells, terminal ducts and islets are grown in culture. A number of methods for adult pancreatic duct epithelial isolation and culture from different species have been reported. However, there are no reliable methods for the large scale isolation and culture of the terminal segments of the pancreatic duct system. Acinar fragments of the hamster pancreas are isolated by partial digestion with collagenase. Culture is achieved by embedding in a matrix of rat-tail collagen in DME:F12 medium and 10% NuSerum supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and cholera toxin (CT). The results show that ductal cysts arise within the areas of degenerated acinar tissue. The method developed in the preparation of this thesis gave a high yield of ductal cysts. Autoradiography indicates the duct cysts could have originated from either progenitor cells of ducts or those of acini. In addition, the question of whether these duct epithelial cysts originate from phenotypic transformation of acinar cells needs to be further evaluated. Acinar fragments isolated from the hamster pancreas were embedded in type 1 collagen and grown in various media. After 34 days in culture, up to 80% of the acinar cells can be shown to be normal, while the remainder were severely degenerated. This occurred in media to which EGF and CT had not been added. When the latter were added, cystic structures developed. However, a few of the cells within the cystic wall still showed amylase positive immuno-reactivity. Cellular amylase activity decreased over time but a more rapid decline was shown in cells cultured with Media containing EGF and CT. It was also found that the duct-like cells had a limited capacity to redifferentiate into acinar cells. This study suggests that ductal-like epithelial structures may arise from transformation of acinar cells and/or proliferation of ductal cells. Purified islets from human pancreas were placed into collagen gel matrix and cultured in DME:F12 medium and 10% NuSerum supplemented with EGF and CT. The results showed that the cultured islets underwent a cystic transformation that was associated with (i) a progressive loss of insulin gene expression, (ii) a loss of immunoreactivity for insulin protein, and (iii) the appearance of CK-19, a marker for ductal cells. After the transformation was complete, the cells had the ultrastructural appearance of primitive duct-like cells. Cysts showed a progressive enlargement with cell replication, as reflected in a 1500% increase in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine. These results are consistent with the transdifferentiation of islet cells to ductal cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duguid, W. P.

To elucidate the mechanism for the increased LT formation in asthma, we investigated the pulmonary cellular infiltration and LT synthesis by dispersed lung cells from BN rats following allergen challenge. To enable us to do these studies we have developed improved HPLC methods for the analysis of complex mixtures of eicosanoids in biological samples using binary gradients containing trifluoroacetic acid. Samples containing PGB$ sb2$ (the internal standard), cysteinyl-LTs, LTB$ sb4,$ hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and the cyclooxygenase product 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHTrE) can be analyzed in as little as 20 min. Mixtures which also contain more polar eicosanoids such as lipoxins and omega-oxidation products of LTB$ sb4$ can be analyzed in 40 min. Ovalbumin (OVA) challenge of sensitized BN rats resulted in a significant influx of neutrophils into the lungs and a significant increase in the synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase products, in particular LTB$ sb4$, by lung cells 6 h after challenge. However, there was little change in the production of cysteinyl-LTs compared with saline challenge. There was a significant eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs 24 h after OVA challenge, but cysteinyl-LT production by lung cells was unaltered at this time suggesting that eosinophils from BN rats are unlikely to be a major site for the formation of these compounds. This was confirmed in experiments with partially purified eosinophils obtained from Sephadex-treated rats. In contrast, cysteinyl-LTs were synthesized in appreciable amounts by alveolar macrophages from BN rats. Administration of rabbit anti-rat PMNL serum abolished the influx of neutrophils into the lungs and appeared to reduce the LTB$ sb4$ synthesis by lung cells. There was a positive correlation between the numbers of neutrophils in the lung and LTB$ sb4$ production by lung cells. In contrast, macrophages were positively associated with cysteinyl-LT production. Exogenous LTB$ sb4$ and 5-oxo-ETE induced infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs and therefore may be responsible for the late phase eosinophilic infiltration in BN rat lungs following allergen challenge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Powell, William S.

Fertilizer P was added at 44 and 132 kg P ha$ sp{-1}$ and to the Chicot soil only, manure containing 60 kg P for the first five years. Mehlich-3 (M3) extraction, soil P fractionation, $ sp{31}$P NMR analysis, P in leaching water, and path analysis were measured. Added P increased M3 P more when manure was also added, and in clay soils. To increase M3 P by 1 kg ha$ sp{-1}$ required from 3.6 to 8.1 kg ha$ sp{-1}$ fertilizer P, and when "net" fertilizer additions were used, fertilizer required was from 1.8 to 5.3 kg P ha$ sp{-1}.$ Moderately labile organic P (Po) decreased at 0 added P. With P at the rate of plant removal, inorganic (Pi) and Po fractions were unchanged. Excess P increased labile P and resistant P through moderately labile Pi. More P remained in labile Pi fractions when manure P was added, or in the soil with the higher clay content. Soil organic P levels increased upon fertilization only in the sandy loam soil. Labile and moderately labile Po could be estimated using monoester phosphate values determined by $ sp{31}$P NMR. Inorganic P values in gravitational water increased above 0.05 mg P L$ sp{-1}$ when soil labile Pi increased above 108 mg kg$ sp{-1}$ in the sandy loam soil and 69 mg L$ sp{-1}$ in the clay soil. Thus soil P movement was related to inorganic P additions. Increased fertilizer P did not increase organic P leaching losses. Fertilizer P in corn production may result in groundwater eutrophication.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, A. F.

The high-pressure experimental method was improved. The interactions between dentin, collagen and hydroxyapatite and the dental materials, 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate phosphoric acid ester were explored by FT-IR, FT-Raman and NMR spectroscopy. Vibrational bonds were assigned for these materials. The results suggest that some hydrogen bonding or chemical reactions occur on the interface of dentin and dental materials. The interaction between dentin and 2-hydroxyethlmethacrylate mainly takes place between collagen and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate.

The interaction of maleic acid with 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate was studied by FT-Raman and NMR spectroscopy.

OAS are unusual, helical, Gram-negative bacteria that are considered putative periodontopathogens due to numerical association with diseased sites and the enzymatic arsenal available to OAS that appears consistent with disease symptoms. T. denticola is the most commonly isolated OAS from periodontal pockets and as such is the focus of most investigations into the role of OAS in PD. As free iron is severely limited in humans the means by which OAS may obtain sufficient iron to prosper in the sub-gingiva was examined. The resultant model suggests T. denticola obtains iron through the $ beta$-hemolysis of erythrocytes and the binding of liberated hemin by a 47-kDa outer membrane sheath (OMS) protein. The kinetics of the ligand-receptor interaction are presented and the receptor has been purified to apparent homogeneity from T. denticola. $ sp3$H-labeled hemin is not transported into the cell. Evidence is presented to show that T. denticola produces an iron reductase, which may facilitate the transport of ferrous iron across biological membranes. It is also shown that T. denticola (Td), T. vincentii (Tv) and T. socranskii (Ts) do not produce siderophores. In growth assays, under conditions of iron-limitation, T. denticola may use inorganic iron, a source unlikely to be available in vivo. Hyaluronidase (Hase) activity is elevated in the gingival crevice during episodes of disease. Hase, when injected into the periodontal cavity under experimental conditions has been shown to result in connective tissue degradation. It is also known that T. pallidum, the agent of syphilis, produces a Hase that is critical to pathogenesis. Evidence is presented herein to show that Td, Tv and Ts all produce a hyauronoglucosaminidase (HGase). The identity and specificity of the Td HGase is confirmed through the use of enzyme inhibitors and activators, by electron microscope observations of the enzyme using the Hase inhibitor gold sodium thiomalate and anti-Apis mellifera venom antibodies and examination of the purity of the HA substrate using other polysaccharide degrading enzymes. As the HGase of these OAS would not migrate through a substrate-SDS PAGE system, we have employed hyaluronate (HA)- and chondroitin sulfate (CS)-absorbed nitrocellulose membranes to visualize HGase activity. The 59 kDa HGase of Td has been purified to apparent homogeneity through the conjugation of HA and CS to Affigel 701 beads. The last subject to be addressed by this thesis pertains to the ultrastructure of oral spirochetes. Using the copper-containing dye, Alcian blue, we have shown that T. denticola produces an exopolysaccharide layer, in an electron microscopy investigation. The development of a stain for dark-field microscopy has simplified the observation of this layer. The exopolysaccharide layer may have relevance to the evasion of phagocytosis, to protection against colicins, immunoglobulins and bacteriophages, to adherence and perhaps to the immunogenicity of OAS inhabiting the sub-gingiva.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Siboo, R.

Calcium and 1,25(OH)$ sb2$D$ sb3$ act in concert to modulate the expression of two important cell-cycle associated genes, c-fos and p53, and of markers of keratinocyte differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of cell growth and of the cell cycle associated oncogene, c-myc, in the malignant keratinocyte cell line, HPK1Aras, requires 10 to 100 fold higher concentrations of 1,25(OH)$ sb2$D$ sb3$ than do the immortal non-malignant human keratinocyte cell line, HPK1A.

The origin of the Gin-1 region has been described elsewhere (Villemur et al., 1987). The novel Pom-1 gene is testis-specific and encodes two major RNA species of 1.0 and 1.2 kbp. Our data have revealed that there is no clear evidence to suggest that Pom-1 is involved in the tumorigenic pathway that resulted in the Gross Passage A Murine leukemia virus-induced thymomas. The pattern of expression of Pom-1 was studied by a time course Northern blot, the STAPUT cell separation technique and in situ hybridization. Analysis of mRNA from enriched populations of spermatogenic cells from adult testes and localization by in situ hybridization revealed that Pom-1 transcripts are most abundant in the round and elongated spermatids, although there is a weak expression in pachytene spermatocytes. Immunocytochemistry data have shown protein expression to be localized in the Golgi apparatus of pachytene spermatocytes (stages IX-XII), round spermatids (steps 5-8) and elongated spermatids (steps 9-15). The Pom-1 gene is not homologous to any sequences present in the Genebank. Sequence analysis predicts a 6 kilodalton protein which is basic, lysine and arginine rich ($ sim$12%). It is also relatively rich in potential phosphoacceptor amino acids ($ sim$20%), mainly threonine and serine, several of which are located in phosphorylation consensus sequences.

In summary, phytase supplementation increased the growth performance, availability of P, Ca, Cu, Zn and N, plasma P, and tibia ash and reduced plasma Ca; it also increased the AID and AFD of most of the AA, particularly in female chickens at 28-d. The efficacy of microbial phytase was high when dietary P and Ca levels were low.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chavez, E. R. (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Touchburn, S. P.

The following studies in Winsor type II systems have been considered: (i) ion distribution in AOT and DODMAC reverse micellar systems, (ii) extraction of zwitterionic amino acids with AOT reverse micelles, (iii) extraction of proteins with DODMAC reverse micelles, (iv) water uptake of AOT, DODMAC and DODMAB reverse micelles. Depending on the study, the effects of the following variables were investigated: salt, amino acid or protein type and concentration, pH, volume ratio of the phases in contact, nature of solvent, alcohol concentration, surfactant type and concentration, and the presence of the impurities in the case of mixed salts. A systematic approach to describe the solubilization of different solutes in the reverse micellar phase, referred to as the "active interface model," has been adopted. Based on the active interface model, the reverse micellar interface is chemically active. Therefore, different species are able to react with the surfactant head groups at the reverse micellar interface and form different complexes. Based on the active interface model, a theory has been developed for the ion distribution in reverse micellar systems. This theory has excellent capability for prediction of ion distribution in multiple salt systems. Dimensionless groups have been defined to regroup several independent variables. The theory of ion distribution has been further extended to predict the extraction of zwitterionic amino acids and proteins. A general model, which accurately predicts the water content in the organic phase, has been developed for reverse micelles formed by the contact method. This model describes well the appearance of a maximum in water uptake, observed for the first time in this work, with an increase in salt concentration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vera, J. H.

This thesis explores Fuller's insights as a foundation for considering the place of legislation within contemporary governance. The challenges of contemporary governance involve a plurality of dimensions and participants. This means that the capacity of legislation to provide an effective response is more contingent than is often recognised. This thesis understands legislation as informing and being informed by an appreciation of the purposes to which that legal form might be put in complex regulatory contexts. An exploration of this issue, and an appraisal of how it contributes to understanding legislation as a medium of governance, sheds light on both the challenge of effective lawmaking in the modern political state, and practical concerns to which contemporary legal theory must respond.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacDonald, Roderick A.

Recently, that situation has changed and we have witnessed liberalization on trade in satellite services where governmental entities that provided satellite services were privatized. Also, countries started to allow the entry of foreign satellites to their markets. The international scenario on trade in satellite services is of great relevance and it will be analyzed in this thesis. We will see Mexico's, Canada's and the US's specific commitments on satellite communications services made in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Likewise, we will see Mexico's, Canada's and the US's background on satellite communications, and their regulatory framework on the use of foreign satellites will be analyzed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jakhu, Ram (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns0647562.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z236</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mass Communications.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
