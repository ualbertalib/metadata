R. Scott and A. J. M. Smith's McGill Fortnightly Review in 1925. Subsequent generations and schools of poets have made their first appearances and they have developed their ideas by producing their own magazines. The aim of this dissertation is threefold: to investigate the phenomenon of the little magazine, its role as an essential alternative to commercial publications, and the sociological and aesthetic necessity for its survival; to investigate the progress that has taken place in Canadian poetry in the pages of the little magazine, as well as the evolution of the little magazine itself; in light of the fact that literary Modernism and Post-Modernism have not developed in Canada in isolation, to investigate the influence of European, English, and American poetic development in the twentieth century on Canadian poetry.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xm44h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n89h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Little

These were inherited by two of his sons in succession: Napier Christie Burton (1758-1835) and William Plenderleath Christie (1780-1845). An examination of the available deeds of concession for our study area shows the legal framework of the tenure and the seigneurs' survey and land granting policies. Seigneurial rents increased between 1785 and 1820, but it was the accumulation of seigneurial arrears, followed by strict collection practices after 1835, which contributed most to social stratification and unrest. A seigneurial monopoly on mill construction and the use of water power was decentralized after 1815 so that manufactures were established by entrepreneurs with capital who acquired a share of the seigneur's rights through patronage. The seigneur's role in regional development--the rise of villages, settlement, and industrial growth--was significant particularly as a system of clientage which helped shape the social structure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278t69h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw84z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feudalism -- Richelieu River (N.Y. and Vt.-Québec) -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land tenure -- Richelieu River Region (N.Y. and Vt.-Québec) -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Social conditions -- To 1867</dc:subject><dc:subject>Richelieu River Region (N.Y. and Vt.-Québec) -- Social conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Christie, Gabriel, 1722-1799.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c1123"><dcterms:title>From Marxism on the state to the state of Marxism</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Van den Berg, Axel.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years there has been a spectacular growth of Marxist literature on politics and the state in capitalist society. The aim of this thesis is to determine whether this literature has contributed towards a viable, genuinely Marxist theory of the state and to assess the state of current Marxist theorizing more generally. On the basis of a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, from the "classics" to the present, it is argued that: (1) instead of theoretical advances, recent theories have produced a progressive immunization of received orthodoxies against empirical falsification; (2) to the extent that it is nevertheless possible to draw empirical implications from them at all, these have become virtually indistinguishable from those of their "bourgeois" counterparts; (3) what continues to underlie Marxist theorizing is an implicit reliance on "socialism" as the criterion of evaluation of capitalist reality combined with a virtual taboo on explicitly considering the exact nature of this "socialism".</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s084w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c1123</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Socialism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>State, The.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marx, Karl, 1818-1883.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct58r"><dcterms:title>La discrimination sur le marche du travail : le cas des employés de bureau à Montréal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dussault, Ginette.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyzes discrimination against women on labor market and stresses the influence of social values on the allocation of labor. This influence can be observed in job segregation itself and in special working conditions associated with typically female jobs. This influence is part of a mechanism of job rationing. All social institutions (churches, family, political parties...) share a common history characterized by a strict vision of sex-role segregation. The roles of men and women in the labour market, an important social institution, will reflect this sex-role segregation. Job segregation has long been viewed by many economists as an exogenous phenomenon... a matter of "tastes". But in this thesis, it is suggested that job segregation, as well as other aspects of the treatment of women on the labor market, is a rationale response by society to job scarcity. Working conditions associated with typically female jobs, for example, are not technologically determined but are part of a mechanism of job rationing: in maintaining women's instability on labor market, low wages and short job ladders induce women to leave the labor market when they are no longer wanted. The evolution of women's participation rates shows the relationship between social values dealing with paid work for women and the needs of female labor force. This vision of the labor market is corroborated by an analysis of working conditions in Montreal office jobs. Detailed data for eight Montreal firms were used in this research. The results indicate that to understand the treatment of women office workers, it is important to distinguish between two groups of firms: those where most office workers are males and those where most are females. In the male dominated firms female workers enjoy much better wages and other working conditions. And, as a result, female labor turnover is apparently not different from male labor turnover in these firms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g5745.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct58r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex discrimination in employment -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clerks -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Employment -- Québec (Province) -- Case studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jr83k"><dcterms:title>Politiques de l'énergie au Bresil et crise de la triple alliance avec le programme pro-alcool</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duquette, Michel, 1947-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the Third World, the Oil Crisis has emphasized the vulnerability of certain large oil-importing countries, engaged in an extensive process of industrialization. The author asks whether Brazil's response to this new challenge will emerge from a tradition of direct State involvement in Energy (exemplified by PETROBRAS), or an original strategy based on the private sector. Both the personal commitment of General Geisel to enhance the national bourgeoisie, and the general context of the mid-Seventies, favour the latter. As the locally-owned sugar-producing oligopoly promotes an alcohol program to replace gasoline, the State is seeking a loose formula--an Alliance of the agro-energetic sector with the multinational automobile industry and PETROBRAS. Its success would be based on the performance of each actor. Given a tradition of susceptibility of the Brazilian State to internal lobbying, and the choice in favour of indirect involvement in the program, it is not surprising that controls remained largely ineffective. Further structural limitations--an archaic agriculture resulting in low productivity of land, a lack of private funding, and technological deficiencies (caused by inadequate R &amp; D activities)--induced the failure of the program in its original conception. However, the national bourgeoisie's fear of foreign control lead the military to veto the possible alternative of further internationalization of the alcohol sector. It remains to be seen, in the light of the weakening position of Brazil in the world economy, if such a stance can be maintained in the long term.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s422.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jr83k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brazil -- Economic policy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alcohol fuel industry -- Government policy -- Brazil.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Energy policy -- Brazil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354f89r"><dcterms:title>Domestic medicine and indigenous medical systems in Haiti : culture and political economy of health in a disemic society</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hess, Salinda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study analyses the development of health care in Haiti as it has emerged from a syncretic cultural background. The historical bases of the social and cultural practices surrounding health and illness are described as four separately developing but interacting strands--domestic medicine, mercantile medicine, official medicine and Creole medicine. The thesis interprets this heterogeneity of health-care beliefs and practices using the theoretical concept of a disemic culture, in which diverse cultural codes interact, to provide occasions for the situational negotiation of health care. Case studies of domestic groups suggest that the domestic unit is the determining factor of health status, and the necessary focus for health development policy. The resources of the health care system outside the domestic unit are shown to contribute little to the health status of the population.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429984r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354f89r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social medicine -- Haiti.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical care -- Haiti -- Cross-cultural studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical economics -- Haiti.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical anthropology -- Haiti.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nv22q"><dcterms:title>The petrology and geochemistry of volcanic rocks at Matagami, Quebec, and their relationship to massive sulphide mineralization : an investigation of the geochemistry of hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks and a proposed new geothermal model for massive sulphide genesis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacGeehan, P.
