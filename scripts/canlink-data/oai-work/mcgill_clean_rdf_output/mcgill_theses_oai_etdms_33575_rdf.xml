A. (Geoffrey Alan)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis seeks to add to the understanding of wage determination in Canada. Data from the Labour Market Activity Survey and the Survey of Displaced Workers are analysed to indicate the degree to which wages for workers of given observable characteristics vary across industries. Possible explanations for such differentials are considered, with market-clearing models argued to be unconvincing compared to the main alternative, efficiency-wage theory, which allows for a persistent distribution of labour rents across industries. In particular, the key mechanisms in versions of the efficiency-wage hypothesis appealing to workers' concern for fairness are found to be relatively free of persuasive objections, and to be supported by a substantial body of theoretical and empirical work in social psychology and sociology, as well as in economics. The extent to which the observed inter-industry wage differentials can be explained in terms of posited mechanisms for the operation of workers' concern for fairness is then examined. Some indications of the influence of the concern for equity on inter-industry wage differentials are found, although limitations in the data and multicollinearity among regressors restrict the ability to isolate different industry-specific effects. It is concluded that while there is both a theoretical and an empirical basis for the proposition that workers' concern for fairness plays a role in the determination of wages in Canada, more work on this question, ideally combined with the availability of comprehensive firm-level data, is needed to get a more precise idea of the extent of this influence.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Soderstrom, L.

Numbered among these were many of the leaders of the Religious Renaissance which had flourished since the turn of the century. They advocated a "third way": neither for the Tsarist regime nor the Bolsheviks; neither for Capitalism nor Communism; neither for Materialism nor Idealism; rather, they promoted personalist, spiritual development (Godmanhood ), Christian economic ethics (Sobornost'), and a path to knowledge informed by reason, but guided by faith (Religious-Philosophy ). Forced to join the Russian diaspora, these religious philosophers continued to advance their movement with the help of the Young Men's Christian Association. Largely at the initiative of Nikolai Berdyaev (1874--1948), they also began to interact with the French intellectual milieu in Paris in order to develop inter-confessional and cultural understandings. Although Russian religious-philosophy suffered a certain decline following World War Two, many of their writings had returned to the USSR. As Soviet intellectuals discovered these works, they gradually began to revolt against dialectical materialism, and aspire to recover the religious-philosophical tradition. In 1988, this Return was at last made possible, and religious-philosophy has been enjoying a second renaissance which continues unabated today.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boss, Valentin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w924z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tt371</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soviet Union -- Intellectual life -- 1970-1991.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russia -- Religion -- 20th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion -- Philosophy -- History -- 20th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soviet Union -- Intellectual life -- 1917-1970.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russia -- Intellectual life -- 20th century.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk539"><dcterms:title>Imagining ethnicity : the role of the Montreal Bangladeshi press in ethnic cohesion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ahmed, Shameem.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation explores the relationship between uses of the Bangladeshi immigrant press in Montreal and the reinforcement of its readers' ethnic identity. The work is based on information gathered from two Bangladeshi newspapers published in Montreal---Probashbangla and Banglabarta . The study views ethnic identity as being perceived, enacted, and maintained symbolically through communication activities of ethnic group members. The Bangladeshi immigrant press is considered to be a major vehicle for its readers' perception of ethnic identity, and as a strong stimulus for its reinforcement. It is suggested that the nature and extent of use of the Bangladeshi immigrant press serves as indices of its readers' ethnic maintenance. The theoretical focus of this study is derived from the notion of 'imagined communities', which suggests that people without direct face-to-face contact, through the sharing of symbols, may imagine themselves to be a community. This study argues that through the mediation and promotion of ethnic symbols, the Bangladeshi immigrant press provides its otherwise unconnected readers with a means to imagine their affiliation with the Bangladeshi ethnic community. Frequent exposure to the immigrant press works to reaffirm that identity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaite, B.

Two of these receptor subtypes, 5-HT2A and 5-HT 2C, have drawn much attention because of their paradoxical regulation and their role in the etiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression, suicide and schizophrenia. While expression of the 5-HT 2A receptor is widespread throughout the body, expression of the 5-HT 2C receptor is restricted to the brain. To better understand the regulation of receptors at a mechanistic, biochemical, and molecular levels, researchers have relied on more simplistic and controllable in vitro cell systems such as cell models expressing native receptors. In this thesis, I report the endogenous expression of 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in two embryonic mouse fibroblast cell lines previously thought to lack 5-HT receptors, as detected by functional, pharmacological, and molecular approaches. In NIH-3T3 cell line, expression of a 5-HT 2A receptor was detected, whereas in BALB/c-3T3 cells, a 5-HT2A , 5-HT2C and a splice-variant of 5-HT2C receptors were identified. In these two cell lines activation of these 5-HT2 receptors induced an immediate release of calcium from intracellular stores by coupling to a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. In NIH- and BALB/c-3T3 fibroblasts, 5-HT2 receptor activities are tightly regulated by desensitization soon after stimulation of the receptor with 5-HT. The main mechanism of long-term desensitization involves down-regulation of receptor number. More detailed studies conducted with NIH-3T3 cells revealed a concomitant reduction in 5-HT2A receptor number and RNA level caused by a repression of its transcription. Growth studies revealed that in fibroblast cells, 5-HT2 receptor desensitization and down-regulation mediated by 5-HT represent a key "safety valve" to prevent aberrant cellular growth by sustained 5-HT2 receptor stimulation. In conclusion, I present NIH- and BALB/c-3T3 fibroblast cells as novel accessible model cell systems for understanding the regulation of native 5-HT 2A and 5HT2C receptors that might provide new insights relevant to their role in the brain but also in any 5-HT2-expressing non-neuronal cells found at the periphery.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Albert, Paul R.

Environments in greenhouse (GR), open air (E0), perforated (E1) and non-perforated (E2) plastic covers in combination with well-watered (W0), moderately-watered (W 1), and water-stressed (W2) plants were used. Soil water content (WC), E, and E x WC interaction significantly affected Delta, WUE, dry matter (DM) and water use. WUE, photosynthetic rate, and leaf nitrogen increased; while Delta, DM, and transpiration decreased with water stress in GR, and E0. WUE in E2 either decreased or remained almost constant with decrease of WC. WUE of W0, and Delta in E2 were independent of growing environment, and WC, respectively. WUE and Delta correlations were significant in GR, E0, and E 1. LM was more paraheliotropic inside plastic coverings than those in E0. LM and pulvinus water content were affected by WC and temperature. High correlations were found between LM and the transmission of beta-rays from a beta-ray gauging system, WC, and leaf water potential. A high correlation was also found between leaf angle and 45Ca activity ratio between the extensor and flexor parts of the pulvinus. 32P uptake increased with increased root temperature, and decreased in presence of iron in the medium. Q10 values showed 32P uptake with and without the presence of iron to be mostly diffusion-controlled, but leaf movements were active processes requiring the expenditure of energy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barthakur, N.

While OVLT neurons have been reported to be excited by hypertonicity, it has remained unknown whether they can directly detect changes in fluid osmolality. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were therefore obtained from neurons acutely isolated from the OVLT. Increases and decreases in osmolality were found to cause respective depolarizations and hyperpolarizations, responses which seemed to be mediated by the volume-dependent modulation of a non-selective cationic conductance. Osmosensitive OVLT neurons were also found to contribute to the osmotic control of supraoptic neuronal firing, which, in the rat, regulates diuresis and natriuresis through effects on the secretion of neurohypophysical hormones. Intracellular recordings obtained from supraoptic neurons in rat hypothalamic explants revealed that the frequency of glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials varied as a sensitive function of the osmolality of the fluid superfusing the OVLT. The relay of osmotic information between the OVLT and the supraoptic nucleus was attenuated in the presence of atrial natriuretic peptide. The inhibitory effects of the peptide on the osmotic activation of supraoptic neurons were found to be specifically mediated through the modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The results presented in this thesis provide evidence for the intrinsic osmosensitivity of OVLT neurons and shed light onto the cellular mechanisms by which they contribute to the osmotic control of supraoptic neuronal firing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bourque, Charles W.

Several calibration techniques to measure the temperature of a 5 mm copper droplet using a two-color pyrometer are described. The levitated droplets required a short time to reach steady temperature with the result that the average measured loss of copper by evaporation was less than steady state evaporation rate by as much as 1 to 15%. The experimental data were adjusted accordingly. The experiments found that the flux of evaporation at constant temperature, was directly proportional to the vapor pressure of copper. For all the levitation experiments in which a significant change in mass loss was observed, the surface area decreased linearly with time. A new technique to calculate the droplet temperature was obtained based on the measurements of mass loss and evaporation time. The estimated temperature values were 5% higher than those obtained with the two-color pyrometer. The mass transfer coefficient based on the evaporation data, varied from 0.10 m s-1 to 0.81 m s-1. The activation energy for copper evaporation was 299 kJ mol-1, similar to the latent heat of evaporation, 305 kJ mol-1. A new method to estimate the vapor pressure of copper was obtained. It was found that the flux of evaporation was inversely proportional to the total pressure. Since the diffusivity is inversely proportional to the pressure, the flux of evaporation close to the droplet-gas interface is mainly due to molecular diffusion. Four models were evaluated to predict the flux of evaporation. The empirical correlation of the Sherwood number was employed to estimate the mass transfer coefficient and the predicted flux of evaporation. The combination of factors which best predicted the experimental flux of evaporation were the diffusion and natural convection. The predicted fluxes using the empirical correlation were always higher than the experimental values and they varied from 2% to 107%. The Turkdogan model predicted four times higher fluxes than the measured values. When the reference temperature was higher than room temperature, the amended model also yielded higher figures than the evaporation data. Considering that the homogeneous condensation does not influence the flux of evaporation, Elenbass' values were lower than the measured fluxes, but were more accurate than the models which take into account homogeneous condensation. The main conclusion derived from the experimental data was the realization that the evaporation of copper follows a simple correlation and the cluster formation in the boundary layer has no influence on the flux of evaporation.

In Emu-bcl-2 transgenic mice, the population dynamics and tissue organisation of phenotypically defined precursor B cells, have been evaluated by immunofluorescence labeling, mitotic arrest, BrdU uptake, flow cytometry and in vivo radioimmunolabeling combined with light and electron microscope radioautography. In bone marrow of Emu-bcl-2 mice, the number and production rate of proliferating precursor B cells were increased. Immature B lymphocytes also increased in number, accumulating extravascularly around the central venous sinus, and the total rate of production of these rapidly-renewed IgM + B cells was increased. Phenotypically mature B lymphocytes and B lymphocytes having a slow turnover rate greatly increased in number. Many mature B cells were located within the lumen of venous sinusoids and in perisinusoidal locations. In the spleen, the usual population of rapidly-renewed IgM + B cells was undetectable. In contrast, both slowly renewing B cells and a further stable population of very long-lived B cells were greatly increased in numbers but had unchanged longevity. The rates of apoptosis among B cell subsets in short term bone marrow cultures from bcl-2 transgenic mice were reduced, while bcl-2/scid mice accumulated many B220+mu- pro-B cells in bone marrow. The results indicate that overexpression of bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis during B cell development in bone marrow and promotes survival of newly-formed B cells in the spleen and their entry into a long-lived recirculating B cell pool. In Ipr and gld mutant mice lacking functional Fas and Fas ligand, respectively, pre-B cells were increased in number and production rate in bone marrow, while in spleen, in addition to an increase in number of mature B cells, a population of B220+mu - cells was expanded. Thus, Fas ligation may contribute to B cell death in bone marrow. The findings suggest that Bcl-2 and Fas can help to regulate the developmental stage-specific apoptosis of B cells designed to prevent the persistence of nonfunctional, preneoplastic or autoreactive cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osmond, D.

I tested the hypotheses that under elevated CO2: (1) Plants with greater non-foliar storage capacity win show more reproductive response and (2) The altered foliar physiology of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) use will cause increases in seed number and quality. Carbon dioxide treatments of High (650 muL L-1) and Ambient (360 muL L-1) were used in a controlled environment, simulated growing season, and in a natural pasture community. Hypothesis 1 was tested experimentally using four Raphanus varieties that differed in hypocotyl and leaf sizes. N fertilization and harvest times were used to obtain a range of root:shoot ratios. Enhancements in vegetative leaf area rather than the hypocotyl predicted reproductive responsiveness to CO 2. However, after three years of CO2 exposure in the pasture, hypocotyl-storing Taraxacum officinale responded strongly in vegetative biomass which correlated with inflorescence size and number. Fitness was enhanced four-fold, while the leaf-storing Plantago major produced more ramets and had only a two-fold fitness increase. Hypothesis 2 was tested by examining the C and N physiology underlying the vegetative organs and seeds of the pasture plants. Under elevated CO2, photosynthesis increased two-fold and senescence was delayed. Total plant C:N ratio did not differ, suggesting N acquisition increased. N similarly limited seed number in all cases suggesting an unchanged Physiology of N use in reproduction. While morphology constrained total biomass response, provisioning to seeds increased as shown by higher seed mass and number and decreased variability in number and mass. In all cases, leaf mass increase under high CO2 corresponded with fitness increase. Phenology constrained response to CO 2 as there was no plasticity in flowering day in Raphanus and Plantago, while there were flowering delays but greater seed maturation rate in Tar</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Potvin, Catherine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f770w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s26r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plants -- Effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plants -- Reproduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Climatic changes -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451k372"><dcterms:title>Inelastic photoproduction of J[psi] mesons at HERA</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hung, Ling-Wai.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A measurement of the inclusive inelastic J/ y photoproduction cross section using the ZEUS detector at HERA is described.

Why is a top manager more attentive to some aspects of his firm's strategic situation than to others? What shapes his interpretation of his firm's strategic reality? How does strategic issue diagnosis (SID) actually take place within a top management team? These are the types of questions that this thesis addresses. It contends that the way strategy formation in general and SID in particular have so far been studied in top management teams---through essentially cognitive lenses---has been inadequate, largely because these cognitive approaches, although concerned with the biases that affect thinking are themselves based on an incomplete and therefore biased and distorted view of people, their choices and their actions. The findings of a single-case field study that explored strategy formation and SID in a medium-sized entrepreneurial family firm led by a still-active founder are presented. The study utilized an enlarged conceptual framework that combined the dominant cognitive approaches in this domain with certain concepts from dynamic psychology. Its findings show that the deeply-entrenched personal preoccupations of a CEO, shaped by developmental processes and formative experiences throughout his life, and of which his cognitions are only one manifestation, have the potential to profoundly influence his strategic orientations, the top management team (TMT) dynamics in his firm, and consequently SID and its outcomes. It concludes that enriching the dominant cognitive models of SID and strategy formation by incorporating concepts taken from psychodynamic theory (specifically, concepts dealing with the consistent manifestations of individual character in all aspects of an individual's life) can lead to a better understanding of the complex subjective phenomena involved.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Westley, Frances (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9031660.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bj92x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chief executive officers -- Case studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Management -- Case studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Strategic planning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827d43x"><dcterms:title>A sense of belonging : pre-liberation space, symbolics, and leadership in gay Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Higgins, Ross.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is a study of collective identity formation among Montreal gay men before 1970. Using a theoretical framework based on schema theory and discourse analysis, I show that the success of the gay movement after that date was founded on the efforts of men who identified as gay in the decades before gay liberation. In their daily lives, their involvement with gay friendship groups, and their participation in gay social life in the clandestine world of bars and other venues of gay sociability, these men created a complex web of knowledge in gay-specific schemata and discourse forms that provided the basis for a gay rhetoric to counter the social taboo on homosexuality. Using data from thirty life history interviews, I have documented in detail the raw's struggle to come to terms with their difference, the influence on them of family, peer groups and authoritative discourses condemning homosexuality, the ways in which they found and entered the gay world, and the processes of learning its social conventions, I have outlined the continuous growth of the institutional foundations of the gay world, especially bars, focusing on the similarities and differences between Francophones and Anglophones, as well as those between working-class and middle-class gays in Montreal I detail the social control exerted by police over gay men's lives and the growth of symbolic forms, including language and shared discursive themes, which the new gay spaces made possible and through which the collectivity was made manifest. Finally, I show that the increasing unwillingness of ordinary gay men to accept their ostracism led to the growth of a gay culture of resistance based on these shared schemata. The leadership of individual gay men in private and in public opened the way for the social, cultural and political transformations of the social organization of homosexuality after 1970.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rousseau, Jerome (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j968f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d43x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gays -- Identity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gay men -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fz46d"><dcterms:title>Self-efficacy and goal choice among acting-out adolescents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Melrose, Regalena G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this study was to investigate self-efficacy and goal choice among acting-out adolescents in comparison to nonacting-out adolescents.

The adolescents were categorized as either acting-out or nonacting-out on the basis of their score on the Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (Achenbach &amp; Edelbrock, 1986), as well as on corroborated reports made by school administrators. Fifty-eight acting-out and 58 nonacting-out adolescents completed a questionnaire packet containing measures of self-efficacy, locus of control, self-mage, and goal choice. In addition, each adolescent was interviewed and administered a brief intelligence measure. With all demographic variables covaried, the primary findings of the study were that acting-out as compared to nonacting-out adolescents experienced more incidents of failure, displayed lower general self-efficacy scores, greater external loci of control, and chose goals that were vague or less specific. The negative experiences associated with behavioral problems, such as academic failure, apparently lower adolescents' self-beliefs and abilities to specify their goals. Despite their experiential differences, however, acting-out and nonacting-out adolescents displayed similar levels of social self-efficacy, real self-image, and ideal self-image, as well as similar goal setting abilities in areas other than goal specificity. All adolescents chose a comparable number of goals, as well as comparable levels of goal difficulty, goal commitment, and procedural knowledge. The stage of adolescence with its many changes, demands, and uncertainties apparently leaves most youths with comparable self-images and goal setting abilities, regardless of whether or not they have negative experiences of social and academic failure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jacob A.

The ocean component is the Wright and Stocker two-dimensional thermohaline circulation (THC) model, and the atmospheric component is a zonally averaged energy-moisture balance model for the atmosphere. Both single- and multi-basin configurations of the model are considered. The results obtained with this coupled model are compared with those from an ocean-only model that employs mixed boundary conditions. The differences in the steady states of the two models and their linear stability are examined over a wide range of parameters, for both one- and two-basin ocean models. The presence of additional feedbacks between the ocean circulation and the atmosphere and hydrological cycle in the coupled model produces significant differences between the latter and the ocean-only model. The two models generally have different (though similar) equilibria, but, more importantly for the issue of climate change, the variability in the models near similar steady states is quite different. These differences indicate that to perform relevant investigations of long-term climatic variability, a coupled model is necessary. Next the coupled model with three-ocean basins is applied to last glacial maximum (LGM) conditions. It is found that to achieve realistic results, it is necessary to add a thermodynamic sea ice model into the coupled atmosphere-ocean model. The variability of the LGM conveyor circulation in the coupled ocean-sea ice-atmosphere model is then examined, and the model is subjected to a range of freshwater perturbation experiments. The conveyor state circulation is quite sensitive to the interbasin atmospheric transport of water vapour from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In particular, increasing this transport makes the conveyor state more robust. The LGM model circulation does not exhibit internal century-to-millennial scale variability, nor can the latter be excited by steady freshwater forcing. However, rapid climatic change on a timescale of decades can be generated through transient freshwater forcing of the northern North Atlantic. Perturbations in the ocean circulation are also found to propagate from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in a few decades. Stochastic, white noise forcing of the model results in a mainly red noise response but also excites a natural mode of THC variability with a timescale of about 150 years.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mysak, L.

At puberty, while some of the hermaphroditic males become fertile, none of the XY sex-reversed females produce litters. The objective of my study was to clarify the cause of infertility in B6.YTIR females. We have previously demonstrated that the eggs ovulated from B6.YTIR ovaries undergo fertilization efficiently, but cannot develop beyond the 2-cell stage. In the present study, we collected oocytes directly from XY ovaries, and examined their maturation, fertilization and embryonic development in vitro. The results show that the majority of fertilized eggs fail to reach the blastocyst stage. To determine whether developmental incompetence of XY oocytes can be attributed to defects in the oocytes themselves or the surrounding XY somatic cells, we constructed female mouse chimera composed of B6.YTIR and XX BALB/c cells. All chimeric females produced progeny exclusively derived from XX oocytes. For comparison, most of XX ↔ XX chimeric females produced progeny derived from oocytes of either strain. The ability of XY oocytes to regulate granulosa cell differentiation and functions was assessed in oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCC) in vitro . Microsurgical removal of oocytes prevented cumulus cell expansion and suppressed estradiol production while it promoted progesterone production. Coculture of the oocytectomized OCC with denuded oocytes from either XX or XY ovaries resumed cumulus expansion and the normal endocrine profile. Morphometric analyses indicated that XY oocytes were significantly smaller and their zona pellucida layer thinner than XX oocytes as early as the preantral stage. Furthermore, XY oocytes were attached with fewer cumulus cells in antral follicles. To determine whether developmental incompetence of the zygotes from XY ovaries resides in the nuclear or cytoplasmic component, we exchanged the pronuclei between the zygotes derived from B6.YTIR oocytes and those from XX oocytes and examined their development in vitro. The results indicate that both compartments are defective in the B6.YTIR oocyte. In conclusion, the XY oocyte becomes cell-autonomously defective in both nuclear and cytoplasmic components during early oogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taketo, Teruko (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr73f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107089g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mice -- Molecular genetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infertility, Female</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qn79k"><dcterms:title>Municipal firefighter exposures to toxic gases and vapours</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Occupational Health</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Austin, Claire.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The hypothesis was that there is an association between cardiovascular, reproductive and oncogenic effects and chemicals (gases, volatile organic compounds (VOC's)) to which firefighters are exposed. The objectives of the study were to assess firefighter exposures to: (1) diesel emissions in firehalls; (2) contaminated self-contained-breathing-apparatus (SCBA's); and, (3) VOC's at fires. Carbon monoxide (CO) was used as a marker for diesel emissions. Air in SCBA cylinders was analyzed for chemical contaminants. The U.S. EPA TO-14 method for ambient air analysis was verified for the analysis of 144 VOC's in air samples collected in SummaTM canisters at experimental and municipal fires. Exposure groups were determined from firehall assignment and vehicle responses to alarms. Estimation of the percentage of time that firefighters used respiratory protection at fires was obtained from records kept for SCBA refills. The mean maximum concentration of CO measured during the operation of two fire trucks in unventilated garages was 4.1 +/- 2.6 ppm (mean +/- SD, n = 16). A linear relationship existed between levels of CO, CO2 and NO2 in diesel emissions. By implication, using CO as a marker, firefighter exposure to diesel emissions was low. Some SCBA's were found to contain levels of CO (up to 250 ppm) consistent with possible COHb poisoning. Distinctive firefighter exposure groups were identified. A Montreal firefighter attended some 19 to 62 fires per year (depending on firehall assignment), 46% being structural fires. Respiratory protection was used for 6% of the time spent at the firescene. No new or novel toxic VOC's were found in fire samples and a characteristic "fingerprint" of VOC's was identified. Three potential carcinogens (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, styrene) accounted for 25% of the 123 VOC's found in fires, maximum levels of these being 11, 5 and 2 ppm, respectively. Since the results suggest that firefighters are not exposed to high levels of carcinogenic VOC's, why then do epidemiological studies reflect adverse health outcomes?</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ecobichon, Don (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w4120.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn79k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Toxicology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579v01n"><dcterms:title>The identification of collagenase-generated cleavage products of type II collagen using anti-neoepitope antibodies /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Billinghurst, Robert Clark.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The degradation of type II collagen, the major collagen of articular cartilage, is thought to be initiated by a specific cleavage within its triple helical domain by one or more of MMP-1 (collagenase-1), MMP-8 (collagenase-2), and MMP-13 (collagenase-3). We demonstrate the direct involvement of increased collagenase activity in type II collagen cleavage, in osteoarthritic (OA) human femoral condylar cartilage, and in IL-1 stimulated mature bovine nasal and articular cartilages, by developing and using antibodies reactive to carboxy-terminal (COL-3/4Cshort) and amino-terminal (COL2-1/4N1) neoepitopes generated by cleavage of native type II collagen by these collagenases. A secondary cleavage followed the initial cleavage produced by recombinant human MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13. This generated neoepitope COL2-1/4N2. These cleavage sites were first seen mainly around superficial chondrocytes in young cartilages, and then with increasing age (non-arthritic) and severity of OA, in deeper regions of human femoral articular cartilage. This pattern of cleavage was similar and correlated with that described for type II collagen denaturation. There were significantly higher neoepitope levels in OA compared to adult non-arthritic cartilages, determined by immunostain grading. Moreover, there was significantly more COL2-3/4Cshort epitope in extracts of OA articular and IL-stimulated bovine nasal cartilages, compared to normal nonstimulated cartilages, determined by immunoassay. A synthetic preferential inhibitor of MMP-13 significantly reduced the spontaneous release of COL2-3/4Cshort from human OA cartilage explant cultures. Moreover, this inhibitor and a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor significantly reduced the IL-1 stimulated generation of this neoepitope and the COL2-3/4m intrachain epitope in bovine nasal and articular cartilages.

The service model is coupled to both a mixed-layer ocean model and a 1-layer thermodynamic atmospheric model which allows for an ice-albedo feedback. Land is represented by a 6-meter thick layer with a constant base temperature. A 10-year integration including both thermodynamic and dynamic effects and incorporating prescribed climatological wind stress and ocean current data was performed in order for the model to reach a stable periodic seasonal cycle. The commonly observed lead complexes, along which sliding and opening of adjacent ice floes occur in the Arctic sea-ice cover, are well reproduced in this simulation. In particular, shear lines extending from the western Canadian Archipelago toward the central Arctic, often observed in winter satellite images, are present. The ice edge is well positioned both in winter and summer using this thermodynamically coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere model. The results also yield a sea-ice circulation and thickness distribution over the Arctic which are in good agreement with observations. The model also produces an increase in ice formation associated with the dilatation of the ice medium along sliding lines. In this model, incident energy absorbed by the ocean melts ice laterally and warms the mixed layer, causing a smaller ice retreat in the summer. This cures a problem common to many existing thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice models. The origin and space-time evolution of Beaufort Sea ice anomalies are studied using data and the sea-ice model described above. In particular, the influence of river runoff, atmospheric temperature and wind anomalies in creating anomalous sea ice condition in the Beaufort Sea is studied. The sea-ice model is then used to track the position of an ice anomaly as it is transported by the Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar Drift Stream out of the Arctic Basin. It can be inferred from driftwood data collected in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago that very different sea-ice drift patterns were present in the Arctic Ocean during the Holocene. In this study, the sea-ice model described above is used to examine the different modes of Arctic sea-ice circulation during this period, and also to infer characteristics of century-to-millennial scale changes in Arctic atmospheric circulation.

The results of this study indicate that social interaction influences the moral reasoning of auditors.

At a practical level, these findings suggest that auditors should be encouraged to prescriptively discuss moral dilemmas with others of high levels of moral development as this tends to result in the use of more principled moral reasoning.

Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the virus-induced destruction of T cells, including direct cytopathic effects of the virus, induction of apoptosis, and killing of infected or bystander CD4+ T cells by the cytotoxic immune response. Also, since HIV-1 is a retrovirus, it has been proposed that, like mouse mammary tumor viruses (MMTV), it could encode a protein with superantigenic properties, which could, by itself, sequentially anergize and delete CD4+ T cells expressing specific T cell receptor (TCR) V$ beta$ determinants. In order to reveal the existence of such molecules in HIV infection, different cohorts of HIV-infected subjects were studied by PCR and flow cytometry, including HIV-discordant monozygotic twins, HIV-infected and uninfected children from HIV-infected mothers, and patients undergoing primary, acute HIV infection. The presence of TCR $ beta$ chain repertoire perturbations not normally observed in uninfected subjects was revealed in each of these systems. These results supported the existence of an HIV-associated superantigen (SAg). However, high-level V$ beta$-specific expansions of CD8+ T cells were also observed in acutely-infected patients, and in HIV-infected children from HIV-infected mothers. These expansions were oligoclonal, and comprised cells that possessed cytotoxic activity directed against HIV-infected cells, suggesting that these cell populations were part of the primary immune response to HIV-1 infection. These expansions were also transient, encompassing defined expansion and decline phases. In some cases, disappearance of these highly expanded effectors occurred while circulating virus titers were still extremely high, and in absence of viral mutation within the cognate CTL epitopes. This suggested that disappearance of these cells resulted from a process of clonal exhaustion, a mechanism by which differentiated peripheral cytotoxic effectors are deleted in presence of overwhelming levels of antigen. Transient, high-level V$ beta$-specific expansions of cytolytic T cells might represent a fundamental characteristic of primary antiviral responses not only in the context of HIV infection, but also in other acute viral diseases. As well, clonal deletion constitutes a new mechanism of viral escape that could result in the base-line CTL repertoire being progressively restricted during the course of HIV infection and HIV-associated disease.

The desire for a low-rate digital representation of speech is often contrary to the demand for a high quality speech reconstruction. In this thesis we present a new speech compression technique designed for near toll quality speech coding at bit rates as low as 4 kb/s. In low-rate speech coding based on linear prediction (LP), poor modelling of the LP excitation for voiced, quasi-periodic segments contributes to the degradation of the quality of the reconstructed speech. In this dissertation, we present a new speech coding method designed for improved modelling of the LP excitation. Conceptually, the LP excitation is decomposed into a series of underlying pitch pulses and a simultaneous unvoiced noise-like signal. The underlying pitch pulses are estimated from noisy observations, i.e. the pitch pulses extracted from the LP residual. Since the pulses change little from one time instant to another, we call our representation the Pitch Pulse Evolution (PPE) model. The PPE model provides a framework to analyze and effectively control the periodicity of voiced speech. We have developed a robust algorithm for extracting noisy pitch pulses from the LP residual based on error minimization with respect to a set of model pulses, and we have examined a number of methods for calculating the underlying pulses. The evolving pitch pulse waveshapes, the pulse positions, and the unvoiced signal are encoded separately. The positions and the shapes of the underlying pulses need only be coded infrequently, and the characteristics of intermediate pulses are obtained by interpolation. The software implementation of a 4 kb/s PPE coder is described. The main features of the implemented PPE coder are: a novel approach to pitch analysis; estimation of evolving pitch pulses which enables control over the pulse characteristics; and a unique coding scheme which avoids the time dilation and contraction of individual pitch pulses found in other waveform interpolation coders.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bg818.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397991j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
