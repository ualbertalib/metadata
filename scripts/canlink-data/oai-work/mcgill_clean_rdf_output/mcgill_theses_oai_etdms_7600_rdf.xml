Great poets spoke out in the Drama with a frank strength, - mirrored forth human nature with reality and ideality. "Look in thine heart and write", the keynote of those sonnets in which Sir Philip Sidney gives expression to his ideal passion, might have been Marlowe's motto, or S&amp;akspere1s, or Ben Jonson's.

If you UNSCOTCH us you will find us damned mischievous Englishmen. The restless and yet laborious and constantly watchful character of the people, their desire for speculation in politics or anything else, only restrained by some proud feelings about their own country, now become antiquated, and which bold measures will tend much to destroy, will make them under a wrong direction, the most formidable revolutionists who ever took the field of innovation."

The absorption of gas by a liquid is what is ordinarily known as the solution of the gas by the liquid. The absorption of gas by a solid, sometimes called "occlusion," includes (1) the mechanical retention and adhesion of the gas or vapour in the crevices between particles of the solid, and (2) in the capillary spaces of individual particles, and also (3) the "'adsorption," or condensation upon the surface of the solid, of the gaseous molecules, this condensation being due to molecular attraction between the gas and solid.
