Cross section values for the reaction Cu63(p,pn)Cu62 were determined up to proton energies of 22.5 Mev. At this energy the cross section is 775 millibarns and is still rising slowly. The excitation curves are rather smooth. The curves do not have any major peaks like in oxygen and there is no sure evidence for minor peaks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

The inferiority of the bilingual, not only in the second language, but also in the first, has been suggested by severa! investigators (e.g. Smith, 1939). On the other hand, the view is commonly expressed by educationists that overlearning the first language hinders the acquisition of a second whereas the early introduction of a second language facilitates its acquisition.

Z.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The word "career" has attained a striking popularity with the public personnel administrator on both sides of the Atlantic. Most frequently seen in recruitment literature, it is also found quite prominently in writings concerned with different aspects of public personnel administration. The concept of "career" has obviously been growing in importance, both with the administrator and with the ordinary staff member, and both have become increasingly concerned with it. The aims of this enquiry are to study the nature of the concept of career, both in theory and practice, as it applies to the Federal civil service of Canada; to investigate its functions in the Federal civil service and its environment; to compare it with ‘career’ as it applies in theory and in practice in the civil services of Great Britain and the United States; and finally, to evaluate the development and present position of the ‘career service’ in the civil services of these three countries in the light of their present needs and operative trends.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Callard, K.

It is unusual in its life cycle in that it is parthenogenetic in its parasitic phase and normally has a bisexual generation outside of the host, thereby increasing the number of potential infective larvae. In addition, however, the bisexual generation may be omitted when the larvae developing from the eggs of the parthenogenetic female develop directly into infective larvae instead of free living adults. The conditions causing these changes, in spite of extensive investigations by various workers are still largely unknown, and many problems still exist.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.
