processing in mines and mills producing crocidolite, amosite and chrysotile asbestos were measured by using light optical and electron microscopy. Airborne fibres of different asbestos types had markedly different size and shape distributions. For a given asbestos type, airborne fibres collected at various stages of processing differed in their size distributions but the differences were considerably less than between fibre types. Most of the airborne fibres to which miners and millers were exposed were short, thin and thus respirable. The proportions of long fibres in the air of crocidolite and chrysotile mines and mills were small compared to those in amosite mining and milling environments. The physical parameters which best differentiated crocidolite fibres from other asbestos fibre types were aspect ratio, which was higher, and proportions of long thin fibres (0.06 - 0.2 (mu)m in diameter and &gt; 5 (mu)m in length). Median mass of amosite fibres was more than 108 and 13 times higher than the median mass of chrysotile and crocidolite fibres respectively. Median true diameter of amosite fibres was approximately 4 and 3 times higher than median true diameters of chrysotile and crocidolite fibres respectively. Median true length of amosite fibres was more than 4.5 and 1.9 times higher than median true lengths of chrysotile and crocidolite fibres respectively. The differences in size and shape of airborne fibres have important implications for setting of work environmental standards and explaining differences in health risks associated with different fibre types.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w5676.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z618n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Asbestos industry -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asbestos fibers -- Analysis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bm51j"><dcterms:title>Static load-bearing characteristics of the in vitro talocrural articulation subjected to internal-external torque</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fraser, Gregory A.

The experimental investigation involved the design and fabrication of several testing and measurement instruments, including a three-dimensional joint loading apparatus, a six degrees-of-freedom displacement measuring device, and several implantable, non-destructive ligament tension transducers. The stress distribution in the talocrural mortise was estimated using a three-dimensional finite element model with simulated physiological loading conditions. The effects of the talocrural joint flexion angle, the subtalar joint angle, and the amount of weightbearing across the joint were examined. The results showed a varying joint behavior for the same torque application across the range of variables studied. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a mechanism for the talocrural joint response to torque was proposed. In addition, the results have been discussed in terms of their clinical significance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r65g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm51j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human mechanics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ankle.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bq14r"><dcterms:title>The antinomy of human freedom and moral restraint in Paul Ramsey's medical ethics /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Redcliffe, Gary Lorne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Paul Ramsey's medical ethics is built from a philosophical antinomy: Premise, the human being is a creature of will; Proposition, the human will is a free will; Contrary Proposition, the human will is a not-free will.

The rifting of continental crust initiated with the deposition of a sequence of volcanics dominated by pillowed basalts. An overlying volcanic sequence began with the deposition of rhyodacites and other felsic volcaniclastics, intercalated with mafic flows and tuffs. These, in turn, are overlain by peridotitic and pillowed pyroxenitic komatiite flows and then by pillowed basalts. The rocks in this Archean belt have experienced at least two periods of deformation and attained amphibolite facies. The early voluminous basalts of the first sequence probably reflect the eruption of steady state liquids from periodically replenished, periodically tapped, magma chambers located near the interface of an early crust and Archean mantle. With time the mafic crust overlying these magma chambers, melted to produce tonalitic-granodioritic magmas. These magmas rose and experienced amphibole fractionation. Residual liquids produced by this fractionation erupted as rhyodacites contemporanously with later basalts. The eruption of komatiitic liquids indicates a major failure of the crustal screen enabling primitive magmas to reach the surface. The spectrum of primitive komatiitic compositions reflects variable degrees (15 to 40%) of partial melting of a garnet lherzolite in the Archean mantle. Pyroxenitic komatiite magmas represent the least degree of melting with garnet remaining in the mantle residue. Garnet was completely consumed, however, in the more extensive melting involved in the production of the peridotitic komatiite magmas. As the volcanic pile of the second volcanic sequence grew crustal magma reservoirs were re-established. Primitive komatiitic magmas held in these reservoirs underwent extensive crystal fractionation to yield residual steady state liquids which erupted as the upper basalts of the second volcanic sequence.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n459.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182m041</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rocks, Igneous.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Petrogenesis -- James Bay Region</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nm32b"><dcterms:title>Analysis and continuous simulation of secure-economic operation of power systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fahmideh-Vojdani, A. (Alireza)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis, for the most part, is concerned with the application of continuous optimization to the secure-economic dispatching of thermal power plants. The general concept of the continuous simulation of the optimum operation of power systems is introduced. This is the characterization of the solution trajectory of the underlying dispatching model as the loads vary along a forecasted trajectory, or as the system parameters continuously change. An efficient continuation algorithm is developed which characterizes the solution trajectory of a secure-economic dispatch model, given a piecewise linear trajectory of the bus loads, parameterized in terms of the system load. The algorithm considers piecewise quadratic generation cost functions, a DC load flow model, and the limits on generations and power flows in the normal and post transmission line outage states. The solution trajectory is provided in an analytic form over the entire loadability range of the system. Applications of the algorithms to systems with up to 118 buses show that it is fast, reliable, and well-suited for many applications in power system planning and operation. The continuation algorithm, as the thesis describes, in essence applies the Incremental Loading procedure to the secure-economic dispatching. In this light, it can be viewed as a natural extension of the highly successful classical dispatching techniques such as Lambda Dispatching. A reexamination of the classical economic dispatching is presented early in the thesis. Highlights of this phase of the study include: generation scheduling with general (i.e., possibly non-convex) generation cost functions, an analytic study of the Valve Point Loading based on the general characterization of the valve loop based system incremental cost curve, an in-depth study of the system incremental cost in the context of the modified coordination equations, and a stochastic formulation and analysis of economic dispatching of regulating plants.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj84b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm32b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric power systems -- Load dispatching -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrothermal electric power systems -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nr85w"><dcterms:title>Structure and organization of the leghemoglobin genes in soybean</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brisson, Normand, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The organization and structure of the leghemoglobin (Lb) genes in soybean have been investigated. Using molecular cloning techniques, a Lb-cDNA recombinant molecule, pLb1, was prepared and characterized. Hybridization of this clone of genomic DNA revealed the presence of at least seven Lb genes in the soybean genome. The arrangement of these genes appeared to be the same in DNA isolated from infected or uninfected tissues. The plasmid pLb1 was also used to isolate three Lb sequences from a genomic library constructed in (lamda) Charon4 vector. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that one Lb gene, present on an 11.5 kilobases (kb) Eco RI genomic fragment, spans about 1 200 nucleotides and appears to code for Lbc(,3). Its coding sequence is interrupted at amino acid positions 32 to 33, 68 to 69 and 103 to 104. The intervening sequences, as well as the 5' and 3' flanking regions of this gene, contain some consensus sequences found in other eukaryotic genes. The length of the 5'-untranslated region is 49 bases as determined by nuclease S1 mapping. R-loop analysis of the recombinant phage containing the 11.5 kb Eco RI fragment showed that another Lb gene is located 2.5 kb away. The nucleotide sequences of the second gene showed that this gene is incomplete, containing only two exons. The deduced amino acid sequence of this gene, although showing 78% homology with the corresponding region of the other Lb gene, is not represented in any of the known Lb proteins. Both genes are oriented in the same direction with respect to the coding strand. Analysis of the sequence present in a second genomic clone containing a 4.2 kb Eco RI fragment revealed a truncated Lb gene showing homology with the last exon and the non-coding region at the 3' end of the two other Lb genes. A very high homology is found among the nucleotide sequence of the Lbc(,3), Lba and Lbc(,1) genes.

The key step involved the asymmetric cycloaddition of azidoacetyl chloride to the cinnamylidene Schiff base of protected D-threonine to generate the desired monocyclic cis (beta)-lactam diastereomer (9:1). The absolute configuration of the final product was confirmed by comparing its antimicrobial activity with that of the corresponding racemate. The influence of (a) the (beta)-chiral center in the starting (alpha)-amino acid, (b) the bulk of the carboxylic acid and (c) the distribution of bulk throughout the imine on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction was studied. The absence of racemization during the cycloaddition was demonstrated by the use of deuterated precursors. The great potential of D-glucosamine derivatives as chiral templates in this reaction was clearly illustrated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042t808.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp80w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antibiotics -- Synthesis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lactams.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fp815"><dcterms:title>Application of a three-dimensional cloud model to the study of GATE showers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Turpeinen, Olli.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An analysis of 5 minute resolution Quadra data on day 261 of GATE (0953 - 1451 GMT) is made to yield statistics of maximum area, echo top, lifetime and maximum reflectivity factor in medium-sized convective cells. The procedure generates a unique data set which is used to compare with the results of a three-dimensional cloud model and to study cloud interactions and merging processes between convective echoes. The results, obtained by tracking 140 echoes throughout their lifetime, indicate that the maximum area is log-normally distributed, 90% of the echoes being smaller than 40 km('2) and living shorter than 60 min. The modes of the maximum echo top and maximum reflectivity factor distributions are around 2.5 km and 30 dBz, respectively. A fully three-dimensional cloud model including precipitation processes is used to simulate convective clouds on this day. A number of single cloud experiments are carried out to verify the numerical results against the radar observations. In addition, several two-cloud developments are simulated to study cloud interactions and merging processes. Comparison of the modelled echo parameters against the observed ones indicates a fair degree of realism in the simulations. The computed maximum reflectivity factor, however, is considerably higher than that of the observations because of the unrealistic drop-size distribution assumed in the model. The two-cloud simulations suggest that both the alignment of the clouds in relation to the wind shear vector and the spacing between the cells are important factors in determining the type of cloud interactions. Merging takes place when the spacing between the two elements becomes small enough. The numerical simulations indicate that the perturbation pressure structure is crucial to trigger echo merging.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m61t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp815</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Clouds -- Mathematical models -- Evaluation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs55h"><dcterms:title>Anatomical study on the choice of pathways by regenerating optic axons in the goldfish following various surgical manipulations of the retinotectal system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lo, Raymond.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The pattern of regenerating optic axons following various surgical manipulations in the goldfish brain has been studied using ('3)H proline radioauthography. The results demonstrate that in most cases severed optic axons regenerate preferentially into degenerating axonal pathways. It is therefore suggested that the degenerating axonal debris and the concomitant glial proliferation in a degenerating pathway, in some way, influences the entry of regenerating optic axons into the path. However, in view of the exceptional cases in which regenerating optic fibers either failed to grow into a degenerating pathway, or grew into pathways which apparently did not degenerate, it is further suggested that the influence of the degenerating pathways on the regenerating optic axons is neither 'compelling' nor 'restrictive'. Similarly, although the results also demonstrate that denervated optic terminal zones may influence the choice of pathways by regenerating axons and that the proximity of a pathway to the regenerating optic axons may do so as well, such influences are also neither 'compelling' nor 'restrictive'. Taken together, the data presented here indicate that the guidance of regenerating optic axons is probably influenced by a combination of these factors.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr269.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs55h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nervous system -- Regeneration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishes -- Nervous system.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Axons.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Goldfish -- Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kr32p"><dcterms:title>Thermopower and resistivity of binary metallic glasses</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Baibich, Mario Norberto</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The resistivity and thermopower of two series of amorphous alloys have been measured between 4 and 300K. The alloys studied are MgZn and CuZr, both in the largest concentration range available as amorphous materials. The alloys were measured in both the 'as made' and 'relaxed' states, as well as some partial or totally crystallized samples. The simple Ziman theory was found at variance with the experimental results in both cases (even for MgZn, proven to be free-electron like as required by the theory). A simple two component model is proposed as an extreme simplification of the Faber-Ziman theory of liquid metallic alloys. The excellent agreement obtained indicates that metallic glasses should be considered as the alloys they really are. A full Faber-Ziman calculation is performed for CuZr and from this follows the conclusion that the term containing the energy dependence of the pseudo-potential (r), usually assumed to be small, is probably of comparable magnitude to that of the disorder scattering (q). The suggested correlations between the electron-phonon mass-enhancement parameter (lamda) (determined from superconductivity experiments) and the thermopowers are studied and both found not to be valid for CuZr amorphous alloys.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x485h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kr32p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Binary systems (Metallurgy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electric resistance.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metallic glasses.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw90b"><dcterms:title>The effect of weak non-linearity on vertically propagating internal gravity waves in the atmosphere /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ibrahim, Mostafa M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The linear and weakly non-linear limits of two-dimensional gravity waves in an incompressible, inviscid and stably stratified atmosphere are studied. The linear results indicate the growth of waves propagating upward leading to the breakdown of the linear theory. The three-wave resonant interaction theory indicates an energy cascade from a vertically propagating wave (primary wave) to waves having smaller absolute values of Doppler shifted frequency ((OMEGA)). When the non-dimensional parameter (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED...PLEASE SEE DAI) is in the range "1 to about 0.8" (N being the Brunt-Vaisala frequency), the energy of the primary wave is transferred to bands of small amplitude waves. The triads in these bands include a member with the same vertical group velocity as the primary wave while other triads contain a member with larger vertical group velocity. The band widths approach zero as the primary wave amplitude is reduced. The analysis suggests that the three-wave resonant interactions should be replaced by a higher order approximation in this limit.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm86j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw90b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gravity waves.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atmospheric waves.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A736665327"><dcterms:title>The water balance of a lichen tundra underlain by permafrost /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wright, Richard Kyle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A detailed study of the water balance of a lichen-heath tundra underlain by permafrost was begun in September 1976 near Schefferville, Quebec. The study was centred on a 0.9 ha hillside and an adjacent 100 ha catchment. The study revealed that the transfer of latent heat by moisture transport occurs during the development of the active layer as well as during freeze-up. The transfer of sensible and latent heat does not have a major impact on the maximum depth of the active layer on hillslopes, but does strongly control the maximum depth of thaw in the valley bottoms. The study also demonstrated that a simple form of the Priestley-Taylor model yields accurate estimates of evapotranspiration from several types of surfaces. A water budget model based on the Priestley-Taylor model gave an accurate estimate of the seasonal runoff from the experimental catchment. A daily water budget model indicated that a significant proportion (31%) of the net runoff (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) is stored within the still-frozen part of the active layer (primarily in the valley bottoms) early in the thaw season. That stored water is released only when the active layer approaches its maximum depth of thaw.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hw243.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736665327</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Groundwater -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water balance (Hydrology) -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tundra soils -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Frozen ground -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville Region.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kr33z"><dcterms:title>Philo and the Haggada as treated in modern scholarship, 1875-1975</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Classics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wardy, Bilhah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation traces the research done by a number of modern scholars on the relationship between Philo and the Palestinian Haggada. The intrepretation proceeds by analyzing Philo's writings and midrashic texts and considering the works of modern scholarship pertinent to the subject. The introduction outlines the main problems, the plan of the dissertation, a classification of Philo's treatises and the central events in his life. The origin, development, and different methods of the Judaic Midrash comprise the subject of chapter one. Each of the following chapters presents a scholar and his opinions on Philonic problems. The most significant issues considered are: the degree and nature of influence, perhaps mutual, between Palestinian Haggada and Philonic exegesis; techniques of Philonic exegesis; Philo as philospher; Philo and mystery religion; coherence in Philo's writings; Philo's knowledge of Hebrew; the proportions of Judaism and Hellenism in Philo. The purpose of the conclusion is twofold: (1) to sum up and compare the scholarly views presented in the previous chapters; (2) to state my conclusions on Philo as a biblical exegete and to identify his position in Western thought.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pd804.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kr33z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philo, of Alexandria.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
