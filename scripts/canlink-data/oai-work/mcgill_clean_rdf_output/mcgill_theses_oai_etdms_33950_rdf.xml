The model consists of three terms. The first term describes the chemical affinity between the X or A atom and its nearest neighbours. The second term accounts for the elastic energy due to the volume mismatch between the X atom and the x A-site. The third term is a structural energy term and is present only for d-electron atoms and accounts for the preference of these metals to crystallize in the bcc, fcc or hcp structures depending on the number of valence electrons per atom. The probability of the substitution is calculated using the Boltzmann distribution assuming that each formula unit of the compound has a maximum of one X atom, and that the X atoms are uniformly distributed throughout the compound. The model was tested successfully for Fe-substitutions in various compounds. The experimental fractional site occupations of the X atoms in the Fe-sites were determined from neutron diffraction measurements. The results show that the model precisely determines the sites preferentially occupied by the X atoms; calculated values are within 40% of the experimental values for all X elements. Moreover, the model correctly predicts sites that are avoided by the X elements. The model calculations for site occupations show that all three terms have to be taken into account to give a quantitative explanation to the experimentally observed substitutions. The agreement between the experimental and calculated values obtained for Fe-substitutions in the 2-17, 3-29, 1-12 and 2-14-1 structures can be improved if the structural term for Fe is assumed to be zero as the Fe structural transition (from bcc to fcc) occurs near the annealing temperatures of the compounds and thus the difference in the structural energy between bcc-Fe and fcc-Fe could be neglected at that temperature. A further improvement can be made if one assumes that the sites which have an irregular shape, such as 9d (2-17), 8j1 (2-14-1), 2c, 4e, 8j4 (3-29) and 8f (1-12) have smaller "effective" volumes, i.e. the "effective" radii of the spherical holes are estimated from the average distances of the closest nearest neighbours. An understanding of the site substitution mechanisms in intermetallic compounds allows us to explain structure-sensitive physical phenomena even in cases where experimental structural data are unavailable. We have studied the anomalous thermal expansion along the c-axis in 2-17 compounds and the reduced rate of the nitrogen bulk diffusion in Nd2Fe 17-deltaXdelta for some X elements. The proposed model for calculating site occupancies is general in scope and can be applied to any intermetallic compound where the site occupations of elemental substitutions need to be determined. The model can be improved if one can determine the contribution of the structural term in the formation of compounds containing two or more transition metals. In order to improve the precision of the elastic term experimental data on the temperature dependence of the bulk and shear moduli of the elements and the compounds will be needed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Altounian, Zaven (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw268.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d168k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440v389"><dcterms:title>Putting pointer analysis to work</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ghiya, Rakesh.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pointer analysis has recently been a subject of active research. The focus of most techniques is on: (1) estimating the targets for stack-directed pointers, (2) computing relationships between heap-directed pointers, or (3) developing faster or more space-efficient algorithms. However, little attention has been paid to actually using the results of pointer analysis for compiler optimizations. This thesis addresses the problem of how to apply pointer analysis information to a wide variety of compiler applications. That is, once the pointer relationships are computed, what can we do with this information? How do we put pointer analysis to work? We have used the pointer analyses implemented in the framework of the McCAT C compiler as the basis of our study. These analyses include, points-to analysis for stack-directed pointers, and connection and shape analyses for heap-directed pointers. We demonstrate that the fundamental problem is that one must be able to compare the memory locations read/written via pointer indirections, at different programs points, and one must also be able to summarize the effect of pointer references over regions in the program. It is straightforward to compute read/write sets for indirections involving stack-directed pointers using points-to information. However, for heap-directed pointers we show that one needs to introduce the notion of anchor handles into the connection analysis and then compute read/write sets to the heap with respect to these anchor handles. Based on the read/write sets we show how to extend traditional optimizations like common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant removal to include pointer references. In the same vein, we propose a novel optimization called location-invariant removal. We also demonstrate the use of our information on more advanced techniques such as array dependence testing and program understanding. We have implemented our techniques in the McCAT C compiler, and we demonstrate examples of applying our methods on a set of pointer-intensive C benchmarks, as well as present concrete empirical data on the improvements achieved. We also present techniques to use pointer analysis information for detecting parallelism in C programs with recursive data structures. In addition to the read/write sets, we use shape analysis information and data structure access paths for dependence testing. The dependence tests are specifically tailored for detecting three parallelism patterns that frequently arise in C programs. These patterns include, function calls that access disjoint sub-pieces of tree-like data structures, pointer-chasing loops that traverse list-Eke data structures, and array-based loops which operate on arrays of pointers pointing to disjoint data structures. To identify loop parallelism, we introduce special tests for identifying loop-carried dependences in the context of recursive data structures. We have implemented the tests in the framework of the McCAT C compiler, and present experimental results for a set of C benchmark programs to evaluate their effectiveness.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000190c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v389</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784n44c"><dcterms:title>Adherence to screening mammography guidelines by recently-licensed family physicians</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haggerty, Jean L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Practice guidelines for screening mammography diverge on the recommended age at which systematic screening should begin for women aged 40 to 69 years. 'Routine' guidelines recommend screening starting at 40 years; 'age-selective', at 50 years and only for younger women who have a first-degree family history of breast cancer. Objectives. (1) To estimate and compare recently-licensed family physicians' adherence to 'routine' and 'age-selective' guidelines in women aged 40 to 69 years, (2) To identify intrinsic physician and practice environment factors which predict referral rates for women aged 50 to 69 years as well as age-selective referral. Study Design. A census sample of 743 recently-licensed family physicians was followed for 18-months of incipient medical practice. Mammograms were identified from physician claims to the Regie de l'assurance-maladie du Quebec for every clinically eligible woman aged 40 to 69 years who had a complete physical examination by a study physician in a community setting (primary care practice). Adherence to 'routine' guidelines was measured as the percent of women with a screening mammogram referred by the study physician in the study period. Adherence to 'age-selective' guidelines was referral rates in older (50-to-69 years) minus younger (40-to-49 years) women. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of mammography referral. Results: Study physicians referred 6% (SD: 10) of younger women and 12% (SD: 15) of older women in their primary care practice. The correlation or ranks of adherence to 'routine' and 'selective' guidelines corresponded poorly (Spearman r = 0.51). Factors positively associated with higher referral rates in women aged 50 to 69 years were female gender, prevention competence, later medical school graduation, the combination of comprehensive inquiry and continuity care, and the extent of community-based care. Negatively associated factors were higher patient volume and shared primar</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tamblyn, Robyn (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v474c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n44c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225c75v"><dcterms:title>La spécificité des structures thématiques à retour dans l'œuvre instrumental de Brahms /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>De Médicis, François.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation develops an analytical model for studying the specific nature of "themes of return" in the instrumental music of Brahms. Such a formal type, whose most familiar examples are the period and the small ternary, is distinguished by the presence of a "return," that is, the restatement, after intervening material, of its initiating material, which performs the same function as it did in its first appearance. Brahms' return structures are analyzed according to four parameters: cadence, return, phraseology (which combines aspects of grouping, accentuation and rhythmic activity) and variation of tension (produced by the combined action of such factors as the curve of the melodic line, dynamics and surface and harmonic rhythms). Brahms' use of cadence and return differs fundamentally from that of classical composers. His cadential gestures are subjected to a looser categorization and articulate broader tonal relations than those found in classical practice. With respect to his treatment of return, he differs from classical composers largely in the influence of underlying factors, such as greater continuity in texture or a tendency to avoid an over-predictibility in cadential organization. The study of cadences and returns thus leads to the identification of formal traits characteristic of Brahms, including the use of structures beginning off tonic harmony. Both the phraseology and the variation of tension in Brahms' themes exhibit a striking diversity in organization. For example, the phraseology may feature a grouping hierarchy based on a binary division combined with an irregular pattern of accentuation, an additive structure associated with a regular accentuation, or asymmetrical groupings. Variations in tension are often organized around a climax; however, the size and range of the fluctuations in tension can vary considerably, the accumulation of intensity which prepares the climax may be accomplished by different combinations of parameters, and each climax may occupy a different position within a given segment. Return structures, so abundant in the Brahms' instrumental music, feature a great variety in their organization. This abundance and diversity is due to the structural type's ready adaptability to the particular demands of Brahms' musical style.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McLean, Donald R.

The first part of the research characterizes the multiple-access interference (MAI) in an integrated DS-CDMA system. The system model is designed to accommodate bursty packed-based data services (e.g., packet or multimedia data) in addition to stream-based services (e.g., voice or facsimile) on a shared spectrum basis. Consequently, this study incorporates features associated with both packet- and stream-based services in order to provide a complete interference characterization. The results of a detailed and precise simulation study are presented in which the influence of traffic burstiness, voice activity, spatial distribution of mobiles, and transmitter powers on the fluctuation of the interference and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is assessed. The interference and SIR statistics are also evaluated in terms of the cumulative distribution function. Since a DS-CDMA network is interference limited, studies of this type are essential for system design, capacity evaluation, and bandwidth management. The second part of the research explores adaptive interference suppression techniques. The motivation of this segment of the work comes from our observation in the first part of the research that MAI may be modeled as a wideband, time-varying stochastic process. The challenge is twofold: (i) interference suppression techniques should consider demodulation in a dynamic environment (e.g., entry/exit of users), rather than a static situation and (ii) interference suppression techniques must also address the worst case scenario where the sources and sinks of stream-based services must be able to handle data in bursts on a realtime basis and without the knowledge of different parameters and signature sequences of the interferers. A neural network based decision feedback scheme for interference suppression in the CDMA context is proposed and investigated. It is demonstrated that a decision feedback functional link equalizer (DFFLE) network in combination with an eigenvector network can closely approximate a Bayesian receiver with significant advantages, such as improved BER performance and adaptive operation. The convergence performance and error propagation of the DFFLE receiver are also considered and show reasonable promise for third generation wireless DS-CDMA networks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morgera, Salvatore D.

To explore this mechanism of recombination an assay was developed, designated as Recombination Access Mapping (RAM), that uses ectopic gene targeting coupled with two color FISH analysis. Using RAM, the integration sites of the gene targeting vector with respect to the target locus were determined for ectopic gene targeting in a murine fibroblast cell line (LTA). The distribution of integration sites was found to be bimodal during ectopic gene targeting, being either within 2--3 Mb of the target or on distinct chromosomes from the chromosome carrying the target locus. Both inter and intrachromosomal sites appeared to be equally accessible to the targeting vector with site specific variations. In contrast, illegitimate integration of a transgene was found to occur randomly in the LTA cell line. Interestingly, interphase analysis indicated that vector sequences which had integrated ectopically in other chromosomes than the target co-localized with the target locus at a significant frequency as compared to random unlinked loci. Mechanistically, the homologous recombination event that produces the extrachromosomal recombinant DNA molecule, following ectopic gene targeting or interplasmid recombination, was demonstrated to potentiate or commit the recombinant DNA to integration in the genome at the site of a double-strand break (DSB). This data suggests that extrachromosomal and chromosomal DSB repair are coupled, and therefore the integration site of the transgene during ectopic gene targeting is most likely a DSB in close proximity spatially to the target locus. The conclusion of this thesis is that RAM can be used to determine which chromosomal domains within the genome are accessible to a given genetic locus. Thus, RAM presents a new paradigm for the analysis of DN</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chartrand, Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p0968832.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860865w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462720h"><dcterms:title>Gothic Cabala : the anti-semitic spectropoetics of British Gothic literature</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Davison, Carol Margaret.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The figure of the Wandering Jew in British Gothic literature has been generally regarded as a static and romantic Everyman who signifies religious punishment, remorse, and alienation. In that it fails to consider the fact that the legend of the Wandering Jew signalled a noteworthy historical shift from theological to racial anti-Semitism, this reading has overlooked the significance of this figure's specific ethno-religious aspect and its relation to the figure of the vampire. It has hindered, consequently, the recognition of the Wandering Jew's relevance to the "Jewish Question," a vital issue in the construction of British national identity. In this dissertation, I chronicle the "spectropoetics" of Gothic literature---how the spectres, of Jewish difference and Jewish assimilation haunt the British Gothic novel. I trace this "spectropoetics" through medieval anti-Semitism, and consider its significance in addressing anxieties about the Crypto-Jew and the Cabala's role in secret societies during two major historic events concurrent with the period of classic Gothic literature---the Spanish Inquisition, a narrative element featured in many Gothic works, and the French Revolution, a cataclysmic event to which many Gothic works responded. In the light of this complex of concerns, I examine the role of the Wandering Jew in five Gothic works---Matthew G. Lewis's The Monk (1795), William Godwin's St. Leon (1799), Charles Robert Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's "Carmilla" (1872), and Brain Stoker's Dracula (1897). In my conclusion, I delineate the vampiric Wandering Jew's "eternal" role in addressing nationalist concerns by examining his symbolic preeminence in Nazi Germany.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kilgour, Maggie A.

It usually presents in the sixth decade with progressive swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), eye lid drooping (ptosis) and proximal limb weakness. Unique nuclear filament inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers are its pathological hallmark. This thesis charts the successful positional cloning of the gene responsible for OPMD, from its chromosomal localization by linkage to the identification of its causal mutations. A genome search using 166 polymorphic markers on a large French Canadian family established linkage to chromosome 14q11.2 - q13. Linkage analysis on 11 families of similar ancestry defined a 2 cM candidate interval. To better characterize the French Canadian founder effect we haplotyped 42 carrier chromosomes. Our molecular analysis confirms that a single OPMD mutation was introduced into this population. By combining genealogies with haplotype data we demonstrate that the mutation was likely brought to North America in 1648 by three French sisters. Our proposed Genealogy-based Estimate of Historical Meioses (GEHM) count fine-mapped the OPMD locus to a 0.26 cM (217 kb) candidate interval in chromosome 14q11. We isolated the poly (A) binding protein 2 (PABP2) gene from this region. A (GCG)6 repeat encoding a polyalanine tract located at the NH 2-terminus of the protein was expanded to (GCG)8-13 in the 144 OPMD families screened. The French Canadian (GCG)9 mutation appears to be the most frequent worldwide. Interestingly, more severe phenotypes were observed in composite heterozygotes for the (GCG) 9 mutation and a (GCG)7 allele found in 2% of the population, whereas homozygosity for the (GCG)7 allele leads to autosomal recessive OPMD. Thus the (GCG)7 allele is an example of a polymorphism which can act as either a modifier of a dominant phenotype or as a recessive mutation.

However, a critical hurdle that must be overcome for FSOIs to deliver on their promise is that of optical packaging. The objective of optical packaging in FSOIs is to implement an optical design within the specified alignment budget and support the associated optoelectronics. It is a multidisciplinary field combining aspects of mechanical, optical and electrical engineering. This thesis explores optical packaging issues for FSOIs such as: type of optical interconnect, impact of device technology, environmental effects, and fabrication issues. Approaches taken to address these issues in previous optical systems described in the literature are then studied; key points are the importance of improving diagnostic techniques and the benefits of microoptic/optoelectronic device integration. To further study these aspects, the optical packaging for a four-stage hybrid macrolens/lenslet FSOI backplane is designed, built, and characterized. A non-obtrusive, in-situ alignment diagnostic system which uses dedicated alignment beams running parallel to the main link is also designed, implemented and characterized. An analysis of optical crosstalk and signal-to-crosstalk ratio considerations due to misalignment is then presented and it is shown that crosstalk can be exploited to yield alignment diagnostic information at the expense of few additional components. A novel approach for simplifying prealignment of microoptics and optoelectronics during fabrication is then presented. This consists of using on-die reflective diffractive structures to generate reference marks for use during alignment and fabrication of integrated microoptic/optoelectronic packages. Future avenues of research are then discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Plant, David V.

The enzymatic extract from F. proliferalum showed the highest LOX activity. The lowest LOX activity was exhibited in the C. pyrenoidosa extract. At pH 8.0, LOX activity from F. oxysporum and S. cerevisiae was inhibited by potassium cyanide (KCN), exhibiting a non-competitive inhibitory effect; however, at pH 10.0, KCN had relatively little effect on enzyme activity. In addition, KCN markedly inhibited LOX activity from C. pyrenoidosa. In contrast, the results showed that the enzymatic activity from F. proliferatum remained relatively stable at KCN concentrations as high as 60 mM. The addition of 5 MM sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate was found to increase the enzymatic activity from F. oxysporum by 50.3 and 16.6% at pH 9.0 and 10.0, respectively, from F. proliferatum by 50%, and produced a noticeable eight-fold increase in the enzymatic activity from C. pyrenoidosa. Hydroquinone (HQ) resulted in a 2-fold increase in LOX activity from F. proliferalum whereas a competitive inhibitory effect on LOX activity from S. cerevisiae was observed at pH 8.0. The enzymes from the four sources demonstrated an overall preference towards linoleic acid, followed by linolenic acid. In addition, the enzymatic extract from F. proliferatum showed a strong preference towards the glycerol fatty acid esters. Linoleic acid was bioconverted into 9- and 13-hydroperoxides (HPODEs) by all four extracts; in addition, the LOX activity in the F. oxysporum extract produced the 10- and 12-HPODEs from linoleic acid while that of the C. pyrenoidosa extract produced only the 10-HPODE.

Also considered was the extent to which gender and family structure influenced the prevalence of these three conditions. Vulnerable teenagers were distinguished from their peers based on their inability to effectively manage the developmental task of individuation. The components of the individuation process considered included ego and cognitive autonomy, and parent and peer relatedness. Stress was measured based on self-reported exposure to conditions of threat, demand, or structural constraint. Indices of depression, problem behaviors, school performance, school absences, and teacher perceived risk were utilized to assess adjustment. Consonant with hypotheses that pronounced difficulty resolving a developmental task is characteristic of vulnerable individuals and that exposure to numerous psychosocial stressors puts individuals at-risk for maladjustment, adolescents who were either poorly individuated or highly stressed exhibited greater dysfunction than their peers. Also individuated or highly stressed exhibited greater dysfunction than their peers. Also consistent with expectations, the poorest overall adjustment was exhibited by vulnerable adolescents who were exposed to multiple stressors. Gender and family structure affected the incidence of vulnerability, elevated exposure to stress, and maladjustment. However, the impact of gender was inconsistent with hypotheses, as girls were found to be at lower risk for dysfunction than boys.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jacob A.

The focus is on verbs that participate in the causative/inchoative alternation, verbs whose lexico-semantic composition---[x CAUSE [ y BECOME predicate]]---is not matched by morphological derivation uniformly across, and even within, languages. The thesis adopts a templatic account to verb classes. Verbs are decomposed into primitive semantic predicates (CAUSE, BECOME, BE) which map onto an X-bar configuration as the heads of light verbs. Thematic roles like Agent and Theme occupy the specifiers. Different verb classes---alternating, transitive non-alternating, unaccusative and unergative verbs---derive from the interaction of semantic subpredicates and thematic roles. Transitivity alternations are determined by other narrower aspects of meaning: namely, the nature of the Agent role and the CAUSE subevent. Causative and anticausative morphology is the overt manifestation of the CAUSE and BECOME subpredicates. Causative errors in L1 acquisition have been attributed to the overgeneralization of the causative/inchoative alternation to unergative and unaccusative verbs. This study proposes that these errors result when children incorrectly map non-alternating transitive and intransitive verbs onto a default transitive template. By extending this proposal to the L2 acquisition situation, it is hypothesized that L2 learners of Turkish, Spanish and English of different language backgrounds and at lower proficiency levels also rely on this universal mechanism when learning transitivity alternations; L1 influence only plays a role with the overt/non-overt morphology of alternating verbs in these languages. Three independent but methodologically identical experimental studies on English, Spanish and Turkish as second languages are presented. Overall, results of a Picture Judgment Task confirm the hypotheses in the three studies. This work argues against the Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis (Schwartz &amp; Sprouse 1996) as a theory of L2 competence and advances a modular view of Transfer which proposes that L1 influence does not affect all linguistic domains in the same way.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cg026.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dp10v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Second language acquisition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Transitivity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Causative (Linguistics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht515"><dcterms:title>Design and implementation of signal enhancing positron-emission-tomography activation protocols for the study of higher order cognitive processes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moreno-Cantú, Jorge J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In PET activation studies, brain function is detected by identifying regional differences in tracer concentration between images acquired while a subject(s) executes different tasks. When imaging volunteers or patients, the differences produced by executing higher-order cognitive processes have magnitudes similar to those of the noise found in the measurements. Therefore, the development of techniques that enhance the signal to noise (S/N) of activation images is of great importance. The work described here was performed to investigate and evaluate three strategies designed to enhance the S/N in activation images of cognitive function. First, the applicability of switched protocols to the study of cognitive paradigms was analysed. Switched protocols enhance the S/N of subtracted images by manipulating tracer kinetics during the washout phase of the input function. This allows the acquisition of images up to 4-min long. Activation foci detected with switched and standard rCBF protocols were compared using two language tasks. The switched protocol improved the signal statistical significance up to 38% by reducing image noise. Second, a protocol designed to augment the S/N enhancements yielded by switched protocols was evaluated. This protocol enhances the S/N of H 215O bolus PET activation images by altering the relative distribution of tracer in the uptake and washout phases of the input function. The protocol combines task-switching with the release of a large pool of activity-free blood (cold-bolus). The combined protocol was first tested using computer simulations of the uptake of H215O into the brain and then evaluated by imaging subjects performing two language tasks. In the PET experiments, activation foci obtained using the combined protocol had significantly higher t-statistic values than equivalent foci detected using a conventional switched protocol (mean improvement 36%). The improvements resulted from increases in signal magnitude. Third, the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR + 3D PET scanner when employed to measure brain function using H215O bolus activation protocols in single sessions was evaluated. Using two sensory tasks and rCBF measurements, the scanner Performance was studied at different count-rates. Optimal dose fractionation strategies for one session imaging studies employing standard rCBF, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols were determined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, Christopher (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bg78z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht515</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj51c"><dcterms:title>Atrial natriuretic factor and renal function during pregrancy in the rat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Omer, Saeed.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using the rat as a model we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy might lead to an attenuation of the diuretic/natriuretic effects of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) to allow physiologically required fluid expansion.

Effects of ANF on fluid and sodium excretion as well as on glomerular filtration rate were significantly reduced during pregnancy This decrease in the renal effects of ANF during pregnancy was not associated with any changes in the pharmacokinetics or renal metabolism of ANF. However, binding studies demonstrated a significant decrease in guanylyl cyclase (GC)-linked ANF receptors and a decrease in ANF stimulated cGMP production in glomeruli and papillae of pregnant rats. The ribonuclease protection assay and Western blot analysis revealed that pregnancy caused a significant decrease in GC-A-linked ANF receptors in renal papillae. It is concluded that pregnancy is associated with attenuation of the renal effects of ANF and this is due to a downregulation of GC-A-linked ANF receptors which might reflect physiological adjustment to facilitate fluid/electrolyte expansion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mulay, Shree (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m114r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zj51c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bw27j"><dcterms:title>Deformations of bundles over the Riemann sphere</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>New, Stephen J.

As a result, all communications between these peoples ceased for a period of 40 years. Eskimos on each side were divided into separate streams of Soviet and American jurisdiction, and with the further development of both regions following the second world War, these people became the recipients of new broadcast services. These services, conceptualized and developed from completely differing philosophies concerning the nature, function, and operation of the press, brought Eskimos into the information and societal orbit of the respective nations, though with little opportunity to control the systems implemented on their behalf. Broadcasting in Chukotka developed in blue print fashion according to central planning directives of the Communist Party, based on an authoritarian, Marxist/Leninist-based model which held a complete monopoly on the means of mass information, in effect, stifling the free exchange of ideas in its attempt to convince Eskimos to accomplish objectives formulated by the Party. Broadcasting in Alaska developed in an opposite fashion, from a combination of state-supported and private initiative based on libertarian/social responsibility models of the press. Alaskan broadcasting was formulated more from the perspective of providing information and entertainment, while radio in Chukotka was more serious in nature, concentrating primarily on political and socio-economic issues facing the region and nation. As the Cold War between the US and USSR intensified from the 1950s through the early 1980s, communication across the Bering Strait was forceably restricted, yet Eskimos could receive radio services from the other side. While Alaskan stations sought accurate information about the conditions of Eskimos in the USSR, Soviet broadcasting sought to issue a slanted, propagandistic account of the lives of Alaskan Eskimos, despite their lack of accurate reporting resources, in order to convince Soviet Eskimos of the superiority of their lives in contrast to the Alaskans. This investigation will provide an overview of the development of broadcast media in both regions, as well as a comparative analysis on the role and operation of broadcasting along the Bering Strait, and the participation by Eskimos with such media. With the development of Soviet glasnost and perestroika in 1985, new opportunities arose for the reunification of the Eskimo people, and broadcasting from both sides played a role in the overall decision-making process between the Soviet and American governments to reopen the border. This study provides a historical synopsis of the border closing and reopening, and the role of broadcast media in these events. Further, developments in the changing nature of mass communications and the reorganization of broadcast media in the Russian Republic will be explored. The study concludes with an assessment on the possibilities for Eskimo control of broadcasting in the overall effort to strengthen the process of societal reintegration and national development of these people living along the Bering Strait.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stenbaek, M.

Modelling of the leaching processes, which take place in a landfill, is an invaluable tool as it is often not possible to conduct experiments over sufficiently long timescales to observe the long term leaching behaviour of wastes. In this study the multi-component transport of heavy metals into a clay barrier has been investigated experimentally and theoretically by coupled solute transport and geo-chemical reaction. An experimental design for coupled solute transport and chemical reaction, based on the column leaching test in association with the batch equilibrium test for comparison, is proposed to examine the Cl and EDTA effects on the partitioning of Zn and Pb (dissolved, adsorbed, precipitated) into uncontaminated or; precontaminated kaolinite or; kaolinite mixtures with silica gel and calcium carbonate (K, KS, KC, KSC). A COupled Solute Transport and CHemical Equilibrium SPeciation (COSTCHESP) model was developed to simulate the transport of multiple thermodynamically reacting chemical substances through clay barrier systems. It consists of two main modules; a finite difference transport module (COST), and an equilibrium geochemistry module (CHESP). This simplifies the coupling between the physical and chemical processes and leads to a simple and efficient model to simulate the simultaneous processes of advective-dispersive transport (advection; diffusion, osmotic and ion restriction effect) and geochemical reactions (complexation, exchange, precipitation, adsorption and desorption). The reliability of the model has been verified by laboratory experiments. The proposed model accounts for most of the hydro-geochemical interactions of the multi-components with the clay liner. The model will lead to proper identification of the form of specific ions (i.e. adsorbed and precipitated on solid, and available in solution) and can be a useful tool for (i) assessing the importance of geochemical reactions on the transport of heavy metals in groundwater; (ii) predicting the forms by which the metals are partitioned in the clay barrier, and (iii) indicating the potential availability of the heavy metals from contaminated soil through the chemical processes, particularly, if one recognizes that the local equilibrium pH environment is neither stagnant nor uniform throughout the subsurface underlying the waste landfill.

The tank heralded the return of breakthrough operations and maneuver warfare. Initially, the western cavalries refused doctrinal revision and chose instead to fight bitter rear guard actions against Fullerist zealots. The Canadian Cavalry, prompted by Blitzkrieg's triumphs, effortlessly evolved into a tank force---virtually overnight. Canadian doctrine, however, was ersatz. Denied its own vast training areas, the RCAC was sandwiched into southern England and saddled with British warfighting techniques developed in the Western Desert. In Normandy, Canadian operational art was driven by Generals Simonds and Crerar, both gunners, who had neither the skill nor experience to conduct armoured warfare. Hampered by General Montgomery's inability to reproduce a strategic offensive comparable to that demonstrated on the Russian front, Allied armoured forces were squandered in mismanaged frontal attacks. In the United States, the attempts to protect the horse forced a praetorian's revolt that ended with General Chaffee garroting the US Cavalry, eliminating it from future battlefields. The doctrinal dominance of the American Armored Force was subsequently threatened by a cabal under artillery General Leslie McNair who imposed the Tank Destroyer philosophy. Internecine squabbles and economic nationalism prevented America from producing a tank capable of meeting German panzers on even terms. Though failing technically, the US Armored force succeeded doctrinally via the Louisiana maneuvers and produced a balanced Armored Division. General Bradley's 12th Army Group arrived in France with a purposeful dogma that had been further refined at the Combat Command, Divisional, and Corps level in North Africa and Sicily. American armour maneuvered during Operation Cobra but it did not fight massed panzers; this was soon redressed in Lorraine where American armoured doctrine reached tactical maturity. Canadian armour fought tank battles throughout Operations Spring, Totalize and Tractable, but it did not maneuver. American and Canadian armour's best opportunity for strategic victory occurred in Normandy. The Canadians, despite better tanks and favourable terrain, failed operationally and received no second chance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morton, D.

This epitope has been proposed to be a marker of aggrecan synthesis during new cartilage formation and repair. The purpose of the present studies was to investigate, in vitro, whether the epitope was truly reflective of aggrecan synthesis, and to understand its role in the cartilage repair process. Foetal bovine chondrocyte cultures were established to study aggrecan synthesis in order to investigate whether the epitope 846 was present on these molecules. These studies showed that the epitope was indeed present on the newly synthesised aggrecan molecules and that these were preferentially retained within the extracellular matrix. The larger size and higher epitope density of the matrix molecules, compared to those molecules which were released into culture medium, suggested a role for the 846-epitope bearing molecules in the formation of new cartilage and during repair. Normal adult articular cartilage cultures were established to investigate whether the epitope could be synthesised by this tissue under conditions where the tissue had been stimulated to repair a damaged matrix, by trypsin-treatment of the cartilage. In these studies, an increase in abundance of the epitope on newly synthesised proteoglycans was observed, further indicating a role for the epitope-bearing molecules in cartilage repair. Explant cultures of osteoarthritic cartilage demonstrated that the release of the 846-bearing molecules from the cartilage was accompanied by the release of some of the newly synthesised 35S-sulphate labelled proteoglycans from the cartilage, and that these molecules contained, in part at least, the epitope. In addition, the release of 846-bearing molecules from the cartilage into culture medium or synovial fluid was reflective of the epitope content of the tissue.

It was found that dixanthogen was the main product and the surface concentration was consistently higher on pentlandite than on pyrrhotite. Ni ions enhanced the dixanthogen adsorption on both minerals in the case of single minerals. Mixed mineral experiments (i.e. pentlandite and pyrrhotite together) showed that dixanthogen formation on penlandite was promoted while on pyrrhotite it was suppressed, interpreted as due to a galvanic interaction between minerals. The ratio of dixanthogen adsorption on pentlandite to pyrrhotite increased to ca 4:1 compared to &lt;2:1 for single minerals and this ratio was maintained in the presence of depressants; overall however, depressants reduced the dixanthogen adsorption on both minerals in the case of single and mixed minerals. For pentlandite in the mixed mineral case, this reduction returned dixanthogen adsorption to values similar to those on the single mineral in the absence of depressants. For pyrrhotite, dixanthogen was reduced below detectable limits. In terms of flotation, the mixture of minerals enhances dixanthogen formation on pentlandite at the expense of pyrrhotite. This is preserved on addition of depressants which serve to reduce the absolute dixanthogen adsorption on pyrrhotite perhaps below a critical level for flotation. Xanthate adsorption on both minerals is reduced when the pH is adjusted by soda ash instead of lime. The general effects of depressants otherwise were similar regardless of pH modifier. Open circuit potential measurements showed that pentlandite has a higher rest potential than pyrrhotite. In the presence of xanthate, however, the order was reversed. A mixed potential model was used to explain the effect of mineral interaction on dixanthogen formation. At the potential of the mixed mineral system, the anodic reaction (xanthate oxidation to dixanthogen) occurred preferentially on the pentlandite and the cathodic reaction (reduction of oxygen to hydroxyl ion) occurred on the pyrrhotite. A new design of spectroelectrochemical external reflectance cell has been developed for in situ analysis under controlled electrochemical conditions. Orientation and stability of xanthate adsorption products on a copper electrode was studied as a model system. Cuprous xanthate was found to be the major product over the potential range --0.5 to --0.1 V (SCE). Further increase in potential to 0.1 V resulted in the formation of dixanthogen in addition to cuprous xanthate. It was also found that the characteristic dixanthogen bands disappeared when the potential was brought back and held at --1.0 V while the cuprous xanthate bands were enhanced. When polarized radiation was used, the appearance of the characteristic peaks of cuprous xanthate changed while that of dixanthogen remained the same, suggesting preferential orientation of the cuprous xanthate molecules but not of the dixanthogen. The probable orientation of cuprous xanthate is given. In the stability study, the dixanthogen disappeared while the copper xanthate peaks intensified. The rate of dixanthogen disappearance was greater in the case of ex situ compared to in situ sampling conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J. A.

In addition, it demonstrates how the mature feature geometry in a speaker's mental grammar restricts the range of nonnative phonemic contrasts that he or she will be sensitive to in the input and, hence, able to acquire as an L2 learner. Three related areas of research are explored and integrated in this work: first, a theoretical study explores the feature-geometric representation of sonorant and non-sonorant laterals, based on their behavior in a variety of phonological processes cross-linguistically, and suggests that [lateral] is not a phonological feature, but rather that laterality is a phonetic property that derives from a specific feature-geometric representation; second, an experimental study investigates the acquisition of phonemic contrasts by English children and demonstrates that segmental representations are acquired in a uniform order that is consistent with properties of Feature Geometry; finally, a series of experimental studies examines the perception and acquisition of the English /l-r/, /b-v/, /p-f/, /f-v/ and /s-theta/ contrasts by native speakers of Japanese, Mandarin Chinese and Korean. The findings from each of these studies are synthesized to obtain a comprehensive picture of how segmental representations are acquired and how this L1 knowledge impinges on the acquisition of L2 phonemes: it is argued that the monotonic acquisition of feature-geometric structure by young children restricts their sensitivity to particular non-native contrasts, and the continued operation of this existing feature geometry in adult speech perception constrains which non-native contrasts adult learners will be sensitive to in the L2 input and, therefore, capable of acquiring; the circumstances in which the native grammar facilitates perception of non-native contrasts and in which acquisition is possible are also discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goad, Heather (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk90x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv51g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Phonology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Second language acquisition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language transfer (Language learning)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cm72w"><dcterms:title>Transcriptional regulation of the human b-amyloid precursor protein gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bourbonnière, Martin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an extensively processed membrane protein with a single membrane spanning domain. One of the natural proteolytic products of APP is a peptide of 39 to 43 amino acids in length, beta-amyloid, that has been identified as a major constituent of senile plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). In Down syndrome (DS) (trisomy 21), overexpression of the APP gene, located on chromosome 21, is thought to be responsible for the early formation of senile plaques in the brain of DS patients. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of the APP gene in order to identify the cis-elements located in its promoter and the trans-acting factors recognizing these elements. Identification of the factors regulating APP gene expression, could help define conditions leading to the development of AD. The APP promoter possesses multiple transcriptional start sites, has a high percentage of GC and lacks a consensus TATA box. We have characterized, using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA), DNase I footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis and transient transfection studies, three elements located in close proximity of the major transcriptional start sites of APP. We present evidence that two of the elements are recognized by the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and USF respectively. Both the Sp1 and USF elements are essential for full activity of the APP promoter, regulate the APP promoter in an additive manner and synergize with the factor(s) recognizing a GC-rich element located upstream in transient transfection assays in NG108-15 and HepG2 cell lines. We also show that treatment by cyclic AMP of NG108-15 cells which had been transiently transfected with reporter constructs driven by different portions of the APP promoter caused an increase in reporter gene activity mediated by sequences located between --2991 to --488 and --303 to --204, even though the upstream sequences of APP do not contain a canoni</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nalbautoglu, Josephine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h630v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm72w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xb315"><dcterms:title>Emotional body, physical mind : an exploration of the psychosomatic system through the lens of day-to-day experience</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brown, Kirk Warren.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis was designed to test the proposition that human health can be understood as embedded in a mind/body system. In this light, the primary goal of the thesis was to test several key principles of systems theory as it applies to the natural workings of a psychosomatic system. These primary principles are (i) variables composing a system are interrelated; (ii) dynamic fluctuation of those variables occurs on a continual basis; and (iii) mutual influence of system components occurs through internal feedback. Using an ecological self-report methodology, data on affective states and physical symptomology was collected intensively over a 20 day period among healthy adults as they went about their day-to-day lives. Analysis of the data found evidence for all three systems principles. Specifically, unpleasant affect and physical symptomology were related both concurrently and in a temporal or predictive fashion. These two variables fluctuated in a dynamically stable pattern over a daily and particularly, over a weekly cycle, and the variations in each variable over time were co-related. Finally, a negative feedback process was found to occur, such that heightened levels of unpleasant affect predicted elevated symptomology, while higher levels of symptoms led to lower levels of unpleasant affect. Further, declines in unpleasant affect led to declines in symptomology, thus serving to bring both body and mind back into a healthier balance. The results of the research are discussed as they pertain to each systems principle, a commentary on the testing of systems theory is offered, and implications of the research are discussed in terms of health care practice, work performance, and our understanding of human health.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moskowitz, D.

The first part is related to the simulation of industrial scale continuous slab casting systems, while the second part deals with the simulation of a twin-roll thin-strip casting process. In the first part, a numerical investigation was conducted for exploring the steady state transport phenomena of coupled turbulent flow, heat transfer and macroscopic solidification in a continuous stainless steel slab caster. The solidification of molten steel was modeled through the implementation of the popular enthalpy-porosity and/or continuum modeling techniques. A series of simulations was carried out to investigate the effects of the casting speed, the delivered superheat, the immersion depth of the twin-ported submerged entry nozzle (SEN) and mold wall heat extraction rate on the velocity and temperature distributions and on the extent of the solidified and mushy regions on the narrow and broad faces of the caster. Next, the model was further developed to take into account two other important aspects of the continuous casting processes, namely electromagnetic flow control and bubble gas injection. For the electromagnetic part, the continuum model equations were solved simultaneously to study the usefulness of five different commercially used electromagnetic braking (EMBR) configurations in continuous slab casting processes. The predicted results showed that the minimum thickness of the solidifying shell at the mold exit increases due to the application of the EMBR devices. In a separate effort, the program was further advanced by incorporating the multiphase continuum model for simulating the argon gas bubble injection via the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) into the mold. The predicted results from this study showed that the flow pattern and temperature distribution were significantly influenced by the bubble injection especially in the upper part of the mold. The gas bubbles with smaller sizes were found to travel deeper towards the narrow face of the slab and spread wider in the mold. In the second part, a numerical study was carried out to investigate the two-dimensional turbulent flow, heat transfer and macroscopic solidification in a twin-roll thin-strip casting machine. The arbitrary nature of the computational domain was accounted for through the use of a non-orthogonal boundary-fitted coordinate (BFC) system on a staggered grid. The developed code was later used to study the sensitivity of the model parameters such as Darcy coefficient and turbulent viscosity modification factor in the mushy region as well as the effect of the casting parameters on the thin-strip twin-roll casting operations.

Although the regulatory mechanisms governing leukotriene biosynthesis are largely unknown, cytokines have been shown to upregulate leukotriene production by these cells. GM-CSF primed leukotriene biosynthesis in a dose-dependent manner in eosinophilic HL-60 cells, whereas IL-5 had no effect on leukotriene production in this cell line. GM-CSF did not affect the kinetic parameters of LTC4 synthase and therefore most likely enhanced the rate of leukotriene biosynthesis by acting upstream of this catalytic event in the biosynthetic pathway. This differential priming ability was not merely due to different receptor populations or differences in the affinity and stability of the ligand-receptor complexes of GM-CSF and IL-5. Receptor binding assays and phosphotyrosine patterns demonstrated that IL-5 is incapable of signal transduction in eosinophilic HL-60 cells, despite the fact that both GM-CSF and IL-5 receptors share a common beta-chain component, necessary for high-affinity ligand binding and signal transduction. The regulation mechanisms that govern leukotriene biosynthesis during myeloid cell differentiation to eosinophils or neutrophils were revealed to be analogous up to the point where the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway diverges. At the stage In the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway where LTA4 can be converted to either LTB 4 or LTC4, specific regulators of transcription may become activated as a myelocyte differentiates. LTA4 hydrolase expression was shown to be up-regulated in neutrophlis whereas the activity and protein and messenger RNA expression of LTC4 synthase were up-regulated in eosinophils. Microsomal GST-II is a novel membrane bound enzyme that possesses LTC4 synthesizing activity and consequently may also be responsible for regulating the formation of LTC4. Microsomal GST-II was determined to be the predominant enzyme respons</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ford-Hutchinson, A. W.
