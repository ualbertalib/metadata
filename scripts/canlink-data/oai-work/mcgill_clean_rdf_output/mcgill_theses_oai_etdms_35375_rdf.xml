The impacts of an invading species often vary  across systems, making their prediction difficult. When data from multiple invaded  sites are available, statistical models can be developed to correlate an invader's  distribution and abundance with local environmental variables; such models could  then provide managers with useful tools to help prioritize efforts to control the  invader. The introduction of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga  mussel (D. bugensis) to North America ranks among the most ecologically and  economically disruptive aquatic invasions ever documented. While some attempts have  been made to predict zebra mussel occurrence and abundance, none have been made for  quagga mussels. Furthermore, few studies have been based on river systems, which  possess the bulk of North American freshwater biodiversity. I related zebra and  quagga mussel occurrence and biomass to physical habitat variables (calcium  concentration, substrate size and depth) in the St. Lawrence River. I then developed  predictive models of abundance for each species from combinations of these  variables. Each variable explained a significant amount of variation in mussel  biomass, but different combinations of variables were obtained for each species.  Although these models do not account for all of the variation in abundance, they do  provide a useful basis for predicting dreissenid distribution and abundance in other  invaded river systems.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h004j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp49d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zebra mussel -- Saint Lawrence River -- Geographical distribution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quagga mussel -- Saint Lawrence River -- Geographical distribution</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shellfish populations -- Saint Lawrence River</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440s98b"><dcterms:title>Production of conjugated linoleic acid and conjugated linolenic acid by Bifidobacterium breve JKL03 and its application</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jung, Yun-Kyoung, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is predominantly found in foods  of ruminant origin such as milk and processed cheese, and has gained much interest  recently due to its beneficial health and biological effects on animals and  humans.

The intention-to-treat (ITT) approach is an analytic  approach for the analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) in which patients  are analysed as randomized regardless of the treatment received. Objective. To evaluate the (1) proportion of articles describing  a randomized trial in main medical journals in 2002 reporting the use of ITT, (2)  proportion violating a major component of ITT, (3) distribution and management of  missing data in the analysis of the studies reporting an ITT  analysis. Method. We conducted a cross-sectional literature review of RCTs  reported in 10 medical journals in 2002. A single rater, using a standardized form,  evaluated all articles. A second rater evaluated a 10% sample to assess reliability.  The proportion of articles reporting the use of ITT was calculated. Among these, the  proportion of articles that "analyzed patients as randomized" and the  proportion and management of missing data was evaluated using standardized  definitions. Results. Of the 403 articles, 249 reported the use of ITT. Among  these, available patients were analyzed as randomized in 192 articles (77+/-5%).  However, more than 60% of the articles had missing data in their primary analysis.  The main reason for missing data was loss to follow-up. Few articles reported a  strategy for missing data. Conclusion. This study emphasizes the fact that authors use the  label "intention-to-treat" quite differently. Its most common use refers  to the analysis of all AVAILABLE subjects as randomized.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000058d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp505</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vr47f"><dcterms:title>Using palynological modern analogues to locate a buried dikeland soil in a recovering Bay of Fundy salt marsh</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Graf, Maria-Theresia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The upper Bay of Fundy's Cumberland Basin contains an estimated  16,500 hectares of salt marsh, nearly all of which have been diked and converted to  agricultural lands since the arrival of the Acadians in the late 17 th century. John  Lusby Marsh is a 600 ha salt marsh that was diked and farmed for approximately 250  years, until dikes breached in the late 1940s and the marsh was restored to tidal  conditions. A sediment core that contained the reclamation surface was extracted in  John Lusby Marsh, and a trial set of eight fossil pollen spectra was compared to the  modern analogues. Discriminant analysis classified the fossil samples into a  plausible sequence of historic land uses which included phases when the marsh was  diked and farmed. A comparison of the soil characteristics and pollen spectra from  this study to those in a previously published study of a nearby salt marsh at  Amherst N.S. suggest that flooding of a dikeland was misinterpreted as a sudden  increase in the rate of sea level rise.

Three functional  protein isoforms are encoded by the Pitx2 gene that differ only in their N-terminus.  Functional studies have demonstrated that the Pitx2c isoform is the most downstream  component of the left-right patterning cascade that is responsible for positioning  the internal organs relative to the midline. In all vertebrates, mRNA for the Pitx2c isoform is expressed  asymmetrically in the left lateral plate mesoderm and in organs that become  asymmetrically positioned. A Pitx2c isoform specific antibody was created and used  to determine the pattern of Pitx2c protein expression in the chick embryo. Pitx2c  protein expression appears to be identical to the pattern of Pitx2c mRNA  expression. I hypothesized that the Pitx2c N-terminus would be able to  independently act as a dominant negative and interfere with the left-right  patterning activity of endogenous Pitx2c protein. To test this hypothesis, the  Pitx2c N-terminus was overexpressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm. The first  morphological sign of left-right asymmetry is the rightward looping of the heart.  The heart looped to the left side in 30% of the infected embryos suggesting that the  Pitx2c N-terminus was acting as a dominant negative protein and interfering with the  activity of the endogenous Pitx2c. Mutation analysis indicated that the amino acid  residues 41 to 45, LAMAT, were required for the dominant negative activity of  Pitx2cN.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n857g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch04n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rh57k"><dcterms:title>Three-dimensional electrophysiological database of motor responses obtained from the human internal capsule</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duerden, Emma G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The somatotopic organization of the motor fibers within the  posterior limb of the internal capsule (IC) in humans remains unclear.

The WEND model was customized to  run on a field-scale and then individually applied to 266 fields on the watershed  for a 30-year simulation period. Field-specific information for the period of  1997-1999, was used as basic inputs to the model. Climatic information was obtained  from local sources. The additional information required to run the model was derived  from the literature. Model outputs were analysed at three different levels: (i) the  overall watershed impacts, (ii) by cropping system, and (iii) for field management  practices presenting a high risk of P losses. Specific outputs examined were: soil  test Mehlich-III P, soil P saturation with aluminium, RUSLE soil loss potential and  TP export. The model was used to examine the impacts of crop rotations,  fertilizer application and tillage management on TP export. For the Castor  watershed, the soil test P increased at a mean rate of 3.71 kg Mehlich-III P ha -1  yr-1, equivalent to a mean input of about 32 kg P2O5 ha-1 yr-1 in excess of plant  requirements, assuming current field management practices remain  constant. If TP export is considered the most important parameter in terms  of P contamination, crop rotations are a good alternative to continuous corn  monocropping under which losses could reach as high as 3.36 kg TP ha-1 yr -1. Crop  rotations were shown to be an important management practice that should be more  carefully examined when establishing field management practices. Just one year of  grassland within a rotation can greatly improve the overall environmental health of  a watershed. The management of P inputs is also an important target for improvement,  as fertiliser inputs often surpassed plant requirements by two- or  three-fold.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/707958274.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cq98b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agricultural pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Castor River Watershed.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonpoint source pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Castor River Watershed.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Castor River Watershed.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Castor River Watershed (Québec)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kn68q"><dcterms:title>A study of the transcriptional regulation of the mouse Indian Hedgehog gene in ATDC5 and COS7 cells /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ciarallo, Anthony</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The signaling peptide Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) is secreted by  prehypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate, the growth center of long bones.

The transcriptional regulation of the Ihh gene, however, remains  uncharacterized. In order to study the gene's regulation, the genomic Ihh sequences  from several species were aligned to identify conserved regions that may contain  regulatory sites. Two putative Stat transcription factor binding sites were  identified, one of which is conserved across all species studied while the other is  rodent-specific. In addition, an in vitro system was established to test the  upstream region of the gene for transcriptional activity. ATDC5 chondrogenic cells  were stably transfected with a plasmid containing 5kb of sequence located upstream  of Ihh as well as a luciferase reporter gene. The presence of the Ihh sequence  induced expression of the luciferase reporter 50 fold above expression from a  control plasmid. COS7 and ATDC5 cells transiently transfected with similar  Ihh-luciferase constructs resulted in unique induction patterns.

To delineate the patterns and extent of EpoR  expression in the brains of patients with sporadic AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment  (MCI; a frequent harbinger of AD) and normal elderly controls (NEC). Results. (A)  Temporal cortex: Percentages of GFAP-positive astrocytes co-expressing EpoR were (i)  significantly increased in AD and MCI vs. NEC (p&lt;0.05) in layers II and III,  (ii) increased in MCI, but not in AD, vs. NEC in layer I, and (iii) unrelated to  diagnosis (p&gt;0.05) in layers IV, V and VI and the subcortical white matter.

We have demonstrated that expanded CAG stretches are  prone to frameshifting to the -1 alanine-encoding GCA frame, and we propose that  this phenomenon is due to ribosomal slippage during translation. This slippage  depends on the presence of long CAG tracts, and generates polyalanine-containing  proteins. We showed that polyalanines increase cell toxicity.

The results of the tests demonstrate that the  algorithm is able to analyze the patient data with a high accuracy even in the  presence of noise, eye-blinks and other artifacts.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg263.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mc58h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f6442"><dcterms:title>The optimum design of epicyclic trains of spherical cam-roller pairs /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hernandez, Sergio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many a robotic pitch-roll wrist uses a bevel-gear differential  train to drive the gripper. The innovative design of pitch-roll wrists using  spherical cam-roller pairs is currently underway at McGill University's Centre for  Intelligent Machines, with the aim of overcoming the drawbacks of bevel-gear trains.  This innovative design relies on Speed-o-Cam, a new concept of speed-reduction  mechanisms based on cams and pure-rolling contact, intended to replace gears and  harmonic drives in applications where backlash, friction, and flexibility cannot be  tolerated. The new mechanism consists mainly of a spherical conjugate cam  subassembly and two roller-carrying disks. We start with a study of cam curvature, with special focus on  its machinability. Drawing from experience, we introduce the hypothesis that high  curvature changes of a cam profile are at the source of the concentration of  machining errors. As a consequence, the machining accuracy of the concave regions in  a cam profile is substantially lower than that of its convex regions. To produce a  more accurate cam we developed the geometric condition that guarantees a fully  convex spherical cam profile. The optimum design of the pitch-roll mechanism based on  cam-roller pairs is reported here. The optimization is intended to simplify the  subassembly of spherical conjugate cams of the old design by means of a layout of  two pairs of spherical mechanisms of the Stephenson type and two conjugate cams  mounted on distinct shafts. We focus on the optimum design of both the spherical  cam-roller mechanism and the spherical Stephenson mechanism.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d957m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f6442</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs24h"><dcterms:title>An automatic warning system for epileptic seizures recorded on intracerebral electroencephalograms /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Grewal, Sukhjit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A seizure warning system for intracerebral EEG is proposed.

The system was designed using 407 hours of EEG from 19 patients  having 152 seizures. Once developed, the system was tested with a different set of  EEGs from 19 patients having a total of 100 seizures during 389  hours. Average results for the testing data were promising, with 86%  sensitivity, a false detection rate of 0.47/hour, and a delay time of 16 seconds.

This group of women was a "community" in  the sense that their contact, sociability, friendship and poetry writing were  meaningfully intertwined in their lives. The thesis is divided into three  interconnected chapters. Two separate biographical accounts of Gu Taiqing's  life---one centered around the relationship with her husband, and the second around  her relationship with her female friends---are reconstructed in the first chapter.  This biographical chapter underlines the importance of situating Gu in the women's  community to understand her life and poetry. The second is comprised of a  reconstruction of this women's community, delineating its members and distinctive  features. In the third chapter, a close-reading of Gu's poems in relation to the  women's community focuses on the themes of xian (leisure), parting, and friendship.  This chapter shows how each of these themes are represented by Gu and how her  representations are closely related to the experiences of this women's  group.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kr04h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977v447</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chinese poetry -- Women authors -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women poets, Chinese</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gu, Taiqing, 1799-1877 -- Biography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n174h"><dcterms:title>Traduire les voix dans The mill on the Floss de George Eliot</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Henri-Lepage, Savoyane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Mill on the Floss, by Victorian novelist George Eliot, is a  polylinguistic novel in Bakhtine's sense of the word in that it integrates the  linguistic diversity of the society which it depicts. This novel published in 1860  was translated six times into French but never enjoyed a great reception in France.  We examine three translations in this thesis: the first is by Francois  D'Albert-Durade (1863), the second is by Lucienne Molitor (1957) and the last is by  Alain Jumeau (2003). D'Albert-Durade's translation evacuates the linguistic diversity  in order to shape the novel to the requirements of the target literary polysystem.  Molitor, by homogenising the eliotian prose, turns the canonised English novel into  a French popular novel. Jumeau, for his part, by rehabilitating the peasant  sociolect in his translation, marks the beginning of a rehabilitation movement of  George Eliot in France. This study, through the analysis of the voice of a few key  characters, attempts to follow the French "translative journey" of The  Mill on the Floss.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf51b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n174h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eliot, George, 1819-1880.

Mathematics is a gatekeeper course in  high school, and students who are not successful with this subject are at a distinct  disadvantage, both in terms of their education and in their future careers. A  persistent source of difficulty for these students is related to language; students  often struggle both to understand what is being taught, and how to explain concepts  or problem solutions in their own words. Interactive journal writing was initiated  as a means of addressing this situation, and of meeting the objectives proposed by  the Quebec Education Plan, which specifies three closely related competencies: (1)  solve situational problems; (2) use mathematical reasoning; (3) and communicate by  using mathematical language. There is ample proof in the research literature that  communication plays an important role in supporting learners by helping them  clarify, refine and consolidate their thinking. This study demonstrates the importance of allowing and  encouraging students to use writing as part of their learning processes. By writing  about what they are being taught, students are forced to slow down, examine and  reflect on the steps they use to solve problems. Sharing what they write promotes  meaningful dialogue and personal engagement, essential ingredients of successful  learning.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vp159.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt98k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics -- Study and teaching (Secondary)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diaries -- Authorship</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remedial teaching</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zn97b"><dcterms:title>Philosophie amoureuse et destinée de la mal mariée au XIXe siècle</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Aubry, Sophie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the character of the unhappy bride in three  French novels of the 19th century: Le Lys dans la vallee (1836) by Honore de Balzac,  Madame Bovary (1857) by Gustave Flaubert and L'Assommoir (1877) by Emile Zola. It  compares the heroines' tragic destinies based on the following points: childhood;  education; marriage; the philosophy of love and psychology; and escapism and death.  We are shown that it is education that leads to the philosophy of love, which is  filled with ideas of platonic love, and that unhappy marriages involve compensation.  Research by psychoanalyst Karen Horney is applied to the characters found in the  novels to explain their deviant behaviour (masochism, bovarism, narcissism,  detachment). Each heroine demonstrates a tendency towards the ideal and illusions  inherited from romanticism. Their fates are sealed with the failure of their dreams  and the victory of reality over fantasy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs48n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zn97b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zola, Emile, 1840-1902.

The methodology consists in  applying histogram analysis for the initialization of parameters, using Simpson's  rule for the approximation of numerical integration and describing methods of skull  stripping and neighborhood information encoding.
