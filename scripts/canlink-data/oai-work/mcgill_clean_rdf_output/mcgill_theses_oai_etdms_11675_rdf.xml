During the course of these experiments it became very evident that time and space are two very important factors to be considered in the investigation of orchard insect problems. The spray program which has been followed in an orchard in the years before an experiment is started has an important conditioning effect on the experiment. This can only be overcome by using the experimental materials on the same trees for several years in succession. Single row plots are limited in long term studies by the differential ability of the various species to migrate from one plot to another. The importance of the failure to consider the over-all effect of a spray program is illustrated by the advocation of elemental sulphur sprays for commercial orchards on the sole basis of their fungicidal value without relation to their effects on all other organisms As a result of these investigations it is now known that sulphur sprays inhibit natural control of oystershell scale while bordeaux mixture, Fermate or no spray at all will allow natural control agents to eliminate oystershell scale.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brittain, W.

Bewley (8), who thought that these fungi interfered with the normal water relations of the plant, was the first to suggest that the term ‘hadromycosis’, used throughout this work, be applied. Six theories have been evolved to explain the mechanism by which hadromycotic fungi cause wilting.

In the past there was no real problem of coordinating supply and demand. The population was expanding rapidly and the markets growing even faster. Consumer tastes were not particularly discriminating, and by and large there was insufficient producing capacity to meet the needs of the market. You simply made what you wanted to make and consumers took i t . Over a period of years the supply never quite caught up to the demand; it was always slightly set back by periods of war and depression when equilibrium was in sight. The situation today is somewhat the same. The tremendous demand created by the curtailment of consumer production during the war is considerably in exfiess of the supply. This provides industry with great temptations of hugh immediate profits to be realized only by the immediate expansion of its productive equipment. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coote, J.

However, the present milling yield of about 0.5 per cent indicates a potential production of about 150 million pounds of germ (1). The wheat kernel is reported (2) to contain 2.2 - 3.0 per cent of germ, and, therefore, it is possible that, in the future, the milling yield and hence the potential production of wheat germ may be greatly increased. For Canada, assuming an annual production of 350 million bushels of wheat and a yield of only 0.5 per cent of germ, the potential production of wheat germ is about 100 million pounds per annum. Wheat germ, as a by-product of the milling industry, is used as animal feed, generally as component of the bran, and in limited amounts as a source of oil. [...] The laboratory conditions for the large scale isolation of ribonucleic acid from wheat germ have not been studied in detail. Ribonucleic acid of a high degree of purity has never been isolated in good yield from wheat germ. Therefore, it is proposed in this investigation to determine the optimum conditions for the extraction and isoelectric precipitation of a definite nucleoprotein fraction; to investigate the required degree of denaturation of nucleoprotein for the separation of nucleic acid; and to develop a satisfactory method for the purification of ribonucleic acid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

This method has the advantage of being easily controlled as well as possessing a faster rate of reaction than either bulk phase or solution polymerization (1, 2). The GR-S system discussed herein is made up of monomer, water, catalyst, modifier and emulsifying agent, which, upon agitation at a moderate temperature, results in the formation of a heterogeneous mixture. This complicates investigation of the locus of polymerization. The ease of control is due, in part at least, to the heat transfer from one medium to the other. Since the GR-S reaction, as in the case of most vinyl polymerizations, is exothermic, rapid removal of heat is necessary in order that the reaction may proceed at an even rate. This is possible in an emulsion system, due to the fact that the monomer is present in the form of small particles, entirely surrounded by the water medium, and thus presents a large surface which permits rapid heat transfer.

The intensity of an electrical field is a measure of the force exerted on a unit charge when at rest in the field. The field intensity at any distance from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law, and in practical units is measured in volts per cm.

This, along with many other superficial judgements, was proved to be a fallacy by the campaigns of the war of 1939-1945. Although, in the early years of the war, there was a school of thought which disparaged the experiences and methods of the war of 1914-1918, it later became apparent to some that there were many similarities between this so-called modern war and the previous world struggle. Many a civilian-turned- soldier found that recruiting bulletins and magazine articles often did not give a true picture of the facts. [...] To go deeper, it became evident that there are basic human factors which must be the same in all wars. The great phenomena of fear, of hunger and fatigue, of discomfort and home-sickness, and of comradeship in arms - all of which are the common experience of soldiers - seem to be permanent and universal. It is because of this common quality that we feel the writings of the past concerning soldiers are relevant to our present understanding of them.

Atmospheric oxygen attacks the unsaturated triglyceride molecules with the formation of many oxidation products, among which peroxidic and carbonyl compounds are the most important. This deterioration of the fat results in the production of off-flavours and odours which render the fat unpalatable. Many chemical tests have been employed for the detection of rancidity which depend on the presence of these compounds. Recently a very sensitive method has been developed based on the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric by the peroxides present in an oxidized fat. The ferric ion produced is determined colorimetrically as ferric thiocyanate. This method has recently been severely criticized by Lea, who stated that the method was subject to serious error owing to the interference of atmospheric oxygen. The presence of air in the reaction mixture has also resulted in high peroxide values of fats and oils when determined by other modifications of the ferrous salt method. It was the purpose of this study to investigate the ferric thiocyanate method, with a view to preventing this oxygen interference, and to compare the results given by several ferrous salt methods with those obtained by iodimetric procedures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chapman, R.

In addition it includes a correlation of all previous work in the Burlington Peninsula. The newly mapped areas include the north coast of the peninsula from Ming's Bight to Cape St. John and south to join the Tilt Cove - Bett's Cove area mapped by Snelgrove, (1931), and a strip about three miles wide along the coast from Nipper's Harbour to the south side of Middle .Arm, Green Bay. To assist in correlation, reconnaissance trips were taken into the previously described areas. Exploratory traverses were made along the shore of White Bay from Fleur de Lys to Bear Cove, inland from Burlington to the end of the new Bowater road at Flat Water Pond, along the trail from Burlington to Baie Verte, and a trans-peninsular traverse from Western .Arm, White Bay, to Middle .Arm, Green Bay.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gill, J.

More particularly, this thesis is subject to the same limitations from which the French party suffered throughout its career: Its emphasis is entirely upon the political, judicial, and religious aspects of the period, almost to the exclusion of economic and social aspects.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adair, E.

S. there has been, over the past years, an increase in the number of sprays applied to apple trees; together with this there has developed a steady increase in the complexity of the pest problem. Fruit growers now find that the keen competition in the markets available to them, together with the high cost of pest control, necessitates that no further increase in the cost of spraying take place and it is desirable that it be decreased. It was with these facts in mind that the staff of the Dominion Entomological Laboratory, Annapolis Royal began studies on the basic cause of the anomaly of more spraying creating still greater problems (Pickett et al 1946). In searching for the answers to this general problem it soon became apparent that insufficient attention had been given to the latent or long term effect of sprays. [...] Sufficient evidence has been gathered to show that the suppression of the natural control of a previously minor pest, by attempting to control some major pest, has led to the necessity for costly increases in the spray program. [...] A study of Haplothrips faurei was therefore begun as a basis for the study of thrips as predators in apple orchards, as well as for its morphological value. This morphological study has been supplemented by observations on its biology and as many records as possible on the effect of spray materials upon its abundance are included.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brittain, W.

The study of the passage of material into and out of living cells, and experimental techniques such as ultrafiltration and dialysis have long required the use of membranes. More recently, an intensive search has been in progress for membranes suitable for determination of molecular weights of high polymers by osmotic pressure measurements. The subject of this investigation Is the cellophane membrane. This material has been used as a membrane in osmotic pressure determinations of high molecular weight materials in organic solvents. The treatment of the cellophane and its accommodation to such systems has been semi-empirical and consequently certain anomalous results have been reported (1) (2). One of the purposes of this investigation is to establish a mechanism of permeability through cellophane consistent with the other known properties of cellulose such as swelling and sorption. Permeability rates, void volumes and electrical conductance measurements were made to establish the size and number of pores and the specific surface of the membrane. Based upon these observations, a mechanism for permeability through cellophane has been advanced.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

In any case, all sciences aspire to this refinement. In Psychology* however, prediction is much more difficult than in other disciplines. Psychologists deal in behaviour and, except in the simplest types, obstacles in the way of prediction are enormous. In general, such obstacles stem from the following conditions: 1) The variables involved usually are very difficult to isolate and define. 2) Control of many of these is impossible. 3) Many of the variables all but defy measurement. For example, there is a vast difference between the relatively straightforward problem of finding and controlling the variables involved in the activity of either an acid or base in the presence of the other and that of tracking down the factors contributing to the behaviour of the college student pursuing a course of study and attempting examinations. Nevertheless, this last is precisely the task which confronts those who are interested in the problems of forecasting and guidance for the college student. Their point of departure is the question: What are the factors governing success in school or college? The success of guidance and counselling programs depends on how fully and accurately this question can be answered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, E.

All three methods led to approximately the same relative potencies. However, Bliss and Marks’ procedure (Method II) overcame some of the limitations of Coward’s dosage-response curve method (Method I), in that it introduced objective tests for the linearity of the response curves and for the existence of parallelism between the standard and the test substances, thus establishing a more valid assay. Method III, by isolating individual treatment effects using single degrees of freedom as illustrated by Snedecor, largely established the validity of the assay and in addition when applied in conjunction with Method II established the reliability of the estimated potencies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.

In particular, many bacterial diseases which have so far failed to respond to immunization are now being more effectively treated with drugs which have only recently been recognized. The chemotherapeutic drugs include those prepared synthetically and the naturally occurring antibiotics produced by living organisms.  [...] Several important physical factors, such as permeability, oxygen tension and oxidation-reduction potentials have been shown to influence the overall antibacterial effect and must therefore be considered in studying the mode of drug action on bacteria. An attempt has been made in this project to investigate some of the fundamental factors which influence the action of chemotherapeutic drugs on bacteria. The results obtained in vitro would seem to indicate that a more effective chemotherapeutic action could be expected by the utilization of two inhibitory drugs simultaneously, resulting in a potentiated or synergistic action which cannot be accounted for by the arithmetic sum of the drug action per se. Accordingly, this latter aspect of synergism between antibacterial substances has also been studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thatcher, F.
