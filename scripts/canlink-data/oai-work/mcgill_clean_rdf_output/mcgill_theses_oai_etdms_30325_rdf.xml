The objective of this project was to define the promoter elements involved in the control of transcription elongation. Using heterologous promoter constructs, the ME1a1 protein binding site located in the c-myc promoter was shown to be required for the block to transcription elongation. From mutation analysis, a correlation was established between the binding of nuclear factors to ME1a1 sites in vitro and the ability of these sites to confer block to transcription elongation in vivo, strongly implicating trans-acting factors in this process. Fractionation studies demonstrated that three nuclear factors interact with the ME1a1 site, thus generating three protein-DNA complexes termed "a", "b", and "c". These factors were characterized and a cDNA encoding the protein responsible for complex "c" was isolated. This protein was shown to represent the human homologue of the Drosophila Cut homeodomain protein (hu-Cut) and to repress expression from the c-myc promoter in transient transfection assays.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nepveu, Alain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t08q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xk111</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n204067p"><dcterms:title>Observations and uses of high resolution radar data from precipitation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fabry, Frédéric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The benefits of very high resolution data from scanning and vertically pointing radars in a research and operational environment are investigated.

Neonatally handled (H) animals exhibit decreased plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) in response to some acute stressors relative to non-handled (NH) animals. However, relatively little is known about how animals that differ in HPA responsiveness to acute stress will respond to repeated exposure to the same stressor. We examined various aspects of HPA activity in adult, control H and NH animals (H CTL and NH CTL), and H and NH animals exposed to chronic, intermittent cold stress (4 h of 4$ sp circ$C cold a day for 21 days; H CHR and NH CHR). H CTL and NH CTL animals displayed comparable ACTH and B responses to the first exposure. H CHR animals exhibited lower levels of ACTH, but not B, during the 22nd exposure (the homotypic stressor) compared to the first exposure in H CTL. However, ACTH and B levels in NH CHR were not different from those in NH CTL. Upon exposure to restraint (the novel, heterotypic stressor), NH CHR animals hypersecreted ACTH and B compared to NH CTL more than did H CHR animals relative to H CTL animals. These endocrine responses were associated with increased basal median eminence levels of both CHR and AVP in H CHR and NH CHR relative to their control groups and with decreased GR densities in septum of both H CHR and NH CHR. Thus, the differential responses of H CHR and NH CHR to the homotypic and heterotypic stressors cannot be explained solely by changes in median eminence content of secretagogues or central GR density. We also examined three aspects of immune function. We first measured the plaque-forming cell (PFC) response, a T cell-dependent, B cell response, and plasma antibody titers to an injection of sheep red blood cells. Suppression of PFC response and antibody titers was similar in H and NH following either acute or chronic exposure to cold, but a greater suppression was seen in NH CHR than H CHR following a single re-exposure to cold. We then examined HPA responses to two doses of endotoxin and found that plasma ACTH and B responses to endotoxin depended on dose. Finally, we examined incidence of tumors in control and chronically cold stressed H and NH animals, as well as chronic intermittently restraint H and NH animals (20 min restraint a day for 21 days; H RES and NH RES) that had been injected with cells transfected with the Fujinami Sarcoma Virus. H RES animals exhibited the lowest incidence of tumors of all animals studied, and this decreased incidence was associated with adaptation of plasma B responses, decreased thymus GR levels, and decreases in some indices of sympathetic adrenomedullary activity. These data support the notion that exposure to chronic stress is associated with perturbations of immune function that may lead to the development of pathology, and that differences between H and NH animals in HPA responses to stress are relevant to the study of individual differences in the development of pathology.

Two empirical components are included: a study of the syntax of anaphora in Serbo-Croatian and an experimental study of second language acquisition of reflexive binding. Data from field work on the coreference properties of anaphors in Serbo-Croatian are discussed in terms of standard, parameterized, LF movement, and Relativized SUBJECT approaches to Binding Theory. Recent versions of the theory identify a categorial distinction between morphologically simple ($ rm X sp circ$) and complex (XP) anaphor types as a crucial factor in determining coreference relations between reflexive pronouns and their syntactic antecedents. The predictions of a morphological approach to the Binding Theory were tested in a study of the acquisition of the binding properties of English XP reflexives by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian, a language with $ rm X sp circ$ reflexives. Acquisition of the English binding pattern by this group of L2 learners requires recognition of the morphological complexity of English reflexives. Prior to reanalysis, learners are predicted to produce an incorrect L1 coreference pattern in the L2 environment. Two sentence comprehension tasks were administered to adolescent and adult Serbo-Croatian speaking L2 learners of English and similar groups of English native speaker controls. Picture identification and multiple choice comprehension tasks produced convergent results with significant differences between control (n = 47) and L2 learner (n = 73) interpretations of reflexives in complex noun phrases and object control infinitival sentences. Their pattern of interpretation shows evidence of transfer of the $ rm X sp circ$ anaphor type found in Serbo-Croatian to the target grammar and suggests L2 learners are able to apply a deductive system constrained by Universal Grammar to compute binding domains in second language acquisition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr960.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r466x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Government-binding theory (Linguistics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Serbo-croatian speakers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Second language acquisition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Serbo-Croatian language -- Anaphora.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language transfer (Language learning)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816p10b"><dcterms:title>Novel bonding interactions in organometallic and biological systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Barnett, Steven Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A number of organometallic and biological systems have been investigated by infrared and Raman spectroscopy.

Both strains degraded 2-chlorobenzoic acid (2-CBA), 2,3-DCBA, and 2,5-DCBA. BRI 6011 alone degraded 2,4-DCBA. Metabolism of the chlorinated substrates resulted in the stoichiometric release of chloride, and degradation proceeded by intradiol cleavage of the aromatic ring. Growth of both strains on dichlorobenzoic acids induced pyrocatechase activities having catechol (catechol 1,2-dioxygenase) and chlorocatechols (chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase) as substrates. Growth on 2-CBA and benzoic acid induced a pyrocatechase activity (catechol 1,2-dioxygenase) directed against catechol only. The chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from BRI 6011 was purified, characterized, and compared with the chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. B13 and P. putida, organisms limited with respect to their CBA degradative versatility. These enzymes appear to be very similar based on biochemical and genetic data and possess sufficient broad substrate specificity to accommodate a wide range of chlorinated catechols, hence the increased versatility for chlorobenzoic acid degradation of A. denitrificans cannot be attributed to a more specialized chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase. Uptake of benzoic acid by BRI 3010 and BRI 6011 was inducible, exhibited saturation kinetics and the substrate was accumulated intracellularly against a concentration gradient by a factor of 8 and 10, respectively, indicative of active transport. Uptake of 2,4-DCBA by BRI 6011 was constitutive and saturation kinetics were not observed, suggesting passive diffusion of 2,4-DCBA and other CBAs into the cell down a concentration gradient. Based on oxygen uptake experiments with whole cells, benzoic acid dioxygenase and chlorobenzoic acid dioxygenase activity was induced by benzoic acid and ortho-substituted chlorobenzoic acids, respectively. Since 2,4-DCBA diffuses across the membrane and the expected catecholic intermediates of 2,4-DCBA metabolism are metabolizable by BRI 3010, this suggests that the major difference between BRI 3010 and BRI 6011 might be the inability of the chlorobenzoic acid dioxygenase in BRI 3010 to recognize 2,4-DCBA as a substrate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c905t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r19r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alcaligenes denitrificans</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polychlorinated biphenyls -- Biodegradation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microbial metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv77h"><dcterms:title>Sequences and genetic analysis of several accessory genes from the Azotobacter chroococcum hydrogenase gene cluster</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Du, Lisheng</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Azotobacter chroococcum the hydrogenase gene (hup) cluster spans about 14 kb of DNA.

The polypeptides predicted from all these genes are homologous to products of the gene clusters of membrane-bound (NiFe) hydrogenases from other bacteria, including Azotobacter vinelandii, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Rhodobacter capsulatus, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Escherichia coli. The products of hupR and hupZ may be involved in hydrogenase-linked electron transport since they are similar to rubredoxins and b-type cytochromes, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of hupB, hupY, hupD and hupE abolished Hup activity with either O$ sb2$ or methylene blue as the electron acceptor whereas two insertions downstream of the hupE gene had no effect on Hup activity. A 10.5 kb fragment of DNA beginning in hupR was able to complement hupD and hupE mutants, supporting earlier evidence for a promoter downstream of hupSL. Mutations in hupB, hupY and hupD had little effect on $ beta$-galactosidase activity in a strain also carrying a hupL-lacZ fusion, indicating that hupB, hupY and hupD are probably not involved in regulating the transcription of hupSL. Adding nickel to the medium restored wild-type Hup activity to a hupB mutant and about half of the activity in a hupA mutant, indicating that the hupB and hupA gene products may be involved in Ni metabolism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tibelius, Karl H.

One site is bound by $ alpha$-bungarotoxin ($ alpha$-BGT), while the other has a higher affinity for agonists and does not bind the $ alpha$-toxin. Muscle nAChRs, which also bind $ alpha$-BGT, had been reported to be sensitive to a thymus-derived polypeptide, thymopoietin (TPO). The present work was therefore done to determine whether this agent might also interact with the different nAChR populations in neuronal cells. Initial studies involved thymopentin (TP-5), a 5 amino-acid peptide which may represent the active site of TPO. TP-5 inhibited nicotinic receptor-induced release of catecholamines in bovine adrenal medullary cells in culture, a function mediated through the $ alpha$-BGT-insensitive nAChR. On the other hand, TP-5 did not inhibit either ($ sp3$H) (-)nicotine or ($ sp{125}$I) $ alpha$-BGT binding to rat brain membranes. These results suggested that TP-5 interacted in a non-competitive manner with the $ alpha$-BGT-insensitive neuronal nAChR. Studies were subsequently done with thymic preparations presumed to be purified TPO ('TPO'), the native polypeptide containing the TP-5 amino acid sequence. In contrast to the effect of TP-5, 'TPO' preparations did not alter nicotinic receptor mediated catecholamine release from neuronal cells in culture. However, 'TPO' preparations selectively decreased ($ sp{125}$I) $ alpha$-BGT binding to brain membranes suggesting an interaction between this polypeptide and $ alpha$-BGT receptors. Quantitative autoradiography revealed that 'TPO' inhibited specific ($ sp{125}$I) $ alpha$-BGT binding uniformly and with similar potency in different brain regions. As $ alpha$-BGT binding sites are highly expressed in the hippocampal formation, primary cultures of fetal rat hippocampal cells were used next to investigate regulation of the $ alpha$-BGT receptor by 'TPO'. 'TPO' caused a dose-dependent and slowly reversible decrease in the density of $ alpha$-BGT receptors. After completion of this work with 'TPO', studies by Quik and coworkers (1993) showed that $ alpha$-Naja toxin (or $ alpha$-cobratoxin) from Naja naja siamensis snake venom was present in the 'TPO' preparations; furthermore, this toxin component appeared to be responsible for the reported effects of 'TPO' on $ alpha$-BGT receptors. Therefore, the above results which had initially been interpreted to occur as a consequence of the interaction of the thymic polypeptide TPO at the nicotinic $ alpha$-BGT site, must now be attributed to the presence of $ alpha$-Naja toxin contaminant in the 'TPO' preparations. Studies were also undertaken to identify a nicotinic function for $ alpha$-BGT receptors in neuronal cells. Intracellular calcium levels were measured in response to nicotine as recent work using parasympathetic neurons showed that this may represent an $ alpha$-BGT-sensitive response. In contrast to earlier findings, the present work indicates that nAChR-mediated calcium fluxes in cultured chromaffin cells do not reveal an $ alpha$-BGT-sensitive component. These results thus suggest that nicotinic $ alpha$-BGT receptors mediate their response by altering intracellular calcium levels in some but not all neuronal preparations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quik, M.

GM1 treatment only attenuated such lesion-induced deficits. Exogenous GM1 was also shown to potentiate NGF-reduced effects on basalo-cortical cholinergic markers and on cortical synaptic remodelling, but did not affect the affinity or number of NGF binding sites in brain membranes isolated from lesioned animals. This suggests that GM1 probably affects an alternative step of the NGF signal transduction cascade to potentiate NGF effects.

Two soil moisture models, The Versatile Soil Moisture Budget (VB4) and SWACROP models, were compared using data from six wheat cropping periods. The models showed good performance in predicting soil moisture contents, but SWACROP underpredicted soil evaporation and runoff, and VB4 did not separate evapotranspiration into its components. Therefore, a new soil moisture model was proposed. In the new model, a Darcy type equation was used to calculate fluxes in the soil profile, and inputs of daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were partitioned during the day using simple disaggregation methods. Crop growth input parameters, interacting with weather and soil inputs, were used to calculate a detailed output of the water balance components. The validation of the model showed predictions of soil water contents and evapotranspiration in close agreement with field data. A crop yield model based on the stress day index approach was selected from an evaluation of seven crop-water production functions using wheat field data. This model was combined with the soil moisture model to assess risks of drought during the establishment and development of non-irrigated wheat crops with different planting dates. Irrigation management strategies were simulated to identify net system delivery capacities and application frequencies that promote maximum yield with minimum requirements of water. Yield reductions in non-irrigated wheat due to water stress varied between 16%, for early plantings, to 50%, for late plantings. Maximum yields with minimum applied water was obtained by the use of low intensity (5 to 10 mm) and frequent (3 to 5 days) irrigations. System delivery capacity requirements varied from 1.5 to 3.0 mm/day, according to planting dates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C. A.

Melt infiltration is a popular fabricating method for such composites, as it allows the production of near-net shape components with high ceramic content. Capillaric melt infiltration is a simpler process since the liquid penetrates the preform under the action of a capillary pressure. This work deals with the fabrication and evaluation of a TiC/Al composite produced by melt infiltration. Pre-sintered preforms, having different void fraction and pore size, where infiltrated with pure Al, in an argon atmosphere, at various temperatures. The infiltration was carried out using the contact and the capillary dip methods to study the mechanical properties and infiltration behaviour, respectively. The material exhibited a wide range of properties, depending on the ceramic content. Optimum tensile strengths of up to 480MPa were obtained for composites containing between 67 and 75% TiC, and infiltrated at 1050-1200$ sp circ$C. The extent of pre-sintering of the TiC was seen to play a crucial role in the strengthening of the microstructure, as well as the fracture mechanism by which the material failed. The elastic modulus was seen to increase with increasing TiC content, from values of 120 to 290GPa. The hardness also increased with TiC content, to values as high as 800kg/mm$ sp2,$ but decreased with higher infiltration temperatures due to the breakdown of the TiC network and grain coarsening. An experimental set-up was designed to measure the rate of infiltration by continually monitoring the weight changes of the preform as a result of the penetration of Al. Infiltration profiles were generated as a function of pore size, pore volume and temperature. At low temperatures, an incubation period was evident as a result of the transient contact angle between the two phases. Moreover, infiltration was inhibited at lower pore volume fraction. Finally, the Activation energy for the system increased from 90 to 450kJ/mol, with increasing pore size, suggesting a transition from a diffusion controlled process to one activated by a surface reaction for larger pore sizes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Drew, R.

The cylinder/support interaction forces and, in turn, the resulting cylinder wear rates are strongly dependent on the detailed dynamical response. This Thesis examines the response of a loosely supported cylinder located in the third row of an otherwise rigid rotated triangular array. The feasibility and potential of a modern nonlinear dynamics approach to the understanding of the underlying dynamics is investigated. A nonlinear quasi-steady model was formulated to model the dynamical behaviour. The steady fluid force field, required as input to the model, was measured experimentally for a cylinder within a rotated triangular array. A lither stability analysis showed the cylinder stability behaviour to be strongly dependent on cylinder position. This result serves as a possible explanation for the rare occurrence of, theoretically predicted, multiple instability regions in experimental measurements. The nonlinear analysis uncovered two important transition routes to chaos. The first, a switching mechanism prevalent at the onset of impacting. The second and most important is the intermittency route to chaos. The theoretical model showed good agreement with experiments in predicting the bifurcation sequences and transitions to chaos--comparisons were quantified via fractal dimensions and saddle orbit distributions. The identification of type I intermittency leads to a quantitative estimate of the probability distribution of the length of laminar phases. It is shown that the duration of laminar phases and the associated frequency may provide better estimates of integration time and frequency for wear-rate computation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paidousis, M.

The first part involves the construction of a novel dynamical scheme which is capable of generating the masses of the quarks and the elements of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, and which does not rely upon the Higgs mechanism. The up quarks acquire their masses by coupling to a new heavy fermion via emission and reabsorption of a new scalar boson. The down quarks, on the other hand, obtain their masses via a correction to the up mass matrix as a result of an anomalous flavour changing interaction of the $W sp pm$. Extensions of the mass generation model are proposed and discussed. The second part involves the leading-log s study of hadron-hadron elastic scattering to order $ alpha sb{s} sp3$. By introducing wave functions, it is found that there are three types of form factor for the proton, and two for the pion. These form factors turn out to cancel the infrared divergence which occurs in quark-quark scattering. To this order in $ alpha sb{s}$, the amplitude of such elastic scattering is shown to have the form $ sim$(1 + log(s)($ alpha sb{o}$ + $ alpha sp prime t$ + $O(t sp2))$ for the imaginary part and a constant $ sim alpha sb{odd}$ for the real part, where s and t are the usual Mandelstam variables, and the $ alpha$'s are constants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Margeous, B.

(Julian Forster)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation explores ideas about human agency and conduct as these are expressed in the Indian epic known as the Mahabharata (the "Great Bharata"). Two concepts in particular retain our attention: daiva, the power that comes from the gods, and purusakara, the power that comes from human beings (purusas). One current of thought holds that human life and the course of history are governed exclusively by external agencies ("the gods" or chance). On the other hand, the epic also carries the commanding message that the lives of individuals and societies may be changed for the better through human initiative (purusakara) in accordance with the dharma, the moral order sanctioned by religious tradition. The issue is finally reduced to the question: who is the real agent of action? The analysis concludes that the question can only be resolved in the context of epic ideas about the nature of the human being. But humanity is simply a stage in the spiritual evolution of all life towards the realization of the unity of existence as the manifestation of a Supreme Person (paramapurusa; purusottama) or a Supreme Self (paramatman). Souls (atmans) are embodied as human beings at the stage when consciousness develops into the self-consciousness of an ego (ahamkara), which arrogates to itself the notion of self-determination or "freedom." In reality, however, the soul is not free but trapped in a cycle of rebirth, which can be broken only by the abandonment of all notion of agency, action and control over the fruits of the action. The epic therefore operates at two levels. In terms of the mundane tasks and responsibilities of daily life, particularly the responsibilities of the king, the human being is regarded as enjoying a modicum of freedom and self-determination to chart the course of his or her future evolution. From the higher perspective of the unity of all life, however, this self-concept is inherently flawed. The actions of such a being spring from unconscious motives prompted by the higher purposes that govern the course of the cosmos as a whole.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Katherine K.

Primitive extraction is the process of finding geometric primitives in geometric data. Such data are obtained directly by active sensors such as laser rangefinders, by processes that operate on passive sensor data to create depth information such as stereo vision, or by simple edge detection and thresholding of intensity images. A geometric primitive is a curve or surface which can be described by an implicit function. We show that the best solution to this problem is at the global optimum of a cost function which often has very many local optima. This global optimum represents the best consensus in the data with regard to the extraction problem. The consensus paradigm attempts to find this global optimum by randomly choosing small subsets of the data and evaluating the cost function for each subset. We apply the consensus paradigm to this problem by randomly sampling minimal subsets. This is a simple and general way of finding the best consensus. For primitive extraction a minimal subset is the smallest number of points necessary to define a geometric primitive. The issues of how to choose the appropriate cost function, how to decide on the number of random samples, and how to convert between a minimal subset and the parameter vector that defines the primitive are explored in detail. While effective, the consensus approach using random sampling often requires a large number of random samples, and therefore a large number of cost function evaluations. We address this problem by combining the consensus paradigm with a genetic algorithm that uses the minimal subset representation. A genetic algorithm is an optimization method based on the evolutionary metaphor. It has been successfully applied to difficult optimization problems, where the cost function is noisy, multi-dimensional, and has many local minima. In our applications the genetic algorithm is able to use local geometric information to produce a global solution in a way that usually avoids the problem of premature commitment. The resulting method often requires far fewer cost function evaluations than the random sampling approach. Some ways of implementing these algorithms on different parallel architectures are described.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, M. D.

The three latter T cells were found to recognize immunodominant T cell epitopes on the G1 domain of PG and cross-reacted with link protein. The presence of KS chain(s) close to T cell epitopes restricted the reactivity of the two T cell hybridomas. The location of one T cell hybridoma epitope (TH5) was contained within a peptide of twenty eight amino acids in the B region of G1. T cell line JY.A can induce early pathological change characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis when injected in the knee joint of naive BALB/c mice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Poole, A.
