Assuming that locations which are maximally interesting will be most useful for recognizing an image, it follows that a location selected by an attention operator will facilitate image recognition if it is of interest to a human. Since attention operators are increasingly being used to replace humans in vision tasks, it is relevant that their performance be compared to human vision. Five different operators were evaluated. Human subjects were shown a series of black and white images in quick succession after which they were presented subimages extracted from the original image set as well as from other images. Subjects were asked to indicate whether they could recognize the subimages. The number of false-positives and true-positives associated with each operator provided information on the interest of the selected locations. Results show that the operators do not perform equally, with some selecting more recognizable image locations than others.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, F.

The energy of the large impact (South Pole-Aitken) is enough to remove the urKREEP layer from beneath the ejecta blanket by mantle circulation and is interpreted as the removal of the heat source for partial melting of a shallow mare basalt source region and explains the absence of fill in the basin while a small impact (Imbrium) cannot produce enough mantle circulation in the time allotted to remove the layer of heat producing elements from the basin surroundings.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Arkani-Hamed, Jafar (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m03b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765372872</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c232s"><dcterms:title>Delirium in the elderly : a survival analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kakuma, Ritsuko.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mortality rates have consistently been shown to be greater in patients with delirium compared to those without. Published work over the last decade has revealed however, that several confounding factors play key roles in contributing to the excess mortality in the delirium population and that statistical adjustment for these factors in multivariate analyses minimizes, if not eliminates, the association between delirium and mortality. These factors include pre-existing dementia, advanced age, severe medical illness, diminished functional status, and intoxication or withdrawal from medications. However, studies on prognosis and prognostic indicators of delirium in the past have been limited to subjects admitted to the hospital where the sample may include both incident and prevalent cases of delirium. Objective. To determine whether prevalent delirium is an independent predictor for mortality among elderly patients seen in the Emergency department. Potentially confounding factors were assessed to reveal their prognostic contributions in this population. Survival analysis was carried out using the Cox Proportional Hazards Modelling technique. Methods. As part of a larger study, 268 patients seen in the Emergency department in two Montreal hospitals (107 delirium cases, 161 controls) were followed up in 6 month intervals for a total of 18 months. Dates of deaths for the deceased were obtained from the Ministere de la Sante et des Service Sociaux. Results. The analysis revealed a non-significant association between delirium and mortality rate for the English speaking subjects, when adjusted for age, sex, pre-morbid cognitive decline (IQCODE), Basic ADL, Instrumental ADL, comorbidity, number of medication, education (years), eyesight, and hearing problems (p = 0.752, HR =1 .095, CI: 0.622--1.929). On the other hand, for the French speaking subjects, the same model revealed a highly significant association between delirium and death rate (p = 0.001, HR = 9.078, CI: 2.362--34.892). Possible explanations for the different results are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galbaud du Fort, Guillaume (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx89j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c232s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gerontology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r281w"><dcterms:title>Developmental competence of prepubertal and adult goat oocytes cultured in semi-defined media</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Koeman, Jennifer.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In vitro production of embryos from oocytes recovered by laparoscopic oocyte pick-up (LOPU) offers great potential for the propagation of genetically valuable animals.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the developmental competence of prepubertal and adult goat oocytes cultured in semi-defined media. The follicular response and recovery of oocytes via LOPU from hormonally stimulated prepubertal and adult goats were also assessed. Oocytes were collected over a 15-wk period from prepubertal goats, ranging in age between 3--7 mo, and adult controls, ranging in age between 2--4 yr, randomly divided into 10 collection groups. Oocytes from six of the ten collections were matured for 26 h. Four collections were not completed due to technical difficulties. Following insemination, zygotes were cultured for 4 d in G1.2 followed by 4 d in G2.2. Morulae and blastocysts were scored via light microscopy on Days 7 and 9, followed by fluorescent staining on Day 9 for cell counts.

In yeast, complete loss of frataxin causes mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative stress. Although FRDA cells exhibit impaired respiratory complex activity and greater sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death, an increase in steady-state mitochondrial iron levels has not been conclusively shown. Pulse-chase experiments using FRDA fibroblasts suggest that severe disturbances in iron metabolism occur following supplementation with iron levels sufficient to overwhelm residual frataxin in these cells. Moreover, frataxin appears capable of forming high molecular weight complexes with iron in vitro, but the propensity of iron to nonspecifically associate with biomacromolecules complicates confirmation of this finding. Lastly, induction of oxidative stress in FRDA cells by iron loading appears unable to initiate the expected transcriptional upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, possibly as a result of failed NF-kappaB activation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pandolfo, Massimo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074x03p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb22f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429c02p"><dcterms:title>The nature and origins of caldera structure and morphology, using results from analogue modeling /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kennedy, Ben.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Calderas illustrate a variety of different styles which are controlled by their internal structure and morphology. The internal structure of many calderas is not exposed; as a result, the calderas frequently are interpreted as simple pistons. The results and examples from this thesis indicate that caldera structure is often more complex than this and that caldera formation consists of several stages controlled by complex interactions of many variables. Internal processes and parameters include rock properties (shear strength, planes of weakness, vertical and horizontal variations), dimensions and internal pressure of the associated magma chamber, styles of tumescence and resurgence, and the size of the eruption. External processes and parameters are also important, such as the regional stress regime (e.g., extensional and pull-apart basins), pre-existing topography, and pre-existing structures (e.g., regional faults, basement grain). Scaled physical models of caldera formation were carried out to investigate the effects of some of these variables on the temporal development of calderas.

The ecology of methanotrophs was investigated in a beech forest soil which exhibited atmospheric-methane-uptake. Maximal methane-oxidation was observed in the upper mineral layer between the organic and inorganic horizons at a rate of 3.1 +/- 0.3 nmoles CH 4 g [fresh wt soil]-1 d-1. A clone bank of the methanotroph pmoA gene was constructed by PCR amplification from soil DNA extracts. The PCR primers used coamplify the related amoA gene of ammonia-oxidizers. The clones recovered grouped into three clusters: Nitrosospira-like sequences, a group somewhat related to alpha-Proteobacteria methanotrophs and previously referred to as the RA14 group, and a cluster which could not be characterized as either amoA or pmoA sequences. No pmoA genes closely related to genera of cultured methanotrophs were obtained. The 16S rDNA was also targeted using eubacterial and methanotroph-specific primers. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of organisms distantly related to known methanotrophs. Methanotroph enrichment cultures were established by inoculating mineral salts medium with soil and incubating under an atmosphere of 10% methane in air. Gene sequencing from the enrichments indicated the presence of organisms belonging to the genera Methylosinus and Methylocystis. The results suggest that the dominant methanotrophs in the forest soil are not related to known organisms and do not grow under conditions typically used to isolate methanotrophs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Driscoll, B.

Batch reactor experiments were performed with the municipal wastewater of Ste-Julie to simulate the biological processes occurring in the lagoon system. The first, second, and third lagoons were characterized in terms of soluble BOD, soluble COD, total solids, total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids, and TOC. The influent wastewater is classified as weak wastewater containing a relatively low concentration of soluble BOD compared to total BOD. The microbial communities in the first three lagoons were characterized using the BIOLOG redox technology which allows the simultaneous testing of the populations for the utilization of 95 carbon substrates. Finally, the specific initial BOD or TOC removal rates were determined for the first three lagoons.

One characteristic distinguishing the H1 subtypes is that the somatic H1 histones are found primarily in dividing cells, whereas the H10 subtype is predominantly found in differentiated cells. The H1 complement in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos from wild-type and H10-/- animals was investigated. Immunocytochemistry of wild-type cells demonstrated that H10 was predominant in oocytes while somatic H1 began accumulating in the 2-cell embryo. In H10-/- cells H10 was not detected, but, surprisingly, somatic H1 was detected beginning at the 1-cell stage. Radiolabeling of wild-type and H10-/- cells revealed that somatic H1 synthesis intensified after meiotic maturation, and therefore prior to its detection in embryos. The functional study found that loss of H10 impaired oogenesis but enhanced embryogenesis. The patterns of H1 immunodetection and synthesis are integrated, and the significance of H1 composition in development is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clarke, Hugh J.

A single point-to-plate EHD system was used in de-watering sugar solutions and glycerin-water mixtures having viscosity between 2 and 22 mPa s. The EHD and forced air (2.5 m s-1) each produced 3 to 5 times higher evaporation rate than the control, which was at ambient temperature and relative humidity. The vapor flux decreased considerably and quadratically compared with the control as viscosity increased, and the dehydration kinetics was linear regardless of viscosity. Agar gels showed a linear relationship between vapor flux and time, and EHD was effective in drying at sub-zero temperatures. The agar temperature during drying was significantly below the ambient, indicating evaporative and entropic cooling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barhakure, N. N.

It also attempts to show that, even if all these risk sharing regimes have been modeled after NASA's, there are certain important differences, which stem from the different political objectives of each of the countries where these carriers are inserted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jakhu, Ram S.

In the past, Venezuela placed tough restrictions upon the entry and operation of foreign investment. These restrictions were made possible as long as petroleum prices remained high and the country had access to cheap international bank loans. The debt crisis in the 1980s, a drop in commodity prices, and a decrease in international bank loans once again made FDI an attractive source of foreign capital. In order to attract greater FDI inflows, Venezuela began to liberalize its foreign investment laws in the mid-1980s. Despite these changes, FDI inflows into Venezuela have been erratic. This paper then discusses some of the adjustments Venezuela will have to make in order to attract greater foreign investment inflows, and ends with an examination of how the country can maximize FDI's contribution to its economic development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, J.

Space debris is not as far out as it sounds. The issue is real and may become severe if no action is taken. Focusing on existing legal instruments, this study shows their inadequacy in addressing space debris. As space debris was not considered an actual or a legal problem at the time of drafting, the provisions of international space law fail to provide solutions in certain areas. Recommendations for the future are made. Considering the increase in outer space activities, solutions for the space debris threat are a necessity. Developing technology will only solve some of the problems as the amount of space debris proliferates in collisions of existing debris. Therefore, legal challenges will also be faced, some of which are discussed herein.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jakhu, R. S.

Such additives are generally introduced to the paper stock prior to the web formation, so that fines and fillers are flocculated and retained into the forming web. This study investigated the mechanism of fines and filler retention under the high shear typical of papermaking. Retention and drainage were optimized using the newly built Laboratory Twin Former. The variables of interest include the concentrations of a cationic polyacrylamide polymer (CPAM) and bentonite, and their residence times with the furnish. The former variables provide information for optimal bridging efficiency between the furnish components, while the latter variables indicate the appropriate location for adding the retention aid to reach maximum retention. The experimental results indicated that the bridging theory well predicts a maximum retention when only CPAM is used. For the microparticulate system, a longer residence time of bentonite in the furnish is preferable so that the fines retention improves by allowing sufficient time for colloids coagulation and by promoting bentonite deposition on the polymer coated fines. We also studied the mechanism of fines retention and quantified the drainage rate at the jet impingement region, with and without retention aids. By individually varying the jet velocity and the jet angle, the two velocity components of the jet, i.e. VjetX and VjetY were controlled. The slice opening and the wire velocity were kept constant. For the range investigated, the drainage force proportional to V jetY had little effect on fines retention or drainage. A high shear impact on the wire by increasing the jet velocity, and consequently by augmenting VjetX relative to the wire speed, reduced the fines retention and restricted the drainage rate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Garnier, Gil (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn321.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53wx61m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture, Wood Technology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk60q"><dcterms:title>Skimming of fluid slag</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ng, Ka Wing, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A 1/12 scale tank was constructed to physically simulate the metallurgical skimming process in order to gain a better insight of the skimming of fluid slag from copper anode furnaces. 1-decanol and water were used to represent the slag and the underlying liquid metal respectively. It was observed that slag skimming was comprised of two steps, a transportation step to carry slag to the skimming lip, and a removal step to move the slag across the lip. The efficiency of the transportation by bath surface circulation was strongly affected by the method of creation of the surface movement. Submerged gas injection failed to carry slag to the lip effectively because of the uncontrollable circulation pattern generated on the bath surface. On the other hand, three impinging gas jets in glancing contact with the bath surface were able to carry slag to the lip effectively. The Re of the jets (I.D. 0.01m) inclined 50° to the horizontal was 6100. The jet configuration was two of the jets were placed close and parallel to the rear wall of the model and faced each other. The third jet was parallel to the model short axis and was directed at the skimming mouth. With the same amount of time, 70% of the slag originally charged to the tank was skimmed with the assistance from the impinging gas jets in comparison to 20% when no jet was used. Detailed analysis of the skimming process revealed that the underlying liquid bath level continuously decreased as the slag was skimmed and resulted in continuous reduction of the skimming rate. In order to compensate the reduction of skimming rate due to bath level reduction, a control strategy was proposed for rotating the furnace continuously to maximize the skimming effectively.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harris, Ralph (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j291m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk60q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h1361"><dcterms:title>AlN precipitation in dual-phase 3% SI electrical steels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Oh, Jae Hoon, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The existing approaches to the detection of precipitation are based on one of the following four techniques: (1) electron microscopy; (2) chemical or electrochemical extraction; (3) the measurement of electrical resistivity; and (4) the analysis of mechanical properties. These techniques can only be used at room temperature on quenched samples. However, the direct measurement of precipitation kinetics at high temperatures is also possible through analysis of the mechanical properties of the specimens. In this work, a creep method was developed and applied to the detection of aluminum nitride precipitation in a dual phase 3% silicon steel. These steels are used in electric power applications, typically as magnetic core materials for transformers, electric motors and generators. Prior to loading, the specimens are solution treated for 20 minutes and then cooled to the test temperature. A constant stress is applied to the sample by means of a computerized MTS machine and the strain is recorded continuously during testing. Microstructural examination revealed that the austenite fraction and morphology and microstructure of the ferrite matrix are quite different depending on whether samples are directly heated or heated and then cooled to the test temperature. The resulting creep rate is sensitive to the occurrence of precipitation; thus the slope of the true strain-log (time) curve decreases immediately after initiation. The precipitation-time-temperature diagrams determined in this way are of classical C shape.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, J. J.

One of the main challenges in realizing free-space interconnects is achieving misalignment tolerance. This thesis presents the design of a receiver used in a system that makes use of spatial redundancy to increase misalignment tolerance. The system consists of four 1Gb/s free-space optical links between two printed circuit boards. It has +/-1mm of lateral misalignment tolerance and +/-1 degree of tilt misalignment tolerance with the spacing between the boards varying from 5cm to 21.5cm. This makes the system ideal for a rack-based interconnection. The receiver for this system is a rapidly re-configurable array that accepts nine low-amplitude, high-speed photocurrents, selects one of them, and then outputs that signal as a digital differential positive emitter coupled logic (PECL) signal. The selection of which channel to amplify is based on received power, and is performed off-chip. The design, packaging, and testing of the receiver are presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064758m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r16h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903175z"><dcterms:title>Pre-Islamic Turkish elements in the art of the Seljuqid period (1040-1194)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pocock, V.

As this thesis represents a first investigation of the topic, it was necessary to retrace Turkish history from its beginnings to fully understand its dynamic, but also to analyze the art historical and cultural past of the Turkish peoples in order to assess the degree of probability of Turkish influence on Islamic art as well as the means of its penetration. The vaster arena of this research is the field of Central Asian history and the growing awareness of the important cultural ramifications of its widespread Indo-Buddhist culture. Due to the complexity of the thesis topic, a simple method has been followed to present the material. The thesis is divided into three chapters, each addressing a major issue. The first chapter introduces the four major Turkish steppe dynasties and their art in so far as archaeology permits. The second chapter deals with the process of Islamicization of the Turks, while the third chapter broaches the issue of Turkish influence on Islamic art of the Seljuqid period under four headings: architecture, architectural decoration, animal imagery, and figurative iconography. The basic premise of this paper is the assumption that, if the Turks played such a major role in the political developments of medieval dar al-islam, they must have also contributed, consciously or not, to the formation of medieval Islamic art.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Little, D.

This is achieved by analyzing the development of the organization vis a vis other Muslim women's organizations. It looks at the activities of `Aisyiyah during the period extending from its birth in 1917 until the late New Order era of the 1990s, with close reference to other women's organizations. A comparison of the activities of `Aisyiyah with those of other women's organizations, and an analysis of the response of this organization towards such issues as polygamy, is also an important feature of this work. While there was much common purpose, still, inevitable differences in perspective, even disharmony developed between `Aisyiyah and other women's groups. This was due in many respects to its determination to maintain its identity as a Muslim women's organization, while it at the same time faced certain limitations by virtue of its being a part of the Muhammadiyah. In general, however, `Aisyiyah is no different from other women's organizations in Indonesia, all of which have tried to represent women's interests and have struggled for their enhancement, while at the same time being faced with the challenges posed by a constantly changing political situation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alui, Sajida S.

Located on the shores of the St. Lawrence River, Kahnawake was faced with the expropriation of 1,262 acres of land for the construction of a canal that effectively cut off the community's access to the river and reduced its land base. Regarded by its members as one of the most important events in Kahnawake's history, the Seaway has become part of the everyday discourse of the community. This thesis examines two recurring themes in the discourse about the Seaway---the factionalism in the community at the time of the construction, and memories about the river---and illustrates how this event informs the present political identity of Kahnawake. The Seaway has become a metaphor for the intrusiveness of the Canadian government and the necessity of resisting any encroachment on Kahnawake's autonomy, and as such has played an important part in the development of nationalism in this community.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morantz, Toby (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623f397.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w414j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Canada -- Government relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kahnawake Indian Reserve (Québec)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saint Lawrence Seaway.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
