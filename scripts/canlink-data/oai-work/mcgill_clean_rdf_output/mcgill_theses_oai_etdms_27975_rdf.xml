The three trend measures investigated included Poisson regression, ordinary least squares (OLS), and a measure based on Raveh's measure of monotone association for time series. Assumptions required for the parametric methods of Poisson regression and OLS were not satisfied. The non-parametric method based on the ranking of the measure of monotone association did not require such assumptions. Significant spatial correlation in the measure of monotone association was observed for all-cause mortality. Using deaths among persons 35-69 years for 3 causes, comparisons were carried out by cross-tabulations, Pearson rank correlation coefficients, and an investigation of discrepancies. Minor discrepancies resulted from differences in trends of age-specific death rates and from CDs with small populations. Rather than distinguishing further between the three trend measures, guidelines should be developed for minimum populations at risk required for mapping as well as methods for combining regions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zc26t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c93x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Demography.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p157f"><dcterms:title>Effect of chloride ions on the adsorption of cadmium from leachate onto kaolinite</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sheremata, Tamara W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) produced in Canada was 12.6 million tonnes in 1980. Cadmium, which is one heavy metal characteristically present in leachate from MSW, is an extremely toxic metal to all living organisms. Clay liners are used to contain contaminants such as heavy metals (aluminum, mercury, manganese, lead, and zinc) present in leachate from landfill sites containing MSW. Consequently, an investigation into the mechanisms of cadmium adsorption from leachate onto clay was pursued. Characteristically, such leachates contain trace quantities of heavy metals and abundant quantities of chloride ions. For this study, leachate samples were collected from the Meloche landfill site in Kirkland, Quebec. This leachate is characteristic of other leachates, and in one monitoring well it contained cadmium (Cd) at 0.069 mg/L (ppm) and chloride ions (Cl$ sp-$) at 677 mg/L (ppm). Under these conditions, the formation of complex ions between cadmium and chloride has the potential to interfere with the adsorption of cadmium by clay minerals.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j925n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p157f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r9674875"><dcterms:title>An evaluation of a multidimensional intervention for learning disabled adolescents /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schnaiberg, Romy S.

Individualized programs which incorporate components to promote motivation, skill building, skill generalization and strategy use, and social competence have been called for in the literature (Deshler, Schumaker, Lenz, &amp; Ellis, 1984), however, there have been remarkably few evaluations of such programs (Horn, O'Donnell, &amp; Vitulano, 1983). This study evaluated a multidimensional intervention program using the objectives-oriented method. The Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement and three nonstandardized measures were used to evaluate the four program objectives. Analysis of the individuals' gains indicated that objective achievement was idiosyncratic. Group gain analysis indicated significant gains only in English class marks, F(7,1) = 7.40, p =.3.

The wideband speech signals have a bandwidth of up to 8 kHz and are sampled at 16 kHz, while the target operating bit rate is 16 kbits/sec. Applications for such a coder range from high-quality voice-mail services to teleconferencing. In order to achieve a low operating rate, the coding places more emphasis on the lower frequencies (0 to 4 kHz), while the higher frequencies (4 to 8 kHz) are coded less precisely but with little perceived degradation. The study consists of three stages. First, aspects of wideband spectral envelope modeling using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF's) are studied. Then, the underlying coder structure is derived from a basic Residual Excited Linear Predictive coder (RELP). This structure is enhanced by the addition of a pitch prediction stage, and by the development of full-band and split-band pitch parameter optimization procedures. These procedures are then applied to an Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) model. Finally, the performance of full-band and split-band CELP structures are compared.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g6309.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032422q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asx61dn593"><dcterms:title>Nicolas Poussin's The Four Seasons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Challons, Siu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nicolas Poussin's landscapes, The Four Seasons, 1660-1664, have been the subject of extensive analysis because of their enigmatic character and the modulation in Poussin's style in his last years. The meaning of these representations has, however, remained cryptic and, to some extent, neglected. This thesis attempts to make a contribution toward unravelling the mystery of The Four Seasons. These profound works reflect Poussin's religious persuasion, knowledge of which is essential to an understanding of them. Poussin's religious convictions, however, are difficult to discern with any precision; for, although he died a Catholic, he was closely associated with the progressive thinking that influenced religious belief in the Baroque age, much of which was rejected by the Church of Rome. Nevertheless, Poussin was undoubtedly a devout Christian, inspired particularly by the early Christian Fathers and Stoics. It is in nature, above all, though, that he perceived God's presence and message which he strove to capture in his "altarpiece" to the seasons.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278v233.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dn593</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Poussin, Nicolas, 1594?-1665.

This thesis describes some of the issues involved in the design of geometric primitive operations that are reliable and accurate when implemented. In particular, algorithms are presented for the problems of point coincidence, determination of the orientation of the angle formed by three ordered points, line segment intersection and point inclusion in a triangle. The algorithms return a YES or NO answer only if it can be determined, through error analysis techniques, that the answer is definitely correct; otherwise a descriptive error message is returned. The techniques of partitioning a problem into rectangular sub-problems, and defining bounding rectangles around regions of interest are used to reduce the amount of numerical computation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w597x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s134w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708x84n"><dcterms:title>The development of a distributed methodlogy for process simulation with applications in pipe flow /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cohen, Steven G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The increases in complexity of industrial process simulations necessitate faster methods and more accurate models for analysis. In many cases automation of industrial plants using real-time control cannot be solved using present computer methodologies. This thesis introduces a parallel methodology that outlines the steps to design and implement a distributed continuous simulation. Implementing the system in parallel reduces the simulation time to comply with predetermined time constraints. The methodology determines the structure of the simulator, organization of the distributed tasks and management of the variable memory allocation. A dynamic model for transient, incompressible pipe flow is used to test the parallel methodology. The generalized flow equations are developed for two applications: a tank-pipe and pipe network model. The models are translated into computer algorithms using parallel techniques developed in the simulation methodology. The individual subroutines of the simulation are directly implemented on a parallel processing and a multi-tasking computer. The flow algorithms are tested on both computers to demonstrate the benefits obtained by using the parallel methodology on a multi-processor computer. Model sizes are varied to provide a performance scale comparing multi-processor results with that of a single processor.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731513c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x84n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967490g"><dcterms:title>A study of forward head-body tilts in human balance control /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lo Monaco, Emmanuel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to investigate the contributions of both the vestibular and foot/ankle somatosensory inputs to the mechanisms controlling lower limb muscular activity of normal human subjects.

A paradigm was developed whereby the vestibular and the ankle proprioceptive afferent systems were systematically and selectively controlled or eliminated. There was a greater tendency for reflex response to be activated in the three lower limb muscles when the forward tilts had an acceleration larger than 1.4 g. This was found when the whole head-body tilts were delivered with minimal changes in ankle angle or a significant change in ankle angle from the neutral position towards dorsiflexion. Frequency of occurrence was greater for the more proximal muscle when there was minimal ankle dorsiflexion, and for one of the distal muscles when there was ankle dorsiflexion. The proximal hip extensor muscle tended to have the shortest latency during whole head-body tilts alone, while the most distal muscles had the shortest latency when the tilts occurred concomitantly with ankle rotation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j704.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967490g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nj279"><dcterms:title>The significance of James Bay Cree cultural values and practices in school committee policy-making : a documentary study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Douglas, Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This documentary study sought to determine the relevance of the James Bay Cree's cultural values and practices to their policy-making process as school committee members.

Using the historical method, both primary and secondary sources were searched for relevant information concerning Cree culture and its distinguishing characteristics. Evidence of a distinct egalitarian society, practicing consensus, reciprocity and communal land use was found. Sources also indicated the continuing existence and adaptability of Cree values and practices despite prolonged interaction with non-native society. This thesis proposes that these cultural values and practices predispose the Cree to be effective school committee members.

After an exposition of Sohngen's three categories of relationship between music and theology (music as science, as worship, and as creatura) there is an extensive examination of Messiaen's compositional techniques which reveals the latter's implicit use of these same three categories.

Then it analyses the dispositions of the FTA in their relevancy. Finally, it examines the opportunity of inserting such principles in an eventual multilateral agreement on trade in services.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm643.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634493v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161741p"><dcterms:title>Isolation, purification and characterization of lipoxygenase isozymes from canola (Brassica napus cv, Westar) seed</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khalyfa, Abdelnaby</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lipoxygenase was extracted from Canola seeds (Brassica napus cv, Westar) and partially purified by precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 20-50% of saturation. The optimum pH for the enzyme activity was 7.5 and its K$ sb{ rm m}$ value was 2.0 $ times$ 10$ sp{-4}$ M. The activity of the enzyme extract was considerably greater on linoleic acid than on its ester or on linolenic acid. The effect of cyanide on the enzyme activity was also investigated. Further purification of the enzyme extract was performed by successive chromatography on ion-exchange and gel filtration, using FPLC system. Four lipoxygenase isozymes (I, IIA, IIB and III) were separated. The homogeneity of each isozyme was demonstrated by the presence of a single protein band on SDS-PAGE gel electophoresis. The molecular weights of isozymes I, IIA, IIB and III were, respectively, 72,000, 106,000, 78,000 and 62,000. The optimum pH for lipoxygenase activity was 6.5 for isozyme I and 6.0 for isozymes IIA, IIB and III.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bq54q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161741p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lipoxygenases.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canola.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj886"><dcterms:title>Outlet discharge coefficients of ventilation ducts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kinsman, Roger Gordon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Discharge coefficients are an important parameter in the prediction of the air displacement performance of ventilation outlets and in the design of ventilation ducts. Discharge coefficients of a wooden ventilation duct 8.54 metres in length and of a constant 0.17 m$ sp2$ cross sectional area were measured. Four different outlet shapes and 3 aperture ratios of each shape were tested. A split plot experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of outlet shape, outlet size, and distance from the fan on discharge coefficient. The relationship between duct performance characteristics and discharge coefficient was examined. A mathematical equation to predict the discharge coefficient was developed and tested. Discharge coefficient values measured ranged from 0.19 to 1.25 depending on the aperture ratio and distance from the fan. Outlet shape had no significant effect. The apparent effects of aperture ratio and size are due to the effects of head ratio. The equation predicting the discharge coefficient had a maximum error of 5 percent for the aperture ratios of 0.5 and 1.0, and 15 percent at an aperture ratio of 1.5.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9997900.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj886</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Air ducts -- Design and construction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air flow -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451j740"><dcterms:title>Contribution à l'étude de la représentation picturale de la ville dans le futurisme italien</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hollevoet, Christel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Partant du constat de l'importance du sujet pour le peintre futuriste a une epoque ou les avant-gardes europeennes tendent a l'abstraction, la presente etude demontre que la ville fut un theme capital dans l'elaboration de l'esthetique futuriste. En effet, les peintres italiens ne cherchaient pas tant a depeindre l'apparence, l'aspect visible de la ville qu'a apprehender de facon conceptuelle les idees-forces qui en emanaient. A travers l'entite "ville", ils revelerent les concepts inherents au monde moderne et en etablirent les equivalents plastiques. Ainsi, c'est a travers le sujet de la ville que s'expriment les idees-forces les plus originales du mouvement, telles que la modernolatrie, le dynamisme universel, la vitesse, le devenir, la transformation, l'unanimisme et le simultaneisme, illustres dans trois chapitres intitules 'La ville montante', 'La ville electrisee' et 'La ville simultanee'. Geux-ci demontrent comment certains motifs recurents du cadre urbain comme les echafaudages des chantiers de construction, les lampadaires, les foules ou les bolides sont transcendes par ces idees-forces. La representation de la ville par les futuristes ne releve pas simplement de la description mais d'un programme d'abord politique puis esthetique: l'avant-garde italienne a cree une nouvelle conception du beau, a revele la beaute de la ville moderne et des valeurs qui lui sont inherentes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x5169.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j740</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Art, Italian -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Futurism (Art) -- Italy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cities and towns in art</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440t61w"><dcterms:title>On literary expertise : the description of a fictional narrative by experts and novices</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Graves, Barbara</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this research is to provide an account of literary expertise by examining literary experts and students in English Literature as they describe a fictional narrative. The experimental text is a complex narrative conveyed by means of character dialogue. To investigate expert performance this study developed a model of text description that identified semantic units in the description protocols as a set of possible "discursive patterns." A discursive pattern identifies the text unit being described along with the point of reference of the description, that is, from the point of view of the reader, the author, or simply the text. The results indicate that students' descriptions closely paraphrased the text, repeating either the narrative events or the characters' speech, while experts' descriptions reflected higher-level references to narrative structure or the function of the dialogue which were derived either from the text or from prior knowledge. Experts relied on specific information in the text as a support for more inferential statements. In addition, experts commented more extensively on the language of the text. Experts also included references to the author, the reader and the relationship between the two. It seems that experts view the text as the result of deliberate linguistic and conceptual choices made by an author and awareness of these choices appears to guide their descriptions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gh49r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t61w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Criticism -- Methodology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Critics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193b20f"><dcterms:title>The legal rights of masters, mistresses and domestic servants in Montreal, 1816-1829 /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hogg, Grace Laing</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In early nineteenth century Lower Canada, a direct relationship existed between the colony's laws of employment and the nature of its economy. As the artisanal and manufacturing centre of British North America, Montreal, in the first third of the century, had a pre-industrial economy. Its legal treatment of the master/servant relationship was established and directed by masters, and drew heavily upon the spirit of the pre-industrial traditions of English common law, emphasizing the criminal liability of servants failing to respect contractual obligations. Montreal's domestic servants, who were drawn from the poor and popular classes, and included mostly women and minors, were often at the greatest disadvantage in this legal system, because of their gender and economic backgrounds. Not only did their masters and mistresses have economic and social advantages, but they also controlled the legal system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r746.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b20f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Master and servant -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Economic conditions -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Employees -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j71d"><dcterms:title>The effect of three vocal models on uncertain singers' ability to match and discriminate pitches /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gratton, Martine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of three different vocal timbres on uncertain singers' ability to match and discriminate pitches. Fifty-six children between six and eight year old were randomly assigned to one of four groups. In the Own Voices group, subjects were training in pitch matching using subjects' own voices. They trained in pitch discrimination using a model child voice as stimuli. In the Model Child group, subjects were training in pitch matching and pitch discrimination using a model child voice of the same sex and age as that of the subject. Subjects in the Female Adult group were training in pitch matching and pitch discrimination using a female adult voice as stimuli. Subjects in the control group had no training. It was found that timbre affected uncertain singers' ability to match and discriminate pitches. Pitch matching to one's own voice was more accurate than pitch matching to a child's voice. The discrimination of high and low pitches was more accurate when a model child's voice was used than when an adult voice was used.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g45d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j71d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Musical pitch</dc:subject><dc:subject>Musical ability -- Testing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans0647074"><dcterms:title>Studies on the immunosuppressive effect of human alpha-fetoprotein on cell-mediated immune reactions in vitro</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>O'Neill, Gary.</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117q130.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0647074</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666570n"><dcterms:title>Variability of tillering behaviour in six-rowed spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L. emend Lam.)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Casey Common, Julia.</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh60h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666570n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89d778g"><dcterms:title>Sodium-stimulated transport of metabolites in two marine bacteria</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Droniuk, Randal</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cm247.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d778g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
