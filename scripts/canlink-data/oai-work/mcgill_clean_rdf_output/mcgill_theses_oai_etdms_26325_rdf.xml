It was hypothesized that microglial activation in MS cortex and presumed associated stripping of GABAergic synapses would be associated with a lowering of GABA concentration. Twelve patients with MS (six relapsing remitting, six secondary progressive) and five healthy control subjects were examined using a GABA-optimized STEAM sequence on a scanner operating at 3.0 tesla. A volume of 2 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm including posterior cingulate and occipital cortex was chosen. GABA/Cr was reduced by approximately 50% in patients with MS with respect to healthy control subjects. This was true for relapsing remitting patients with short duration disease, as well as secondary progressive patients with longstanding disease. NA/Cr, Ino/Cr and GABA/NA were decreased, while Glu/Cr was increased in patients with respect to normal controls. These observations are consistent with a specific effect of MS on GABAergic interneurons. The fact that this occurs early in the disease suggests that a reduction in GABAergic inhibition may initially be part of a neuroprotective response.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831ck259.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708w80b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n1427"><dcterms:title>Diet diversity and infectious illness in young children in rural southern Madagascar</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Natalie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of the study was to determine whether diet diversity can predict the prevalence of infectious disease in children under 6-years in a rural African village.

A correspondence is then obtained between solutions of this new problem and traveling waves of the LDE. Drawing on existing theory regarding existence, uniqueness, and stability, two approaches are presented in Chapter 2 for solving the new formulation to obtain traveling wave solutions of the one-dimensional discrete Nagumo equation. Chapter 3 presents the results of the new approach applied to the two-dimensional discrete Nagumo and a one-dimensional Ising type model. Finally, Chapter 4 presents an extension of a previously reported method for obtaining the roots of a general class of characteristic equations arising in the study of traveling wave solutions to LDEs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr46f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn9996998</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax059c7728"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of alkane monooxygenase (alkB) genotypes from Arctic contaminated soils by culture-independent methods</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Víquez, Ana M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alkane monooxygenases (encoded by the alkB gene) are a group of microbial enzymes that catalyze the first reaction of alkane degradation. Studies to determine the diversity and prevalence of alkB genotypes in the environment have focused on culturable organisms. The goal of this research was to use culture-independent methods (DGGE, clone library) to identify and characterize alkB genes, and to determine their prevalence in Arctic contaminated soils. General alkB PCR degenerate primers (alkB-Mc) were designed using the conserved nucleotide sequences of the Histidine I Box and Histidine III Box. General alkB-Mc and alkM (Acinetobacter spp. alkane monooxygenase genes) primers were used to screen the soils for the presence of alkane monooxygenase genotypes. A predominance of the Rhodococcus spp. alkB genotypes and the absence of alkM genotypes in these soils was found. alkB PCR fragments amplified from the soils were analyzed by DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis). BlastN and blastX results of the DGGE bands sequences showed that they were similar to Rhodococcus spp. alkB genotypes (~80-90% DNA identity and ~80-90% amino acid homology). An alkB clone library was built using the general alkB-Mc primer set, screened by RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) and characterized by sequencing of alkB clones. BlastN and blastX results of the alkB clone sequences showed the presence of divergent alkB genotypes (≤ 70% DNA identity and ≤ 67% of amino acid homology to data base sequences). The alignment of the clone-derived amino acid sequences to confirm functional alkane monooxygenase sequences revealed the presence of Histidine Box II and the HYG motif in all of the deduced amino acid clone sequences. These results indicate that the alkB sequences from the clone library represent novel alkB sequences. Both alkB DGGE and clone library techniques were independently able to identify alkB genotypes from High G+C microorganisms as predominant in the 1A03 soil sample. Nevertheless, only the clone library approach identified putative novel alkB sequences. Mineralization of hexadecane and naphthalene was clearly observed at subzero temperatures (-5ºC) in Arctic contaminated soils, proving that the indigenous microbial communities could mineralize these representative hydrocarbons at subzero temperatures in an environment that is predominantly frozen for most of the year.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2362335.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c7728</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soil microbiology -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bioremediation -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alkane 1-Monooxygenase.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cytochrome P-450.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oil pollution of soils -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881m23n"><dcterms:title>Magnetic behaviour and Yb²+Yb³+ valence coexistence in Yb₅xSixGe₄-x</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Voyer, Christian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the discovery of a giant magnetocaloric effect in Gd5Si 2Ge2 that is associated with a first-order magnetostructural transition, the R5SixGe4- x materials (where R=Y,La-Lu) have come under intensive study. Systematic structural data has now been obtained for most of the R5Si xGe4-x compounds (Y, Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Er, and recently Yb), and from this structural data, trends have been begun to emerge. The Yb5SixGe 4-x system however defies all conventional wisdom and adopts the orthorhomic Gd5Si4 structure, independently of x, a unique feature in the R5SixGe 4-x family. The magnetic transition temperatures of the Yb5SixGe4- x compounds have been found to be monotonically increasing from 2.4 K to 3.2 K with increasing Ge content contrary to trend measured in other R5SixGe4- x compounds. Moreover, magnetic susceptibility suggests the presence of both Yb2+ and Yb3+ in all compounds at a 60:40 ratio. In this study, we have performed cold-source 170Yb Mossbauer spectroscopy on samples that have been previously fully characterized, and analyzed our data with an exact solution to the full Hamiltonian. We conclusively confirm the presence of both Yb2+ and Yb3+ ions in all samples, however with a ratio closer to 50:50. Previous attempts to assign specific crystallographic sites for them fail. We also find the magnetic transition temperature to be far lower than was indicated by the susceptibility data. More strikingly we find that the magnetic behavior of the x = 0 and 4 members is similar, with a single transition temperature at similar temperatures, whereas the middle members, x = 2, 3, have not only considerably different magnetic behaviour (we find two separate magnetic components with different ordering temperatures), but also lower transition temperatures. This system is considerably more complex than was originally thought.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kn42k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m23n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b1542"><dcterms:title>Morphologies and corona compositions in aggregates of mixtures of PS-b-PAA and PS-b-P4VP block copolymers as influenced by controllable assembly parameters</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vyhnalkova, Renata.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study is devoted to the morphologies and corona compositions in aggregates of mixtures of PS-b-PAA and PS-b-P4VP block copolymers as influenced by controllable assembly parameters, such as block length, pH, solvent, water content and the molar ratio of PAA/P4VP. Morphologies and surface properties of the aggregates were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and electrophoretic mobility, respectively. According to the results, the general hypothesis that the external corona is composed of long chains, while short chains form the inner corona of the vesicles, is valid only in mixtures without additives (no acid or base). In the presence of acid or base the environment during aggregate formation influences the system. Besides the numerical block length, pH and solvent composition, and therefore solubility, determines the morphology and the coil dimension; the numerically longer chains can be made to contract and to go to the inside, while the numerically shorter chains go to the outside.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zt569.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b1542</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gw504"><dcterms:title>Reinforcement learning in stochastic games against bounded memory opponents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vrljicak, Tomislav.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Learning to play in the presence of independent and self-motivated opponents is a difficult task, because the dynamics of the environment appear to be non-stationary.

One commonly used approach has been to restrict the opponent to a class of computationally bounded players, creating a parametrized model of it, and then search the model that can best explain the observed opponent behavior. In this thesis we study the problem of Reinforcement Learning in Stochastic Games, and propose two models for the opponent and two search algorithms, one based on Tests of Significance and the other on Maximum a Posteriori probabilities. We integrate the modeled opponent into a Markovian environment, and present an algorithm for solving the resulting MDP.

It is involved in multiple cellular processes, either directly or through its effect on the redox status of the cell. clk-1 encodes a highly conserved hydroxylase required for UQ biosynthesis. In C. elegans, mutations in clk-1 result in the accumulation of an UQ precursor, DMQ, and a pleiotropic phenotype in the mutants characterized by the slowing down of development, behaviors and aging. Additionally, in the absence of dietary UQ, clk-1 mutants also show a transient growth arrest and are sterile. Mutants that can suppress both sets of phenotypes in the point mutant clk-1(e2519) have been isolated. Their suppression patterns indicate that various aspects of the clk-1 phenotype can be uncoupled from each other. Furthermore, the analysis of their quinone content suggests that the phenotypes on UQ-producing bacteria are caused by the inability of dietary UQ to completely substitute for endogenous UQ. These suppressors carry mutations in tRNA genes, and thus to our knowledge, they are the first tRNA missense suppressors found in any metazoan.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526c63n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x54c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ubiquinones.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z063"><dcterms:title>Evidence for the putative roles of GABAergic, cholinergic and octopaminergic pharmacology in the auditory system of the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Naraine, Kim.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, two types of auditory interneurons, AN2 and ON1, have been studied. AN2 responds best to ultrasound frequencies (≥20kHz) produced by echolocating bats and initiates negative phonotaxis by the cricket. ON1 responds to both low (4-5kHz) and high frequency sounds and encodes the temporal information present in sounds of both frequencies. ON1 also provides lateral inhibition to contralateral interneurons, such as AN2, thereby enhancing binaural contrast. The pharmacology associated with these two interneurons is investigated here. ON1's response to 4.5kHz sound is increased following picrotoxin application, while it's ability to encode temporal information present in low and high frequency sounds is reduced. An increase in spiking response and a decrease in response latency to low frequency sound is produced by the addition of atropine, while d-tubocurarine application increased ON1's response latency to both 4.5kHz and 30kHz sound. The neuromodulator octopamine reduced AN2's response to ultrasound.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526c64x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z063</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auditory pathways.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oceanic field cricket.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rp041"><dcterms:title>Biotic and abiotic controls on soil respiration in a biodiversity plantation in the tropics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Murphy, Meaghan Thibault.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Sardinilla plantation is a long-term facility for studying the links between tree species diversity and ecosystem function.

It is caused by a protozoa parasite called leishmania. The current therapy for leishmaniasis is limited. Pentavalent antimonials (SbV) have been the recommended drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis for over 50 years, but long courses, and toxicity limits their use. New approaches for new therapies, including combination therapies, are urgently needed. Imiquimod is a novel compound that activates macrophages to kill leishmania amastigotes in vitro and could reduce disease severity in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). It is an agonist for the Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) on macrophages directing the development of Th1-type immune response required for resolution of leishmaniasis. A new combined model therapy for CL, was investigated in order to confirm that it was superior to SbV alone in the treatment of CL. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out using Sb V in combination with topical imiquimod (5%) or a placebo cream for the treatment of CL in Peru. The study shows that, when used in combination with SbV, imiquimod significantly shortens the time required for complete cure of CL and may reduce the severity of scarring. High costs and drug resistance to SbV are a big problem in endemic areas; therefore alternative drugs for SbV are necessary to possibly be used in combination with imiquimod. The findings of these studies represent a significant advance for leishmaniasis, demonstrating that it is possible to translate the rationale for combined therapy based in basic immunological concepts into action in the developing world.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w14n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096732c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn46x"><dcterms:title>Ground beetle (Coleoptera:Carabidae) communities along a successional gradient in southwestern Quebec and notes on the range expansion of introduced species</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mercado, Alida.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Species diversity is influenced by disturbance in the environment.

Seventy-three species (5139 individuals) were collected during both years of sampling, of which 9 species are introduced species and compose 64.8% of the total catch. In contrast to the predictions of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, diversity of ground beetles was higher in the agricultural fields and lowest in the old forests. The community composition, as seen with Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ordination, in the agricultural fields was the most distinct, while the difference between and among other habitats was less clear, possibly influenced by the introduced species present in the area. The introduced species collected had a significant influence in the total catch as they represented more than half of the total individuals collected and in the ground beetle community composition. The distribution of seven introduced species in Quebec was studied and compared to what was reported in 1975.

These genes display similar temporal and spatial expression patterns along the AP axis of the neural tube, with an anterior limit of expression in the posterior hindbrain. As the vertebrate Hox complex arose by duplication of an ancestral complex, members of the same paralog may have retained the presence of cis-regulatory elements characteristic of their ancestral ortholog. Hoxb4 has important roles in patterning of the neural ectoderm and the somitic mesoderm, as well as a key function in regulation of hematopoiesis. In this study, we investigated the role of the developmental regulator protein PAX6 in transcriptional regulation of the homeobox gene Hoxb4, using a P19 cell model. EMSA results demonstrated that PAX6 can bind to evolutionary conserved DNA motifs present in the early neural enhancer of Hoxb4 and Hoxd4. These motifs bear significant sequence homology with the PAX6 paired domain binding site (PD CON) site. ChIP analysis demonstrated that regulation of Hoxb4 is not directly mediated by PAX6 at the particular time of investigation. These results are in contrast with previous data obtained on regulation of Hoxd4 by PAX6. The data obtained in this study suggests that different mechanisms regulate the transcription of these two paralogous genes in the neural ectoderm. Alternatively, PAX6 may directly regulate Hoxb4 and Hoxd4 transcription at different time points during development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q922g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj31j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35t887v"><dcterms:title>Dynamical structures and precipitation distributions of transitioning tropical cyclones in Eastern Canada, 1979-2004</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Milrad, Shawn M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>From 1979-2004, 32 storms originally tropical in nature (as classified by the National Hurricane Center) have affected Eastern Canada to various degrees during or after extratropical transition (ET).

Results from Whapmagoostui were compared with those found in Mistissini and also the literature. Twenty-one plant species were cited during the survey. Although Cree medicine throughout Quebec and Canada is homogenous, geographical and vegetation gradients show some variations. Medicinal plants have better antioxidant potential than non-medicinal plants and have a higher phenolic content.

Here, it was investigated whether glutamate could exert an action on striatal neurogenesis by a metabotropic receptor mechanism in the developing rat. In vivo and in vitro methods were used to identify a role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in striatal neurogenesis. mGluR5 glutamate receptor activation promotes neuroblast proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. The results of these experiments suggest that glutamate acting via the mGluR5 receptor plays an important novel role in striatal neurogenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171x56z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h4737</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t213n"><dcterms:title>A survey of tree models in biological applications /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gao, Si Zhu, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We present a survey of mathematical models explored in computational biology.

In those cases, arc therapy offers the best way to optimize dose uniformity while sparing healthy tissues and critical organs. The use of this technique overcomes under or over dosage problems caused by field junctions. However, electron arc therapy presents important challenges in terms of dosimetry and treatment planning. Clinical implementation of electron arc therapy requires the study of many parameters of influence such as the radius of curvature of the treated surface, the width of the treatment field, the total angle of irradiation and the beam energy. Monitor unit calculation to deliver prescribed dose is a very critical topic and, in general, requires acquisition of a large amount of measured dosimetric data. This project concerns the clinical implementation of electron arc therapy using an Elekta SL-25 linear accelerator in the radiation oncology department of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital (Montreal, Canada). Firstly, the objective of the study is to observe the influence of the radius of curvature, the total arc angle and the field width on the following dosimetric parameters: depth of maximum dose, isodose distributions and electron arc beam output at the depth of maximum dose. Secondly, for our particular setup, the goal is to develop a simple monitor unit calculation method, based on an analytical model fitted through measured dosimetric data covering a large range of possible clinical situations. In order to achieve these goals, electron arc irradiations were performed on cylindrical acrylic phantoms of different radii, successively varying the total arc angle and the field width at isocentre. Results obtained with thermoluminescent dosimeters show a minor impact of the radius of curvature variation on the percent depth dose curves. However, they show a significant impact on the beam output. It was also observed that the total arc angle influences the dose at the depth of maximum dose only up to a limit angle value, different for each radius of curvature. Finally, the field width at isocentre has an impact on the beam output as well as on the bremsstrahlung contribution at the isocentre. Concerning the monitor unit calculation, a seven parameter analytical model fitted through measured data was obtained using Origin 7 software. A relationship giving the beam output as a function of the radius of curvature and the total arc angle was found. The field width was not included in the model, but will be part of further investigation before clinical implementation. As future work, dosimetric measurements with other energies should be carried on, mainly to be able to cover a wider range of clinical cases.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n364d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q923r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k760d"><dcterms:title>Microfabrication : using bulk wet etching with TMAH</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duan, Xuefeng, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In November 2002 a Microfabrication Lab was established in the physics department of McGill University to support research in nanoscience and technology. At the same time, I arrived at McGill to begin my graduate study. So I was assigned to do research on microfabrication, especially bulk wet etching of silicon using TetraMethyl Ammonium Hydroxide (TMAH). The content of microfabrication is quite broad, and also very useful in both industry and academic. Since our fab is a newly built one and I had no experience in this area before, this thesis mainly included some basic processes in microfabrication, such as the photolithography, wet etching, reactive ion etching, and soon. Also it compared the wet etching with dry etching. Some results of TMAH wet etching were showed in the thesis, which agreed well with that of the other groups. A simulation program was developed to predict the etching result of TMAH and it appeared to work well. Finally, based on the knowledge and experience acquired, processes in making cantilever and tip structures, which are critical in the scanning probe microscopes, were developed. Silicon oxide cantilevers with length of 100-200 mum, width of 30-50 mum, and thickness of 1 mum were obtained. Pyramid like silicon tips were also fabricated using the wet etching.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq00t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k760d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n365p"><dcterms:title>The effects of pneumoperitoneum and fluid administration on renal perfusion /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Demyttenaere, Sebastian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Minimally invasive surgeons are performing increasingly complex and time-consuming procedures on increasingly frail patients. Understanding the complex physiologic consequences of pneumoperitoneum is therefore of critical importance. This is especially true in the field of live laparoscopic donor nephrectomy where a thorough understanding of the effects of pneumoperitoneum on renal perfusion and function is mandated. A systematic review of the literature is undertaken and reveals that both renal perfusion and function are decreased during pneumoperitoneum. Next, a porcine model is established and used to compare the effects of aggressive fluid hydration (28cc/kg/h) versus maintenance fluid hydration (5cc/kg/h). We demonstrate that renal perfusion is preserved with aggressive fluid hydration. Finally, a noninvasive fluid administration algorithm based on esophageal Doppler stroke volume measurements is assessed. Using this technique, renal perfusion is preserved during pneumoperitoneum, using less fluid (10cc/kg/h) than a bolus group (25cc/kg/h). Fluid administration via the esophageal Doppler is a noninvasive way to target individual hemodynamics to maintain renal perfusion during pneumoperitoneum.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t659j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n365p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kg545"><dcterms:title>Graph layout for domain-specific modeling</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dubé, Denis, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this thesis is to investigate automatic graph layout in the context of domain-specific modeling. Inherent in the nature of domain-specific modeling is the creation of new formalisms to solve the current problem as well as the combined use of multiple formalisms. Unfortunately, graph layout algorithms tend to be formalism-specific, thus limiting their applicability. As a starting point, all major graph drawing techniques and many of their variants are summarized from the literature. Thereafter, several of these graph drawing techniques are chosen and implemented in AToM3, A Tool for Multi-formalism and Meta-Modeling. A new means of specifying formalism-specific user-interface behaviour is then described. By fully modeling the reactive behaviour of a formalism-specific modeling environment, including layout, existing graph drawing algorithms can be re-used without modification. The DCharts formalism is modeled to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv25x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kg545</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415p9724"><dcterms:title>Modeling and experimental characterization of a tethered spherical aerostat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Coulombe-Pontbriand, Philippe.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tethered helium balloons are known to be useful in applications where a payload must be deployed at altitude for a long duration. Perhaps the simplest such system is a helium-filled sphere tethered to the ground by a single cable. Despite its relative simplicity, there exists little data about light tethered spheres in a fluid stream. The current work focuses on an investigation of the dynamic characteristics of a spherical aerostat on single tether. A test facility was constructed to gather the experimental data required for a characterization of the system. The balloon's drag coefficient is extracted from the position measurements. Our experiments were all in the supercritical range that is, at Reynolds numbers greater than 3.7 x 105. We find that the balloon's large oscillations and surface roughness combined with the wind turbulence result in a substantial increase in the drag coefficient. A model of the dynamics of a spherical aerostat was previously developed at McGill University and our experimental data was used to refine and improve that simulation. The aerostat is modeled as a single body attached to the last node of a tether. It is subject to buoyancy, aerodynamic drag and gravity. The tether is modeled using a lumped-mass method. The dynamic simulation of the aerostat is obtained by setting up the equations of motion in 3D space and integrating them numerically. Finally, the model is validated through comparison with experimental data and a modal analysis is performed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tp64p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415p9724</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375w50f"><dcterms:title>The snow/snow water equivalent ratio and its predictability across Canada /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cox, Jessica, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The current practice of snowfall forecasting in Canada is to determine the snow water equivalent (SWE) expected to precipitate using a numerical weather predication model and then multiplying this amount by a snow/SWE ratio to determine the forecast snow depth.
