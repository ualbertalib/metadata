A total of 11,114 and 14,169 glial cells were counted in the corpus callosum of aged and adult mice using toluidine-blue stained preparations. The results for the aged mice are as follows. In the 2 hour group, the labelled cells were found to be immature glial precursor cells with a labelling index of 8.15%. These cells showed a labelling index of 18.69% in the 30 day group and 0% and 0%, respectively, in the 30 + 60 and 30 + 180 day groups. These results indicate "renewal" of the precursor cells.

The present thesis work analyzes the expression and regulation of maternal immunity to self Ia antigen, as well as to embryonic antigens common to fetal and tumor cells but absent from normal adult somatic tissues. Initial studies revealed that the in vitro proliferative capacity of thymus and bone marrow-derived T cells is enhanced during syngeneic murine pregnancy. Pregnancy was also found to promote the manifestation of autoreactive splenic T cells capable of mediating syngeneic graft-versus-host reactions. In addition, primigravid isopregnant mice harbour splenic T cells which are specifically sensitized to syngeneic fetal antigens. Both alpha-fetoprotein and a population of B-like pregnancy-associated splenic suppressor cells were shown to be potent regulators of autoimmune lymphoproliferative activity. Monoclonal antibodies (clone PSBA-1) were generated which, in the presence and absence of complement, abrogate the in vitro inhibitory activity of such suppressor cells. Moreover, a significant proportion of gravid females which were treated with PSBA-1 antibodies resorbed their embryos. Thus, a B-like suppressor cell appears to play a crucial immunoregulatory role during murine pregnancy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m76p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rh79m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qc96d"><dcterms:title>A comparative study to determine the effects of screening for intestinal parasites in newly-arrived Southeast Asian refugees /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gyorkos, Theresa Walburga.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate the effects of a screening programme for intestinal parasite infection in newly-arrived Southeast Asian refugees.

Further analyses concentrated on the Kampuchean group because of its large number and satisfactory participation rate. The greatest prevalence differences were found in hookworm and Ascaris infections. Continued high levels of Giardia and Strongyloides infection indicated the potential for transmission and the diagnostic challenges of imported parasites. A statistically significant reduction in self-reported morbidity was demonstrated between the treatment groups. However, no difference in health care utilization, measured as (outpatient) contact with a physician, was found over the six-month period.

Despite continuous increases in testis size, serum LH-profile characteristics became greatest between 2 and 4 months and declined thereafter. However, LH-peak frequency increased by about 2-fold between 6 and 7 months; this was associated with marked increases in testosterone (T) secretion and spermatogenic function. Mean FSH and PRL levels were maximum at 2 months and 3 to 5 months, respectively, and decreased thereafter. Increases in steroidogenic and spermatogenic function were due partly to increases in testicular content of LH and FSH receptors. Yearling ram testis size and spermatogenic function were predictable from testis size at 5 to 6 months, neonatal (50 days) secretion of LH and T, and pubertal (150 days) secretion of T.

Reduced dietary Zn (13 ppm) during the last 4 wk of pregnancy and first 2 wk of lactation presented no serious consequences to the dam or offspring. Reduction of dietary Zn throughout pregnancy and lactation (10 ppm) caused overt signs of Zn deficiency in one-half of the gilts, however, their offspring exhibited no obvious abnormalities. Zinc restriction did not affect feed consumption but depressed plasma and urinary Zn and plasma alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). The use of the balance technique and radiotracers revealed that gilts deficient in Zn initiated protective mechanisms such as, increased Zn absorption reduced endogenous Zn excretion, prolongation of the biological half life of Zn; all these responses affected higher efficiency of Zn utilization. Despite the protective mechanisms, gilts depleted in Zn exhibited prolonged stressful parturition and a high incidence of intrapartum and neonatal mortality than control gilts. Piglets from gilts depleted in Zn showed depressed birth weight, reduced concentrations of plasma Zn, Cu and ammonia and low APA and hematocrit, increased plasma concentrations of glucose and lactate, reduced content of Zn in liver, heart, lung, skin, bone and carcass and higher concentrations of Cu and Mn in various tissues compared to controls. Zinc depletion did not change the Zn content of colostrum but did change it in milk. Content of Cu, Fe, and Mn was effected in colostrum and milk. Weight of piglets was lower at one wk but not at two wk of age. Two-week old piglets exhibited lower Zn and higher Cu concentrations in plasma; reduced Zn and increased Cu and Mn concentrations in liver and bone and changes in Cu and Mn in other tissues. At the end of lactation, gilts depleted in Zn exhibited low level of Zn and APA in plasma; reduced Zn content in liver, spleen, heart, small intestine; increased Cu content in liver and small intestine; increased Zn and Mn content in brain. Although gilts depleted in Zn exhibited a highly efficient handling of Zn via homeostatic mechanisms, the reduced amount of corporal exchangeable Zn in these gilts caused biochemical changes affecting the performance of the dam and the offspring.

The electrical resistivity was measured in the temperature interval 0.1 to 300 K and in magnetic fields up to 4.3 T. The results show the presence of two effects: one of non-magnetic origin, caused by electron-electron interaction in a highly disordered system and the other of magnetic origin, probably the Kondo effect. The high field isotropic magnetoresistivity was also examined in detail and was found to be inconsistent with all currently available models. Results of a detailed investigation of the ferromagnetic anisotropy in the resistivity are included and discussed in the light of existing theories. The first direct observation in metallic glasses, of the classical phenomena known as excess resistivity due to the domain structure is also presented. The thermoelectric power of Fe-Cr-B and Fe-B for compositions in the range 13 to 22 at .% B has been measured from 4.2 to 550 K. The thermopower is extremely sensitive to B and Cr concentration and highly non-linear with temperature. A semi-quantitative explanation of the data is given, which emphasizes the importance of magnetic scattering. The a.c. magnetic susceptibility and d.c. magnetization as a function of field and temperature was measured in the Fe-Cr-B series of alloys. Samples with x (LESSTHEQ) 28 show ferromagnetic ordering which follows scaling law predictions yielding well defined values of the critical indices. Mossbauer spectra of these alloys as well as of the Fe-B glasses have been analysed to yield hyperfine field distribution, isomer shift, quadrupole splitting and correlations between these parameters. It is shown that in Fe-Cr-B glasses magnetic and non-magnetic iron sites coexist in the ferromagnetic phase and that Fe sites having more than 4 Cr near neighbours are essentially non-magnetic.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q973z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k801f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metallic glasses.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k958"><dcterms:title>Surface properties and selective flotation of inherently hydrophobic minerals</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kelebek, Sadan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Surface properties of a number of minerals including talc, graphite and sulphides such as chalcopyrite and galena were investigated.

A diagnostic study of an explosive winter storm shows that significant residuals attributable to cumulus convection are present in the horizontal momentum, thermodynamic and vorticity budgets, but not in the divergence budget, and that the finite-amplitude wave is well described by linear dynamics. A scale analysis appropriate for mid-latitude synoptic-scale waves with intense convection indicates the importance of three mechanisms by which cumulus clouds can influence these storms. These mechanisms are the thermodynamic and dynamical effects of clouds, and certain cloud-induced non-geostrophic effects. A series of experiments with linear models of moist baroclinic instability using an idealized basic state shows the significant role of the ageostrophic terms and the important damping due to the dynamical effects of clouds. With a realistic wintertime basic state, we conclude that the different cloud forcings are necessary to account for the observed features of explosive storms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kn91h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149q608</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cumulus.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cyclones.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Convection (Meteorology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s78c"><dcterms:title>Biochemical and immunochemical characterization of human placental type V collagens</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Niyibizi, Christopher.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The structure and molecular forms of human placental type V collagen preparations containing (alpha)1(V), (alpha)2(V) and (alpha)3(V) chains were investigated.

One fraction contained (alpha)1(V) and (alpha)2(V) chains in a 2:1 ratio and the other contained (alpha)1(V), (alpha)2(V) and (alpha)3(V) chains in a 1:1:1 ratio.

Trypsin cleaved collagens in both fractions at temperature near melting producing completely different fragmentation patterns, indicating that (alpha)1(V) and (alpha)2(V) chains in the two fractions were assembled in two different molecular forms. The collagens in the two fractions were also shown to differ in antigenic determinants in their native assemblies. (alpha)1(V) chains isolated from the two fractions were shown to differ in at least one antigenic determinant.

Although the infectious process is quite complex, it is clear that one critical event, the interaction of viral attachment proteins with cell surface receptors, plays a major role in determining the pattern of infection. The mammalian reoviruses have served as useful models for understanding the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis. The mammalian reovirus hemagglutinin ((sigma)1 protein), which is an outer capsid protein, has been shown to be a major factor in determining virus host-cell interactions. To further our understanding of the structure and function of the hemagglutinin, we have cloned a cDNA copy of the reovirus type 3 Sl double-stranded RNA gene that encodes the viral hemagglutinin and sequenced the DNA complementary to the Sl gene. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the viral hemagglutinin has allowed us to determine that the amino-terminal portion contains an (alpha)-helical coiled-coil structure and that the carboxy-terminal portion contains the receptor interacting domains. With this information we have designed a model that shows how the reovirus hemagglutinin is attached to the viral particle.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n196j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x211v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p1123"><dcterms:title>Immobiology of the decidual tissue</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kearns, Mary, 1957-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Murine decidual cells were examined for surface markers common to lymphomyeloid cells and for unique lineage specific markers by radioautography.

Given this background, it is convenient to distinguish soft econometrics from its hard counterpart, which stresses mathematical statistics. This distinction is derived from a parallel in Cox's discussion of the behaviour of statisticians, and of the nature of data. To clarify the substance of soft econometrics and to reveal its occurrence, three essays are provided. One essay considers the potential use of econometrics in long-wave research.

Many of these nitrogen fixers were discarded when the production of N(,2)O in the presence of C(,2)H(,2), as a test for denitrifying ability, was included as a selected characteristic. Further characterization of the Nir('+) strains showed that they were Azospirillum lipoferum. The cytochrome composition of Azospirillum brasilense (a denitrifier) grown under various conditions in a defined medium was investigated. Optical absorbance difference spectra of the particulate fraction of cells grown under aerated conditions indicated the presence of cytochromes of type b, c and a+a(,3). Under low aeration there was a quantitative increase in cytochromes b and c with a concomitant decrease in the a+a(,3)-type cytochrome. At high aeration, a CO spectrum indicated the possible participation of an o-type cytochrome. At both high and low oxygen concentrations, the supernatant fraction revealed only one c-type cytochrome. Its abundance was increased at low oxygen concentrations. Cytochrome spectra of anaerobically grown cells using different nitrogen oxides (NO(,3)('-), NO(,2)('-) and N(,2)O) as final electron acceptors revealed the presence of the different cytochromes involved in anaerobic respiration. The reduction of NO(,2)('-) was associated with the cytochrome cd (peak at 620 nm) found only in the supernatant fraction of NO(,2)('-)-grown cells. Growth on NO(,3)('-) was characterized by a diauxic type of curve in which the first logarithmic phase corresponded to the reduction of NO(,3)('-). The second logarithmic phase corresponded to the reduction of NO(,2)('-). Growth of Azospirillum brasilense with NO(,2)('-) and N(,2)O as final electron acceptor was possible only when a small amount of NO(,3)('-) was present initially. In contrast with other bacteria, growth of Azospirillum brasilense with tungstate instead of molybdate did not result in NO(,3)('-) reductase-deficient cells. The NO(,2)('-) accumulation observed with NO(,3)('-)-grown cells possibly resulted from the different NO(,3)('-)- and N(,2)('-)-reductase specific activities. However, the longer lag in the NO(,2)('-) reduction when higher concentrations of NO(,3)('-) were used may be due to a direct effect of NO(,3)('-) on the synthesis or activity of the NO(,2)('-) reductase.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306sz96x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x936b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nitrogen -- Fixation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Azospirillum brasilense.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrification.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb862"><dcterms:title>Synthesis and bulk physical properties of styrene-4-hydroxystyrene and styrene-4-hydroxymethylstyrene ionomers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Clas, Sophie-Dorothée.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polystyrene-co-4-hydroxystyrene ionomers (3.0-22 mol %) were synthesized via neutralization of demethylated polystyrene-co-4-methoxystyrene.

While evidence for ion aggregation was obtained for the styrene-4-hydroxystyrene ionomers from SAXS and torsion pendulum studies, no firm evidence was obtained for the styrene-4-hydroxymethylstyrene ionomers. Stress relaxation studies on both systems, however, showed failure of time-temperature superposition at high ion contents, indicating that these systems are both thermorheologically complex. The glass transition temperature of the matrix, the size of the ionic aggregates and the strengths of the ionic interactions within these large aggregates were related to the type and position of the ionic group.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st40r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zb862</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Styrene.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ionomers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d412"><dcterms:title>Étude sur les changements respiratoires aigus chez les travailleurs des salles de cuves de l'industrie primaire de l'aluminium (Complexe industriel de Jonquière)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Durand, Pierre.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Acute respiratory changes have previously been observed in aluminium potroom workers.

Pulmonary function tests were administered four times on the first working shift of the week to 385 of the 412 subjects who had also answered a respiratory symptoms questionnaire. An index of acute changes was devised. Among the 279 smokers, those exposed to the Prebake process and with high exposure to the Soderberg had a higher index on average than those with low exposure to the Soderberg process and unexposed workers.

Contractility was assessed by analysis of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during supramaximal phrenic stimulation at different frequencies and during spontaneous diaphragmatic contractions. Different conditions variously produced negative inotropic effects on the diaphragm. These effects in decreasing order of magnitude were produced by diaphragmatic fatigue, compensated metabolic acidosis and metabolic acidosis which was equivalent with respiratory acidosis. The fatigued diaphragm was improved by aminophylline, isoproterenol and neostigmine but not by salbutamol. Similarly, during compensated metabolic acidosis aminophylline restored diaphragmatic contractility while salbutamol did not. In respiratory acidosis aminophylline and neostigmine increased contractility but isoproterenol had no effect. Mechanisms underlying the alterations in diaphragmatic contractility produced by various interventions appeared to be related to changes in the amplitude and time course of the twitch.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx422.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn01x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236280j"><dcterms:title>Liquid crystallinity of a semiflexible polymer : acetoxypropyl cellulose</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laivins, Gunar V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A thermotropic cholesteric polymer, (acetoxypropyl)cellulose (APC) is synthesized by reacting (hydroxypropyl)cellulose and acetic anhydride. The molar etherification and esterification values, determined by chromic acid oxidation and saponification are 3.1 (+OR-) 0.3 and 1.9 (+OR-) 0.1, respectively. Fractions ranging in molar mass from 2.2 x 10('4) to 6.5 x 10('5) g mol('-1), and of the same chemical composition, are obtained by addition of n-heptane to a dilute alcoholic solution. The phase separation behaviour of APC in dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is adequately explained by the modified lattice theories for freely-jointed chains, even when orientational interactions are neglected. The volume fraction of APC needed for anisotropic phase separation is 0.52 (+OR-) 0.02 in DBP at 25(DEGREES)C, while the isotropic phase is stable below a polymer volume fraction of 0.69 (+OR-) 0.04. Between these concentrations, the ordered phase coexists with a more dilute isotropic phase. The concentration of both phases increases with that of the solution. The molar mass of APC in the mesophase exceeds that in the isotropic phase. The critical concentration determined by optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry increases markedly with temperature from 25(DEGREES) to 150(DEGREES)C. This increase is attributed to a decrease in the stiffness of the chain; the axial ratio of the Kuhn segment decreases from 10.8 (+OR-) 0.8 to 5.6 (+OR-) 0.4 over the same temperature range. The axial ratio of the Kuhn segment is calculated from the limiting viscosity numbers of the APC fractions in dimethyl phthalate. Variations in cholesteric pitch of APC with temperature and with diluent concentration are determined from the spectrophotometrically measured changes in the wavelength of light reflected by thin layers of the mesophase. The pitch increases with both DBP content and temperature for all the samples. As predicted by Kimura (1982), the temperature dependence of the pitch decreases with increasing DBP concentration. Quantitative agreement with Kimura's theory requires the use of physically reasonable dimensions for the optically active APC chain. Analysis of the refractometric data indicate that shearing of the cholesteric mesophase transforms it into a nematic-like arrangement. The birefringence of the undiluted nematic APC is 0.013 at 26(DEGREES)C, from which a nematic layer order parameter of 0.73 (+OR-) 0.3 is calculated. The order parameter appears to be concentration independent.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n197t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236280j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Polymers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acetoxypropyl cellulose.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquid crystals.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r648v"><dcterms:title>The systematics and phylogeny of Alabagrus (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Agathidinae) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sharkey, Michael Joseph.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alabagrus is a New World genus of braconid wasps.

The sequential organization of an alternating pair of monaural pure tones (A and B) was found to oppose the effect of a contralateral noise burst (synchronous with B) to delateralize B's perceived position and to distort its perceived purity. Similarly, the sequential organization of a monaural tone with the same-ear component of a dichotic tone was found to often oppose the perceptual integration of the components of the dichotic tone. These findings were interpreted as suggesting that sequential cues compete with certain binaural cues during lateralization and dichotic integration decisions. However, sequential cues were found not to influence the fusion of identical sinusoids presented at opposite ears. Thus, binaural fusion appeared to occur independently of sequential organization processes. These findings were discussed in terms of levels and mechanisms of processing, and of ecological demands.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r44g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9674476</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auditory perception.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nv337"><dcterms:title>Contemporary compatibilism : a critical examination</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Govitrikar, Vishwas P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a study of some recent issues and arguments in the debate over freedom and determinism.

In chapter I, the introduction, I discuss some basic notions and offer a brief survey of the discussion of freedom and determinism between 1930 and 1970. In chapter II, I examine an influential recent attack on the principle that an agent is responsible for his actions only if he could have done otherwise. In chapters III and IV, I discuss the emergence of explanation as a major issue in the free-will debate. In III, I criticize the claim that mechanistic explanations are compatible with intentional ones. I conclude by identifying some major outstanding problems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d42b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv337</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Free will and determinism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy, Modern -- 20th century.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dg49d"><dcterms:title>The determination of catecholamines in cerebrospinal fluid by high pressure liquid chromatography with dual-working-electrode electrochemical detection /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McClintock, Sam A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The design and construction of an electrochemical detector with two working electrodes located on the opposite walls of a thin-layer cell and its use as a detector for High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in the analysis of catecholamines in human cerebrospinal fluid are described.

If one electrode is held at a potential where oxidation takes place and the second electrode at a potential where reduction of this oxidized form back to the starting material occurs, then the current produced increases proportionately to the number of conversions that take place.

It was found that the effects of systemic D- and L-amphetamine on ICSS were different for medial and lateral SN sites. These differences were attributed to the presence of two subtypes of dopamine (DA) neurons in the SN. The circling results indicate that circling in opposite directions can be elicited from the medial and lateral parts of the nigrostriatal DA system from the same hemisphere suggesting that medial and lateral nigrostriatal DA have opposing roles in the expression of circling. It was further demonstrated that the superior colliculus is critical for the expression of medial SN derived circling and the midbrain reticular formation is critical for both medial and lateral SN derived circling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f91j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236281t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brain stem.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain stimulation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain -- Localization of functions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj76n"><dcterms:title>Nonlinear spinor fields : toward a field theory of the electron</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mathieu, Pierre.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nonlinear Dirac equations exhibiting soliton phenomena are studied.
