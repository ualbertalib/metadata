This, therefore, is the object of this thesis: To acquaint architects and architectural students, particularly those in the Montreal area, with the demands and phenomena of the large and small scale climate, known respectively as the macroclimate and microclimate; and to inform them how to apply this knowledge to the design and orientation of buildings and towns. It is not the object to discuss the use of different materials, and their weathering qualities, except in a general sense. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bland, J.
