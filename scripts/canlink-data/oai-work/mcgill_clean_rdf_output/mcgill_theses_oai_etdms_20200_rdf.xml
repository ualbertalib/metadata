Large blade-like supraneural spines are present above neural arches 1, 3, and 5, but not 2 or 4. The supraneural spines support a muscular complex involved in feeding, not only through raising the snout, but also in depressing the lower jaws by the forward swing of the quadrate. The similarity in skulls of osteolepiforms, and between osteolepiforms and Paleozoic tetrapods implies that a cranio-vertebral joint of similar function existed in the ancestor of tetrapods, forming the precursor of the tetrapod atlas-axis complex. The distinct nature of the basioccipital and exocippitals of tetrapods is the result of reduced ossification of the occiput, and no the incorporation of vertebral elements onto the back of the braincase relative to the rhipidistian condition. The similarity between the occiput and succeeding vertebrae of some primitive tetrapods is due to analogous ossification of notochordal tissue. Bony occipital condyles arose separately in many lineages of Paleozoic tetrapods. The atlas-axis complex of tetrapods is constrained by the pattern of occipital articulation. It is an excellent character for diagnosis of particular groups, but a poor character for determining relationships between separate lineages.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx79q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p831x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Zoology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655h76p"><dcterms:title>The kinetics of copper etching in ferric chloride-hydrochloric acid solutions /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bryce, Christine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The kinetics of copper etching were studied using a ferric chloride-hydrochloric acid etchant in a stirred-tank reactor.

The use of a ferric nitrate-nitric acid solution yielded similar results but substantially reduced etch rates. Since the nitrate ion is essentially non-complexing with the ferric ion, the presence of chloro complexes of the ferric ion in FeCl$ sb3$-HCl etchant solutions was investigated. The FeCl$ sb2 sp+$ and FeCl$ sb3 sp0$ complex ions were found to constitute the majority of ferric species at all concentrations, and their respective enhancing and inhibiting effects incorporated into a rate equation:  = A {m sb{FeCl sbsp{2}{-}} over 1 + 0.25m sb{FeCl sbsp{3}{0}}} here m$ sb{ rm i}$ is the molality of species i. The rate constant, A, was found to fit an Arrhenius plot for a temperature range of 30-50$ sp circ$C. Experiments performed with etchants containing both the chloride and nitrate ions showed etch rates increasing uniformly as the chloride fraction of total anion increased. The FeCl$ sb2 sp+$ complex continues to exhibit an enhancing effect in these solutions, but at the conditions chosen the concentration of FeCl$ sb3 sp0$ remains constant. The FeCl$ sp{2+}$, however, appears to inhibit the etch rate.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m14r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h76p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf2686281"><dcterms:title>Le livre de la deablerie d'Eloy d'Amerval (1508) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dupras, Elyse</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work is an edifying text in which the interlocutors are experts in evil deeds--they are none other than Sathan and Lucifer.

This research examines the performance of conventional ARQ schemes over fading channels. The basic Gilbert-Elliott two-state Markov model is used to represent these channels. This basic model is recursively extended to a 2$ sp{n}$-state Markov chain suitable for n-bit block codes. Using this 'Extended Gilbert-Elliot' model, an approximation of the throughput efficiency of the conventional ARQ schemes is derived. This approximation is particularly valid for slow fading channels. Furthermore, performance plots are obtained, showing the effects of channel fading on throughput efficiency: ARQ performance deteriorates with slower fading, or alternatively, higher channel memory. Consequently, frequency-hopped codeword transmission is explored, a technique by which channel memory can be reduced. Throughput performance of frequency-hopped ARQ systems is derived, which shows significant potential improvements over systems with no frequency hopping.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv593.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fs50g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vm112"><dcterms:title>The effect of visual perturbation in planning landing from a jump in adult humans /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thompson, Hershell William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prelanding EMG responses in uniarticular and biarticular flexors and extensors of the leg were assessed during landing from jump-downs at a constant height (0.45 m) or randomly varying heights (0.35, 0.45 and 0.55 meters) in normal humans under four visual conditions: normal, occluded, stabilized by a visual conflict dome, and disrupted by stroboscopic flash at 8 Hz. Pressure sensitive foot-switches and video recordings of each jump-down from a sagittal view allowed the expression of EMG in temporal relation to limb trajectories and foot-ground contact. Results from EMG analysis demonstrated a stable, global pattern of activation regardless of visual condition and independent of knowledge of the jump height. A generalized strategy of EMG activation was adequate for successful landing on stable height trials, but subjects developed a different default strategy for jumping at random height when inadequate visual update was provided. The prelanding EMG responses from the muscles recorded suggest that there are different roles for the muscles in preparing the body for ground impact.

A constraint technique is used in gedit as a means for making precise graphics and constructing new graphics by applying constraints to existing graphics. The abstract graphics description is represented as five kinds of primitive drawings: point, circle, polyline, polygon, and text. A constraint is visualized on the screen as an icon which shows the relationship among the graphics objects constrained. A set of basic commands for graphics and constraints are presented. A constraint satisfaction mechanism for building up simultaneous equations for constraints and solving the system of equations to get the expected result is also provided.

The effect of operating variables on the gas holdup in two- and three-phase mixtures was measured. To measure gas holdup, the isolating technique, conductivity and pressure techniques were employed. Gas fractions between 10 and 65% were achieved. These high holdups are a consequence of bubbles being forced downwards against their buoyancy. The high gas fraction may account for the fast flotation claimed for this cell. The conductivity technique using Maxwell's equation gave a maximum error of 6%, in both two- and three-phase systems (considering the water-solids mixture as one phase). The drift flux model was applied to try to correlate the data. Both two- and three-phase systems showed consistent trends. The model was used to estimate bubble size. In the Richardson and Zaki equation the m factor was in the range 2.9 to 3.1. A dimensionless drift flux was defined assuming $m=3$ which fitted the data. For three-phase systems, however, the results predicted a trend in bubble size that seemed opposite to observation.

Both the sensor and the preprocessing stages of the signal are described. A mathematical model of the high pass filtering transfer function is developed in the time domain to predict its role in modifying the raw signal's transient waveforms.

The heart rate at rest was similar in all groups, however it was significantly lower in VSDop than all other groups.

A numerical finite difference technique is used to formulate this model. The control system contains two loops, a feedfoward loop using the steam flow and drum pressure signals as the input and a feedback loop using the deviation of the measured drum water level from its set point as an input. The feedback loop is an incremental PID controller with an adjustable proportional gain. The feedfoward loop is designed to directly actuate the control devices before the "swell" and "shrinkage" in the boiler water level occur. The feedforward controller output signal is summed along with the output of the PID controller to establish the set point for the control actuator. This scheme is effective because steam flow changes are immediately fed forward to change the final feedwater set point for the control actuator. In this way, feedwater flow tracks steam flow and any disturbances in the feedwater system will be arrested quickly. It is shown that an incremental PID controller plus adapt feedfoward compensator can be successfully employed for the control of water level in such a plant.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999780r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418p344</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kr63p"><dcterms:title>British foreign policy toward southeastern Europe and the restoration of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ioannidis, Eudoxia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the thesis is to analyze Britain's Mediterranean strategy and his relationship to the acquisition of the Dodecanese islands to Greece.

Nouveau-Quebec and Igloolik Island, N.W.T. The highly resistant siliceous bedrock of the Labrador Trough in the Schefferville area produced very dilute surface waters with more or less equivalent concentrations of major cations. Dolomitic limestone and dolostone on Igloolik Island resulted in highly mineralized surface waters dominated by Ca$ sp{2+}$, Mg$ sp{2+}$ and HCO$ sb3 sp-$, with contributions by Na$ sp+$ and Cl$ sp-$ increasing with coastal proximity. Sediments from the Schefferville area possessed low concentrations of Ca and Mg indicative of noncarbonate bearing substrate, contrasting to the calcareous nature of the sediments from Igloolik Island. Sediment concentrations of Al, Fe and Mn from the Schefferville area were elevated compared to sediment concentrations on Igloolik Island. The disparity in trace metal concentrations in sediments between the two study areas is attributed to the enrichment of these elements in the Labrador Trough, as well as the general trace metal dilution encountered in limestone and dolostone. Principal Component Analysis with Varimax Rotation for surface waters of Igloolik Island revealed four factors accounting for 98% of the total variance confirming controls exerted by sea-salt spray and lithological substrate in moderating surface water chemistry. Differential rates of weathering at certain sites on Igloolik Island are suggested by dissimilar factor loading scores.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c871.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s697</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water-rock interaction -- Québec (Province) -- Territoire-du-Nouveau-Québec</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water-rock interaction -- Northwest Territories -- Igloolik Island</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kh49h"><dcterms:title>A 3-dimensional numerical flow analysis of a superfund site in Ohio /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stein, David Martin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The closed Chem-Dyne Site is located in southwestern Butler County, Ohio. It operated from 1974 to 1980 as a waste recycling operation. Over the six year period of operation, the corporation built a clientele comprised of over 200 chemical and manufacturing companies throughout the United States. Due to inappropriate controls, numerous hazardous waste spills occurred during the period of operation. These spills resulted in severe contamination to the surface soils and underlying aquifer. Beginning in 1980, engineering consultants were contracted by federal and state environmental agencies to study the site and submit recommendations for remediating the environmental contamination. Since the start-up of the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study in 1980, approximately 5 professional consulting firms have been contracted to study the Chem-Dyne site. The site is currently in a cleanup phase. The objective of the present thesis study is to determine the effectiveness of the site remediation program since the commencement operations in January 1987. To accomplish this task, an analytical and 3-dimensional numerical flow analysis was performed.

The island of St. Kitts was represented by two geographic demes, one from the Northern tip of the island and one from the Southern tip of the island. The island of Nevis was considered as one separate deme. Eight plasma proteins were analyzed with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A preliminary DNA investigation was also completed. Three of the plasma proteins--transferrin, albumin, and an unidentified protein that migrated faster than albumin--appeared to be monomorphic. Three proteins in the alpha globulin region (between transferrin and albumin) and pseudocholinesterase were polymorphic in the total population. The DNA locus identified by the Human Molecular Fingerprinting #1 probe (locus D1Z2) was also polymorphic in all demes. The levels of heterozygosity for North Island, South Island, and Nevis were 2.02%, 2.49%, and 2.49% respectively. North and South Island demes were more similar to each other than either was to the Nevis deme. The South Island deme was more unlike Nevis than the North Island deme. These figures do not provide sufficient genetic evidence to evaluate divergence within the West Indian vervets according to geography.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q5127.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602195w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cercopithecus aethiops -- Saint Kitts-Nevis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cercopithecus aethiops -- Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mammals -- Saint Kitts-Nevis -- Variation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xg162"><dcterms:title>Generalized scale invariance, differential rotation and cloud texture</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pflug, Karen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The standard 2D/3D picture of atmospheric dynamics of two distinct isotropic regimes separated by a "meso-scale gap" has been seriously questioned in recent years. Using satellite cloud images and the formalism of generalized scale invariance (GSI), we test the contrary hypothesis that cloud radiance fields are scaling in the range 1-1000 km. Using a two-dimensional representation of GSI and three new analysis techniques, we test the following relation for each picture: $ langle vert F( lambda sp{ tilde G} vec k) vert sp2 rangle = lambda sp{-s} langle vert F( vec k) vert sp2 rangle$, where $F( vec k)$ is the Fourier amplitude at wavenumber $ vec k$, $ lambda$ is the scale ratio and $ tilde G$ is the generator of the semi-group of scale changes in Fourier space. Since we test only the linear approximation to GSI, $ tilde G$ is approximated here as a matrix. For the three texturally--and meteorologically--very different images analyzed, we find three different generators that generally well reproduce the Fourier space anisotropy. These results show that linear GSI is a workable approximation for studying the atmosphere and that GSI can be used for cloud classification and modeling over this important mesoscale range.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vr996.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xg162</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v838167x"><dcterms:title>A pictorial motivational scale in physical activity for people with a mild intellectual disability /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Poulin, Carole</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Poulin Pictorial Motivational Scale (PPMS) attempted to measure separately four different types of motivation; intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation/self-determined, extrinsic motivation/non self-determined, and amotivation. Sixty-two high school students were tested with the PPMS. These individuals with a mild intellectual disability were grouped according to age level (12-13, 14-15, 16-18) and academic ability (low, average, high). They answered two questionnaires; the PPMS and Harter's scale (to test students' self-competency). Other scales, made for teachers, were used to assess the validity of the PPMS, a Physical Educator's rating scale and a Teachers' questionnaire. The reliability estimates of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and temporal stability were sufficiently high to conclude that the PPMS was a reliable instrument. The results also revealed that the PPMS is valid and it correlates in the expected directions with the other scales which followed the self-determination theory of Deci and Ryan (1985a). Therefore, it was concluded that the PPMS is a valid and reliable instrument.
