Over forty years of investigation have provided extensive data on the chemistry, analysis, deficiency symptoms and nutritional requirements of vitamin A. However, there is still a scarcity of information concerning its mode of action in the body, particularly regarding carotenoid conversion to vitamin A and its absorption, transport, storage and association with disease. As recently as twenty years ago, fish liver oils and alfalfa meals were the major sources for vitamin A supplementation. These natural concentrated sources varied in potency and activity from one batch to another. Some contained impurities which interfered with assays and contributed to the instability of vitamin A activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nikolaiczuk, N.

In particular it presents the results of interviews with 75 male pensioners living in private homes, who are retired from the same large company in the communications industry. It uses an interview schedule that was adapted from the one developed for cross-national research in 1959 by Peter Townsend and Brian Rees and it seeks to appraise this schedule in terms of its suitability for research on the aged across Canada. Most of the men studied seemed to be in good health, adequately housed and financially comfortable and they were experiencing frequent contacts with children and relatives. Notwithstanding the contribution that these factors made to the pensioners' satisfactory retirement situation, this study suggests that well-being in retirement is associated with steady preretirement employment, in which the retiree has had ample opportunity to save and to participate in a pension plan geared to both length of employment and to wages. The study pointed out several limitations in the schedule, but found that it was an effective instrument to probe the patterns of living, social relationships and material circumstances of older people.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.

Turbidity changes did not take place when the buffer concentration was increased. These decreases in turbidity or the cell envelope suspensions he interpreted to being due to degradation or the cell envelopes. A number or soluble products were released when the cell envelopes were incubated. The nature or these suggested to Brown that their release was due to the action or an enzyme. Since the release or these compounds was prevented by high buffer concentration, Brown suggested that lysis of the whole cells was due to the action of an enzyme residing in the cell envelope. Prevention of lysis of the whole cells by high salt concentration would then be due to the inhibition by salts of the action of a lytic enzyme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLeod, R.

True firs, Abies spp., are the only hosts of the aphid which causes severe damage to balsam fir, A. balsamea (L.) Mill., the predominant fir species in the Atlantic Provinces. Severe damage is caused by high numbers of aphids feeding in the crowns and on the stems of trees. In Newfoundland, rapid deterioration of tree crowns predominates; stem attack occurs infrequently and in widely dispersed spots (Carroll and Bryant, 1960). The infested area in the Province bas increased from 300 square miles in 1949 to over 3500 square miles in 1962.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morrison, F.

The effectiveness of gas exchange is largely dependent on the efficiency of these distribution systems. If parts of the lung are ventilated but not perfused, or perfused but not ventilated, no gas exchange will occur in these areas. Furthermore, ventilation in excess of perfusion, or perfusion in excess of ventilation are relatively inefficient. The optimum distribution is clearly when the quantities of ventilation and perfusion are matched, that is, the Ventilation/Perfusion ratio is equal in all lung units. To predict gas exchange it is therefore necessary to know not only the total quantities of alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary blood flow, but also their distribution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bates, D.

This model is particularly convenient since it allows an exact analytic solution, which can be written in the form of correction terms to the spherical optical model. The application of this model to the s wave strength function results in a splitting of the single peak at A= 55. The inclusion of the effect of octupole excitation introduces desirable but minor modifications. Determination of the total neutron cross sections with this model substantiates the view that the flattening of giant resonances away from closed shell regions can be attributed to the effect of quadrupole excitation. There is also some evidence from this model that the effect of collective excitations could account for the characteristic shift of the maxima associated with these resonances. The scattering and reaction cross sections as well as the differential shape elastic scattering are also calculated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Margolis, B.

Surfaces below 750' were not investigated. All are considered to be of subaerial origin. By inductive reasoning, based on a recent hypothesis of the evolution of the continental margin of eastern North America, it is tentatively concluded that the group of surfaces above 2000' developed during a Cretaceous - early Cenozoic erosion cycle, and that lower surfaces are of later Cenozoic age. Uplift occurred at the beginning of the Cretaceous, in the mid Cenozoic and in the late Cenozoic. Small vertical intervals between the surfaces are tentatively attributed to periodic positive isostatic responses of the earth's crust to the relief of load by denudation since at least the beginning of the Cretaceous.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Summers, W.

Because of the bearing of immune function on tissue transplantation and because of the possible role of the thymus in immune function, this gland may be of importance in a better understanding of organ and tissue rejection. Similarly, modification or removal of the thymus, with or without other treatment, may be of value in modifying the homograft rejection phenomenon.

A sign of man in an otherwise empty landscape can change an l-It attitude to an I-Thou attitude, even though the sign may be no more than a vehicle track on the dry surface of a barren desert. Natural and man-made landscapes are of primary interest to the geographer, but while study of the first is likely to be largely objective, aimed at a deeper understanding of nature, study of the second is more subjective and aimed at a deeper understanding of man.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hills, T.

This research has important theoretical implications for the behavioral sciences, but there have been few systematic laboratory studies of the effects of specific visual stimuli on amphibian behavior.

In the first chapter, we first introduce the notion of an M-set, which is essentially a representation of a monoid, and these M-sets play the same role as R-modules for rings. Then, through the rest of the chapter, we introduce all the tools needed to show that the injective hull of an M-set always exists, and we end the chapter by an example: more specifically, we show that the injective hull of the rationals, considered as a partly ordered set, is the set of reals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambek, J.

Canada, particularly in the north, has large areas covered by deposits in the form of peat bogs or muskegs. The examination of bedrock under peat bogs or muskegs by chemical analyses has not been practised in Canada, but it has been tried with some success in Finland.

According to Gordon (1958), men have been attempting to control or predict the sex of their offspring for thousands of years. This subject was discussed in a Chinese Manuscript about 4,400 years ago. An Egyptian papyrus of 2,200 B.C. noted that a pregnant woman with the use of greenish cast was certain to bear a son. Aristotle believed that the placing of the marriage bed in a north-south direction favored the conception of boys. These are examples of the many beliefs that have been reported regarding sex determination, which have since been demonstrated to be false. The scientific history of the subject of sex determination began with the discovery of the genetic mechanism by which sex is determined in mammals. According to genetic theory, the male mammal has a special pair of sex chromosomes made up of one X chromosome and one so-called Y chromosome.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moxley, J.

Since then, the gravity method has been extensively used for outlining various geological structures. A series of typical applications of this method is discussed by Heiland (1940, p. 157) Because of the relatively high density contrast between rock and ice, gravimetric measurements have been used recently for determining subglacial elevation contours. This application of gravity measurements possibly originated with the Expeditions Polaires Francaises. (Martin 1948) Within the last few years, such measurements were used quite successfully on the Gilman (Weber 1960), Salmon (Russell 1960), and Athabaska (Kanasewich 1963) glaciers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pounder, E.

This enquiry is based upon sociological evidence that the combination of professional and bureaucratic modes of occupational life contains mutually dysfunctional aspects. The published work by Blau and Scott, Formal Organizations, is the point of departure for the study. The data are the perceptions of social workers as obtained by a slightly modified 85 item questionnaire developed by W.R. Scott in his work on a Doctoral dissertation in Sociology at the University of Chicago. The questionnaire was distributed to 12 social work settings in Montreal. Coded data from the 128 respondents were used in IBM processing. Findings suggest that training and experience are associated with some opposition to supervision, but divergent findings and interpretations are reported on the theoretically non-professional aspect of supervision in social work as a nascent profession. Perceptions of the extent to which seven principles and standards are fulfilled in practice seem affected by respondents’ religious beliefs and by the extent to which a given principle corresponds to cultural values. Social work at present meets, in varying degrees, some of the criteria of a profession. For professional workers, informal norms of the social work community suggest occupational reinforcements via advancement to supervisory posts and by identification with medicine, especially psychiatry. The high proportion of women in social work practice and other topics are suggested for future investigation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kirk, H.

In particular, differences have been reported in both urine constituents and blood constituents; and in blood constituents, not only in the plasma fraction, but also in the formed elements (or cells) fraction. While the nature of the association between such biochemical anomalies and the behavioral anomalies of schizophrenic patients remains to be investigated, evidence is accumulating that a factor, or factors in the blood substances of schizophrenic patients can disrupt the behavior of animals, ranging in neural complexity from planaria to Cebus monkeys.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stern, M.

In reality, the problem is more involved than this definition might suggest for the reason that the two operating factors, namely, stress and corrosion do not act in a simple additive way. Stress corrosion cracking is not a mere case of metal corrosion in the presence of stress. Although it is true that corrosive attack is part of the mechanism, the extent or severity of corrosion is not a guiding criterion for susceptibility to cracking. Many mildly corrosive environments have been recognised as strongly potent in causing this type of failure. A classical example was noted (1,2) in an experimental alloy which was stressed and immersed in a mineral oil-Nujol-and which failed in 735 days.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yates, H.

La politique en est en partie responsable, mais l'évolution des valeurs intellectuelles y est aussi pour beaucoup. Morand s'était identifié à une époque, celle de la génération de 1930. Elle lui avait reconnu un grand talent et l'avait placé presque au même niveau littéraire que Marcel Proust et André Gide. Nos aînés semblent avoir commis une monumentale erreur d'appréciation. Ils ont pris du strass pour du diamant, et se sont laissés éblouir par le "modernisme" de Morand. Cosmopolitisme, ésotérisme, snobisme, joints à une authentique élégance d'attitude, à une passion de la vitesse, à un élan vers le "dernier cri", à une coïncidence parfaite avec son époque, avaient fait de Morand le plus représentatif des écrivains grand' bourgeois de l'entre-deux guerres.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Launay, J.

The remaining two methods are found to have serious inherent disadvantages and are discarded oh those accounts. A method, developed for the measurement of the corona discharge rate, is extensively used to analyze the sequence of discharge behaviour within spark gaps of various spacings and under different vapour pressures. The discharge rate measurements, in conjunction with toe observations on the voltage waveforms across discharging gaps, show numerous deviations from the idealized hypotheses of Gemant and Whitehead -- the most conspicuous difference being the quasilinear increase of discharge rate with voltage instead of the abrupt jumps predicted by the idealized theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>D’Ombrain, G.

The activity in housing does not meet the demands of increasing populations, with the result that today every country is facing a serious housing problem particularly in urban areas. It is an actual fact that the need for housing, particularly of people of low income in urban areas such as Bangkok, has reached a high level. The significance of this can be seen from the steady growth of housing projects, but most of them are not perfectly suited to satisfy the needs of the people sufficiently. In the country of Thailand as a whole this causes many problems, and especially in Bangkok where the problem has been more serious than in the other provinces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hazeland, A.
