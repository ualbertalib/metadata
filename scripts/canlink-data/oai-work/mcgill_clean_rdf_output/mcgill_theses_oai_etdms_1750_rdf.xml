The technical innovations are asking for an international institutional implementation, which has not yet started. After a brief look at the technical aspects of the new systems (Chapter II), existing institutional arrangements of international satellite systems, air-navigation infrastructure and air traffic control are outlined (Chapter III). A legal analysis presents the obstacles and alternatives future institutional arrangements will be confronted with, and leads to a definition of the institutional problem (Chapter IV). The core of the thesis is a proposal for regional intergovernmental organizations, which coordinate the operation of aeronautical satellite communications and air traffic control as an intermediary between the States and service providers (Chapter V). Among other problems financing, user charges, and liability are discussed. Legal problems of navigation systems are discussed on the base of the emerging global systems (Chapter VI).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd25r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xn81v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mass Communications.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remote Sensing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abc386m564"><dcterms:title>Michelangelo : architecture and the vision of anatomy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Klassen, Helmut W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Michelangelo considered a mastery of the body and anatomy to be the essential "theory" articulating the practice of architecture. For him, the reality of the moving human figure embodied the supreme difficulty of life as animation. By his architectural appropriation of the figure, human artifice was understood to be circumscribed by the radical intelligibility of the processes of life. This study is an articulation of his vital understanding of the living body and artifice by the "vision" of anatomy. The outline of an artifice faithful to the radical life of things is first examined in the thought and practice of medicine in the Renaissance. Upon this understanding, the coherence of Michelangelo's unprecedented emphasis upon the living body for architecture may be articulated. It concludes with an elaboration of his "theory"; the vision of anatomy as a dynamic drawing of things as they appear.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp44x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m564</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375z52d"><dcterms:title>A syntactic analysis of noun incorporation in Cree</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mellow, John Dean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis outlines a syntactic analysis of Noun Incorporation in Cree. In this construction, certain morphemes, 'medials', that appear as the nominal root of an external NP can alternatively appear within a verb. This thesis extends previous analyses of Algonquian medials by utilizing the theory of Incorporation developed in Baker (1988b). Within this theory of grammar, medials are base-generated as nouns within an 'object' NP and then optionally adjoined to the verb stem as a result of head (X$ sp{ rm o}$) movement. Established restrictions on head movement can account for many properties of NI, including paraphrasing, doubling, bare modifiers, possible thematic relations, and differences between NI and compounds. The efficacy of the syntactic approach validates a modular account of polysynthetic word formation. In addition, the distribution of Cree NI validates several putatively universal principles of theta-role assignment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng83t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z52d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cree language -- Syntax</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cree language -- Noun</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d634h"><dcterms:title>Kinematics and optimization of a parallel robotic wrist mechanism with redundancey</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kurtz, Ronald L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a new robot wrist design that is fully parallel and actuator redundant. Actuator redundancy refers to the addition of more actuators than are strictly necessary to control the mechanisms without increasing the mobility. The uses of this form of redundancy include the ability to partially control the internal forces, increase the workspace, remove singularities and augment the dexterity. As the proposed wrist design is fully parallel, it exhibits high structural rigidity accompanied by a large load carrying capacity as well as superior dynamic response. In the first part of this thesis, the wrist architecture is developed and then analyzed with respect to its kinematics and the resulting singular surfaces. The workspace is then investigated taking into account these factors as well as limits imposed by the collision of movable links and fixed trusses of the assembly. Next, the kinematics of tendon actuated mechanisms are investigated. Tendons display an intrinsically non-linear behaviour. They are shown to have additional constraints that result in singularities of a type not found in linear systems. These act to reduce the workspace and influence the mapping of external to internal forces.

There was evidence of less atrophy and degeneration in DS seen in both light and electron microscopy. Dependent t test analysis using the normal contralateral muscle groups as the control showed that twitch contraction time was maintained within normal limits by stimulation whereas in the unstimulated group prolongation of twitch time occurred (p $&lt;$ 0.004). The electrical resistance property of the stimulated muscle was also preserved when compared to the normal control (p = 0.7) but did differ between D and N (p $&lt;$ 0.04).

This foundation, based on Aristotle's phronesis or practical wisdom, contains elements of the lived human experience which are seen as essential aspects of ethical, as well as medical, deliberation. The Aristotelian intellectual virtues of theoria and phronesis, used as "ideal types" of rationality, provide epistemological prejudices that structure two distinct ways of thinking. With this distinction, an alternative to certain dominant trends within biomedical ethics arises as phronesis provides more human centered prejudices for understanding. In conclusion, we shall see, using the doctrine of informed consent, that a phronetic rationality allows different, more humane meanings to come into being. Phronesis, it will be argued, provides a mode of rationality which promotes compassion and engagement in both ethics and medicine and consequently, is the more appropriate way of thinking in these important human practices.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fk17b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md94k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aristotle -- Contributions in theory of knowledge</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical ethics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Decision making -- Moral and ethical aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zd261"><dcterms:title>The images of Fāṭimah in Muslim biographical literature</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ali, Rukhsana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the Islamic tradition, as in other religious traditions, female saints are relatively few and not much scholarly attention has been given to them. Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, is one such example. It is, however, a point of interest in her case is that in the twentieth century she has captured the attention of writers of Muslim religious literature to such an extent that there now exist at least eleven fairly recent biographies of her in Urdu, English, Arabic and Persian. This is remarkable, given that the earliest sources of Islamic history contain only a minimal amount of information on her. These modern biographies present Fatimah in a manner which interweaves historical information with hagiographic accounts, thus reinforcing her status as a saint. This thesis attempts to identify, from the earliest available sources, the details concerning Fatimah as a historical person but ultimately shows that there is little real evidence for her life and even what facts do exist are the subject of controversy. Following this it examines the growth of the hagiographical tradition which created out of her a true Muslim saint and discusses its significance particularly for the Shi'ah. Finally, the conclusion presents some of the possible reasons for Fatimah's exalted status and for the resurgence of interest in her in the context of the modern Islamic world.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb93n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zd261</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shiite literature -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fāṭimah, d. 632 or 3 -- In literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sf73p"><dcterms:title>Prospects for a "worldly" theology in the writings of Menno Simons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Reesor, Rachel H.

I have traced the evolution of Klee's thought through an examination of his diaries, letters and other documents of the period. It is clear that a demonstrable change occurs in Klee's concept of art as a result of his exposure to Worringer and the Blaue Reiter.

Several contain portraits of their commissioners, represented together with a holy figure. An analysis of these scenes, examining features such as the holy figures represented and their specific iconographic meaning, and the relation of mortal to divine, reveals many facets of Byzantine art, religion and society. This analysis indicates a major distinction between portraits representing the emperor, and those depicting all other patrons. Non-imperial portraits show deep personal devotion and piety. The manuscripts in which they occur were commissioned to honour the holy figure, and many request salvation in return. Imperial commissions, on the other hand, were not votive gifts. Their portraits stress the public, political, and occasionally religious role of the emperor as the elected of God upon earth, and head of state. These portraits are thus highly informative of several aspects of Byzantine life.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vw12w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s226d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Christian art and symbolism -- Byzantine Empire</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emperors -- Byzantine Empire.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Illumination of books and manuscripts, Byzantine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Benefactors -- Byzantine Empire</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544br56g"><dcterms:title>Novikov, freemasonry and the Russian enlightenment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Webster, William Mark</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q841s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br56g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Novikov, Nikolaĭ Ivanovich, 1744-1818.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russia -- Intellectual life -- 18th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freemasonry -- Russia -- History -- 18th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472z49b"><dcterms:title>Political ideology and the black American community</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Iton, Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fr01n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z49b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>African Americans -- Suffrage</dc:subject><dc:subject>United States -- Race relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>African Americans -- Politics and government</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397b36p"><dcterms:title>Separate integral responding in children demonstrating attention deficit disorder</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Amin, Kiran</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Integral (holistic) and separable (analytic) processing were studied in ADD-H and normal children using restricted classification tasks composed of separable dimensions and triad/tetrad combinations.

Analysis of the S-3 ore indicated that copper exists as chalcopyrite and that gold as free gold or in association with sulphides. The S-3 ore typically contains 0.3% copper and from 3.0 to 5.5 g/t gold. The study involved both laboratory and plant testing. Four routes were investigated to treat the S-3 ore: flotation with the present circuit and reagents, flotation with the present circuit and new reagents, flotation at natural pH in a slightly modified circuit, and direct cyanidation. Alkaline pH flotation in the existing mill circuit with Aero 3477 and Xanthate 343 as collectors (the second route) gave the most promising copper and gold recoveries. A Laboratory locked cycle test indicated that a copper concentrate grading 18.4% Cu with 89.4% gold and 94.9% copper recovery can be obtained. Plant flotation test yielded a copper concentrate grading 16.9% Cu with 82.0% gold and 95.7% copper recoveries. The plant results were obtained using gravity circuit tail as the flotation feed. If recovery of coarse free gold in the gravity circuit is taken into account, the overall gold recovery is 87%.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v766r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg57z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fr02x"><dcterms:title>Immersed surface heat transfer in a vibrated fluidized bed</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Malhotra, Karun.</ual:dissertant><ual:supervisor>Arun S.
