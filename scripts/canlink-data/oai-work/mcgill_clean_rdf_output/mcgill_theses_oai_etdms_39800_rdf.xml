Its usefulness and efficacy derives primarily from the fact that it is independent from the underlying relationship between buyer and seller. In a considerable number of cases, however, the independence of the letter of credit has been challenged as a result of fraud in the underlying transaction. After analyzing recent reforms of the regulatory framework governing letters of credit, this fraud exception to the independence principle will be reappraised in the light of current developments in Canada and the United States. Finally, the author argues that arbitration can and indeed should play an increasingly important role in the resolution of international letter of credit disputes involving fraud in the transaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, W.

Furthermore, to our knowledge, no attention has been given to how the addition of touch and force-feedback information could contribute to the task of tracing the geometrical structure of objects in images. This thesis describes the development and implementation of a Multi-Modal Image Display System (MMID system) for tracing 2D boundaries in graphic images, using a two-dimensional force-reflecting haptic interface. A haptic image model is defined to convert "what is seen" to "what is felt". Movement as an indispensable factor is an intrinsic part of the haptic image displaying process. A new performance-based rendering method for displaying image boundaries is developed to facilitate the boundary exploration, which is based on the purpose of providing users a movement guidance through an "active" haptic sensation rather than using an "impedance" technique which by definition impedes movement. An experiment is designed to evaluate tracing performance. The haptic force feedback produced by the technique introduced here, contributes to better globale performance (accuracy-speed tradeoff) and less workload for human subjects with very small levels of force intensity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs79x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw35q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903183n"><dcterms:title>Numerical modelling of underground openings in bedded rock</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vicenzi, Ivan Flaviano.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Finite element analysis of tunnel excavations has been widely used by geotechnical engineers for assessing the deformations and stress conditions. Discontinuities in the rock mass play a major role when simulating the behaviour of the rock mass around an opening. A crucial point in such analyses is the choice of the constitutive model. Although numerical modelling of jointed rock mass has been suggested by several authors in the last three decades and different modelling codes have been developed, the simulation of discontinuities is still a complex task. After reviewing the various constitutive models, the author of this thesis presents the simulation of bedded rock mass based on the concept of an equivalent media proposed by Amadei and Goodman. The model has been implemented in a two-dimensional finite element code. In addition to the properties of the bedding planes, the spacing between them is considered. The performance of the model is shown by a parametric study focusing on the influence brought by the scale effect. For the latter control, a comparison with the results from the design of the Piora exploratory tunnel in the Swiss Alps has been carried out.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nitri, Hani S.

This thesis discusses the development and implementation of a complete unsupervised object-based attention system for locating salient objects in an image. The major components of this system are the segmentation and the attention process. Considerable research has been done in these two areas, but unfortunately, there is still not a single method that can be applied reliably under all situations. We have analysed the attention model proposed by Osberger and have found that their method fails to identify some important regions that are salient to humans. Modifications to this model are proposed to correct some of these problems. For the segmentation process, one important aspect is the measurement of the quality of a particular segmentation, since the attention process depends solely on the segmentation output. In particular, three different cluster validity measures are considered: a simple threshold-based index, a non-parameter index, and the modified Hubert index. From the experimental results, the simple threshold-based index is shown to outperform the other indices on most test images. We believe that the success of the threshold-based index is largely related to the incorporation of human preference in the selection of the threshold parameter.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm35g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3013269</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qd90z"><dcterms:title>Magnetic resonance data acquisition and image reconstruction using spiral gradients</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lazda, Andreas E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the design, implementation and testing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences using spiral readout gradients. Three different designs and their corresponding sequences are developed: 14-interleaf, short readout, 4-interleaf, medium readout; and single-shot, long readout. The sequences are run in both 2D multislice and 3D modes. Image reconstruction is performed using regridding, together with three different spiral density compensation methods. Results are compared for both phantom and in vivo human brain data. They indicate that the medium and long readout scans suffer from a certain level of image distortion due to field inhomogeneities, as well as T2* decay, in relation to their longer data acquisition times. This distortion is improved using a conjugate phase reconstruction technique, based on field maps generated from the same sequences. Custom software was developed to design the spiral gradients, set-up the sequences and reconstruct images. This software is flexible, and can support a variety of scan parameters, taking into consideration the limitations of a given MRI scanner.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pike, G.

Delamination failure of the main rotor yoke under static and fatigue loading conditions is investigated, both analytically and experimentally. A finite element model of the yoke is developed with a commercial finite element code, using the 'dummy plies' technique to allow modeling of a tapered laminate. The model is validated against the available experimental data. A set of static and fatigue experiments---limited to beamwise bending loads---are performed on representative test specimens cut out of actual yokes. The model is able to accurately predict the location of initial static failure, which corresponds to the interlaminar shear stress concentration predicted by the stress analysis. Results of the specimen fatigue tests are successfully correlated with the glass-epoxy material fatigue properties, using the Normalized Fatigue Life Model and the finite element model of the specimen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lessard, Larry B.

I designed a fully-automated system to quantify both resting and recovery spectra, followed by quantification of metabolite recovery kinetics. This included quantifying the recovery kinetics of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), an index of mitochondrial function which previously had not been properly characterized. I modeled the transition from ischemic-exercise to perfused-recovery as a step function, and fitted the ADP recovery with a second-order step-response function. Furthermore, I used nearest-neighbour methods to account for the effects of physical conditioning and metabolic work on the recovery kinetics.

However, because there exists a trade off between strength and ductility, steels destined for both high formability and high strength applications must further undergo a sequence of energy intensive heat treatment steps. Alternatively, TRIP (TRansformation Induced Plasticity) steels have been acknowledged to possess excellent combinations of both strength and ductility. The timely strain or stress induced transformation of Retained Austenite (RA) to martensite locally strengthens these steels at the point of plastic instability, causing failure by necking to be postponed and shifted elsewhere along the steel. This phenomenon repeated over and over again allows increased levels of deformation, prior to fracture. In the current TRIP grades, Si is a key elemental addition. However, in levels exceeding 1.0 wt.%, it is unpopular as it is responsible for a tenacious oxide layer. In this work, it is suggested that Mo may potentially replace Si in part. Multi pass rolling simulations were also performed using torsion.

The most common themes touched upon were the attributes of which a tribe may have been particularly proud, such as its victories and generosity to the vanquished, the bravery of its heroes in battle and on hard journeys, the beauty of its women and of nature, the genealogy of the tribe, and prayers to the Almighty. Through verse the ancient Arabs expressed how they conceived of their deities, whether, idols representing various gods and goddesses, or Allah. These verses make it clear that Allah alone was not represented by any idol, allowing us to infer that He was regarded as superior to other deities.

The Henri cycle was to illustrate the "triumphs" of her late husband the King, and the Maria cycle was to illustrate the Queen's "illustrious life and heroic deeds". This thesis proposes that the Maria de Medici cycle cannot be disassociated from the Henri IV cycle because the Queen's intention was to present her reign as a continuation of his and to prove that she was equally capable to rule the French nation. Chosen by Henri as his successor, Maria overcame obstacles that originated in his reign and that jeopardised the throne for her son and the Bourbon line. Although the Henri IV cycle was never completed, the paintings and sketches that exist make it possible to link the two galleries by the pivotal event of marriage. The Maria cycle addresses and resolves issues stemming from this union. The repetition of specific images and themes in the two cycles represents Maria's unique qualifications and reinforces the equality of the two sovereigns. Maria completed the mandate that Henri authorised her to carry out, ensuring peace at home and in Europe, thus justifying her designation as a heroine Queen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glen, Thomas L.

The contract between artist and patron specified two sets of twenty-four canvases: one dedicated to the life of Maria and the other to the life of King Henry IV. Maria intended the paintings to illustrate her continuation of the King's policies and the legitimacy of her own rule---themes that echoed her vast propaganda campaign. One reason for numerous scholarly interpretations of the Medici series is the incomplete nature of the Henry cycle. This thesis supports the idea espoused by one, and possibly two scholars (and then only in a selected fashion), that Maria and Henry's lives must be understood as unified and complementary in order to interpret the original commission correctly.

The instrumental case study approach was employed to analyse DCP ownership in the Indo-Canada Education Project (ICEP) to that end. ICEP was an education development project funded by the Canadian International Development Agency in the southern Indian states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamilnadu for approximately seven years. The results of the study yielded evidence of 3 process factors (participation, power, and control) and 2 attitudinal factors (freedom and commitment) operating over 3 levels (individual, organisational, and institutional) that contributed to DCP ownership in ICEP. Each of the factors expressed themselves differently over the various levels. These distinct expressions were termed, "manifests". A total of 15 manifests were found.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lusthaus, Charles (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182n09m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gj35m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economic development -- India.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- India.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j737m"><dcterms:title>A relational analysis of verbal interactions in conjoint behavioral consultation /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martel, Chantal Annie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the patterns of relational communication that occur during conjoint behavioural consultation (CBC) and explore the relationship between relational control during CBC and intervention outcome. The participants included nine children with identified behavioural problems (ages 3 to 7), the parents and teachers of these children who acted as consultees, and graduate students who acted as consultants. The Conjoint Problem Identification Interview (CPII) and the Conjoint Problem Analysis Interview (CPAI) of the nine CBC cases were coded using the Family Relational Control Coding System. Scores on the variables "domineeringness" and "dominance" were calculated for each participant in order to measure relational control. Improvements in children's target behaviour from baseline to intervention at home and at school, as measured by effect size statistics, was used as a measure of intervention outcome. Consultants exerted more control (i.e., domineeringness and dominance) over the consultation process when compared to consultees. Also, there is preliminary evidence that in general, a higher degree of consultant control is associated with more favorable CBC outcomes at home and at school, while a lower degree of consultees control is associated with more favorable CBC outcomes at home. Results are discussed in light of their practical and theoretical implications.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sladeczek, Ingrid E.

A dependent sample of Grade 10 students completed Vealey's State Sport-Confidence Inventory at the completion of their single-sex class and then again at the completion of their coeducational class. They also completed a sport specific self-confidence measure, in order to factor out their confidence in basketball and volleyball from their overall State Sport-Confidence. Some students also participated in focus group interviews at the completion of each class type. Vealey's State Sport-Confidence Inventory showed no significant differences between classes or between genders. However, qualitative results contradicted these findings as females indicated obvious differences between the two class types that would in turn affect their self-confidence levels. The results indicate that more research is needed into how class type affects the self-confidence of students in single-sex and coeducational physical education classes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Downey, Peggy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k897.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb62f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sports -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical education for children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex differences in education.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-confidence.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht647"><dcterms:title>Hegel's influence on American political thought : an analysis of the American Progressive movement</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mauro, Robert M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>James Harvey Robinson, Charles Austin Beard, John Dewey, and Herbert Croly are all founding members of the American Progressive Movement. However, a thorough understanding of their philosophy remains incomplete. Thus, this thesis attempts to investigate the intellectual foundations of these scholars by comparing their philosophy to Hegel's. Therefore, the object of this thesis is to demonstrate that Hegel's philosophy plays a major role in the formation of American Progressive thought---an understanding of Hegel's political thought helps one to better grasp the philosophy of the American Progressive movement. While Robinson, Beard, Dewey, and Croly have many intellectual influences, a close reading of Hegel's works and the writings of the Progressives teases out similarities between the two. However, Hegel's influence on the Progressives is not self-evident or unattenuated---in most cases Hegel's influence comes to the Progressives through sources other than his texts (e.g., instructors and mentors, readings, and personal relations). Thus, this thesis argues that American Progressive thought represents some variation on Hegelianism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patten, Alan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v58s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht647</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Progressivism (United States politics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, 1770-1831 -- Influence.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr1720141"><dcterms:title>Psychosocial factors underlying problem gambling</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marget, Nancy.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The psychosocial correlates of adolescent gambling behavior were assessed among 7th, 9th, and 11 th graders. Participants (N = 587) completed questionnaires concerning their gambling behavior, coping skills, locus of control, depression, and substance use. Adolescents were grouped into 1 of 4 groups based upon their performance on the DSM-IV-J (Fisher, 1992) gambling screen: non-gamblers, social gamblers, problem gamblers, and probable pathological gamblers. This research examined whether individuals belonging to the 4 groups differ with respect to locus of control, coping skills, depression, and substance use. Results indicated that probable pathological gamblers were characterized by an external locus of control and reported higher levels of maladaptive coping styles, depression, and regular substance use than non-gamblers and social gamblers. Logistic regression analyses suggest that coping skills, locus of control, substance use, and depression alone do not adequately predict pathological gambling, but do seem to play an important role in the etiology nonetheless. Implications are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gupta, Rina (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m967.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr1720141</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adolescent psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gambling -- Social aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795956s"><dcterms:title>Environmental technology transfer : a case study of Quebec environmental firms in China</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gervais, Paul, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As developing countries have grown aware of the effects of pollution and resource depletion, industrialized countries that produce environmental goods and services have secured new markets where to export them. In this manner, increased concerns over environmental degradation have led to the growth of the green technology sector which is currently in full expansion. The purpose of the thesis is, therefore, to uncover the dynamics of such exchanges by exploring the interactions of Quebec environmental firms in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Results indicate that the PRC presents accommodative structures that are compatible with those found in Quebec, but an inappropriate level of protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs). This scenario gives the PRC a certain advantage since most local firms are able to reproduce foreign technologies without being constrained by issues of intellectual property. Combining theoretical and practical approaches, the thesis uncovers that accommodative conditions do not supersede the question of IPRs when attempting to ensure transfers. Even though the current state of these factors affects the nature of the agreements, the environmental aspect of these technologies seems to facilitate the transactions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duquette, Michel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Noumoff, Samuel J.

His tragedies, fables, essays and other writings have since given rise to countless analyses. Rarely, however, has that polyphony of commentary addressed the faint presence of the female characters in his plays or their often unenviable fate. Indeed, only recently has literary criticism initiated debate on the feminine condition in Lessing's dramaturgy and theatrical aesthetics. Pursing that same line of inquiry, we will attempt to uncover the logic of exclusion of the feminine Other that lies behind the reactions of the male characters in the play under consideration. We will premise our exploration on the feminist concepts of woman as image and on male fantasies of women. Our inquiry is two-pronged: How should Emilia's death be interpreted? Where does her guilt lie? First, we will explore the "economics of separation," i.e., the universe of mental representations harboured by patriarchal man of the Enlightenment. Through analyzing the concepts of death and gender, first from the vantage of the eighteenth century and then within the context of the theatre and literature of that period, we will define those concepts and better assess their powers (death) and limitations (gender). Second, we will probe the image of woman and her sexuality by observing the characters as they interrelate. We will underline the phenomena of projection and identification as well as the structures of abjection in the play. Lastly, our study will bring to light the fiction of the masculine identity and the manner in which women are imagined as "individuals," in sum, how stereotypes are engendered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schmidt, Josef (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698941x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps346</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lessing, Gotthold Ephraim, 1729-1781.

My research furthers VanPatten's work through an investigation of more advanced students of Spanish L2. The participants for this study were 60 advanced Spanish L2 students at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. To investigate whether advanced L2 learners can focus on form while listening for meaning, participants were randomly assigned to complete one of four listening tasks: Task I (control task): listening to the passage for content only, Task II: listening to the passage for content and simultaneously noting the key lexical item, inflacion, Task III: listening to the passage for content and simultaneously noting the article la, and Task IV: listening for content and simultaneously noting the verb morpheme -n. Comprehension of the passage was assessed by a written recall protocol. Results revealed that comprehension scores were higher among learners listening only for meaning than those of learners attending to meaning and one of the formal features. The findings of the present study are in agreement with VanPatten (1990). Learners' attention to form while listening for meaning appears to affect comprehension.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spada, Nina (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb33z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741t62r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Second language acquisition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spanish language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m126j"><dcterms:title>The question of the Islamic city /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Goddard, Cedrik Christopher.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis critically examines the creation and development of the concept of the Islamic city in the discourse of twentieth century Orientalism and Islamic studies. Based largely upon the urban theories of Max Weber, French Orientalists working in the first half of the twentieth century developed a standardized and ideal model of the Islamic city. This model remained unchallenged until the late 1950s when Eliyahu Ashtor-Strauss and Claude Cahen began to question some of its fundamental assumptions. The revisionist trend continued into the 1960s and 1970s with the innovative work of Samuel Stern and Ira Lapidus. Contributions from fields outside traditional Oriental studies such as anthropology, sociology, and geography also helped to paint a more complex and diverse picture of the city in Islam. By the 1980s, thanks in part to the influence of Edward Said's book Orientalism, the old French model of the Islamic city was thoroughly discredited. In its place emerged a new understanding of the Islamic city in which scholar increasingly saw Islam as just one of many forces which have helped to shape the urban form. Moreover, cities are increasingly regarded as dynamic and constantly evolving entities, and therefore they can longer be simply represented in idealist and essentialist terms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Little, Donald P.
