A few facts were obtained in the beginning from the vast collection of data on the binding energies of nuclei. In order to account for saturation, Heisenberg (1) and Majorana (2) introduced the idea of exchange forces, somewhat akin to the exchange forces which occur in molecular binding. These forces give rise to spin and parity dependence in the interaction. From the large ratio of the binding energy of the alpha particle to that of the deuteron, Wigner (3) deduced that the forces were short ranged and very strong within that range.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lomon, E.

In the current study we have evaluated the effect of a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor SKI-606, on breast cancer growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. Treatment of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 with SKI-606 caused a marked inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration by inhibiting MAPK and Akt phosphorylation. For in vivo studies MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) [MDA-MB-231-GFP] were inoculated into mammary fat pad of female BALB/c nu/nu mice. Once tumor volume reached 30-50 mm3, animals were randomized and treated with vehicle alone or 150 mg/kg of SKI-606 by daily oral gavage. Experimental animals receiving SKI-606 developed tumors of significantly smaller volume (45-54%) as compared to control animals receiving vehicle alone. Analysis of lungs, liver and spleen of these animals showed a significant decrease in GFP positive tumor metastasis in animals receiving SKI-606 at a dose that was well tolerated. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumors showed that these effects were due to the ability of SKI-606 to block tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, growth factors expression and inhibition of Src mediated signalling pathways in vivo. Together the results from these studies provide compelling evidence for the use of Src inhibitors as therapeutic agents for blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395wc21j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k879x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Quinolines -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitriles -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aniline Compounds -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breast Neoplasms -- drug therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasm Metastasis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasm Invasiveness.</dc:subject><dc:subject>src-Family Kinases -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w826k"><dcterms:title>DNA-inspired materials for 'bottom-up' nanotechnology</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ishihara, Yoshihiro.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>DNA is a remarkable material that is both an inspiration for polymer nanotechnology and a versatile building block for assembling well-defined nanostructures.

These DNA-mimetic polymers self-assembled into spherical aggregates in solution, held together by hydrogen bonding interactions. We have reported the first example of a block copolymer micellar aggregate that is capable of selective recognition of small-molecule guests, with concomitant changes in its aggregation behavior. In the field of DNA-mediated materials, the ordering of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) arrays can be hindered by the lability of AuNP-DNA linkages. In the search of an indefinitely stable AuNP-DNA linkage, three dendritic thiol-terminated DNA strands were synthesized, and were bound to AuNPs. A preliminary AuNP-DNA linkage lability study showed potential in forming nonlabile AuNP-DNA linkages through the use of dendritic thiol-modified DNA.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr1721813.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w826k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gold.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanoparticles.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanoelectromechanical systems.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A000003670"><dcterms:title>The cytoprotective role of Ras signaling in glomerular epithelial cell injury /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Huynh, Carl.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In experimental membranous nephropathy, complement C5b-9-induced glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury leads to breakdown of glomerular peimselectivity and proteinuria. This study addresses mechanisms that limit complement-mediated injury, focusing on Ras. Complement-mediated injury was attenuated in cultured GEC expressing a constitutively active form of Ras (V12Ras), compared with Neo (control) GEC. V12Ras GEC showed constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, but inhibition of these pathways did not reverse the protective effect of Ras. V12Ras GEC showed smaller and rounder morphology, decreased F- to G-actin ratio, decreased activity of the Rho GTPase, Rac, and decreased Src activity. In V12Ras GEC, disruption or stabilization of the F-actin cytoskeleton reversed the protective effect of V12Ras on complement-mediated injury. Thus, the protective effect of V12Ras may be dependent on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the reduction of Src activity due to Ras activation may alter the equilibrium in activities of Rho GTPases, a family of proteins known regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of Ras signaling is a novel pathway to consider in developing strategies for cytoprotection in complement-mediated injury.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm843.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000003670</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cytoprotection -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>ras Proteins -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Complement Membrane Attack Complex.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kidney Glomerulus -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epithelium -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akh04dt10f"><dcterms:title>Labeling of genetically modified organisms and the producer's negative labeling decision under a voluntary labeling regime</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hu, Rongrong, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During the past decade, there has been growing public attention and concern over consuming products containing or processed with genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

A theoretical model was developed to analyze non-GMO producers' labeling decisions under a voluntary labeling regime, aimed at providing a theoretical perspective for governments that are contemplating the adoption of a voluntary approach to regulate GMO food products.

The beta-arrestins, adaptor proteins involved in GPCR desensitization, may also act as scaffolds for signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK family, which includes the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2, promotes cellular differentiation and proliferation. Herein, the activation of ERK1/2 upon stimulation of the GPCR bradykinin type 2 receptor (B2R) with bradykinin was examined. Various B2R mutants with modified C-termini were employed to examine the temporal kinetics of ERK1/2. One of these receptor mutants displayed a loss of beta-arrestin binding as well as greatly enhanced ERK1/2 activation, compared to the wild-type receptor, when a cluster of serine/threonine residues important for B2R internalization was mutated. The other receptor mutants exhibited a correlation between their affinity for beta-arrestin and the intensity of ERK1/2 activation. Data from a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line null for beta-arrestin suggested that beta-arrestin is involved in late-phase ERK1/2 activation by the B2R. These data point to the involvement of beta-arrestin in the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPKs through the B2R.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr66s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx39x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor, Bradykinin B2 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zv237"><dcterms:title>Measuring organ donation performance internationally : modeling the effects of available denominators for organ donation rates</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hornby, Karen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective. To evaluate organ donation (OD) policy, appropriate comparisons between different OD programs are required. The objective of this research was to investigate alternative methods of measuring national rates of OD using publicly available data and examine the implications of using each method as a measure of performance. Method. We used 7 measures to calculate deceased OD rates, based on 7 different denominators. Data were collected from OD organizations and the World Health Organization. OD rates for each measure were calculated for 10 countries for the years 2001--2004. Relative rates were calculated using Spain as the standard. Results. We found variations in relative rates across the proposed measures. Regardless of the measure used Spain excelled. Conclusion. If the purpose of the OD rate is to identify the top performer internationally, it may not matter which measure is used providing this is done with an understanding of its limitations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d355x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zv237</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tissue and Organ Procurement -- statistics &amp; numerical data.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cx904"><dcterms:title>Predictors of excess weight gain among children participating in the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hillou, Farah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of excess weight gain among children participating in the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP).

Generally regarded as a behavior with a multitude of state and trait dependent risk factors (e.g. psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, genetics), explanations as to why certain individuals commit suicide while others do not are complex. Of interest is in studying potential trait dependent variables involved in the neurobiology of suicide, particularly at the cellular level. Knowledge of the cellular integrity may aid in explaining the observed macroscopic alterations and ultimately the behavioral correlates associated with suicidality. Therefore we set out to summarize extant knowledge of the cellular alterations occurring in the brains of major depressive and suicide individuals. Following this, we conducted our own cellular investigation in a region known to be altered in major depression and suicide, a supracallosal area of BA24a. Neuronal and glial cell densities as well as neuronal cell sizes were assessed in upper and lower cortical layers between sudden-death controls and MDD suicide subjects. Secondary analyses were also conducted to examine the effect of alcohol on depressed suicides. Analyses of cell densities and neuronal soma sizes between controls and MDD suicide subjects did not reveal any significant differences. Further analyses showed increased glial cell densities in alcoholic depressed suicides. Future studies are necessary to examine explicit changes in the cellular compositions occurring in alcoholic dependent individuals. Staining techniques aimed at targeting specific subtypes of neurons and glial cells will help determine if these cell populations do in fact have an influential role in suicide and MDD.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687m87q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c1912</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neurons -- cytology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Depressive Disorder, Major -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebral Cortex -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gyrus Cinguli -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Suicide.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neuroglia -- cytology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301504p"><dcterms:title>Alteration and ammonium enrichment vectors to low-sulphidation epithermal mineralization : insights from the Banderas gold-silver prospect</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Harlap, Ariel.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The alteration at the low-sulphidation epithermal Banderas Au-Ag prospect, Guatemala, was characterized using a portable infrared mineral analyzer (PIMA) spectrometer and shown to comprise illite, buddingtonite and, on surface, kaolinite associated with gold mineralization. The Spextract python program, developed by the author, was used to measure variations in the short-wave infrared spectra (SWIR) which were then mapped as equal-area-of-influence or voronoi diagrams. Voronoi maps of the 2200 and 2350 nm absorption features, position and depth, respectively, for illite and 1560 and 2120 nm feature depths for buddingtonite indicate that illite crystallinity and ammonium alteration intensity increase towards gold mineralization. The latter observation suggests that gold transport and deposition may have been controlled by ammonia complexation. At conditions likely to have prevailed during mineralization, i.e., temperatures between 150° and 250°C, a pH between 5 and 8.5, an oxygen fugacity ( fO2 ) near the hematite-magnetite buffer, a chlorinity of 0.5 m, a total sulfur activity of 0.001 m, and a total nitrogen activity of 0.004 m, AuNH3 +2 is the dominant ammonia complex and gold solubility at optimal pH- fO2 conditions reaches ~65 ppm at 250°C. In contrast, the maximum solubility of gold as AuHS -2 , the species normally assumed to control gold transport in epithermal systems, is approximately four orders lower at 250°C; at 150°C the solubility of AuNH3 +2 and AuHS -2 are essentially the same, i.e., ~9 ppb. A model for Au-Ag mineralization is proposed in which hydrothermal fluids were focused along NW-SE extensional faults and at the contacts of rhyolite domes and tuffs, and gold transport and deposition were controlled mainly by ammonia-dominated complexation and boiling-induced temperature decrease, respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q073g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301504p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gold ores -- Geology -- Guatemala -- Chiquimula.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t2945"><dcterms:title>Cis-regulatory modules clustering from sequence similarity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Handfield, Louis-François.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I present a method that regroups cis-regulatory modules by shared sequences motifs.

Gene expression profiling was performed on these clones to determine differentially expressed genes between the parental and resistant cells. DARPP-32 (Dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32kDa) was, by far, the most overexpressed transcript. DARPP-32 is coamplified with ERBB2 on the same amplicon of chromosome 17.10 This protein has been mostly described in neurobiology, but DARPP-32 overexpression was recently reported in gastrointestinal, esophageal, prostate and breast cancer.11 Therefore, we suggest that overexpression of DARPP-32 can cause acquired resistance of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab. The in vitro knockout of DARPP-32, using stable shRNA transfection, abolishes the resistance to trastuzumab in the clones, while overexpression of DARPP-32 in the parental cells results in de novo resistance. Overall, our results suggest that DARPP-32 may be a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer patients who develop acquired trastuzumab resistance.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h0915.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827g45w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Breast Neoplasms -- drug therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drug Resistance, Neoplasm.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antibodies, Monoclonal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor, erbB-2.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antineoplastic Agents.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wv13t"><dcterms:title>Enhanced bone formation during distraction osteogenesis in FGFR3 deficient mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hamade, Fares.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) is a technique for bone lengthening and filling of bone defects following trauma, infection or resection of tumors. DO consists of an osteotomy of the bone to be lengthened, followed by controlled distraction of the bone segments with an external fixator until the desired lengthening is obtained (distraction phase). This is followed by the consolidation phase, during which the external fixator is kept in place until the newly formed bone in the distracted zone consolidates. This phase is long and may cause numerous problems. Ongoing research aims at finding a method to accelerate the consolidation of the newly formed bone. Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) play a significant role in bone development and repair. FGF 18 has been shown to be the only FGF member to be expressed throughout both the distraction and the consolidation phases of DO. It was also reported that FGF18 is the physiological ligand of FGFR3. Therefore, we hypothesized that FGF18 and FGFR3 may have an important role in DO. To test this hypothesis, we investigated DO in FGFR3 deficient mice (FGFR3-/-). (FGF18 deficient mice are not viable). A miniaturized DO apparatus was applied to the tibia followed by an osteotomy. Distraction began after a 5-day latency period at a rate of 0.2 mm/12 hours for 12 days. Samples were collected at 3 time points comparing the mutants (FGFR3-/-) to their wild type litter' sates: end of distraction (17 days post-surgery), mid-consolidation (34 days post-surgery), and end of consolidation (51 days post surgery). The samples were analyzed using X-ray, DEXA, microCT, histology, biomechanical testing and Real-Time PCR. Our results revealed that FGFR3 deficient mice showed accelerated bone formation compared to the W.T. littermates at mid-consolidation where the parameters measured revealed increased bone mineral density, bone mineral content and trabecular number in the mutant tibial samples. The newly regenerated bone consolidated faster in the FGFR3 knock-out mice and the bone was of better quality as revealed by biomechanical tests in which more force was needed to break the mutant bone because it exhibited higher resistance than the age matched wild-type sample. The marker gene expression patterns revealed an up-regulation of chondrogenic markers that suggest that the knock-out mice follow the endochondral ossification pathway during DO. All results were statistically significant. These results show that signaling through FGFR3 acts to decrease bone formation during DO. Consequently, blocking FGFR3 may lead to accelerated bone formation in DO. This may have important clinical implications in attempts to improve the functional outcome of DO by decreasing the long duration that the external fixator has to be kept on.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q9895.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wv13t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mice.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice, Knockout.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Osteogenesis, Distraction -- methods.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 -- genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
