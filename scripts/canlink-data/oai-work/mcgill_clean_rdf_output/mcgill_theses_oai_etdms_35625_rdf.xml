Particular reference is made to the situation in the European Union and the  changes that might occur in the aftermath of the "open-skies" decision of  the European Court of Justice in November 2002. One major part of the thesis generally analyses different means  of distributing limited public right, in order to determine an appropriate method  for the allocation of air traffic rights. After a comparison with the  telecommunication sector, it is concluded that the most appropriate approach is to  conduct a Beauty Contest in the form of a Documentary Hearing. It is suggested that  airlines submit their proposals and the regulatory agencies make their choice based  on certain criteria. Subsequently, a glance is taken at the methods for allocating  air traffic rights that are currently applied in several countries. It can be seen  that all these countries have chosen the same approach, a Beauty Contest, and that  they all are facing the same difficulties, which are inconsistency and ambiguity of  the distribution procedure. Furthermore, a short evaluation, whether the General Agreement  on Trade in Services has an impact on the allocation of air traffic rights, is  undertaken. However, this is denied. Based on the previous results an own proposal is presented, how  air traffic rights could be distributed in a Beauty Contest, while avoiding most of  the difficulties encountered by other countries. This proposal concentrates on the  situation in the European Union, but could be also applied in other  countries.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n855x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042t58r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bm223"><dcterms:title>The power of "the human rights approach to HIV/AIDS" : gender, health and the transnational advocacy networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Avani, Christina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis undertakes an in-depth examination of the power of  human rights advocacy in combating women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Focusing on  sub-Saharan Africa, the thesis explores the gender discrimination that lies at the  core of women's susceptibility to the virus. Culturally-imposed social roles are  depicted as the fundamental cause of the violation of women's human rights,  including their right to health. The objective of the thesis is to analyze the  potential of using a human rights approach to address this issue. It adopts the  assumption that "the mobilization of shame" triggered by civil society's  actors can alter states' human rights practices. Looking at a specific type of  actors, namely the transnational advocacy networks, the thesis concludes that  "the human rights approach to HIV/AIDS" can be an efficient and effective  strategy to pressurize governments to implement their international human rights  obligations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236253n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm223</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human rights -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human rights advocacy -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Equality -- Health aspects -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Health and hygiene -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women's rights -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784m33n"><dcterms:title>A legal analysis of aviation security under the international legal regime /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jung, Sang Yool, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The safety of civil aviation has been endangered not only by  terrorism, but also by many other unlawful acts committed by persons with varying  motivation. The international community has worked to provide a secure and safe air  transportation system for general people and thus has developed aviation security  systems in the legal and technical fields to combat and prevent the man-made  intentional harm against civil aviation. The legal instruments are mainly based on several multilateral  conventions, resolutions and declarations. They are all focused on how to eliminate  safe heavens for unlawful actors against civil aviation, secure the safety of  passenger and crew, and facilitate the resumption of affected  aircraft. The technical instruments, dealing with specific preventive  security measures to suppress the unlawful acts against civil aviation on a  practical basis, have been developed by ICAO as "Standards and Recommended  Practices" (SARPs) in the form of Annexes. In addition, to promote global  aviation security, ICAO launched its "Universal Security Audit Programme"  immediately following the tragic events of September 11, 2001. This thesis critically analyses the legal and technical aviation  security systems under current international legal regimes and provides several  recommendations to improve the remaining problems in the international aviation  security system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j8598.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784m33n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aeronautics -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Security measures</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t247g"><dcterms:title>Aircraft noise regulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ionescu, Irina Gabriela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Aircraft noise is one of the most controversial environmental  concerns in the aviation industry, partly due to the difficulty in harmonizing  countries' regulation regarding this issue. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze  the ways in which aircraft noise is regulated at the national and international  levels, and to compare the legislative responses to aircraft noise issues in Europe  and North America. Each of the four main chapters of the thesis takes into  consideration a different aspect of the problem. The first chapter describes the  objective and subjective ways of measuring aircraft noise. This process is necessary  in order to allow the legislation to meet its purpose, namely, to protect the  environment, the sources of the aircraft noise, and the effects of the aircraft  noise on people. The second chapter describes the evolution of aircraft noise issues  at the national levels in the US and throughout the EU, respectively, as well as at  the international level, such as at the ICAO. The third chapter analyses the EU  Regulation 925/1999, which created tension between the EU and the US due to its  alleged discriminatory nature. This thesis examines the arguments of both sides.  Finally, the fourth chapter analyses the noise certification standards developed by  ICAO, namely the "balanced approach".</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t911q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t247g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airplanes -- Noise -- Law and legislation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m713n"><dcterms:title>Corporations and intellectual assets : a case of being blinded by the economic value</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Durell, Karen Lynne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Corporations appear to be mesmerized by the revenue value of  intellectual assets to the exclusion of other attributes thereof.

Since it is not known  how to differentiate stem cells into disc cells, our rationale is to differentiate  stem cells into chondrocyte-like cells. This proposal is based on the fact that  cartilage and immature nucleus possess similar macromolecules in their matrix. Our  hypothesis is that these cells can produce a matrix that mimics native nucleus  pulposus with properties resembling that found in healthy intervertebral disc. We  used a pellet culture system to promote in vitro chondrogenesis of MSCs, in which  the cells were cultured in defined chondrogenic medium and supplemented with  TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta3, IGF-1, with or without dexamethasone. Markers of  chondrogenesis include collagen type II and aggrecan, with collagen type X being  used as a marker of late stage chondrocyte hypertrophy. The purpose of this study  was to investigate the above growth factors on the chondrogenic differentiation  pathway using these markers to follow cell differentiation. Our results show  evidence of constitutive expression of aggrecan message and early expression of type  X collagen message, surprisingly before the appearance of that for type II collagen.  This raises the question whether they are good markers of chondrogenesis and  chondrocyte hypertrophy, respectively, during MSC differentiation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cd716.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j53n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827c29w"><dcterms:title>Product attributes and consumer willingness to pay for environmental management systems in agriculture : using the choice modeling technique</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Straub, Matthew Otto Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Consumer concerns in food purchasing contain a number of  elements, including food safety, environment, animal welfare, and other socially  related issues.

Conditions mimicked the mill system as closely as possible. Acetate  carbon uptake kinetics and conversion to CO2, growth products, PHB, and secreted  metabolites in each of the four phases were measured. The role of PHB synthesis in  the initial stripping of acetate from mill effluent and the PHB production potential  of this mill AS were also investigated. Results showed that acetate was rapidly taken up by  high-affinity systems in the AS. During the initial exposure of mill-starved AS,  acetate greatly stimulated AS-O2 uptake, and was quickly converted to PHB and CO 2.  Upon depletion of available effluent acetate, as occurs in the downstream sections  of the aeration tank, O2-uptake rates decreased and the acetate-C stored in AS-PHB  was slowly released as CO2, and partly used for growth. Under secondary  clarifier-like anaerobic conditions, the AS released virtually no CO2. However,  substantial amounts of PHB were used for growth under anaerobic conditions and a  small proportion of the original acetate C exited the cells as organic acids.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jx56w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687h99w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate -- Metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wood-pulp industry -- Waste disposal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sewage -- Purification -- Activated sludge process.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acetates -- Metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g39w"><dcterms:title>Conjugate gradient in Hilbert spaces</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Panayotov, Ivo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we examine the Conjugate Gradient algorithm for  solving self-adjoint positive definite linear systems in Cn .

Dystroglycan is composed of two subunits that are  tightly but non-covalently linked. alpha Dystroglycan (alpha DG) is located  extracellularly and it is the only component of the DGC linked to the ECM, while  beta Dystroglycan (beta DG) spans the plasma membrane and has both an extracellular  and a cytoplasmic domain.

In particular,  they act as negative regulators of neuronal development. Gro/TLEs can be recruited  to DNA by forming complexes with a number of DNA-binding transcription factors and  are thus involved in the regulation of numerous genes. The aim of this study was to  characterize a new member of the Gro/TLE family named Groucho-related gene 6 (Grg6).  It is reported here that Grg6 is expressed in selected regions of the murine  embryonic nervous system in both mitotic progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons.  Exogenous expression of Grg6 in cortical neural progenitor cells does not  significantly affect neuronal differentiation. However, when co-expressed with  Gro/TLE1 and the anti-neurogenic Gro/TLE-binding protein brain factor 1 (BF-1; also  called Foxg1), Grg6 causes an increase in the number of differentiated neurons. In  agreement with these findings, Grg6 interacts with BF-1 and decreases  transcriptional repression mediated by BF1:Gro/TLE complexes. In addition, Grg6  disrupts the interaction between BF-1 and Gro/TLE1.

In this thesis we explore a fiber laser-based wavelength-to-power mapping interrogation system for wavelength-division-multiplexed FBG sensors, and we prove that such solution offers increased measurement reliability with high power efficiency.  Another aspect of improving the performance of sensing systems is the ability to measure multiple parameters, which are extremely useful when working with FBG-based sensors experiencing similar changes in spectral characteristics in response to changes in temperature or strain. These can be discriminated when they can be measured using different interrogation methods. For this purpose, we first explore and evaluate the performance of a vibration sensor designed by QPS Photronics, and we prove that it can be used to measure temperature and/or strain by translating the changes in its sinusoidal multi-wavelength spectrum to changes in the response of a single pass-band microwave photonic filter (MPF). The operation principle is based on monitoring the shift of the main filter band as temperature or strain changes. We demonstrate that such a system can achieve high-speed measurement with variable sensitivity.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Avec la  croissance de l'application potentielle des capteurs à fibres optiques, il est important de trouver des systèmes de mesure simples, à coût réduit, et présentant une efficacité de puissance élevée. Celle-ci est extrêmement utile quand il s'agit de multiplexer des capteurs distribués sur des grandes distances, ce qui contribue à l'augmentation de l'atténuation du signal optique et impose une limite au nombre de capteurs qui peuvent être interrogés en utilisant un minimum d'unités de  mesure. Dans cette thèse nous explorons un système d'interrogation basé sur un laser à fibre optique pour réaliser la traduction de la longueur d'onde en une mesure de puissance pour les capteurs à base de réseaux de Bragg. Nous prouvons que grâce à cette solution nous pouvons augmenter la fiabilité de la mesure avec une efficacité de puissance élevée ainsi que de réduire les erreurs de la mesure. Pour augmenter la performance d'un système de capteurs, il est aussi important de pouvoir mesurer de paramètres additionnels. Ceci est extrêmement important quand le capteur est base sur des réseaux de Bragg qui ont une réponse similaire aux changements de température ou tension. Ces deux facteurs peuvent être distingués en utilisant des méthodes d'interrogation différentes. Ainsi, nous explorons et évaluons premièrement la performance d'un capteur de vibration conçu par QPS Photronics. Nous prouvons qu'il est possible de mesurer aussi la température et/ou la tension en traduisant les changements du spectre à plusieurs longueurs d'onde en des changements de la réponse d'un filtre à micro-ondes photoniques (MPF) à une seule bande passante. Le principe de l'opération du système est base sur la surveillance du déplacement de la bande passante principale du filtre quand la température ou la tension de la fibre changent. Nous montrons qu'un tel système est capable d'assurer une mesure très rapide avec une sensibilité variable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lawrence R Chen (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn77x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9353562</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149q455"><dcterms:title>Language, subjectivity, and meaningful change</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Peters, Stephen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Drawing from analyses of both fiction (Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart and Franz Kafka's short story “A Report to an Academy”) and graduate student writing, this thesis discusses the relationship between individuals and language.

Animal models of Cl2 exposure indicate that the airway epithelium is a  target. gammadelta T-Cells are present in the mucosal surface of the airways and may  control the growth and differentiation of the airway epithelial cells. However, the  role of these cells in the airway response to Cl 2 exposure has not been  elucidated. Aim. To study the role of gammadelta T-cells in the response to  Cl2 exposure with respect to inflammation and lung function. Methods. C57B1/6J (wild type) and TCR-delta -/- mice exposed to  Cl2 (400ppm) for 5 minutes were mechanically ventilated for measurement of responses  to i.v. methacholine (MCh) at 1, 3, and 5 days after exposure. Bronchoalveolar  lavage was performed to determine epithelial and leukocyte counts, and protein  content. Tissues were harvested for PCNA immunoreactivity to evaluate the rate of  repair of the epithelium. Results. Wild type mice developed a greater degree of airway  hyperresponsiveness to MCh at 1 day post exposure to Cl2 compared with TCR-delta-/-  mice. Epithelial cell counts in BAL after Cl2 exposure were greater in TCR-delta -/-  mice, and the pattern of inflammation differed in wild type and TCR-delta-/- mice;  macrophages showed a later peak and granulocyte numbers were lower in TCR-delta-/-  than in wild type mice. Both groups of mice had increased levels of total protein  content in BAL after Cl2 exposure that resolved after 3 and 5 days, respectively.  TCR-delta -/- mice have a lower rate of epithelial regeneration as shown by PCNA  immunoreactivity. Conclusion. The severity of airway injury after Cl 2 appears to  be greater in TCR-delta-/- mice but the lack of TCR-delta seems to abrogate the  changes in airway responsiveness to i.v. methacholine.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r35r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cd72g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs21p"><dcterms:title>Land-use change in the Neotropics : regional-scale predictors of deforestation and local effects on carbon storage and tree-species diversity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kirby, Kathryn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Land-use change, and in particular tropical deforestation, is  the leading cause of species extinctions globally, and is the second most important  source of CO2 emissions after fossil fuel combustion. I examine two policy-relevant  questions that relate to tropical deforestation and land use change: (1) At regional  scales, what biophysical and infrastructure-related factors are associated with  deforestation? and (2) At a local scale, what are some of the impacts of land use  change on above- and below-ground carbon stocks and on tree-species richness? The  first question was examined for the Brazilian Amazon through spatially-explicit  correlation analyses of deforestation and a series of predictor variables that  included highways and roads, annual rainfall, dry season length, soil  characteristics, site accessibility, and population density. The proximity of a site  to roads and highways was the strongest predictor of deforestation, with more  accessible sites more likely to be deforested. Dry season length was also a strong,  positive predictor of deforestation. The results suggest that current plans to  expand road infrastructure in Amazonia will have a significant impact on the forests  of the areas transected.

Ivermectin induces heterogeneous vacuolation in the pharynx that appears slowly and  accumulates over several days. This vacuolation is almost completely rescued by a  mutation in avr-15, which codes for the alpha-subunit of pharyngeal GluCls. The  vacuoles stain strongly with Lysotracker Red and are therefore likely to be acidic  compartments of the endosomal-lysosomal system. Examination of mutants defective for  endocytosis (rme-1, rme-8, and cup-5) uncovers the presence of acidic vacuoles  identical in appearance to ivermectin-induced vacuoles.

The  aim of this study was to compare in vitro the effects of monomeric versus polymeric  FN, OPN and BSP on MC3T3-E1/C4 osteoblast adhesion, proliferation and  differentiation.

It has been suggested that development molecular programs may be  reactivated to offset acute organ damage. One such molecule, Pax-2, is expressed  throughout the fetal collecting duct and was recently shown to suppress apoptosis  during kidney development. We hypothesized that during urinary tract obstruction (UTO),  PAX-2 expression is reactivated in the mature kidney, partially suppressing  apoptosis; and that mice with PAX-2 mutations will have increased susceptibility to  parenchymal damage during UTO. Wildtype (C3H) and heterozygous PAX-2 mutant mice (C3H/  PAX-21Neu) underwent unilateral ureteral ligation or sham operation at six weeks of  age. Kidneys were removed, weighed and assayed for Pax-2 reactivation following 5,  10 and 15 days of UTO. Kidneys were then screened for apoptosis by TUNEL staining,  and the novel anti-cleaved spectrin assay. Pax-2 protein expression fell to nearly undetectable levels in  the first weeks of life but was sharply reactivated in collecting duct cells of  wildtype, but not in PAX-21Neu mutant mice with 10 days of UTO. Wildtype mice with  UTO had increased TUNEL, cleaved spectrin and reduced kidney weight after 10-15 days  UTO. Mutant mice had exaggerated increases in TUNEL staining, cleaved spectrin and  parenchymal loss in the obstructed kidney. In conclusion, we have shown that PAX-2 is highly expressed in  the fetal kidney but is normally down regulated in the postnatal period; it is  rapidly reactivated in collecting duct cells during UTO. Mice with genetically  limited PAX-2 expression have heightened susceptibility to apoptosis and renal  parenchymal loss following acute UTO.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh69p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698808p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rt961"><dcterms:title>Hes6 function in mammalian cortical development : the role of the LXXLL motif</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ciura, Sorana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mammalian cortical neurogenesis is a highly regulated  developmental process. The main factors involved in this regulation are the bHLH  family of transcription factors, of which the Hes family of Notch effector proteins  play a major role. Hes1 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting the  co-repressor Gro/TLE and functions to prevent differentiation of progenitors into  neurons. Recently, a novel member of the Hes family, Hes6, has been identified. This  protein was shown to have an opposite function to Hes1, promoting differentiation of  progenitor cells into neurons. The goal of the present project was to determine  whether Hes6 might also have an effect on astrocyte differentiation during cortical  development. We found that Hes6 can significantly decrease the gliogenic potential  of cortical progenitor cells in culture and the Gro/TLE recruitment domain was  required for this function. As part of a structure-function analysis for Hes6, we  also characterized a motif termed the "LXXLL" motif present in Hes6 but  not in other Hes proteins. A Hes6 mutant where the function of this motif was  abolished failed to antagonize the function of Hes1 and did not have an effect on  the differentiation of cortical progenitors into astrocytes like the wild type  protein. These results suggest a novel role of Hes6 in inhibiting gliogenesis. This  role is partly mediated by the newly characterized LXXLL motif of  Hes6.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq10t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt961</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
