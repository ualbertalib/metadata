His theory of knowledge and his attempt to describe the philosopher's ascent en route to conjunction with the Intellect are explained in Chapter two. His concern with the Prime Mover is shown in Chapter three.

Selon le dogme shi'ite, l'imamah a une fonction importante car il est une expression de la Grace (lutf) de Dieu envers sa création. Selon le principe de la Justice ('adl) de Dieu, les théologiens du Shi'isme duodécimain ont developpé des arguments religieux afin ge soutenir ce dogme. Un aspect de la justice divine est que Dieu ne commet pas d'injustice et ne punit son serviteur sans raison valable. Par consequent, ce principe rend necessaire pour Lui d'imposer des obligation religieuses (taklifs) afin que son serviteur les observent.

On the basis of the principle of God's Justice ('adl), Twelver-Shi'i theologians developed theological arguments to support this dogma. One aspect of God's Justice is that He will not do injustice or punish His servants without valid reason. Consequently this principle makes it necessary for God to lay Religious Obligations (taklifs) upon His servants to be observed. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Charles J.
