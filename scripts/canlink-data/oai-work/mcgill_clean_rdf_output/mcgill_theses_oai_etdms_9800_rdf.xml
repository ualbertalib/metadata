The east-west boundary between the County and the Territory of Quebec crosses the area. The writer was engaged by the Quebec Bureau of Mines to map the geology of this area during the summer of 1939 and was in the field for about four months. During that time the shores of the principal lakes and rivers were examined and the intervening ground covered by means of pace and compass traverses. The land traverses were in general spaced at intervals of about half a mile, but certain areas thought to be practically devoid of outcrops were avoided, or covered only by widely-spaced traverses. Aeroplane photographs of the district were of considerable assistance in the organization of the work. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osborne, F.

The absence of rearranged products, and of saturated or cyclic hydrocarbons indicates unequivocally that the decomposition proceeds, not through free radical formation, but by expulsion of a proton, probably induced by preliminary hydrogen bonding, followed by rupture of the carbon-nitrogen bond.

The water and cement combine by the process of hydration, and this combination binds the aggregates together into a solid mass. The resulting product is hard, durable, strong in compression and shear, but very weak in tension and, when not reinforced, can be adapted for use only as relatively massive members to be subjected to compression. But in combination with steel rods properly placed to resist the tensile stresses, concrete can be used for all types of structures. In the construction of huge dams and buildings it has proved its permanence. The principal requirements - strength and durability - are the governing considerations in the design of mixtures. Since the discovery of concrete, different theories for its proportioning and various procedures for its control have been proposed, the purpose being to secure a high quality of concrete. Through years of investigation and practice, it has been found that the Water-Cement Ratio Law is the most applicable method for the mixing of concrete under ordinary conditions.

The maximum field strengths were in excess of 250 kV./cm. 3. Eighty-one lines were photographed in nickel, all of which were found to be undisplaced. 4. Thirty-five copper lines were photographed, of which 17 are displaced. The Stark effect increases fairly rapidly with increasing term number. 5. Several corrections are made to the observations of previous investigators in this field. 6. Displaced and undisplaced levels are classified for copper and displacements are predicted for lines not photographed. 7. Undisplaced levels for nickel are classified. The existance of a new odd 2P term for Cu is suggested. 9. Several lines in the copper arc spectrum are shown to be due to the small electric field existing in the arc. 10. It has been found that the intensity of the spectra obtained is a function of the diameter of the cathode dark space, and, in order to bring out important lines in copper, nickel and silver a cathode diameter of 3 mm. was required.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

The lack of unanimity of opinion concerning the use of vaocines for active immunity and sera for passive immunity has led to a general apathy in regard to any attempt to conduct a systematic campaign toward the conquest of this disease. The very high mortality rate from whooping cough in the ranks of the infant and pre-school child makes this disease one of major importance from the standpoint of public health.

Thwing (1) attempted to measure the entire range of binary mixtures of acetic acid in water but encountered considerable difficulty in making oapacitance measurement because of the conductance effect. Mixtures containing less than 30% acetic acid gave the most uncertain results. These dielectric constants were measured by the bridge method whioh is suitable for conductive materials. Dielectric constants of aqueous solutions of various electrolytes have been determined largely by the resonance and the Furth (2) ellipsoid methods. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hatcher, W.

Since then, suggestibility has been studied by workers in various fields: abnormal psychology, social psychology, sociology and individual differences. The exponents of the Nancy theory of hypnosis, who consider that the hypnotic trance is a "state of heightened suggestibility," of course studied suggestibility as an abnormal phenomenon. Murphy and Murphy (231, p.5) writing as social psychologists consider that the experimental study of suggestion marked the beginning of experimental social psychology. Various sociologists treat "mob suggestion," propaganda, and similar phenomena as illustrating the social aspects of suggestion. And those who take their cue from Alfred Binet in this field, treat suggestibility as a problem in individual differences. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tait, W.

Denken wir uns seinen Lebenslauf plastisch wie den Umriss der von Meyer so geliebten Alpengipfel, so steht der junge Conrad als vielversprechendes, lebhaftes Kind zuerst auf einer anscheinend sanft ansteigenden Hochflaeche. Ploetzlich befindet er sich aber, im siebten Lebensjabre am Rande eines erst langsam dann staerker abfallenden Abhanges. Im 20. Jahre sehen wir den jungen Menschen auf einem weiteren stark abschuessigen Wag, um sich zwischen dam 27. und 31. Jahre 1n einer tiefen, dunklen Kluft zu befinden. Dann hebt ein muehevoller,steiler Aufstieg an, der ihn im 40. Lebensjahre auf die anfaengliche Normalhoehe bringt. Er setzt seinen Anstieg aber weiter fort und erreicht tm 60. Lebensjabr e1nen blendenden Gipfel; dann tolgt aber wieder ein bedenklicher Abstieg, der bald in einem grausigen Abgrund endet.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beck, J.
