Despite efforts to Canadianize our broadcasting system, however, Canadians are watching more and more American television and have more choice of American programming. This has led to a fear of American television as a threat to Canada's continuance as a separate and independent country. By studying the contemporary Canadian context with respect to Canadian drama, the following questions will be addressed: Are Canadian interests dependent on communication policy? Is Canadian dramatic programming essential to the maintenance and enhancement of national identity and cultural sovereignty? Can the illusive quality "Canadian" be defined? Do television dramas made in Canada have distinctively Canadian characteristics and if so, how are these characteristics perceived by audiences? What are the options and alternatives that Canadian policy makers and programmers must face in the midst of the massive internationalization of culture and the onset of the 500 channel universe? In answering these questions, this study sets out to demonstrate how Canadian dramatic programming can be distinctive and unique in a way which still maintains an audience loyalty and a relevance to the Canadian way of life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levin, Charles (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm30v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gz13d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Television broadcasting -- Social aspects -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>National characteristics, Canadian</dc:subject><dc:subject>Television broadcasting -- Canada -- Influence</dc:subject><dc:subject>Television programs -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Television programs -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580p58k"><dcterms:title>Occupationism : occupational discrimination in relation to funeral directors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Akçali, F.

The relationships between capacitance versus voltage, capacitance against frequency were first investigated. A dispersion effect of the capacitance-voltage curves was observed, confirming the presence of either interface states or deep levels in the depletion region. The minority carrier diffusion length was measured by two different methods, namely the photocurrent and capacitance method and the differential photocurrent method. For a cell with an efficiency of about 5% with a doping concentration in the order $10 sp{16}$ cm$ sp{-3}$ in the CuInSe$ sb2$ substrate, the electron diffusion length was in the range from 0.3 to 0.9 $ mu$m. This value is relatively small as compared with that for monocrystalline CuInSe$ sb2$ devices due to the presence of interface states and deep levels in the thin film cells. However, the value is comparable to that observed on vacuum deposited CuInSe$ sb2$ thin film cells. Optical absorption coefficient $ alpha$ for the CuInSe$ sb2$ film was deduced using the differential photocurrent method. The results are comparable to those on the electrodeposited CuInSe$ sb2$ thin films reported in the literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, I.

Membrane distillation is a thermally driven process in which a hydrophobic microporous membrane separates a hot or warm saline solution from a cold desalinated one. Water, in the form of vapour, migrates from the hot solution to the cold one. Two different hollow fibre membrane distillation modules were used to conduct experiments. Tests were performed to determine the sensitivity of permeate flux and quality to stream temperatures and flowrates, and feed concentration. The hot side temperature was found to have a greater effect on the water flux than the cold side temperature. Water flux values ranged from 0.5 to 1.6 Kg/m$ sp2$hr with salt removals of over 99.99%.

The process consisted of vaporizing quartz particles in a batch transferred arc reactor using the radiative energy from an Ar/NH$ sb3$ thermal plasma. Ammonia was used to increase the vaporization rate of quartz. The hot gas stream exiting the reactor contained a mixture of the decomposition products of NH$ sb3$ and SiO$ sb2$. This included SiO$ sb{ rm (g)}$, O$ sb2$, H$ sb2$ and N$ sb2$. Rapid quenching of this gas stream with steam resulted in the production of a fumed silica aerosol. Collection of the product took place in a baghouse filter. The quench conditions studied included pre-quench temperature, T$ sb{ rm q}$, and supersaturation, P$ sb{ rm s}$, quench rate, R$ sb{ rm q}$, and quench stoichiometry, S$ sb{ rm q}$. P$ sb{ rm s}$ was defined as the molar ratio of SiO$ sb{ rm (g)}$ flow, calculated from the quartz weight loss during an experiment, to the SiO$ sb{ rm (g)}$ flow predicted at equilibrium. S$ sb{ rm q}$ was the molar ratio of steam to SiO$ sb{ rm (g)}$ flow. In general, high pre-quench temperatures, high quench rates, and low pre-quench supersaturation ratios, produced high surface area powders. Quench stoichiometry did not have an effect here, but the use of a large excess of steam in the quench caused the degree of surface hydroxylation to be high. In all cases, the characteristic chain-like aggregate shape and an amorphous morphology were produced. The thickening and thixotropic ability of the powders was found to be significant compared to commercial brands of fumed silica. The best fumed silica produced during the study was found to be 46% as effective as Aerosil$ sp circler$ 200 and 60% as effective as Cab-O-Sil$ sp circler$ M-5. The experimentally generated powders were not equivalent to the commercial brands due to a lack of surface area. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Munz, R. J.

The rhetoric of transparency is initially scrutinized through a story that elaborates, in audacious generalizations, on the totalitarianism that comes out of the atheist rationalism of the Enlightenment. These generalizations are probed specifically in a look at the role of glass architecture and the consequent suppression of the body to a belief in an all-powerful reason. The inquiry then switches to the operation of the destabilizing effect of a space that devours with its reflections and spatial ambiguities. As absolute transparency is defied by experience in the material world, the space of glass is investigated as an instrument for dissolving the identity of controlling institutions. From the subversive character of reflections, the final look is at the possible emergence of a new attitude and thinking inspired by that experience which does not serve ideological certitudes, but contradicts them.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k63p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010s20q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Glass construction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x591v"><dcterms:title>Les contrats d'exportation d'électricité Québec - USA</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Labbé, Jean-François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hydro-Quebec's electricity exports greatly affect our economy and our environment. They may be concluded either under "interconnection agreements" to sell excess capacity and production during off-peak periods, or completed under "firm sales" contracts. Hydro-Quebec exports could thereby replace production plants that are needed and difficult to build south of the border. Economics and regulation of the American industry have led to the writing of too much rigidity into the clauses. There are long term, responsibility, major force and other clauses that prevent the contracts from adapting to the changing competitive market conditions. Utilities involved in such international sales would be well advised to adopt standard formats, preferably of medium term duration. In this way, Hydro-Quebec will ensure itself of becoming a specialized supplier of electricity to the United States and thereby take advantage of its low production costs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, A.

A critical "rewinding" of the diverse and seemingly contradictory suprematist periods--starting with the artist's chef d'oeuvre, his Funeral-Performance and moving backwards to the figurative works, the Architectons and then, to the 1913 Black Square, in its beginnings in futurist Zaum poetry--makes patent the fragmentary nature of the meaning of those periods and introduces Suprematism-as-Architecture as the meaning of Suprematism in its entirety. Malevich's extensive written work is the guiding thread we follow in trying to demonstrate how the full meaning of Suprematism echoes, in the context of our Nietzschean world, Martin Heidegger's presentation of questions concerning building.

In this study the aforementioned tasks for the three degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator are described in detail and their conclusions are used for the construction of the manipulator. Finally a motor speed/control system for the control of the selected motors, to form a complete microprocessor-controlled DC motor servopositioning system, is designed.

An experimental paradigm was developed to determine if, and to what extent, disadvantaged group members perceive the discrimination that confronts them. Women were asked to react to negative feedback after receiving information about the probability that they had been discriminated against. When discrimination was made ambiguous, subjects minimized their personal experience with discrimination and attributed their failure to themselves. A second experiment investigated the role of perceived control as a potential cause of minimization of personal discrimination. The results indicated that disadvantaged group members were reluctant to blame their performance on discrimination because in so doing, they were placing control for their outcomes in the hands of others rather than themselves. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the on-going victimization of disadvantaged group members.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taylor, Donald M.

"Desaturaters" (N = 13) if oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO$ sb2$%), as determined by finger oxymetry, fell below 91% or "non-desaturaters" if SaO$ sb2$% remained above 91%.

Among the major Post-Impressionist artists, Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) alone has been viewed as untouched by this influence, largely because of the strong three-dimensional quality of his art. This study provides a reassessment of the issue of Cezanne and "Japonisme" by concentrating on the flat, two-dimensional aspect of his art. The development of Cezanne's conceptualized and schematized treatment of the Mont Sainte-Victoire theme is considered both formally and iconographically in relation to the image of Mt. Fuji by the influential Japanese printmaker, Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). Illustrating that Cezanne's path toward Modernism in painting may have been influenced by the Japanese print, and particularly the art of Hokusai, this study leads to a more profound understanding of Cezanne's development and the ideographic language of his images of Mont Sainte-Victoire.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kiefer, Carol Solomon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064782p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv67m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cézanne, Paul, 1839-1906.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Katsushika, Hokusai, 1760-1849</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hh661"><dcterms:title>The concept of the imamate in the works of al-Māwardī</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nafis, Muhammad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with al-Mawardi's concept of the imamate as expounded not only in al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah, but also in his other political treatises which are related to the subject.

During the given period (1641-1699) the empire was ruled successively by four female rulers. The thesis deals with the political and economic developments in this period. Aceh was an Islamic empire in the Indonesian archipelago which emerged as the greatest and most influential Islamic power in the region from the middle of the sixteenth century to the early seventeenth century. It reached its golden age during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda (1607-1636) who succeeded in developing the empire into an unrivaled Muslim power whose control included the West Sumatran coast and the Malay peninsula. During his reign, Aceh became the holder of the political and economic hegemony in the region. Towards the second half of the seventeenth century, the power of Aceh gradually declined from its peak both internally and externally. Internally, political disintegration paved the way for the process of power transition between political groups within the empire. Externally, both the political importance and the economic supremacy of the empire in the region was drastically reduced. Consequently, its power again shrank back into the north-Sumatran area from which the empire originally emerged.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, A.

Further, in curved mold continuous casting, transverse cracking occurs during the unbending procedure to straighten the solidified curved strand, and this can also strongly depend on the austenite-to-ferrite transformation. In both of these industrial processes, during deformation, the temperature usually decreases continuously. Thus, two new methods to determine the Ar$ sb3$, based on continuous cooling compression (CCC) and continuous cooling torsion (CCT), have been developed. While the latter is applicable for low and high strains, the former can be only used for low strains. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of deformation in the single phase austenite and two phase austenite plus ferrite region on the transformation and dynamic transformation behaviour of austenite-to-ferrite. CCC tests were carried out on a low carbon steel and the influence of strain, strain rate, cooling rate and austenite grain size, was examined. During the application of strain, the generated dislocations cause an increase in stored strain energy. This energy adds to the driving force for austenite-to-ferrite transformation, increasing the kinetics of this transformation, raising the Ar$ sb3$ in this way. The faster kinetics leads to a finer polygonal ferrite grain size after transformation. In contrast to the effect of increasing strain, accelerated cooling rates decrease the transformation start temperature, but can still lead to grain refinement via high nucleation rates. By increasing the cooling rate, fine acicular ferrite with a high aspect ratio could be obtained. Since, the ferrite grain size is directly related to austenite grain size, by varying austenite grain size, a wide range of ferrite grain sizes could be obtained. Finally, deforming close to the Ar$ sb3$ maximizes the strain effect on dynamically transformed ferrite.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yue, S.

Perhaps this bears witness to the growing appreciation of the pivotal role that language plays in our formation as individual persons, as peoples and as cultures. As a particular kind of speech, liturgical language takes seriously the multi-dimensional nature of human reality, and, among other things, addresses itself to the profound questions of meaning posed by the human condition, as well as the 'needs' that arise in the posing of these questions. Further, as a rich communicative complex, liturgical language is itself multi-dimensional and multi-valent. This study is undertaken to investigate the meaning of this kind of language. To do this, the analytical 'lenses' of Ritual, Performative Language Theory, and Metaphor will be employed and discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McLelland, Joseph (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dr61h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b088z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Meaning (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liturgical language</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw95052408"><dcterms:title>Learned helplessness in gifted, gifted underachieving, and unselected children</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Corber-Wiltzer, Cheryl Lisa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Simulated learned helpless behavior was examined among gifted, gifted underachievers, and unselected children. Using the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility (IAR) Scale (Crandall, Katkovsky, &amp; Crandall, 1965), after the children read a brief story and cast themselves in a failing role, the three groups of children were compared before and after the intervention (a week or two after the initial testing) on their positive and negative IAR scores. Learned helplessness theory would predict that helpless children would have high negative scores (attributing failure to themselves) and low positive scores (attributing success to external factors). Negative IAR scores did not differ or change across trials. Positive IAR scores for both gifted groups declined considerably over trials. The unselected group's positive IAR scores differed from those of both groups of gifted children in that they declined but not as drastically at posttest. All three groups' positive scores decreased to varying degrees across trials, indicating that nobody took personal responsibility for success after imagining themselves as a failure. In this respect, one aspect of learned helpless behavior was elicited. The results suggest that gifted children are capable of showing behavior which might indicate learned helplessness.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shore, Bruce M.

As majority children grow older, their tolerance for children of other races increases, in part, because of changes in cognitive level. The study investigated the pattern of development of attitudes associated with cognitive maturity among a group of black children. Measures of racial attitudes and preferences were related to cognitive maturity as assessed by measures of conservation but were not related to the racial constancy task. The attainment of more mature racial cognitions did not lead to the expected changes in attitudes and preference. This would suggest that the relationship between racial bias and racial identity constancy was more complex than had been hypothesized.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pedersen, Eigil (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k7155.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b8094</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children, Black -- Attitudes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gg00d"><dcterms:title>The educational thought of Al-Ghazālī : theory and practice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Asari, Hasan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis tries to bring together al-Ghazali's thoughts about different aspects of education, scattered in numbers of works of different kinds and aims at presenting his educational theory in its complete picture.

The theoretical aspect of his educational thought consists of a psychology that focuses on a series of mental operations by which man attains knowledge. Being a Sufi, al-Ghazali holds that knowledge can be attained through either sensual-rational or purely spiritual ways, believing the latter to be the source of true knowledge. Consequently, in his classification, he places spiritual sciences over the rest of the sciences. The practical aspect of his thought concerning education centers on the duties of student and teacher which must be fulfilled to ensure the success of the learning process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Little, D.

In the same way as the United States have tried to apply antitrust laws to Europe, the EC now wishes to apply this kind of legislation to companies outside the EC, using the criteria of jurisdictional competence in conformity with public international law. Three successive theories have been put forward: The "Effect theory" which has been much debated on its concordance with international law. The theory of "Enterprise Unity" has the desadvantaye that it cannot be applied to all foreign undertakings. Finally, the Commission and the Court of Justice have recently relied on the theory of the "Location of Anticompetitive Conduct". This last theory stands as a compromise between the first two and has broader potential application. As the competence of jurisdiction, the "enforcement jurisdiction over foreign undertakings is governed by international principles and is also constrained by blocking statutes. Nevertheless, the EC Commission knows how to make the most of its enforcement powers and most of the time, foreign companies submit to its decisions because the jurisdictional competence is well established. International cooperation is developing progressively through formal and informal agreements but the diplomatic way to resolve international litigation remains predominant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mestral, Armand Ile (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x93h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw499</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687k23z"><dcterms:title>On Mohawk word order</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chamorro, Adriana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the influence of definiteness and movement on Mohawk free word order from the perspective of Government and Binding Theory. On the one hand, Mohawk data show that the relative order of NP's with respect to the verb does not determine definiteness and that the particle ne is not a definite determiner, the language lacking this type of "pure" marker for this feature, all of which contradicts previous claims. It is argued that pragmatic considerations will determine the interpretation of nominals. On the other hand, the evidence shows that there is no movement operation in the production of free word order in Mohawk, unlike in other scrambling languages. The evidence is accounted for by the fact that NP's are base generated in adjunct position (Baker 1991a) and coindexed with pro's in argument position which are licensed by the rich agreement morphology on the verb.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baker, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nk178.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687k23z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mohawk language -- Word order.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mohawk language -- Definiteness.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Word order.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62fb41g"><dcterms:title>Autonomy, self-creation, and the woman artist figure in Woolf, Lessing, and Atwood</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sharpe, Martha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis traces the self-creation and autonomy of the woman artist figure in Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook, and Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye. The first chapter conveys the progression of autonomy and self-creation in Western-European philosophy through contemporary thinkers such as Charles Taylor, Robert Pippin, Alexander Nehamas, and Richard Rorty. This narrative culminates in a rift between public and private, resulting from the push--especially by Nietzsche--toward a radical, unmediated independence. Taylor and Rorty envision different ways to resolve the public/private rift, yet neither philosopher distinguishes how this rift has affected women by enclosing them in the private, barring them from the public, and delimiting their autonomy. The second chapter focusses on each woman artist's resistance to socially scripted roles, accompanied by theories about resistance: Woolf with Rachel Blau DuPlessis on narrative resistance, Lessing with Julia Kristeva on dissidence, and Atwood with Stephen Hawking and Kristeva on space-time. The third chapter contrasts the narratives of chapters 1 and 2 and reveals how the woman artist avoids the problematic public/private rift by incorporating the ethics developed within the private into her art; she balances her creative goals with responsibility to others. Drawing on the work of women moral theorists, this thesis suggests that women's self-creation and autonomy result in an undervalued but nevertheless workable solution to the public/private rift.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.
