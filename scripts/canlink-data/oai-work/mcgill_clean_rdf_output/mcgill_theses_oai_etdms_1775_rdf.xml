Very little is known about the strategies that patients with CVA employ to prevent falls during unexpected changes of a support surface while patients are standing and walking. Previous studies showed that light touch increases postural stability in healthy subjects. However, it is not known whether patients with CVA would benefit from light touch in the same way as the healthy subjects do. Three studies in this research were conducted to examine the impact of stroke on postural responses triggered by surface rotations (Triggered Postural Responses; TPRs) during standing and walking and to investigate the effect of light touch on the control of TPRs during both tasks. Pitch and roll surface rotations (amplitude:5o; peak velocity:32o/s) were randomly presented to 11 stroke and 8 healthy age-matched subjects during quiet stance and walking, with similar limb geometry in double limb support. Light touch (&lt;4N) was provided by a load sensor strip mounted on a rail along the walkway. Body kinematics was captured at 120 Hz by a 6-camera Vicon 512 system. Ground reaction forces were acquired at 1080Hz by 2 AMTI force plates. Surface EMGs were recorded at 1080 Hz from 4 bilateral lower limb muscles. Results showed that TPRs in healthy subjects were functionally appropriate to the direction of perturbations and task demands, such that TPRs were tuned down during walking, as compared to standing, suggesting that postural requirements are less during walking. In contrast, CVA disrupts equilibrium control such that TPRs in the stroke subjects were delayed and not modulated as the perturbed directions and task demands changed, possibly due to problems in sensorimotor integration. Asymmetry was characterized by under-activated muscle responses and force generations of the paretic side and hyperactivity of the non-paretic upper and lower extremities. These impairments led to instability of the trunk and center of
pressure, especially in the frontal plane. Light touch increased postural
stability in both subjects but its effect was more dominant in the stroke
subjects, suggesting that light touch is a potential tool for balance
rehabilitation. </dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Les lésions du système nerveux central suite à un accident vasculaire cérébral (AVC) affectent fréquemment l'équilibre et la mobilité. Peu d'information est disponible sur les stratégies utilisées par les patients ayant survécu à un AVC pour prévenir les chutes lorsque des changements inattendus de la surface de support se produisent pendant la marche et la position debout. Des études ont établi que des sujets sains voient leur stabilité posturale améliorée avec l'ajout d'information tactile. Cependant, il n'a pas été démontré si les sujets ayant eu un AVC peuvent aussi bénéficier de ces informations tactiles. Cette recherche inclut trois études visant à examiner, en premier lieu, l'impact d'un AVC sur les ajustements posturaux réactifs (APR) déclenchés par des rotations de la surface de support et, en deuxième lieu, l'effet des informations tactiles sur le contrôle de ces APR pendant deux tâches, soit la marche et la position debout. Onze sujets ayant eu un AVC et huit sujets sains, appariés pour le genre et l'âge, ont participé à ces études. Des rotations de la surface de support dans les plans sagittal et frontal (amplitude: 5°; vélocité maximale: 32°/s) étaient présentées aléatoirement aux sujets lors de la marche (phase de double appui) et en position debout (position des membres inférieurs simulant la phase de double appui). Le toucher léger (&lt; 4N) d'une rampe fournissait l'information tactile aux sujets. Un système à six caméras d'analyse tridimensionnelle du mouvement (Vicon 512 system) a été utilisé pour acquérir les données cinématiques du corps à une fréquence de 120 Hz. L'électromyographie de surface de quatre muscles du membre inférieur a été enregistrée bilatéralement à une fréquence de 1080 Hz. Les forces de réaction du sol ont été acquises par deux plate-formes de force (AMTI) à la même fréquence. Les sujets sains ont présenté des APR fonctionnels et modulés par la direction de la perturbation et les exigences de la tâche. Ainsi, les APR étaient diminués pendant la marche comparativement à la position debout, ce
qui suggère que les exigences posturales sont moindres pendant la marche.
Au contraire, la perturbation du contrôle de l’équilibre et de l’intégration
sensori-motrice chez les sujets ayant eu un AVC entraîne un retard dans les
APR de même qu’une absence de modulation selon la tâche et la direction de
la rotation de la surface. Les membres inférieur et supérieur du côté parétique
ont montré une sous-activation des réponses musculaires et une diminution
de force, alors qu’une sur-activation musculaire et une augmentation de force
étaient présentes du côté non-parétique. Ces modifications ont entraîné une
instabilité du tronc et du centre de pression et ce, surtout dans le plan frontal.
L’utilisation d’informations tactiles a amélioré la stabilité posturale chez les
sujets ayant survécu à un AVC et, dans une moindre mesure, chez les sujets
sains, ce qui suggère une utilité potentielle de cette technique pour la
réadaptation de l’équilibre. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joyce Fung (supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj39g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q76b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Rehabilitation and Therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d635s"><dcterms:title>British policy in the Italo-Turkish war</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1948</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>O’Neill, T.

The intentions of private enterprise to construct and operate satellite systems capable of providing service literally anywhere in the world has created a somewhat adverse political environment internationally, not to mention a supporting regulatory and legal structure completely devoid of definition. The present manuscript focuses to examine and discuss both the regulatory and legal issues surrounding GMPCS and their evolution towards globally accepted standards and protocols for the effective regulation and technical standardization of the GMPCS industry. Through identification and discussion of the principal regulatory issues, including concerns voiced by national telecommunications administrations, we can begin to seek solutions which will satisfy the diverse global nature of these proposed operations. By further examining pre-existing commitments of nations to liberalize telecommunications markets under the GATS and WTO, we go on to examine the interests of nations to accommodate and/or reject the global nature of GMPCS inclusive of the financial and social impact which the systems promise to impose.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng843.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227ms01h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mx58w"><dcterms:title>Cultural standardisation : a byproduct of European integration?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Murray, Siobáin Jane.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The process of European integration has had an impact on the cultural patterns of the Member States but it is not inevitably eroding national identities. By analysing the way in which the ability of the Member States to pursue a national language policy is restricted by the free movement principles and by analysing the cultural action taken at the supranational level it is argued that the European Community is genuinely committed to protecting and maintaining its cultural diversity. However, the political sensitivity which surrounds any impingement of national cultural sovereignty coupled with the fact that the objective of European integration remains primarily economic has significantly restricted the European Community's room to manoeuvre in the cultural sphere. A re-ordering of Community values and priorities would prevent non-economic interests, such as cultural interests, from being consistently trumped by those which are of an economic nature. In the meantime, the European Community must expressly and unequivocally state its commitment to cultural diversity, for example, in a Community Cultural Charter. Further, it is asserted that tangible cultural homogeneity is not required in the development of the overarching European identity necessary to legitimise the future construction of Europe.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webber, Jeremy (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795980v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx58w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg90g"><dcterms:title>Legal and ethical considerations of alternative health care delivery systems in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Muirhead, Paul.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The focus of health care reform is to contribute to better patient health and maintain an equitable access to the system while at the same time achieving a more effective and efficient use of increasingly scarce health care dollars. Due to budgetary and other restraints provincial governments are either spending less on health care or are looking to change the delivery and management of the health industry. How the Canadian health care system responds to the challenges depends upon the interpretation of a number of factors. Three basic factors which are linked to any health care delivery system are financing, delivery and allocation of resources with the altering of one of these components affecting the others. Has there developed a right to health care and if so, would this foreclose a curtailment of health care services? If there is no right to health care, can the courts or the Charter of Rights and Freedoms be used to protect the existing system? Is it possible for public interest groups, or others, to utilize judicial intervention to force a government, either at the provincial or federal level, to spend more on health care or change their health care policy? What if a patient is affected by decision affecting health care delivery, does this bring in civil liability? This thesis will review these areas in an effort to understand, articulate and ascribe values to Canada's health care system and provide a legal and ethical analysis of alternative health care delivery systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, H.

From a global perspective, the penetration of telephone lines in Colombia is quite poor; there are only seventeen lines for every one hundred people. In this thesis, access to telecommunications from a structural viewpoint is examined. According to social, economic, and historic factors, the approach to universal service in rural areas must differ from that of urban centers. While stronger government intervention is required in the Colombian countryside, the same rigid universal service regulation is not necessary in the main urban areas. This assumption is supported on two main arguments. Firstly, universal service regulation might protect self-serving interests while constraining the market from increasing the number of users. Secondly, the starting point of the rigid cross-subsidization structure is the economic capability of customers. This policy restricts greater penetration because it fails to consider people's communication interests and needs as the core objective of the telecommunications policy. Under a different approach, telecom operators might be able to accomplish successful market segmentation according to the particular needs of different regions and communities. Efficient market segmentation would acknowledge the low-income customer's potential in the market place, while at the same time encouraging innovation by operators. Thus, affordability and profitability would not oppose each other. This thesis considers three different zones in the Colombian territory, showing that the Communications Fund's investment should be used in regions with greater levels of violence, poverty and migration. In addition, we propose that a universal access policy should be applied in order to shrink the already large gap between rich and poor people in the heterogeneous Colombian society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52jb086.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm30p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247dv27j"><dcterms:title>Resolution of antidumping and countervailing duty disputes in North America : the recent Mexican experience</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martínez, Juan Pablo, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>For a developing country, such as Mexico, switching from a centralized economy to a market economy implied a political and cultural transformation that may only be compared to the encounter of two cultures occurred more than five centuries ago, when the Spanish colonizers arrived to "New Spain". From a legal point of view, Mexico's signature of the North American Free Trade Agreement represents the deepest encounter of that country with representatives of the Common Law. Within this context, the differences between the two legal backgrounds can be specially perceived in the procedural features of the NAFTA. At a first glance, some of these differences in legal culture may be exacerbated to the point where an authentic middle ground might be impossible to find. However, a more detailed analysis of Mexico's institutions reveals that even those most complex features of Mexican law are compatible with the free trade movement if the interpreter decides to be compatible with the reality he lives in. This thesis contains a detailed explanation of the path Mexico followed when modifying its industrial and commercial policy, as well as a description of the procedure contained in the NAFTA for solving disputes on antidumping and countervailing duties.

The case study considers a set of sexual harassment cases decided in the "mainstream" unfair dismissal jurisdiction. As a site of women's overt presence in the labour market, these cases are disruptive to settled constructions of "the worker", particularly because they connect the sexuality of women (and their gender) to their status as worker. In so doing, they suggest the possibility of a "womanworker"---a woman who is simultaneously woman and worker. The thesis concludes by exploring the consequences of this possibility and asks how the recognition of women's experiences, needs and specificities can allow the subject of labour law to be reconstructed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Colleen (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j758c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g232j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sociology, Industrial and Labor Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women's Studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bk304"><dcterms:title>Conflict of laws in aircraft securitisation : jurisdictional and material aspects of the 1998 Unidroit Reform Project relating to aircraft equipment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Krupski, Jan A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In June 1998, a Steering and Revisions Committee of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit) fleshed out the final version of a "Draft Unidroit Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment".

These parts constitute a safety risk to the aviation industry and also have a negative economic effect on the industry. This thesis attempts to outline a complete set of legal solutions to contribute to the control and eradication of the problem of unapproved aircraft parts. Prior to a more detailed specifically legal study, a background to the problem is given, concentrating on the various sources and classifications of unapproved parts. The main elements of an anti-unapproved parts legal regime are then proposed, which would ideally be prescribed at international level to states for inclusion in their national legal regimes, and the extent to which current international law reflects the proposed regime is examined. Subsequently, a possible national anti-unapproved parts legal regime is proposed, drawing on the regulatory experience of the United States of America and Canada in dealing with this problem. Next, in addition to subject-specific regulation at national level, wider criminal law is also an effective tool in combating unapproved parts and the various possible criminal violations in unapproved parts scenarios are looked at. Finally, national private law is a further legal means both to combat unapproved parts and to control the effects of these parts, such as they do exist. Accordingly, private law remedies for unapproved parts will be examined, using the hypothetical example of an aircraft accident caused by unapproved parts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.

This Thesis also describes the agreements' specific provisions that translate the achieved compromises and tries to show the tensions resulting from the difficulties to reconcile the cultural and economic objectives of nations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, Armand (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m23t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm31z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v8382649"><dcterms:title>The air transport relations between the European Union and the United States /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Holderbach, Hans.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Air Transport relations between the European Union and the United States were nonexistent until the European Commission obtained in 1996 from the member states a limited mandate to negotiate an air transport agreement with the US. For the Commission, the achievement of an EU internal market with full competition among European airlines under equal conditions is impeded by individual member states' bilateral relations with the US. It requested a complete mandate to replace the multitude of bilaterals with a Community wide agreement. Member states fear that Community negotiations will not reflect the different needs of their national airlines. They believe that their interests are best met through individual bilateral agreements and refused the Commission the right to negotiate the commercially important market access rights: routes, capacity and frequency. Even though the US is willing to consider an agreement with the EU it still pursues bilateral liberalisation through Open Skies agreements as they are more advantageous to its interests. For EU and US airlines an agreement on the EU - US level is not a priority as their needs are being met through their strategic codesharing alliances. This thesis studies the legal rules affecting the EU - US relations and analyses to what extent these rules are shaped by political and economic interests. Special attention is paid to the convergence and divergence of the parties' legal regimes and policies, and to the prospects for an agreement on the essential issues of a complete bilateral agreement between the US and the EU.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Van Fenema, Peter (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xb650.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v8382649</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jd446"><dcterms:title>The impact of EC law and WTO law on domestic law : a critical analysis of the case law of the European Court of Justice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hagelüken, Alexandra.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The relationship between, on the one hand, European Community Law and World Trade Organization Law and, on the other hand, domestic law lies at the heart of this thesis The European Treaty and the World Trade Organization Agreements have far reaching impacts not only on their Member States, but also on individuals. It is of crucial importance for the protection of individual rights and for the effective enforcement of these treaties whether individuals can invoke them before their national courts. After giving an overview of the general theories, which exist in international law with respect to the impact of international treaties on domestic law, this thesis analyzes the case law of the European Court of Justice regarding the impact of EC Law on domestic law and the impact of GATT 1947/WTO Law on the European Community. A review of this case law will demonstrate that the European Court has effectively promoted European integration by the doctrines of direct applicability, direct effect and supremacy. In contrast, the European Court has so far denied that individuals or Member States can challenge the validity of EC Law by invoking provisions of the GATT 1947. It is not clear whether the Court will change its attitude with respect to the WTO Agreements. This thesis will demonstrate that the general denial of direct effect to GATT/WTO Law is not based on legal reasons. With respect to the European Community, individuals must be allowed to rely at least on some of the provisions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, Armand (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k933x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jd446</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff3657365"><dcterms:title>Aviation insurance</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Góngora, Luis Jorge.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the subject of aviation insurance from the broad international market perspective, mainly covered by London, and the structure, content and interpretation of typical aviation insurance policies An historical background is provided to give an overview on the matter.

Chapter One will first consider the historical development of statutes of repose and the arguments for and against their use in products liability actions. Chapter One will then review the legislative history of the "General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994" ("GARA") and identify the factors proffered for enacting a national statute of repose for the benefit of general aviation manufacturers. The remainder of this paper is intended to serve as a practitioner's guide by compiling and analyzing the various statutes of repose and the significant reported case law involving general aviation aircraft. Chapter Two will analyze the provisions of GARA and its related case law. Chapter Three will consist of an analysis of the individual state statutes of repose and their reported general aviation cases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b1001.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v7671</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612q77m"><dcterms:title>Developing a dispute settlement system for the free trade area of the Americas : a comparison of some aspects of the dispute settlement mechanisms of the GATTWTO and certain regional and bilateral dispute settlement systems of the western hemisphere</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Filippidis, Mariel Solange.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Within the context of the current negotiations over the Free Trade Area of the Americas, there is an unquestionable need to create a system to resolve disputes that may arise between the state parties.

The study commences with a discussion of the importance of competition regulation in the domestic policies of states and the impact that globalization has had on competition regulation. It then proceeds to analyse the various approaches to the regulation of international competition. Reference is made to the development, benefits and drawbacks of the existing methods of unilateral and bilateral regulation and suggestions are made regarding the further elaboration of these methods. A major part of the discussion deals with plurilateral and multilateral competition regulation, analysing the effectiveness of existing regulatory mechanisms and considering a number of recent proposals relating to multilateral regulation. Particular attention is given to the potential role of the WTO in this regard. In conclusion, suggestions are made regarding possible future developments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De Mestral, A.

They fear that even partial decriminalisation, which would allow voluntary active euthanasia in very few circumstances, will lead to such great abuses that States should not amend the law to create a medical exception to the Criminal Codes, to this effect. A majority of judges are in favour of the criminal sanctions, but not of the recognition of the patient's rights and the implementation of control measures in order to prevent abuses. This fear of abuses seems to us to be the greatest obstacle to the expression of popular opinion, which is in its great majority, favourable to voluntary active euthanasia. The author try to discuss this legitimate concern of the States and Courts, in an objective light. Lastly, the author try to define to what extent and under what vehicle a State intervention in this matter could be carried out without affecting the right of the other persons opposed to voluntary active euthanasia and which could assure also the implementation of effective controls against abuses.

For many countries, patent disputes touch on public policy, which in turn, often interfere and sometimes deny the arbitrability of such disputes. There is no legal obstacle to arbitration. The controversy lies rather in the arbitral tribunal's power to challenge the validity of registered rights. In all cases, the state ensures that all granted rights fulfil the legal criteria. Therefore, it may decide to give exclusive rights to its jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute challenging the validity of a patent. This paper suggests doing a comparative study of American, French, Belgian and Canadian legal systems by exposing the legal and theoretical debate between case law and doctrine related to Intellectual Property disputes. More importantly, it will outline the legislative body's response to the debate and how it meets court and doctrine expectations. Only a few countries have enacted laws dealing specifically with the arbitrability of patent disputes. In addition, these laws have been shown to be either too restrictive in nature, or simply too liberal. This study will also dispute why most states do not have legislation dealing with this arbitrability issue and why it seems so difficult to find an equitable solution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brierley, John E.

The adoption of such regularization measures rests on the belief that granting squatters legal title to the land they occupy, and thus providing them with security of tenure, will create an incentive for squatters to invest in their dwellings and in their community, and will facilitate access to credit. This thesis critically examines these assumptions, bringing to bear on this reflection the results of a survey conducted in two squatter settlements in Trinidad. In so doing. it explores the role of law in development and, further, it questions the capacity of law to guide and modify social behaviour.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, Jane Matthews (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956j03x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032509c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sociology, Social Structure and Development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Urban and Regional Planning.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569651d"><dcterms:title>ICAO and the use of force against civil aerial intruders</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Augustin, John V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There have been many cases of intrusion of civil aircraft into the airspace of foreign States. On occasion, the subjacent State has reacted by using force against such aircraft, sometimes with fatal consequences. Customary international law admits the use of force only in exceptional circumstances. As the United Nations specialized agency responsible for international civil aviation, ICAO has conducted fact-finding investigations into a number of cases of aerial shootdowns and adopted resolutions and taken decisions in this connection. Such resolutions and decisions have clearly been influenced by political factors. The Organization has also taken specific legal and technical steps aimed at reducing the dangers to civil aircraft and their occupants arising out of an intrusion. In the legal field, its principal achievement has been the adoption in 1984 of an amendment (Article 3 bis) to the Chicago Convention which is, however, not free of ambiguities and obscurities in meaning and which, despite numerous assertions to the contrary, does not reflect the exact scope of customary international law in this area. On the technical side, the Organization has successfully developed a number of detailed provisions in Annexes to the Convention which are universally respected and accepted by its Member States.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vlasil, I.
