In addition, the gene structures of these two  proteins are similar in functional organization. BLK and BIK activate apoptosis in  similar fashion in both human and mouse cell lines, dependent on the presence of a  functional BH3 domain and active caspases. BLK, like BIK, is very unstable and can  be stabilized by addition of pan caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. In contrast to BIK,  BLK is not upregulated by p53 at the RNA or protein level in several mouse cell line  systems. Furthermore, BLK localizes to the mitochondria, not to the endoplasmic  reticulum where BIK resides. To further investigate the localization of BLK and BIK,  the transmembrane domains of these proteins were swapped. BLKBIK and BIKBLK both  localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein fused to  the transmembrane domains of BLK and BIK also localized to the endoplasmic  reticulum. The mitochondrial localization of BLK despite its transmembrane domain  preference for the endoplasmic reticulum suggests that the N-terminal portion of BLK  plays a role in targeting. Collectively, these results argue that BLK is not the  functional mouse homolog of BIK.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shore, Gordon C.

Asthma is one such complex disease with multiple  determinants including putative genetic factors on regions of chromosome 12. This  thesis compares the evidence from a range of GMB models to an ASB analysis for  linkage between asthma and chromosome 12. Methods. Data from an asthma cohort of Saguenay Lac St-Jean  families was reanalysed using both GMB and ASB models. The range of GMB models was  constrained by epidemiologic estimates of asthma prevalence. The results from the  GMB analyses were compared with the results of an ASB method. The specific GMB and  ASB methods used were LOD-score with liability classes and 'Non parametric linkage'  (NPL), respectively. The analyses were performed using multipoint techniques in  Genehunter software.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joseph, Lawrence (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Greenwood, Celia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xx847.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795829p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn85m"><dcterms:title>Effects of plant sterols on plasma lipid profiles, glycemic control of hypercholesterolemic individuals with and without type 2 diabetes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lau, Vivian Wai Yan, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plant sterols (PS) are effective in reducing plasma lipid  concentrations, however, few studies have examined their cholesterol lowering  effects in type 2 diabetics. The objective was to assess whether PS consumption  alters blood lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic subjects with and without type 2  diabetes. Fifteen control subjects (age = 55.1 +/- 8.5 yr and BMI = 26.9 +/-  3.0kg/m2) and fourteen diabetic subjects (age = 54.5 +/- 6.7 yr and BMI = 30.2 +/-  3.0kg/m2) participated in a double-blinded, randomized, crossover,  placebo-controlled feeding trial. The Western diet included either 1.8g/d of PS or  cornstarch placebo each provided over 21 d separated by a 28 d washout period.  Subjects consumed only foods prepared in Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit  of McGill University. Total cholesterol (TC) decreased (p &lt; 0.05) from  baseline with PS for control and diabetic subjects by 9.7% and 13.6%, respectively.  TC decreased (P &lt; 0.05) from baseline with placebo for control and diabetic  subjects by 10.9% and 11.6%, respectively. Non high density lipoprotein cholesterol  (non-HDL-C) decreased (p &lt; 0.05) from baseline with PS for diabetic subjects  by 18.5%. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were reduced (p  &lt; 0.05) from baseline with PS for control and diabetic subjects by 14.9% and  29.8%, respectively. The reduction of LDL-C due to PS alone is greater with type 2  diabetics. There were no significant changes in HDL-C and TG across diets or  treatments. It is thus concluded that PS consumption with diet enhances non-HDL-C  and LDL-C reduction compared with diet alone in hypercholesterolemic individuals  with and without type 2 diabetes. Demonstration for the first time that PS alone are  more efficacious in lowering LDL-C and non-HDL-C in diabetic individuals compared to  non-diabetics confirm the beneficial effects of PS to help prevent cardiovascular  disease (CVD) for this high risk population.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, Peter J.

TRBP also binds the interferon induced,  double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, that exerts antiviral activities.  Activated PKR inhibits translational initiation by phosphorylation of the alpha  subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIf-2alpha). TRBP blocks the  inhibitory effects of PKR, whereas PKR activating protein (PACT), another cellular  protein, heterodimerizes with and activates PKR in vitro and in vivo in the absence  of viral infection. TRBP and PACT are highly homologous but have opposite effects on  PKR. We studied the interplay between TRBP and PACT on PKR activation  and on the regulation of HIV expression. By the yeast two-hybrid method, we showed  an interaction between TRBP and PACT and we characterized domains implicated in this  interaction. We confirmed this interaction in the human cellular context by  coimmunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescence studies showed that TRBP and PACT  colocalize in the cytoplasm. In the context of HIV-1 expression, PKR mediates an  inhibition of LTR (long terminal repeat) expression, but no further decrease was  obtained with PACT. Interestingly, in coimmunoprecipitation studies, we found that  the concentration of PACT protein is decreased when PACT and TRBP were  cotransfected, whereas PACT mRNA level remains unchanged. This result suggests that  TRBP either blocks PACT translation or induces its degradation, which open new ways  of PKR and viral regulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gatignol, Anne (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z725.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150j823</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816n12p"><dcterms:title>Evidence of oxidative stress response in a mouse model of AA amyloidosis : immunolocalization of specific markers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kamalvand, Golnar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Amyloidosis describes a heterogenous collection of systemic  diseases characterized by the extracellular deposition of proteinaceous amyloid  fibrils derived from normally soluble proteins. With progressive tissue deposition  of amyloid, death can occur through failure of the affected organ(s). However, the  mechanism of amyloid fibril formation remains obscure. To understand this mechanism,  a parasite (alveolar hydatid cyst, AHC)-mouse model of inflammation-associated AA  amyloidosis, was used. AHC is a potent inducer of chronic inflammation, serum  amyloid A (SAA) synthesis and AA amyloidosis. It has been proposed that reactive  oxygen radicals (ROR) generated by inflammatory macrophages (mphi) and  reticuloendothelial (RE) cells, which are also intimately involved in SAA clearance,  could initiate intra-lysosomal AA fibril formation. ROS generated intracellularly  could oxidize SAA fragments or other key cellular proteins, alter them structurally  and thus render them resistant to enzymatic degradation and prone to intralysosomal  nascent AA fibril formation. The objective of this research was to identify oxidative stress  (OS) markers (heme-oxygenase-1, HO-1; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, HNE; Nepsilon  -(Carboxymethyl)lysine, CML) in peritoneal mphi and splenic/hepatic RE cells  obtained from AHC-infected mice prior to and during AA amyloidosis. Histochemical  and peroxidase-immunoperoxidase methods were used to detect the OS markers. High  levels of HO-1, an antioxidant enzyme; HNE, a product of lipid peroxidation; and  CML, an advanced glycation end product, were found in peritoneal mphi and  splenic/hepatic RE cells proximal to AA fibril deposition. HNE and CML deposits were  found in both the tissue interstitium and bound to AA amyloid deposits, indicating  their possible role in the oxidative alteration of intracellular SAA. OS mediated  changes in mphi/RE cells loaded with SAA may prove to be a prelude to nascent  intracellular AA fibril formation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ali-Khan, Zafer (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v6020.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n12p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w0323659"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of chemoprotection conferred against alkylating drugs by a bicistronic retroviral vector expressing the A3 isoform of glutathione S-transferase and a variant of human dihydrofolate reductase</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Karatzas, Antonios</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The principal dose-limiting toxicity of most chemotherapeutic  agents is myelosuppression.

As reported herein, GID-transduced murine hematopoietic  cells exhibited greater survival compared to control cells in presence of  chlorambucil concentrations ranging from 5 x 10-6 M to 1 x 10-4M.

GID-transduced hematopoietic cell enrichment by ex vivo chemoselection was limited,  under our experimental conditions, by a marked loss of hematopoietic reconstitution  ability, while in vivo chemoselection was shown to hold greater potential to  selectively enrich GID-expressing blood cells. The presence of replication competent  virus in the experiments makes it difficult to reach to conclusive interpretations  of results.

Another lies protein, Hes6, also interacts with Gro/TLE through its  WRPW motif. Contrary to Hes1, Hes6 promotes neuronal differentiation. It is shown  here that Hes6 negatively regulates Hes1 activity by at least two mechanisms. Hes6  promotes a proteolytic degradation of Hes1.

In addition to a significant  variability of waiting time according to radiation therapy centre, predictors of  shorter waiting times were earlier year of treatment, localised cancer stage, breast  conserving surgery, early consultation with a radiation oncologist, being operated  in a centre with a radiation therapy facility, living close to a radiation therapy  facility, and living in a higher socio-economic area. In conclusion, waiting time to start of radiation therapy after  localised breast cancer increased substantially in Quebec from 1992 to 1998.  Possible explanations include increased demand, insufficient resources and changes  in the indications for breast conserving surgery and RT.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goldberg, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz96n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257f76f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xj24w"><dcterms:title>Transplantation of skin-derived precursor cells into neonatal rat brain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fortier, Mathieu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have isolated a novel source of stem cells derived from the dermis of either rodent or human skin.

We transplanted orange cell  tracker-labelled mouse SKPs into the lateral cerebral ventricule and the hippocampus  of neonatal rats. Analysis of the transplants revealed that SKPs survived over the  short, medium and long-term in vivo, with SKPs remaining viable for up to 6 weeks  without forming tumors. Many cells also adopted a branched morphology, but, based on  immunocytochemistry of orange cell tracker-labelled SKPs with specific markers for  either neurons or glia, these morphologically complex cells did not differentiate  into specific neuronal cell types. In control experiments, neural stem cells  exhibited a similar in vivo pattern of survival and a lack of differentiation,  thereby validating our results and that our transplantation protocol required  further refinement in order to give optimal results.

To evaluate the caries experience of people with Down  syndrome (DS) compared to people without DS. Methods. A cross-sectional study was  conducted. The caries experience was assessed by a crude DMFT score and an adjusted  DFT score expressed as a percentage of caries-affected teeth to compensate for  hypodontia in the DS group. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were used to  compare the outcomes of both groups, controlling for all predictors. Results. Of the  44 DS and 84 non-DS subjects, the adjusted DFT score showed non-significant  differences between them (p = 0.18). The crude DMFT score displayed borderline  significance (p = 0.06), while people without DS had a higher likelihood of a caries  experience compared to the DS group (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5--14.0). Conclusions .  Independent of other predictors, the caries experience was greater among people  without DS, without adjusting for the number of teeth.

Such regions are  naturally represented with a trace-cache, a collection of long, frequently-executed  sequences of instructions. An ideal trace-cache is small and captures the majority  of the program's execution stream, yet consists of traces large enough to allow for  useful inter-bytecode optimizations and improve instruction-fetch performance. This  thesis describes an efficient dynamic technique for finding and constructing such  traces. Our trace caching algorithm relies on three innovative  techniques: profiling data is managed with the Branch Implication Graph(BI-Graph)  data structure, decomposing the program into small, independent, tree-like  components using our hot subgraph filters the BI-Graph for relevant data, and traces  are constructed from components using a minimum-bounded expected completion  rate. We evaluated the runtime performance of our generated traces  using a trace cache simulator implemented on top of the Java Virtual Machine,  SableVM. Tested against Java benchmarks, our primary data structure, the BI-Graph,  scales linearly with the loaded program size and is no larger than a control flow  graph. On our benchmarks set, our traces capture 98.5% of the executed instructions,  average 34 bytecodes instructions in length, and execute to completion 98.5% of the  time. Further, the total size of all traces created scales linearly at 83% of the  program's size, averaging only 50000 bytecodes. The entire algorithm, including  context-sensitive, branch bias profiling and trace creation, has a projected  overhead of only 4.5%. Thus, our algorithm efficiently constructs a small trace  cache consisting of long traces that both tend to execute to completion and capture  the majority of the execution stream.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg93t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967432k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj67p"><dcterms:title>Managing multiple land uses : applications in subarctic Urko Kekkonen National Park, Finland</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Berrouard, Delia Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Evaluating the integration of multiple land uses in protected  areas by assessing user satisfaction assists in identifying the balance between  ecological protection and the socio-economic and cultural needs of local  populations.

In this  thesis, statistical models are used to infer behavior characteristics of a multiple  arch dam. First, a statistical model known as the Hydrostatic-Season-Time (H-S-T)  model is fitted to each individual displacement component from pendulum data for the  Daniel Johnson Dam, a multiple arch concrete dam located in Northern Quebec.  Principal component analysis (PCA) was used with the data from pendulums. A modified  PCA analysis was also performed after removing thermal effects. A C++ language  program (DASOD) was developed for the estimation of the H-S-T model, visualization  of results, and data preparation for the principal component analysis.

Several methods of automatic seizure detection exist, but few can operate as an on-line seizure alert system. Proposed is a seizure detection system that can be used in real-time to alert medical staff to the onset of a patient seizure and hence improve clinical diagnosis. Proposed is a system based on the seizure probability of a section of EEG. Final operation features a user-tuneable threshold to exploit the trade-off between sensitivity and detection delay and an acceptable false detection rate. The system was designed using 307 hours of scalp EEG including a total of 56 seizures in 13 patients. Wavelet decomposition, feature extraction and data segmentation were employed to compute the a priori probabilities required for the Bayesian formulation used in training, testing and operation. Results based on the analysis of separate testing data (354 hours of scalp EEG including 74 seizures in 15 patients) show an average sensitivity of 70.5% and a false detection rate of 0.25/hr. This average sensitivity is based on the successful detection of 47 of the 74 seizures with a mean detection delay of 10.8s and a delay of 10 seconds or less in 31 of these (66% of detections). The system is considered to be preliminary and results are promising enough to encourage further work on probability-based seizure detection. The tuning mechanism was also seen to add value to the use of the system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gotman, Jean (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268574x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn52k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qm60n"><dcterms:title>High-speed low-power asynchronous circuits</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saadallah, Nisrine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents several design experiments for  high-performance power-efficient asynchronous circuits.

In terms of flexural members, e.g., a steel  I-section beam, bent about the major principal axis, lateral buckling about the  minor principal axis in combination with torsional buckling is the main stability  concern. To prevent lateral-torsional buckling from occurring, lateral braces are  typically installed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flexural member,  either on the top and/or bottom flange or near the shear-centre of the beam.  Nethercot developed an equation to predict the critical elastic lateral-torsional  moment resistance of cantilever beams, which involves a series of effective length  factors, which are dependent on the brace configuration, type and position of  loading, as well as cantilever system. This effective length factor approach has  become widely used as a simplified method to calculate the elastic lateral-torsional  buckling moment resistance of cantilever steel beams. However, no specific  guidelines for the design of the lateral braces are available in design  standards. This thesis will include background information on elastic beam  buckling theories, an introduction to the development of research on lateral brace  requirements, and a discussion on the currently used lateral bracing requirements in  North American and British Standards. Details of a study concerning the lateral  bracing design requirements for cantilever I-beams, carried out with the use of the  finite element software Buckling Analysis of Stiffened Plates (BASP), are provided.  Concerning the required brace stiffness, the results from the numerical parametric  study are compared with the results from the Canadian Steel Design Standard CSA-S 16  and the SSRC (Structural Stability Research Council) method of the United  States. It is shown that the current code methods are generally  conservative for top flange loaded cantilever beam cases in terms of the predicted  elastic lateral-torsional buckling capacity. Furthermore, the current bracing design  requirements provide adequate results in most cases, except for the prop cantilever  scenario without a tip brace.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rogers, Colin A.
