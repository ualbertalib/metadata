Holly D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The filtration mechanics of the slip casting and filter pressing ceramic forming processes are analyzed so that better control can be achieved over these processes. The rheological behaviour of alumina suspensions with different solids loadings, particle size distributions and amounts of deflocculant as well as the effects that these suspensions have on the filtration process were studied. During slip casting the formation of the filter cake occurs as a result of the capillary suction pressure of the pores in the plaster of Paris molds. Therefore, the mold microstructure, density, permeability, suction pressure and the effects that these mold properties have on the filtration process are analyzed as a function of the plaster/water ratio used to form the molds. During filtration, as the cake thickness increases with casting time, fine particles can be carried along with the filtrate and deposited within the filter cake and/or filter medium thereby clogging and reducing the permeabilities of the porous media. This in turn affects the growth rate as well as the permeability, density and porosity of the cake. Evidence of cake and filter medium clogging was obtained by: (1) SEM analysis of cakes and filter media, (2) surface area measurements of cross-sections of cakes, and (3) measurements of cake thickness as a function of casting time. A computer model consisting of a network of tubes with a random size distribution has been developed to simulate the filtration process. The model accounts for porous media clogging due to: (1) fine particles depositing on the pore walls and gradually reducing the pore radii and (2) pores trapping particles larger than the pore openings. The network model shows that the permeability of the porous medium is dependent upon its pore size distribution rather than its average pore size. The model also illustrates that minor changes in the pore size distribution due to clogging can significantly affect its permeability and casting rate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq59h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vk833</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Applied Mechanics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bm487"><dcterms:title>The structure and function of the autoinducer of the vibrio harveyi luminescence system /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cao, Jie-Gang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The regulation of autoinduction of the luminescence (lux) system of the marine bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, has been studied. The autoinducer, which controls expression of the V. harveyi lux operon containing genes coding for luciferase and the fatty acid reductase complex responsible for synthesis of the aldehyde substrate, has been purified and structurally identified as N-$( beta$-hydroxybutyryl)homoserine lactone (HBHL). The $ beta$-hydroxybutyryl moiety of the autoinducer has been determined to be in the D configuration. The biosynthesis of the autoinducer was inhibited by exogenous fatty acids and/or cerulenin. These results suggest that the D-$ beta$-hydroxybutyryl moiety is directly derived from the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Seven structural analogs of the V. harveyi autoinducer have been synthesized. Studies on the biological effects and molecular modeling analysis revealed important structural requirements for the autoinducer and its analogs to interact with the putative receptor. The apparent dissociation constants for the autoinducer and these analogs have been determined. Mutants of V. harveyi, whose expression of luminescence is dependent on the presence of exogenous autoinducer, have been isolated for the first time. These mutants provide a good system to study HBHL-inducible expression of the lux system of V. harveyi at the levels of biochemistry and molecular biology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bc38m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm487</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150k04x"><dcterms:title>The Commission of Sir George Carew in 1611 : a review of the exchequer and the judiciary of Ireland</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rutledge, Vera L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the summer of 1611, Sir George Carew, the Irish Elizabethan military commander and former president of Munster, was commissioned by the king and his royal council in London to conduct an enquiry into all aspects of the Castle administration. Included in that wide mandate was an investigation into the existing practices and procedures of the Irish exchequer and judiciary, the two most important divisions of the Dublin government. This thesis is concerned with these two aspects of the commission of Sir George Carew. Since it is requisite for an understanding of the terms of reference handed to Sir George Carew in 1611, the study includes an analysis of the exchequer and judiciary between 1603 and 1611. In addition, there is an examination of the fiscal and judicial reforms that the king and his councillors commanded Irish officials to implement between 1613 and 1616. As is shown, these reformist measures were a direct outgrowth of recommendations submitted by Sir George Carew to the English privy council following the conclusion of his commission in 1611.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1392702.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150k04x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Totnes, George Carew, Earl of, 1555-1629.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finance, Public -- Ireland -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Justice, Administration of -- Ireland -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ireland -- Politics and government -- 17th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh537"><dcterms:title>A human organ-specific neoantigen defined as a mycoplasma 40 KD protein (P40) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Michaelidou, Aliki</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human organ-specific-neoantigens (OSN) are tumor molecules found in crude cancer extracts to which patients with cancer of the same organ and histogenesis respond in the in vitro assay of leukocyte adherence inhibition (LAI).

Distribution studies on a variety of cultured cell lines, fresh, and fetal tissues showed that p40 is present only on some cultured cells. Using the peptide sequences of p40 a collaborating laboratory isolated and sequenced p40 cDNA from a colon cancer cell line (LS-180). P40 was a Mycoplasma hyorhinis transport protein. Moreover, a series of experiments with anti-mycoplasma reagents showed that p40 is expressed by cells infected with mycoplasma. By the LAI assay mycoplasma proteins stimulated positive cellular responses with cancer patients leukocytes but not with leukocytes from normal controls.

It is shown that variability in successive operational model forecasts results from variations in the representation of the features at both levels, but that particular predictions can be sufficiently realistic for diagnostic purposes. The variability in two successive forecasts of a specific case is explained as a moist baroclinic response modulated by the growth of low-level cyclonic vorticity prior to the period of rapid deepening. This antecedent vorticity growth came about through a self-development mechanism involving an interaction between quasigeostrophic processes, surface energy fluxes and warm-frontal latent heat release. In order to define the preconditioning for this case, it is necessary to resolve these processes, interacting on both meso and synoptic scales.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462625p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj953</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tq17h"><dcterms:title>Employment equity programs in Canada's federal jurisdiction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leck, Joanne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the introduction of the Employment Equity Act in 1986, organizations in Canada's federal jurisdiction have been required to adopt Employment Equity Programs (EEPs) designed to increase the presence of four traditionally under-represented groups: women, aboriginal peoples, disabled persons, and visible minorities.

Resistance is associated with the protective role of antioxidants as shown by the increased levels of superoxide dismutase and of the glutathione system enzymes. Hydroperoxide-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity was not detectable in newly transformed schistosomula, however the activity was present in the liver stages. The antischistosomal drug oltipraz (OPZ) decreased in an irreversible manner the activity of S. mansoni glutathione S-transferase (GST), an important protective enzyme, both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of GST activity was not isoenzyme restricted and was non-competitive with respect to the two substrates essential for GST activity. On the other hand, OPZ treatment increased the levels of mouse (S. mansoni host) liver GST activity in an isoenzyme specific manner, with the $ mu$ class subunit induction accounting for most of the increase. However, mammalian GST activity was inhibited by OPZ in vitro. However, the inhibition of mammalian GST activity was reversible upon addition of dithiol reducing compounds. OPZ inhibited the binding of ($ sp{14}$C) N-ethylmaleimide (specifically alkylates SH groups), suggesting that OPZ interacts with SH-groups of GST to inhibit its enzymatic activity. Another SH-dependent enzyme, hexokinase, from yeast and S. mansoni was reversibly inhibited by OPZ. The oxy-analogue of OPZ, in which the thione sulphur is replaced with oxygen, did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of GST and hexokinase. Many of the biochemical effects of OPZ on S. mansoni and its mammalian hosts may be related to its ability to bind to SH groups and inactivation of the functions of many essential proteins.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b016.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hw154</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Schistosomiasis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Schistosoma mansoni -- Effect of drugs on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oltipraz</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glutathione transferase.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407z06x"><dcterms:title>Process measurements in flotation columns using electrical conductivity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Uribe-Salas, Alejandro</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Techniques based on electrical conductivity to estimate interface level, gas holdup and bias rate in flotation columns were developed. A conductivity probe and associated data acquisition system for locating the froth/collection zone interface in flotation columns were developed and tested. The level detection technique is based on the collection of a conductance profile around the interface and on the location of the position at which a sharp change in conductance occurs. Such a change in conductance across the interface is caused by the difference in the effective conductivity of the froth and collection zone, primarily due to their difference in gas holdup. A conductivity cell to measure the effective conductivity of water-air, water-mineral, and water-mineral-air systems was developed. The cell consisted of two grid-electrodes covering the entire cross-sectional area of the cylinder containing the two or three phase system. Such an arrangement allowed the free movement of the phases and provided conditions for uniform potential and current (electrical) fields. It was found that Maxwell's model (1892) predicted the holdups of the non-conductive material reasonably well from the conductivity measurements. Conditions encountered in industrial flotation columns allowed the use of conductivity to trace the flows of feed water and wash water across the interface, and therefore, to determine the bias rate. Alternative parameters to bias rate as measures of metallurgy such as fraction of feed water in the overflow water (called here feed water entrainment), feed water recovery, and conductance profiles, were explored.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c1301.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z06x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z614j"><dcterms:title>Lateral and isopycnal mixing of passive and active tracers in an ocean general circulation model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gough, William A. (William Arthur)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The parameterization of isopycnal mixing is examined in an ocean general circulation model. The results are compared to those obtained with lateral mixing. In the equilibrium experiments, the isopycnal case has more gyre kinetic energy, a less intense thermohaline circulation, and less interior downwelling than the lateral case. Convection is replaced by enhanced vertical diffusion in the isopycnal case. In the time dependent passive tracer experiments, the isopycnal case has smaller depth penetration of a surface released tracer. This is likely due to induced recirculation rather than numerical limitations. The active tracer experiments examine the long term asymmetric behaviour of warm and cold surface anomalies introduced in an abrupt and gradual fashion for the lateral and isopycnal models. The thermal anomalies produce asymmetric transient responses. The abrupt and gradual changes produce the same equilibrium but different transient responses. The isopycnal case responds more rapidly and energetically than the lateral case.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193983h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z614j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gp07f"><dcterms:title>A study of a model elastomeric sparger /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pangalos, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Spargers are devices featuring small orifices through which bubbles are formed into a liquid from a pressurized gas. In conventional (rigid) spargers, orifices have a fixed shape and size. This study deals with elastomeric (deformable) spargers--in a circular-membrane form--in which the sparger deformation and hence the shape and size of orifices depend upon the gas pressure. Punctures (slits) and perforations (circular holes) were considered for the orifices. Mathematical models were developed to relate the pressure to the deformation of the sparger and then to the deformation of the orifices. These models were combined with a model for the formation of bubbles from a circular orifice. Predictions from the overall model were compared with measurements of bubble volume and frequency for single-orifice, latex rubber spargers operating in glycerol-water solutions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v6241.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp07f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p542d"><dcterms:title>The incidence and risk factors for falls and fall-related injury among elderly persons living in the community /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>O'Loughlin, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To determine the frequency of and risk factors for falls and fall-related injury, a one-year prospective follow-up study of 417 community-dwelling persons aged 65 years or older was conducted.

Data were also collected on exposures which could fluctuate over time. The response rate to the initial interview was 75%, and 90% or more of study participants completed each of the 12 follow-up interviews. Twenty-nine percent of subjects fell during follow-up; 61% of fallers fell once and 39% fell two or more times. The majority of falls resulted in no injury or in minor injury only. A total of 28 independent predictors of falls and fall-related injury were identified in multiple logistic-regression analyses. These included a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle and health characteristics, and reflect the multifactorial and complex etiology of falls in the elderly. The strongest predictors of increased fall and fall-injury rates were similar for falls and fall-related injury, and included dissatisfaction with health, dissatisfaction with social life and dizziness.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv37b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p542d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerontology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
