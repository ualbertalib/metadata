We tested whether fire, seed dispersal, and the presence of an introduced grass, Saccharum spontaneum L., were barriers to forest regeneration. We examined growth, survival, and density of both experimentally-introduced and naturally-regenerating tree seedlings using a series of multifactorial experiments. We found that seed dispersal limits forest regeneration. Large-seeded species have the highest performance in the Saccharum spontaneum, but were found in the lowest abundance in natural conditions. Small-seeded species were most frequently observed, but they have the lowest survival. We conclude that dispersal limitations preclude entry of the larger-seeded species. Distance from the forest limits dispersal of many small-seeded species. Fire is a major barrier to natural regeneration because it lowers species diversity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Potvin, C.

Several claims have been made regarding the consumption of blue-green algae. Such claims range from increased physical and mental energy to the treatment of neurological disorders and the enhancement of the immune system. In order to determine whether the species of blue-green algae Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (AFA) has effects on immune cell circulation and function, 21 volunteers were involved in a crossover, double-blinded placebo-controlled study. Results reveal that two hours after AFA consumption, there was a generalized mobilization of lymphocytes and monocytes. This mobilization included increases in the CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets, and of CD19+ B cells, in peripheral blood. In neither the CD4+ nor the CD8+ subsets however, were changes observed in the relative proportions of naive versus memory T cells. In addition, the relative proportions and absolute numbers of natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood were reduced after AFA consumption. This effect did not occur with polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. Using in vitro techniques to elucidate possible mechanisms of these in vivo observations, we have found that AFA binds to the L-selectin molecule on lymphocytes and PMNs. Furthermore, it does not directly activate lymphocytes, as evaluated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and by proliferative activity. Similarly, AFA does not induce reactive oxygen species formation in PMNs in vitro, and appears to slightly reduce the phagocytic activity of PMNs harvested from volunteers 2 hours post-consumption (ex-vivo). Further studies are required to determine the components of AFA that are responsible for these phenomena. By altering the circulation of specific leukocyte subsets however, AFA represents a novel approach to modulating immune surveillance. Such an approach may have implications in the treatment and prevention of infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency states.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jensen, Gitte (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t87j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g688q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nutrition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rk02d"><dcterms:title>Effect of incinerator ash addition on the efficiency of UV disinfection</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Giroux, Emile, 1952-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The efficiency of UV disinfection of wastewater is limited by particles that shield embedded pathogens. The objective of the experimental work presented herein was to investigate if the addition of microorganism-free, inert, solid, incinerator ashes would create more readily disinfectable particles by concentrating pathogens at the surface of particles. The ensuing reduction of embedded pathogens would increase the efficiency of UV disinfection. Wastewater from the Montreal Urban Community wastewater treatment plant (MUCWTP) was used for the study. The wastewater contained domestic and industrial influents, as well as urban runoff. The physicochemical treatment of the MUCWTP was simulated using a modified jar test. Ash particles (200 mg/L; &lt;75 mum) were added at the same time as either the addition of the coagulant or the coagulant-aid. Furthermore, some tests were done by coating ash particles with a coagulant or coagulant-aid. UV disinfection was carried out on the jar test supernatant at doses of 25, 32, and 40 mW.s.cm-2. Results showed that the addition of ash particles improved the efficiency of UV disinfection by as much as one log reduction, but the improvement was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level when tested with the one-way ANOVA parametric test and the Friedman non-parametric test. An analysis of the mechanisms of agglomeration with and without the addition of ash indicated that the efficiency of the UV disinfection process appeared to be enhanced through the production of numerous small flocs, which, however, lowered the overall quality of the physicochemically-treated effluent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehr, R.

Using changes in the phase of ground targets as proxies for changes in the two-way travel times of radar pulses, fields of near-surface refractivity have been generated in real time on McGill University's Doppler S-band radar since 1996. Retrieval of meteorological information from refractivity is possible because of its strong dependence on air humidity and also density (and hence temperature). In a sensitivity study it was found that accurate high-resolution moisture information can be extracted, as the effects of temperature and pressure fluctuations are relatively small during the summer. Errors on radar-derived near-surface moisture measurements due to neglect of temperature and pressure variability were found to be smaller than those typical of point measurements made at traditional surface stations. Further, the effects of radar phase measurement errors due to refraction and precipitation are usually less significant than those that result from ignoring temperature and pressure variability. On this basis, refractivity measurements were used to study small-scale moisture signatures, in particular, a refractivity contrast associated with initiation of a convective system which, interacting with a near-surface moist region, developed into a shallow supercell hailstorm. Refractivity was found to be a useful predictor of convective storms, through detection of convergence lines and the use of near-surface moisture diagnosis to improve stability assessments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fabry, Frederic (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vw02n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm85v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445cg28b"><dcterms:title>Characterization and classification of Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) habitat in the Estrie region, Québec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Connolly, Véronique.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bicknell's Thrush is one of the rarest species of breeding bird in North America.

To identify habitat preferences, we characterized and compared the vegetation composition and habitat structure of 42 sites occupied by the species, and 19 unoccupied sites. To classify the habitat on the two mountains as suitable or unsuitable for Bicknell's Thrush, we used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to integrate Thematic Mapper data (bands 3, 4, 5, and 7) with field observations on the locations of occupied and unoccupied sites. The supervised classification of habitat on each mountain identified sites that were occupied or unoccupied by the species as suitable or unsuitable, respectively, with an accuracy of 89 to 90%. The results indicate the usefulness of our methods in mapping potential suitable habitat for Bicknell's Thrush at the local scale.

This hyperacetylation of histones then leads to a change in chromatin conformation and transcription of genes. Histone deacetylases have recently been found to directly affect gene expression by associating with transcriptional repressor complexes. The present thesis describes the initial characterization of histone deacetylase activity in variants of HeLa cells that are capable of growth in cytotoxic concentrations of butyrate. Analysis of acetylation levels of total histones by triton-acid-urea gels indicated that the histone deacetylases in the variants are less sensitive to the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors than the parental HeLa cells. Control experiments showed that this resistance was not due to the transport of butyrate into the cell nor from the overexpression of HDAC1 or HDAC2, further suggesting that the resistance to butyrate is due to an alteration in a gene encoding HDAC.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Th'ng, John P.

While previous studies have used decapitated dams to perform C-sections, the purpose of experiment 1 was to develop a more clinically relevant model using controlled amounts of anesthetic. The findings show that the level of maternal anesthesia used is an important factor influencing neonatal systemic and CNS oxygenation during C-section birth. In experiment 2 indicators of systemic and CNS hypoxia were measured in rat born by C-section with varying concentrations of anesthetic and periods of added global anoxia. Anesthesia was shown to reduce the rate of recovery from global anoxia. Experiment 3 was designed to determine if different rat strains were differentially vulnerable to the long-term effects of C-section birth on amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. The findings from this study indicate that genetic factors and C-section birth interact in producing long-term CNS effects.

Technological developments and the increase of economic benefits deriving from telecommunications have caused the proliferation of megacarriers located on a world-wide basis and the treatment of telecommunications as a business product. In this scenario, the International Telecommunication Union and the World Trade Organization separately rule the development of telecommunications via satellite, affecting national regulations and, at the same time, the evolvement of the pattern in commercial relations among the companies who develop satellite telecommunications in outer space. This thesis illustrates the state of the liberalization of telecommunications and the main national obstacles for its achievement. This study thoroughly analyzes the functioning of the two leader organizations, ITU and WTO, and the regulations that they are enacting. Additionally, the thesis analyzes the most practical and new problems that influence their structure, such as the new technological developments, the role of national regulations of some countries, and the privatization of intergovernmental organizations. Moreover, the thesis examines the increase in the demand of space resources and the introduction of market mechanisms to the attribution of orbital slots and frequencies, due to the increase of private actors, and concludes with the proposal of possible models of cooperation between the two leader organizations.

In the modern world, this evolution has culminated in a dynamism reflected in numerous interactions between a wide range of different actors. As a result, the former boundaries between the public and private law, as well as the international and municipal law dichotomy, have become blurred. In an emerging global society, these four major categories have entered a dynamic dialogue that equally challenges both legal theory and practice.

The contrasted concept of preliminary agreement and its hybrid legal nature give rise to legal issues, such as interpretation, enforceability and liability. Those issues are differently tackled in French and American law. The ambiguity of pre-agreements allows the French and American judges to play a decisive role in the interpretation of such agreements. In accordance with its definiteness and completeness, the pre-agreement may be considered as the final contract and binds the parties. Then, in case of non respect, the blameworthy party may be held liable, and courts may grant damages to the party who has suffered prejudice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, H. P.

Existing conceptions of the notions of dereliction, causality and damage are analysed in order to point out the many inadequacies with the rights of the patient, source of the obligation to inform. Particular emphasis is given to the situation in Quebec and to the eventual place that could be occupied by conception of the duty to inform that is more sensitive to the situation and rights of the patient.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jutras, Daniel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv50h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n85v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Informed consent (Medical law) -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Informed consent (Medical law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n0544"><dcterms:title>Lease and leasing of aircraft in Italy and Quebec : default of the lessee</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guidone, Luigi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the contracts of lease and leasing have been used for many years by airline companies, increase in traffic volume predicted for the following years will certainly determine a greater need for aircrafts and consequently a greater demand for use of these kind of contracts. Not only do they offer economic benefits but they are also very important instruments in the hands of an airline for fleet planning. Operating and financial lessors have a wide market for their costly "toys", but, as the market and profits expand, so does the need for lessors to be at any time able to keep total control of them. In fact, one of the biggest fears for a lessor is to loose his property because he is not able to repossess it after a default of the lessee. This thesis first briefly overviews the contract of lease and leasing and how the latter, being a contract of common law origin, has been included in the legal systems of two civil law countries like Italy and Quebec. Subsequently, the main clauses of a contract of aircraft lease or leasing are analysed not only to see the duties that a lessee entering into such a contract has, but also to see if these clauses follow the provisions which govern the contract, in general, and the contract of lease and leasing, in particular, in Italy and Quebec. Chapter II deals with the remedies that, in case of the lessee's default, a lessor has, in Italy and Quebec, in order to repossess his aircraft; whether these remedies can guarantee speedy repossession and whether the remedy of the "self-help repossession", which is a typical common law legal instrument, can be applied in Italy and Quebec. Finally there is a short analysis of the "Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment" which is being drafted by Unidroit and its possible help in solving the problem of quick repossession in the case of a default by the lessee.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jobin, Pierre-Gabriel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs33x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n0544</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aircraft leasing and renting -- Italy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aircraft leasing and renting -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440v55z"><dcterms:title>What future for the WTO dispute settlement system? : the European perspective</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guillou, Solen Anne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>On the eve of the launch of the first round of multilateral negotiations within the framework of the new WTO system, the so-called Millennium Round---which may be officially opened by the Seattle Ministerial Conference on 30 November 1999---the review of the WTO dispute settlement system should deserve the attention of WTO Members as one of the most essential topics to be considered. Within this context, this thesis raises the question whether the future developments of the WTO dispute settlement system could be influenced by the successful European model. In an attempt to answer this question, this thesis first highlights the grounds on which the EC approach to the GATT dispute settlement system has changed so that the EC has finally become an active supporter for "judicialization" of the new system (Introductory Part). The impact of the new WTO dispute settlement system on the EC participation in its development is then analysed (Part I). Finally, the last part of this thesis focuses on the reasons of the EC success in order to conclude to its potential influence on the further developments of the WTO dispute settlement system (Part II).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, A.

Part Two suggests some modern approaches that shall be considered for adoption in Mexico based largely on a comparison with the advanced structure of secured transactions under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the United States, Book Six of the Civil Code of Quebec, and the Canadian Personal Property Security Acts. All may serve as effective models for Mexican legislators to follow in their aim to modernize personal property security law.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lametti, D.

Employing digital and satellite technologies in support of a seamless air traffic management system, it will bring improvements upon the present levels of safety, efficiency and accuracy, as well as increased capacity and economic benefits. An analysis of the existing legal tools hereby confirms the need for the development of an appropriate legal framework for the GNSS. In considering the fundamental principles to be contained therein, this thesis examines the adequacy of an international convention as the long-term means to provide for the legal guarantees which will inspire world-wide confidence in the integrity of the system. Finally, it provides detailed examination of the relevant legal issues, such as liability, certification, administration, financing and cost recovery, as well as future operating structures.

Meeting the aggressive requirements for contamination control requires the development of advanced techniques in defect detection, prevention, and surface preparation. Thus in order to control the device manufacturing environment, it is necessary to detect the presence and if possible the origin of the contaminant, airborne or otherwise, actually found in the cleanroom. In this project a technique using preferential nucleation of water vapor on particulate contaminants was developed to detect fine (10mum--100mum) particles. The wettability of various semiconductor and related surfaces was determined by measuring the contact angle of different solutions and droplet growth rates. Nucleation experiments to determine if preferential nucleation occurred were successful for both water soluble and insoluble particles. The droplet growth rate was determined to be a function of the temperature difference between the gas phase and the substrate, contact angle, carrier gas flow rate, and solution concentration where applicable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berk, Dimitrios (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v821.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq39v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r965v"><dcterms:title>Supranational systems of dispute resolution and their integration into domestic legal systems : a view of the Latin American Experience</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Aguilar, Sofia Beatriz.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The influence of globalization over legal systems has resulted in, among other effects, the emergence of transnational law and new international players, such as multinational corporations (MNEs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and numerous international entities. The dynamics of the new players within the new transnational legal order have generated a need for a new supranational system of dispute resolution. The analysis focuses on the Latin American experience in adapting to judicial reform programs (sponsored by international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Development Bank) which promote the integration of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods into domestic legal systems, in order to integrate such systems into a supranational system of dispute resolution for the entire continent. This study aims to explore various alternatives for preventing a continental supranational system of dispute resolution from undermining domestic democracies, while integrating developing countries into the process of commercial globalization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, H.

Sensitization was achieved before spark ignition and DDT by illuminating a quiescent mixture of hydrogen and chlorine with a weak ultraviolet source. The arrival time of the reaction front was monitored by means of discretely located optical sensors along the length of the detonation tube. While no observable changes are produced during the early stages of the flame acceleration process, it is found that radical seeding promotes the onset of detonation through a reduction in run-up length and time. This is in accord with the generally accepted view that flame acceleration is mostly governed by molecular and turbulent transport. The photochemical initiation of chain reactions ahead of the flame accelerates the induction kinetics of the mixture. Shock induced auto-ignition is therefore facilitated, thereby promoting DDT during the period of onset.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, John H. S.
