It is composed for an ensemble of fifteen performers: piano solo, flute (doubling on piccolo), oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, percussion, two violins, viola, cello, and contrabass. It is composed as a suite of short movements, scored for the full ensemble, interspersed with interludes composed as duos for piano and one other instrument. The accompanying paper discusses the form of the work along with some of its historical precedents. Further topics include the use of tonality in the work, the variation techniques used in composing the interludes, and a discussion of compositional procedures used in a single movement along with examples of their application in other movements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rea, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v4911.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x70q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Concertos (Piano) -- Scores.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qp00m"><dcterms:title>Intercultural communication in the refugee determination hearing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pelosi, Anna M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Through interviews, observation of refugee hearings, the analysis of negative decisions rendered by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), and the application of communication, and social work theories, as well as discourse analysis, this study explores the effects of intercultural communication on the outcome of the refugee determination hearing.

This paradox is testimony to the difficulties of applying the international definition of a Convention Refugee to a socially and culturally-constructed refugee determination process. The political, social, and cultural context in which the IRB functions, the Board's institutional culture, which mirrors the social discourse on refugees, and the way individuals ascribe meaning to information in a culturally-defined manner, all have an impact on the outcome of the hearing, and in turn on refugee protection in Canada.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nichols, Barbara (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c256c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qp00m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Intercultural communication.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Court interpreting and translating -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Refugees -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada.

This qualitative research draws on the experiences of ten student activists and leaders, and explores student-involved AR and MC programs in Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto. Specifically, the roots of student involvement, their views of AR and MC, the factors which limit action within schools, and the sources of hope and discouragement will be documented. It is argued that school ethos, a hierarchy of student activities, bureaucracy, and power relations between adults and students all act to marginalize and affect the outcome of student programs which challenge racism.

These works, the Underweysung der Messung (1525) and the Vier Bucher von Menschlicher Proportion (1528), employ an unprecedented degree of graphic projection to render visual various geometrical and architectural figures. Nevertheless, Durer's obsessive interest in geometry and visualisation is not necessarily expressive of a strictly modern intentionality. Although his treatises have some continuity with the reductive techniques of contemporary practice, they were formulated in a traditional world and manifest many of its concerns. This thesis elucidates the interplay between these aspects of Durer's mathematical corpus. It proceeds by articulating both the traditional underpinnings of his work and his patent struggles with its modern implications. By revealing the original density of meaning inherent in modern means of architectural representation, this study questions the contemporary prejudice that such means are merely neutral instruments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924d699.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v052s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dürer, Albrecht, 1471-1528.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sj228"><dcterms:title>L'analogue D'Aldo Rossi</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Olivier, B.

The idea of type which is central to The Architecture of the City, is reinterpreted here in relation with Rossi's ideas about analogy which are proposed in A Scientific Autobiography. The influence of Etienne-Louis Boullee and Ernesto Rogers are discussed. Rossi's architectural type is related to Carl Jung's archetype whose numinous and compulsive aspects relate type to Rossi's ideas about architecture as instrument or apparatus. The theme of the cabine and the sea, and that of deposition are analyzed in order to illustrate the ideas above. The deposition introduces a discussion of Rossi's ambivalence about the role of type and the possibilities of architecture today. Finally, the moral and political aspects of these theories about analogy is presented in relation Rossi's ideas of the analogous city and of technique.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj307.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj228</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rossi, Aldo, 1931- -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999858f"><dcterms:title>Lilong housing : a traditional settlement form</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guan, Qian, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"Li" means neighborhoods, "Long" means lanes. These two words combine to describe an urban housing form which characterizes the city of Shanghai. Indissociable from the growth of Shanghai from 1840s to 1949, lilong settlements still comprise the majority of housing stock in the city center today. Inherited traditional dwelling patterns prevailing in the southeast China, profound transformation due to drastic social changes during that era produced lilong housing. Though, these transformation were demonstrated by the evolution of lilong's house forms, the settlement's general organization pattern persisted. Lilong settlement, as a low-rise, ground-related housing pattern, has many advantageous features: hierarchical spatial organization network, separation of public and private zones, high degree of safety control, strong sense of neighborly interaction and social cohesiveness, and so on. These factors make the lilong neighborhoods a pleasant place to live and hence they are loved by local populace. This thesis traces the evolution of lilong settlement forms in response to social transformation, and analyzes its indigenous design features and urban characteristics. As an ultimate goal, this thesis also explores the key characteristics of this settlement pattern, and the valuable experience that could be drawn as reference in contemporary housing design.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999859q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999858f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- China -- Shanghai.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Housing -- China -- Shanghai.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89d855c"><dcterms:title>Between memory and desire : the renaissance vision of Cristoforo Sorte</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Giunta, Stephen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with cartographic practices and the representation of the world during the Renaissance.

An examination of Sorte's methods of creating his work, relying on memory and the active recollection of the viewer, will reveal the primacy of shared human experience in the making of meaningful art and artifacts during the Renaissance.

Responding to Bogota's problem of insecurity, CHPs are groups of dwellings that are organised around, or within, outdoor communal grounds closed to the public and surveyed by an armed guard. The CHP, however, is much more than gates and guns. Due to its enclosure, it is isolated from Bogota's troubled urban setting. As a result, the CHP has become a marketing phenomena packaged and promoted by developers as an escape from many of the social problems of living in Bogota. The consuming public has accepted this option and popular culture now perceives the CHP as a necessary and appealing way of life. Mostly drawing from the Bogota architectural press, this study argues that the insular nature of the CHP makes a return to earlier housing types typically found in Bogota, and thus is evidence of architectural continuity in the city. The thesis also analyses the role of the CHP type in contemporary consumer culture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Annmarie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps478.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21th47h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Housing -- Colombia -- Bogota.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bn70z"><dcterms:title>Omah : the construction of meanings in Javanese domestic settings</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Santosa, Revianto Budi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Domestic space is a primary site for cultural reproduction. When the inhabitants intensively interact with domestic space, the house receives its cultural significance. This thesis aims to understand how, through practices, meanings are embodied in the spatial formation of the Javanese house, and how these meanings in return affect the spatiality of certain practices. The subject of these observations are four houses of considerably different scales and forms, which range from a simple single-structure house to the elaborate Sultan's palace. The domestic activities observed encompass three types of activities: daily life, ritual celebrations, and theatrical performances. My study is based on direct observation and involvement in such activities, personal interviews, and the published works of other scholars. The central arguments of the thesis are that the two-part division of the house is legible in all these examples and that this front-rear division has a dynamic relationship with established cultural practices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Annmarie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547w81w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bn70z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Indonesia -- Java.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Indonesia -- Java.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zw44x"><dcterms:title>The Mexicali experimental project : an analysis of its changes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ruesjas, Ana Laura.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During 1975 the Architect Christopher Alexander designed and built an experimental project for low income people in the city of Mexicali, Mexico. The aim of the project was to create a beautiful place, not just of architectural beauty but in its essential spirit, in its quality of life. A number of patterns, taken from the book A Pattern Language, were used to design the environment. The residents played an important role in the design of their place: this, according to the author, would guarantee that the place would directly respond to their physical and spiritual needs. Today, 20 years later, the project has undergone a lot of changes. People have continued the building process by themselves. Additions, modifications and changes in the use of spaces have blended the project with the neighborhood. This research attempts to describe the project's changes, to explain the motivating factors in its changes, and to evaluate the designer's original goals. It reveals the discrepancy between the architect's intentions and the actual needs of the residents. In this respect, the transformations observed show the incorporation of a culturally-based production process, suggesting the existence of an already inherent building practice that was neglected in the Mexicali approach.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k710s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw44x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Housing -- Mexico -- Baja California.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hm19p"><dcterms:title>A critical look at the United Nations Convention on International Multimodal Transport of Goods (Geneva, 24th May 1980) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Briant, Adeline M.

Traditionally, when goods were transferred from one mode to another they were also transferred to a new legal regime. There was no coherent legal regime governing carrier liability for goods moving in multimodal transport. The Convention creates a new liability system and confer international legal sanction on the responsibilities and immunities flowing from the multimodal transport contract. The Convention compromises between the needs of developing countries--who called for provisions on regulation and control of multimodal operations at the domestic level--and the demands of developed countries--who wanted the convention to deal primarily with private law matters and pointed to the danger of conflicts with modal conventions. The Convention is not yet in force but its provisions are the basis of current through carriage contracts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.

In fact, collusion has been encouraged. Collusion in the maritime industry has its historic origin in the colonial period. The evolution within this particular industry truly is a study in industrial organizational structure. This Thesis sets out to explain and analyze the current regulatory scheme of the European Union, as it applies to the maritime industry (European, as well as non-European). This is accomplished through an in-depth statutory interpretation of EU Council Regulation 4056/86 dated 22/12 1986, laying down detailed rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome to the maritime transport (Conferences), as well as the Commission Regulation 870/95 dated April 20, 1995 on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty of Rome to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (Consortia). This Thesis concludes that the former regulatory scheme is no longer up to date and thus requires replacement. The Thesis favours current developments within the maritime industry which call for increased co-operation and concentration among the carriers and providers of services (as well as co-operation as between the carriers and shippers), counter-balanced by restrictive regulation through the application of conditions, market share-restrictions and a limited five year application of the regulatory framework. The former regulatory scheme, Council-Regulation 4056/86, which remains in force, must therefore be interpreted restrictively, and in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, in particular Articles 85 and 86. Finally, this Thesis provides various solutions to soften the impact of full-scale application of the competition law of the European Union, as it will be applied in the maritime industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd45h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s677w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg82s"><dcterms:title>Indonesie, terre d'avenir</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Verney, Eric.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The history, culture and ethnic diversity of the Republic of the Indonesia make it a highly complex country.

Existing legislation and government policy prohibit payment out of fear that the poor, minorities, and other vulnerable people will be coerced to exchange organs for money, i.e. it focuses on the potential harm to the donor. This thesis will address the issue of whether this prohibition is justified and how much risk a paid donor should be allowed to assume. This essay will present a detailed investigation of an existing kidney trade in Israel, as well as a review of the nature and medical risks associated with kidney donation from a healthy kidney donor. It will also provide an overview of the legal provisions and case-law, pertaining to kidney transplant in Israeli law and Jewish law, and will seek answers to the silence of the legislator in different sources of law. This thesis will conclude with suggestions and recommendations for a statutory authorization of a market system of kidney transfer and will present a model of a health-transplant agency, in an effort to answer the growing demand for kidneys.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jutras, Daniel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k463f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm40b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074x19k"><dcterms:title>The Vietnamese Foreign Investment framework : an assessment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Plante, Carole Marie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the legislative framework governing foreign investment in Vietnam. More specifically, it focuses on the regulatory control exerted over foreign entities in the country. At the fulcrum of Vietnam's transition from a centrally-planned to a market-oriented economy, its foreign investment legislation is designed to attract the outside capital necessary to rebuild its infrastructure. Simultaneously, it must also allow the authorities to effectively screen the entry of foreign investment and supervise the operations of foreign enterprises. The various control mechanisms in the Vietnamese legislative framework are far too extensive and, as such, not only create an impediment to a greater flow of foreign direct investment in the country, but also account for a more difficult business environment. Amidst efforts to reconcile the tenets of market economy with communist ideology, the handling of foreign interests in Vietnam remains highly conditioned by various ideological, political, historical and cultural factors. This thesis concludes with a review of the underlying issues affecting the investment climate: the Vietnamese notion of private rights, the political risk at play for foreign investors and the country's legal development with regards to the principle of the rule of law.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, Gary F.

Part One is a historical introduction designed to provide a brief background knowledge and information necessary for a proper understanding of the geo-political and socio-economic foundation of air law in Kenya. It focuses on colonization process of East Africa with particular reference to Kenya. Part Two discusses the character and content of British air law and regulations exported to Kenya respecting aviation and attempts to analyse at the juridical basis of these regulations, Orders in Council and sub-delegated legislation. Effects on transition to independence on these laws is also examined in this part. Part Three identifies and analyses the major post-independence developments in air law and the present regulatory system. Kenya's practice with regard to international aviation treaties is also briefly discussed. The final part is an incursive summary of the preceding parts and possible conclusions drawn therefrom. Here, we also proffer some suggestions we think might be useful to Kenya's overall regulatory system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53wx84x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s6785</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>History, African.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w673j"><dcterms:title>Negotiating the boundaries : gender and community in India</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Narain, Vrinda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Personal laws regulate the family, which is the sphere in which Indian women experience the sharpest discrimination. Despite constitutional guarantees of equality and freedom from discrimination, Muslim personal law perpetuates the subordination of women within the family. The political manipulation of Muslim personal law reform by the State and by fundamentalist leaders has resulted in the marginalization of Muslim women's interests. This thesis focuses on the issue of Muslim women's equality within the family. It explores how arguments relating to 'religion', 'culture' and 'group identity' have been used to subordinate Muslim women. Their rights have been recast as oppositional to Muslim collective interests. In this context, there is a critical need to interrogate hegemonic categories that bind Muslim women to an essentialist notion of identity and deny the possibility of internal challenges to Muslim tradition. This thesis seeks to problematize and contest the exclusion of Muslim women's voices from the very discourse that attempts to define their rights and articulate their interests. It aims to reconceptualize and reformulate the frameworks within which inequality and discrimination are sought to be addressed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Colleen (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p0150.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w673j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women's Studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257g939"><dcterms:title>Privacy law issues for encryption and government control in Mexico</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mora Guerra, Mario Ivan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mexico is part of the dramatic change that information technologies are triggering worldwide and is thus subject to the potential risks of privacy that this "digitally conformable" world implies. Encryption may be a solution to this problem, but its use also involves important difficulties that some countries have tried to solve restricting its use, import or export. This thesis studies the legal challenge of achieving a balanced legislative answer that ensures maximum protection of privacy without conflicting with law enforcement. It also warns the Mexican Consultant Committee on Informatic Policies about the potential problems that the use of encryption technologies will create in Mexico and proposes some solutions. Mexico is urged to reform its laws pertaining to privacy and confidentiality, and to regulate the illegal and beneficial uses of encryption, in order to achieve a comprehensive and poised legal and administrative infrastructure for information technologies, privacy and encryption. We lay out basic legal parameters to shape a future encryption law in Mexico, emphasizing that the Mexican Government should guarantee that any Mexican can use, develop, market, import or export any encryption product, and that in no event should the Mexican Government impose any compulsory encryption standard. In order to control the criminal use of encryption, we suggest lawful compulsory decryption and certain encryption use restrictions in cases where these technologies are found to have been used to further a crime.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Johnston, David L.

In this area, the freedom of overflight is absolute, alike the freedom of navigation on International waters. No State can exercise its constraint power. Nowadays, the International Airspace is used in different ways, more or less legally. Sometimes, abuses can happen, for instance, a civil aircraft can use the International Airspace in order to "spy" military activities of a foreign State. In that case, the State, victim of the abuse, has essentially two ways to reply: legal means or armed force. Even in a case of reply to an abuse, International Law clearly prohibits from resorting to weapons against a civil aircraft located in or out the International Airspace. In spite of this prohibition, incidents are still happening.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.

This doctrine was abandoned in 1972 in the Bremen, where the United States Supreme Court established the presumption of validity of foreign forum selection clauses. However, the enforceability of such clauses is subject to certain exceptions which relate to particular applications of the general principles of contract law. The Bremen analysis was modified in 1991, when the Supreme Court decided Carnival Cruise, which limited the scope of such exceptions and strengthened the presumption of validity of forum selection clauses. In 1995, the Supreme Court decided Sky Reefer, overruling the lower court decision in Indussa, and extending the presumption of validity of foreign forum selection clauses to maritime bills of lading subject to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, William (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v94t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b37f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jt164"><dcterms:title>The crisis of unification of private air law : problems and solutions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lu, Angela Cheng-Jui.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals primarily with the air carrier's liability in the case of passenger death or bodily injury under Warsaw System. It analyzes the problems of today and tries to offer solutions for the present crisis of the Warsaw System for the future. The first chapter concentrates on an brief introduction of the development of the Warsaw System from the original Warsaw Convention, to the 1996 ICAO new draft instrument. The chapter gives the trend of development and explains the different characteristics of each Warsaw instrument. The second chapter analyses the shortcomings of the original Warsaw Convention by comparing the rationales of the air carrier's limited liability in 1929 and the requirements of today. In this way, this thesis seeks to present the limited liability of air carriers as unreasonable and out of date. In order to offer the suggestions and possible solutions for the future, the third chapter analyses the merits and shortcomings of the Warsaw Instruments, unilateral or group action, the ECAC recommendation, the IATA Intercarrier Agreement and its implementing Agreement, and the ICAO new draft instrument. Finally, for the integrity of the air carrier's liability, this thesis also briefly criticizes the shortcomings of baggage liability under the present Warsaw System and offers a better solution for baggage liability in the future. In the last chapter, the author introduces the related legal regime of the Republic of China, compares it with the Warsaw System and attempts to develop a method to link the Republic of China with the rest of world in the field of private air law.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182n19v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jt164</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62fb32h"><dcterms:title>Legal implications of mobile communication systems in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Logie, André N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The world of telecommunications has dramatically evolved these last few years. With the wind of liberalization blowing, private companies are playing a new role in an area where monopolistic public entities had always imposed their rules. New technologies are now opening broad perspectives which were even not forecast a few years ago. In only ten years, mobile communication systems have witnessed three different technologies and are now integrating the latest concept, satellite mobile communications called S-PCS (Satellite Personal Communication Systems, which is the faculty of being contacted at anytime, anywhere). New players are emerging from the United States and tend to impose their predominance to the world. With the award of a licence to operate by the Federal Communications Commission to them, three US companies have gained a headstart, which only one non-US company, Inmarsat ICO, seems capable to challenge. However, in order to achieve the global communications era of S-PCS, they will have to overcome implementation barriers such as the authorization to operate on a worldwide basis. Countries are not ready yet to relinquish their sovereignty on telecommunications and each company will have to be licensed in each country to be able to provide their service. If they can implement these new technologies, the new systems will definitely dominate the international mobile communication era for the next ten years.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jakhu, Ron (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jq750.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb32h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pv59x"><dcterms:title>Institutionalizing the balance : trade objectives and environmental concerns :</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Keersmaekers, Hendrik.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The interrelationship between trade objectives and environmental concerns lies at the heart of this research. After describing different trade regimes and environmental protection agreements, and offering the general framework of international law in which the trade-environment-development debate takes place, this thesis elaborates on the structures of international institutional authority that have been created through these trade regimes, environmental protection agreements and development organizations. A review of the existing international organizations will show us their strong points, usefulness and weaknesses, and will bring us to the statement of the necessity of new institutional authority in order to more effectively address the trade-environment-development issues at stake. On the one hand, the idea of a newly created Global Environmental Institution would highly improve the institutional potential in this debate, but is likely not a realistic option in the international arena of today. On the other hand, the option of institutional improvement and betterment of the existing international structures is more realistically feasible, and possibly the only way to achieve New Institutional Authority in the area of trade and environment today.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs63s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv59x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
