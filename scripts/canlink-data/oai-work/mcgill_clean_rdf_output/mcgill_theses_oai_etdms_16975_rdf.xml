The etiology of MS is unknown but many researchers believe that it is autoimmune mediated. This study investigated naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ T-cell homeostasis in patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. The naive T-cell compartment involves a balance between thymic production of naive T-cells, homeostatic proliferation and the delivery of death and survival signals. Naive T-cell production was quantified by measuring signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sj-TRECs); episomal byproducts formed during V(D)J T-cell receptor rearrangement. Homeostatic proliferation was quantified by flow cytometry analysis of % expression of CD31 and Ki-67. CD31 is a marker found on CD4+ recent thymic emigrants (RTE) but not on naive T-cells that have undergone homeostatic proliferation. CD31 can be used as a marker of the proliferation history of naive CD4+ T-cells. Ki-67 is a nuclear and nucleolar antigen found in actively cycling cells. It can be used as a marker of cell proliferation at the moment of isolation. Cell survival was measured by quantifying plasma IL-7 levels and by measuring Bcl-2 expressions. IL-7 plays an important role in maintaining and restoring peripheral naive T-cell homeostasis. It stimulates naive T-cell proliferation and prevents the reduction of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein. In this study, PPMS patients had significantly reduced naive CD4 + T-cell sj-TRECs compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0007) and compared to RRMS patients (p = 0.0010). RRMS patients had fewer sj-TRECs than healthy controls but this difference was not significant (p = 0.4652). Similarly, in PPMS, naive CD4+ T-cells had significantly lower CD31 expression than healthy controls (p = 0.0017) and RRMS patients (p = 0.0032). This finding indicates increased homeostatic proliferation in naive CD4 + T-cells in PPMS, most probably a response to decreased thymic export as marked by the decreased naive CD4+ T-cell sj-TRECs. % CD31 expression in naive CD4+ T-cells did not differ significantly in RRMS compared to healthy controls (p = 0.7455) which is consistent with their naive CD4+ sj-TREC levels. Naive CD8+ T-cell sj-TRECs were significantly reduced in PPMS patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0212) but not compared to RRMS patients (p = 0.2379). RRMS patients had fewer naive CD8 + T-cell sj-TRECs compared to healthy controls but this difference was not significant (p = 0.1517). PPMS patients expressed increased Bcl-2 levels in their naive CD8+ T-cells. This finding indicates upregulation of survival signals, most probably a consequence of reduced thymic export of naive CD8+ T-cells. The data from this study indicate that PPMS is different from RRMS in their naive CD4+ T-cell sj-TRECs and naive CD4 + T-cell % CD31 expression but is similar to RRMS in their naive CD8+ T-cell sj-TRECs. This study concludes, therefore, that both PPMS and RRMS patients have altered naive T-cell homeostasis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k880p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wp01t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Homeostasis -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive -- immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881q68m"><dcterms:title>Quebec hog producers' willingness to accept carbon credit revenue for adopting management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guo, Yi, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Canada's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol provides agricultural producers with an opportunity to supply carbon offset credits to a domestic carbon market and receive revenue from the sale of these credits. This study employed the multiple bounded discrete choice method to estimate Quebec hog producers' willingness to accept compensation to adopt two management practices that reduce carbon emissions; i.e. reduced protein feeding and adopting a manure storage cover. The average willingness to accept compensation for reduced protein feeding was $46.71 per tonne of CO2 equivalent and for the manure storage cover was $40.40 per tonne of CO2 equivalent. In addition, hog producers were asked what cost they would be willing to bear if they received $20 per animal unit in carbon offset credit revenue. The average cost they were willing to bear was $11.88. Key factors that influenced producers' decisions were identified. Results can be used to improve the institutional rules and public policy associated with developing a domestic carbon emission trading mechanism. Starting-point and sequencing bias were tested for with the convolution approach. Starting-point bias was found in all the hypothetical situations; while sequencing bias was not found.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c619t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881q68m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Greenhouse gas mitigation -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emissions trading -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon offsetting -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pork industry and trade -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pv24c"><dcterms:title>Selective increase of neuronal cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in vulnerable brain regions of rats with experimental Wernicke's encephalopathy : effects of nimesulide</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gu, Baoying.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric disorder resulting from thiamine deficiency (TD) and is characterized by neuronal loss, astrocytic proliferation and microglial activation.

More than 22,000 individuals representing 716 species were collected using pan traps, sweeping and Malaise traps. Restored and abandoned sites were similar to each other and both distinct from natural sites as shown by small-size class, acalyptrate and trophic assemblages. However, abandoned sites showed much lower evenness and generally supported lower species richness than restored and natural sites, due to the dominance of one or two saprophagous species. The coverage of bare peat, Sphagnum mosses and ericaceous shrubs explained most of the variance in species composition. Those results suggest that restoration enhanced the recovery of high species diversity, although more than seven years are needed to recover a complete trophic structure or to enable species with low dispersal ability to recolonize to pre-disturbance levels.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r902v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395wc22t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wetland restoration -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diptera -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peat bogs -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xw65c"><dcterms:title>Positron emission tomography of extra-striatal dopamine release</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gravel, Paul.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Altered dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

To measure extra-striatal DA release, where D2/D3 receptor concentrations are much smaller, an approach using a high affinity radioligand, such as [18F]Fallypride, is required. The aim of the present study was to investigate in healthy volunteers the suitability of [ 18F]Fallypride to measure variations in D2/D3 receptor occupancy, as a function of amphetamine-induced DA release, in extra-striatal regions. Six healthy male volunteers underwent two 18F-Fallypride PET sessions, following the double-blind oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg of d-amphetamine (Dexedrine) or placebo (lactose), counter-balanced for order. Following amphetamine administration, D2/D3 receptor occupancy of 18F-Fallypride was significantly reduced in striatum, but also in extra-striatal regions, including substantia nigra, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortical areas.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rs53k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xw65c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptors, Dopamine D3 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Benzamides -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Dopamine D2 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corpus Striatum -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pyrrolidines -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Positron-Emission Tomography -- methods.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hp079"><dcterms:title>Understanding the basis of 5-Bromo-2'-deoxuridine teratogen specificity in organogenesis stage mouse embryos</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gnanabakthan, Naveen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analogue, is genotoxic and teratogenic.

The goal of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that development is disturbed at sites where BrdU is incorporated into DNA, triggering oxidative stress and c-Fos induction. Gestation day 9 CD-1 mice were treated with BrdU and embryos were obtained for immunolocalization of BrdU, 8-oxoguanine, a biomarker for oxidative stress, and c-Fos. BrdU incorporation into DNA was dispersed throughout the embryo. In contrast, the staining for 8-oxoguanine and c-Fos were highest in the neuroepithelium. BrdU incorporation was not affected by the pre-administration of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant, although both 8-oxoguanine and c-Fos staining were decreased. Thus, the response of the embryo to insult is tissue specific.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf10q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp079</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Abnormalities, Drug-Induced -- embryology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acetylcysteine -- administration &amp; dosage.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guanine -- analogs &amp; derivatives.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Embryo, Mammalian -- drug effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transcription Factor AP-1 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxidative Stress -- drug effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bromodeoxyuridine -- toxicity.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xd31k"><dcterms:title>Collapse transition of SARWs with hydrophobic interaction on a two dimensional lattice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gaudreault, Mathieu.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We study the collapse transition of a lattice based protein model including an explicit coarse-grained model of a solvent. This model accounts for explicit hydrophobic interactions, and it is studied by Monte Carlo simulation. The protein is modelled as self-avoiding random walk with nearest neighbor interactions on a two dimensional lattice. Without the solvent, universal quantities of the chain around the collapse transition temperature are well known. Hydrophobicity is then modelled through a lattice of solvent molecules in which each molecule can have Q states depending of an orientation variable. Only one state is energetically favored, when two neighboring solvent molecules are both in the same state of orientation. The monomers are placed in interstitial position of the solvent lattice, and are only allowed to occupy sites surrounded by solvent cells of the same orientation. The potential of mean force between two interstitial solute molecules is calculated, showing a solvent mediated attraction typical of hydrophobic interactions. We then show that this potential increases with the energy of hydrogen bond formation as it appears in the model, while its characteristic range decreases. More importantly, we show that the chain embedded in the solvent undergoes a collapse transition, with the temperature of the transition being shifted relative to that of the chain in isolation. We calculate several critical exponents near the collapse transition, and we observe that their values are not conserved in presence of the explicit solvent.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117s55x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xd31k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Self-avoiding walks (Mathematics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein folding -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859k30s"><dcterms:title>Convergence results on Fourier series in one variable on the unit circle</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ferns, Ryan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an analysis of convergence results on Fourier series.

A total of 8,808,798 test-day records from 566,736 Holstein cows in 5,183 different herds, and 416,883 test-day records from 26,973 Ayrshire cows in 652 different herds covering a period of five years were obtained from the Quebec dairy herd improvement agency (Valacta). In addition to test-day records, information on lactation, animal status, feed composition and feeding systems was also available. For both Ayrshire and Holstein cows the fixed effect of Feeding System*DIMB (Blocks of 15 days in milk) was a significant effect in predictive models of daily milk, milk-fat, protein, and lactose yields and on milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentration. Cows served a diet prepared with a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) compared to cows served a diet in a Traditional way tended to have higher peak milk yields and appeared to have a stronger persistency after peak milk yield. TMR-fed cows also showed a tendency for higher milk-fat, protein, and lactose yields and lower MUN concentrations than Traditionally-fed ones. Significantly higher milk yields (peak to 135 days in milk) and higher milk-fat and protein yields (peak to mid-lactation) were found in TMR-fed cows compared to Traditionally-fed ones in 3rd parity Holsteins. Both milk-fat and protein-yield lactation curves of TMR-fed cows displayed a different pattern than Traditionally-fed cows. The fixed effect of the Grain diet*DIMB was found to be a significant effect in predictive models of milk and milk-protein yields of both Ayrshire and Holstein. It was also found to be a significant effect in predictive model of MUN concentration but only in 2nd parity Ayrshire. The effect was non-significant in predictive models of both milk-fat or lactose yields. A tendency for higher milk and milk-protein yields, and lower MUN values was seen when cows received Corn Grain or High Moisture Corn compared to Barley or Commercial Concentrate but no significant differences were observed. It was concluded that a tendency for higher milk and components yields can be observed when cows are fed with a TMR compared to a Traditional system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f21k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w827v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Milk -- Composition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Milk yield.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Feeding and feeds.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A736668377"><dcterms:title>Field-scale nutrient transport monitoring and modeling of subsurface and naturally drained agricultural lands</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Eastman, Mark, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Eutrophication impacts the quality of many surface waters worldwide. Algal blooms threaten lake water quality and in order to control their growth, understanding of nutrient transport at the field-scale is essential. In order to accomplish this, a combination of field monitoring and computer modeling with the SWAT model was undertaken. Four sites located in the Pike River watershed of southern Quebec were instrumented to monitor nutrient losses from both clay loam and sandy loam soils under both subsurface and naturally drained conditions. Results illustrate how the presence of subsurface drainage influences phosphorus loss depending on soil texture and structure. Total phosphorus loss from the clay loam subsurface drained site was 4.0 kg ha-1, 55% greater than the naturally drained clay loam site. Total phosphorus loss from the sandy loam subsurface drained site was 1.2 kg ha-1, 14% less than the naturally drained sandy loam site. Total phosphorus losses from the subsurface drainage systems in the clay loam field and the sandy loam field were 2.3 and 0.4 kg ha-1, respectively. Particulate phosphorus was the dominant (78%) form of phosphorus loss from the subsurface drainage system at the clay loam site. This indicates that bypass flow through the soil profile in the clay loam field led to excessive total phosphorus loss. SWAT, a watershed-scale model was calibrated with over 6 site years of data, in an attempt to simulate hydrology and pollutant transport at the field-scale. After calibration, the monthly Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency varied from 0.09 to 0.74 for total drainage; 0.04 to 0.71 for sediment loading; 0.29 to 0.48 for nitrate loads and 0.28 to 0.64 for total phosphorus loads. Overall, SWAT has shown that it has the ability to simulate long-term sediment and nutrient transport at the field-scale. This makes SWAT a valuable tool for the development and evaluation of various beneficial management practices which control sediment and nutrient loss from agricultural fields.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p230.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736668377</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Pike River Watershed (Vt. and Québec).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural pollution -- Pike River Watershed (Vt. and Québec).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hw356"><dcterms:title>Differential regulation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitin ligases downstream of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Durrant, Michael, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases are important negative regulators of multiple receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, and participate in a wide variety of cellular processes. Uncoupling of Cbl-mediated negative regulation allows activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Met receptor to escape degradation, enhancing their oncogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Despite the consequences of loss of Cbl-mediated negative regulation for human disease, little is known about the mechanisms regulating Cbl protein levels themselves. In this thesis work, I demonstrate a differential regulation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b downstream of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Cbl-b protein levels decrease in response to Met kinase activity, whereas c-Cbl levels remain stable. Cbl-b is partially degraded in a proteasome-dependant manner. This requires Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase activity and a carboxy terminal domain region located between the RING and UBA domains. I conclude that the regulation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b differs downstream of Met, and propose that negative regulation of Cbl-b by a dysregulated Met receptor may contribute to tumourigenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xj491.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hw356</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases -- physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vv54g"><dcterms:title>Small-scale secondary anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dudley, Jonathan, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the main harbingers of the modern age of precision cosmology, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has proven itself to be a veritable trove of cosmological information. With the aid of experiments such as the WMAP satellite, precision measurements of the CMB anisotropy spectra are now being made. This work will first explore the physics of the Vishniac effect, a small-scale CMB temperature anisotropy created by the Compton scattering of CMB photons by free electrons caught in a line-of-sight bulk flow. The Vishniac effect arises due to a density enhancement in the electrons caused by gravitational potentials in both the linear and nonlinear regimes and contributes significant power to the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum on small scales. This effect is strongly dependent upon cosmology and as such this dependence is investigated for all experimentally-allowed values of the fundamental cosmological parameters. This analysis is performed for both the linear Vishniac effect as well as its nonlinear extension. Following this analysis a fitting function, capable of predicting the power generated by the Vishniac effect over a range of scales for any allowed cosmology, is investigated. This function proves to be an accurate and efficient way of computing the Vishniac effect for any input cosmology. The next small-scale phenomenon to be explored is the small-scale CMB polarization anisotropies generated by Thomson scattering of the local photon quadrupole anisotropy during reionization. The underlying physics behind this effect are studied along with the observational information it potentially contains. Observational data of the remote quadrupole is capable of improving constraints in the CMB temperature anisotropy spectrum on scales of ℓ ~ 11 as well as offering information concerning the reconstruction of the primordial density perturbations on gigaparsec scales in our local universe.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tq601.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vv54g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Anisotropy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cosmic background radiation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xz736"><dcterms:title>Evidence for the involvement of the zinc cluster protein Asg1p in the transcriptional regulation of some stress response genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Drolet, Jessica Ann.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Saccharomyces cerevisiae has developed mechanisms in order to survive harsh environmental conditions.

Recently, our lab has begun to characterize a member of the zinc cluster protein family: Asg1p (Activator of Stress Genes, systematic name: YIL130W), which is presumed to stimulate stress response genes independently of the Hsflp and Msn2/4p pathways. Previous work has revealed five target genes of Asg1p (HSP30, STP4, YER130C, TPO2, YRO2) thought to be involved in this novel stress response pathway. In this study, we attempted to better characterize the role of Asg1p and its target genes during stress induction. We first determined if the induction of certain Asg1p target genes by stress is strain specific. HSP30 induction by heat shock is specific to the W303 strain as shown by primer extension analysis. We then generated the deletion strains Deltaasg1 and Astp4 in W303. We observed a loss of induction of HSP30 in the Deltaasg1 deletion strain when cells were exposed to ethanol. This led us to believe that Asg1p does play a role in the stress response pathway. Also, we attempted to globally define the target sites of Asg1p in vivo on a genome-wide scale by combining Chromatin Immuno Precipitation with microarrays (ChIP-chip). We identified eight putative Asg1p target genes: YRO2, HSP78, ZRT2, ZRT1, MSN4, STP4, TPO2, and HSP30.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795c44d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xz736</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc Fingers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal -- genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vv55r"><dcterms:title>Gait dynamics on a cross-slope walking surface</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dixon, Philippe.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Though the biomechanics of level walking have been studied extensively, the adaptations required for cross-slope locomotion are still largely unknown despite being a common terrain characteristic.

Statistical analyses were made across limbs (down-slope (DS) and up-slope (US)) and across slope condition (level (0°) and cross-slope (6°)) (2X2 ANOVA). Ten healthy male volunteers performed several barefoot walking trials. The lower-limbs responded asymmetrically to the cross-slope condition by substantially changing (1) the medio-lateral GRF, (2) the sagittal and frontal plane kinematics as well as step-width, and (3) the medio-lateral JRF and frontal plane JRM. The modest cross-slope induced important asymmetrical changes in locomotor patterns and may represent a substantial physical obstacle to populations with restricted mobility.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk281.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vv55r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gait in humans.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Walking.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fg455"><dcterms:title>Early second trimester amniotic fluid erythropoietin and pregnancy outcomes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Di Giovanni, Jessica Louise.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The study objective was to determine whether early 2 nd trimester amniotic fluid (AF) erythropoietin (EPO) was associated with and predictive of (a) development of maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) and (b) the infant outcome parameters of (i) gestational age at birth (GAAB) assessed exclusively among spontaneous vaginal deliveries or (ii) birth weight (measured in grams and percentiles). Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay was used to determine the EPO concentration of 170 biobanked AF samples. Student's t-test revealed no difference between GDM and non-GDM subjects. AF EPO was not predictive of GAAB despite being significantly greater among preterm infants compared to post-term infants. In contrast, AF EPO was significantly higher among the smallest infants using both birth weight classification schemes. However, following inclusion of known covariates AF EPO was predictive of gram birth weight only. Early 2nd trimester AF EPO may emerge as a useful biomarker of fetal nutritional status and/or growth.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm85c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fg455</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Erythropoietin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetus -- Growth.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amniotic liquid -- Analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Birth weight.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diabetes in pregnancy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gh47h"><dcterms:title>The characterization of CXCL12, CXCL8, CXCL1 and HGF in five human uveal melanoma cell lines /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Di Cesare, Sebastian, 1983-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Uveal Melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults. Despite the advances in numerous ophthalmic techniques leading to the increased accuracy of diagnosing this malignancy, the ten-year mortality rate for patients has remained unchanged at approximately fifty percent. Knowing this, further understanding of the specific steps that occur within the metastatic cascade of uveal melanoma is required. Our laboratory utilizes five human uveal melanoma cell lines (92.1, SP6.5, MKT-BR, OCM-1, UW-1) of known proliferative, invasive, and metastatic potential. We used four methods to characterize the presence and roles of the chemotactic factors CXCL12, CXCL8, CXCL1 and HGF in these five cell lines. We also used a novel peptide inhibitor (TN14003) to block the biological action of CXCL12 on its receptor CXCR4. With the results obtained from this thesis, we were able to establish the novel presence and importance of the four chosen factors for this malignancy. We were also able to display the positive effects TN14003 had on inhibiting uveal melanoma cell migration in vitro. This may lead to a future therapeutic target, which ultimately may delay or inhibit the metastatic process in uveal melanoma patients, improving the present unaffected ten-year mortality rate.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z709135h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gh47h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemokines, CXC.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, CXCR4 -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Uveal Neoplasms -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Melanoma -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Melanoma -- secondary.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612s22f"><dcterms:title>The role of Ras and Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR-1) in breast cancer in progression and metastasis /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>De Cristofano, Sabrina.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Ras signaling cascade is a vital component in the processes that mediate cell survival, growth, differentiation and transformation through activation of MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase). The recent discovery of a new scaffold of the Ras signaling pathway, Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR), is found to be a positive effector of Ras signaling which further contributes to proliferation and transformation in the ERK/MAPK pathway. This thesis describes the roles of Ras and Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR-1) in regulating the expression of tumor promoting genes such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in the development and progression of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Ras and KSR increase the proliferative capacity and migration of MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cells in vitro. In contrast, Ras and KSR decrease the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, uPA gene expression levels do not correlate with uPA protein expression levels suggesting a possible mutation induced by KSR and/or Ras. In vivo studies reveal that Ras and KSR increase tumor volume in mice, as well as more advanced osteolytic bone metastases. Collectively, these results indicate that Ras and KSR play significant roles in breast cancer development and metastasis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk299.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612s22f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>ras Proteins -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Signal Transduction -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasm Metastasis -- physiopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breast Neoplasms -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein Kinases -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hp08k"><dcterms:title>Personal narratives : collective grief, the echoes of a disaster</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Steinberg, Abby D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to locate the experience of individuals in the shared experience of a cultural community, to reveal a collective experience. Further, this thesis aspires to demonstrate that the experience of trauma is transmitted, often silently, intergenerationally. This is an attempt to define a community of distant survivors, and to locate the echoes of the voice of trauma hidden in the narratives of its members. The study explores the events of the December 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami. At the moment of the tsunami disaster all the participants in this study, Indonesian International Students, were studying in Montreal Canada. The impetus behind this qualitative inquiry into the essential experience of trauma is the desire to bring the experience of distant survivors to the foreground; to recognize vicarious victims by listening for echoes in their narratives. The aim of this thesis is to (1) locate personal narratives in the context of collective grief, (2) detect the re-creation of that grief in subsequent generations. This project has been undertaken with the hope of determining ever more effective social work practices for today's survivors, and of sparking interest in trauma research for tomorrow's victims.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558h780.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp08k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2004.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Post-traumatic stress disorder.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Disasters -- Social aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301505z"><dcterms:title>Shared experiences : a qualitative study of the impact of a diagnosis of terminal illness on family functioning</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Davidson, Melissa J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this qualitative research is to provide an in-depth exploration of the impact that a diagnosis of a terminal illness has on family functioning. The goal is to gain insight into adult children's personal experience when a parent is diagnosed with a terminal form of cancer. This study explores how families respond, adapt and cope when this specific family member is diagnosed with a terminal illness. It also explores any significant changes in relationships within the family and any shifts in the roles of the members and how they adjusted to such shifts. The study is informed by a phenomenological paradigm and used an explorative, qualitative design, which included semi-structured interviews. Participant text and "found poetry" is used in order to present a more accurate account of the participants' experiences. Found poetry provides an opportunity to hear the participant's voices by taking direct quotes from their transcripts and forming them into a poem. Themes of denial, anger, helplessness, hope and anticipatory grief/mourning are portrayed in the findings of this study. The difficult emotional dilemmas and tensions that people have to work through when faced with a family member dying are discussed. The realization of the loss of future relationships will be identified as one of the greatest impacts of the illness. This study shows the lack of professional supports and resources that are available for each participant's family in being faced with the diagnosis of a terminal illness, and will address a needed consideration for social work practice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514np97k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301505z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cancer -- Patients -- Family relationships.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Critically ill -- Family relationships.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chronically ill -- Family relationships.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816r154"><dcterms:title>Poetic afterthought : seven pieces for orchestra</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chang, Yuli, 1982-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Poetic Afterthought is an original music composition for orchestra (2-2-2-2 / 4-2-2-1 / timp-perc / piano-harp / strings).

The artistic project gave way to a reflection on the directional aspects of music in order to establish transitional links between independent musical entities defined as 'musical objects'. The main transitional agent between these entities consisted of an autonomous musical layer bearing an exclusive impact on the surrounding musical context. The harmonic network of the piece, a set of interchangeable chord progressions, was conceived from the self-replication of a three-note cell.

Review of these policies reveals that the OTP prefers to act on referrals of situations by states and the Security Council, rather than to employ its proprio motu investigatory powers. While the OTP has effectively defined the threshold for the gravity of the crimes that it will prosecute, a number of other discretionary criteria that inform the OTP's exercise of jurisdiction remain undefined. Additionally, the OTP's acceptance of state 'waivers of complementarity' moves in the direction of establishing a quasi-exclusive jurisdiction for the OTP. This thesis will critically evaluate these policies, and propose a recasting of the OTP's prosecution strategy towards the promotion of domestic war crimes prosecutions. It posits that the ICC OTP can act as a catalyst for domestic war crimes prosecutions, by serving in an advisory and support role. The OTP thus has the opportunity to breathe life into the complementarity regime and advance the global struggle against impunity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cm269.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644w33g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Prosecution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>War crime trials.</dc:subject><dc:subject>International Criminal Court.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kf30p"><dcterms:title>Legal aspects of commercial space transportation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mugarra, Leire.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The commercial space transportation industry is growing with the technology that creates more capable spacecrafts to access space.

After two decades of civil war, Ugandans enacted their first popular constitution in 1995. However, the judiciary's dominant positivist ideology, Matovu's ghost, still haunts the new legal order. The author sets out this ideology's presumptions and then critiques them against an alternative, pluralist map of laws in Uganda. The constructive analysis of recent case law (or lack thereof) that follows shows how this ideology undermines the constitution's promises of equality and freedom. This pluralist methodology is also essential to explain contemporary crises like the Lord's Resistance Army, arms proliferation in Karamoja and Museveni's "no-party" rule. In conclusion, exorcising Matovu's ghost is a priority for Ugandans and the process deserves considered thought for legal scholars advocating the "rule of law" or interventions by the International Criminal Court.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rz23b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk302</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law -- Uganda -- Philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Legal positivism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Customary law -- Uganda.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Uganda.
