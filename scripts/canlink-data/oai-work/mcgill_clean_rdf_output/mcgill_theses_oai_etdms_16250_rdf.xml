However, until now, we did not know which elements of these systems and to what degree these elements improve outcome. Trauma systems and the components which comprise them were originally devised based on expert opinion. They have subsequently been shown to significantly improve the outcome of injured patients in many systems throughout the world over the last thirty years. Our primary objective was to bring an evidence-based approach to the creation and running of trauma systems, based on outcomes related to specific elements which make up the structure of the systems and contribute to the process of care which make up these systems. The series of projects which comprise this thesis have attempted to dissect trauma systems into their basic components and then attribute specific outcomes to each element in order to enable the creation of evidence-based, cost-effective trauma systems for the future. To our knowledge, this is the first study to ever look at trauma systems in this way and hence creates benchmarks for future research in this area. Evidence-based, component-oriented analysis can be successfully applied to the evaluation of trauma care systems. Results from these analyses can be used to define variables which impact positively on outcome for injured patients and to what degree. The results of this study can be used to create new systems and update current systems in an evidence-based manner which will lead to improved outcomes and cost-efficiency in these systems. This is the first study to evaluate the specific elements which go into building a trauma system/trauma center. These elements were created by committees based on their experience in treating trauma patients in urban hospitals and in war-time scenarios. The creation of these systems was not evidence-based and although these systems have been shown to work and improve outcomes, we now understand which elements of these systems are responsible for the improvement in outcome, to what degree these elements contribute to improve outcome, and which elements do not.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p3894.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s80h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Evidence-Based Medicine.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Regional Medical Programs -- organization &amp; administration -- Quebec.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Regional Medical Programs -- organization &amp; administration -- North America.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emergency Medical Services -- organization &amp; administration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trauma Centers -- organization &amp; administration.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v207c"><dcterms:title>Plurisubharmonic solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Qun, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we study the plurisubharmonic solutions to certain kind of fully nonlinear elliptic equations in complex variables. The most natural class of this type of equations involves the k-th elementary symmetric functions in terms of the complex Hessian matrix of a plurisubharmonic function, while the complex Monge-Ampere equation is one special example. In the first part of our thesis, we study the complex Hessian matrix of a plurisubharmonic solution to some Hessian equation, and conclude that it has constant rank under certain conditions on the fully nonlinear equation. Our result is useful in deducing a strictly plurisubharmonic solution to certain geometric problem as well as guarantees the existence of foliations through a work by Bedford-Kalka. For a general fully nonlinear elliptic equation, we could also establish a constant rank result on the complex Hessian matrix of the solution, which has been applied to the study of extremal metrics in the second part. We present a uniqueness theorem of the Kahler-Einstein metric with the help of constant rank result if the Ricci curvature tensor satisfies certain fully nonlinear elliptic equation. Finally we consider a generalized pluri-Green function in a complex manifold, whose singularity lies on a totally real manifold, in other words, we study a plurisubharmonic solution to a homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equation with singularity on a totally real manifold. We demonstrate the existence of such a solution in the weak sense, and some interesting discussions on it as well.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t291b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v207c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plurisubharmonic functions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Differential equations, Nonlinear -- Numerical solutions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Differential equations, Elliptic -- Numerical solutions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053k80h"><dcterms:title>Effects of long-term estrogen exposure on cognition and activity in old mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lauzon, Patricia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To assess the effect of estrogen (E2) on memory deficits in very old mice, a delayed matching-to-position test was employed in a Water T-maze. First, normal mice were tested at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 21 months, and 25 months of age. The 6-12-18 mo old performed at 80% correct while the 21 and 25 mo performed at chance level. Memory deficits occurred in normal aging mice between 18 to 21 months of age. Second, mice ovariectomized (OVX) at 14 months were divided into 3 treatment groups and 3 age groups (21 months, 23 months and 24 months). One group received long-term continuous E2 treatment, one group received cholesterol treatment, and one group started on cholesterol but switched to E2 treatment so that they were E2 treated at the time of testing. The 21 and 23 long-term E2 exposure groups performed at 80% correct, as did the 6, 12, and 18 month old normal subjects. Mice that received cholesterol or cholesterol/E 2 performed like the 21 and 25 month old control mice, and did not learn the task. Third, to assess the nature of the deficits one group (A) was trained at 18 months and retrained at 23 months, compared to another group (B) which was trained at 23 months only. Group A reached 70% correct responses on original training and 80% correct responses at retraining, while B never exceeded chance level. Thus, data suggest that old mice are impaired in acquisition of the task. Results of this research support other recent findings in rats and humans suggesting that there may be a time window within dependent which E2 therapy has a beneficial effect on cognition in old age.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k58q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053k80h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cognition -- Age factors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Estrogen -- Therapeutic use.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hg67b"><dcterms:title>Function of Nck adaptor proteins in the unfolded protein response and glucose homeostasis in mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Latreille, Mathieu.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), an intracellular signaling network aimed at alleviating stress through the coordinated inhibition of mRNA translation and the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone genes. A few years ago, we identified an interaction between Nck signaling adaptors and the beta-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2beta). We ascertained that overexpression of Nck1 antagonizes ER stress-mediated inhibition of translation by decreasing phosphorylation of eIF2beta on Ser51 by the PERK ser/thr protein kinase. In this thesis, I determined that Nck overexpression prevents the induction of ATF4 and CHOP genes associated with eIF2beta phosphorylation in ER stress conditions. Conversely, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient of Nck1 and Nck2 genes (Nck1-/-Nck2-/-) show increased levels of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP in response to ER stress, further supporting a role for Nck in regulating the translational arm of the UPR. Concurrently, I found that Nck adaptors localize at the ER and are part of an eIF2beta holophosphatase complex containing PP1c, a ser/thr phosphatase that dephosphorylates eIF2beta on Ser51. Unexpectedly, however, I observed that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated Nck1 depletion results in decreased levels of eIF2beta phosphorylation and GADD34 induction in ER-stressed cells. Moreover, I uncovered a direct and SH2-mediated interaction between Nck and PERK. I provided strong evidence that PERK is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vitro and demonstrated that Tyr561 located in PERK juxtamembrane domain is virtually essential for the association with Nck adaptors. Therefore, I proposed that during the process of PERK activation, Tyr561 is phosphorylated and creates a binding site for Nck adaptors. I hypothesized that Nck is required for proper targeting and phosphorylation of eIF2beta by PERK. To demonstrate this in vivo, I took advantage that obesity in mice causes ER stress in specific tissues. My data validate my hypothesis as eIF2beta phosphorylation levels in liver and adipose tissue of obese mice were decreased by 45% in mice genetically inactivated of the nck1 gene. Characterization of glucose homeostasis in normal and obese Nck-/- and Nck2-/- knockout mice revealed marked alteration in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to controls, thereby shedding light on a new physiological function for these signaling adaptors in controlling glycaemia in vivo.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bg23m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg67b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Signal Transduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Endoplasmic Reticulum -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Homeostasis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oncogene Proteins -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood Glucose -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445ch82b"><dcterms:title>Regulation and functional profile of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein in monkey primary visual cortex during postnatal development and activity-dependent plasticity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lalonde, Jasmin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has long been known that there is a critical period of development during which neurons in area V1 adopt their final wiring patterns. How this is achieved is a poorly understood but important question as failure to make appropriate connections is associated with irreversible impairments in visual function. Studies presented in this thesis intend to better understand developmental differences in regulation and downstream genomic targets of cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB) protein in the monkey primary visual neocortex (area V1) in response to monocular enucleation (ME). CREB signaling in neural cells has been extensively studied and is known to be important to events such as neuronal survival, cellular differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. In area V1, specifically, evidences suggest that normal CREB function is key to activity-dependent plasticity induced by monocular deprivation during the critical period of development. However, the exact nature of CREB-dependent gene transcription during ocular dominance (OD) plasticity and whether CREB function persists similarly after the end of the critical period remains unknown. In this thesis, I provide new insights to these questions. Chapter One of this thesis is a general review that summarizes our current understanding of three specific topics: (1) timing of the visual critical period of development, (2) the molecular basis of OD plasticity induced by monocular deprivation during the critical period, as well as (3) characteristics of neuroplastic changes in "post-critical period" area V1. In Chapters Two, I present new experimental results that support the idea that the Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase IV (CaMKIV), a known calcium-dependent activator of CREB function never examined in area V1, may contribute to postnatal maturation of the visual cortex and the neuroplastic changes induced by monocular enucleation (ME). Next, in Chapters Three and Four, I provide new insights about CREB regulation and function in young (critical period) and adult monkey primary visual neocortex after partial removal of visual input. Chapter Five is a general discussion in which I first address methodological and theoretical issues. Last, I suggest directions for future research and discuss how a better understanding of these topics may contribute to a more complete description of the molecular underpinnings of visual cortex plasticity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zm35d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445ch82b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Visual cortex -- Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666829j"><dcterms:title>Étude électrophysiologique des différents stades de traitement de l'information visuelle chez l'individu ayant subi un traumatisme craniocérébral</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lachapelle, Julie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of acquired brain damage in humans. Its clinical presentation is complex, heterogeneous and it is important to rapidly determine which individuals will present which types of deficits and intervention needs in order to help them attain their full recuperation potential. The general goal of this thesis was to measure the impact of a TBI on visual and cognitive information processing using various electrophysiological paradigms, including visual evoked potentials (VEP) of different complexity levels (pattern reversal, simple motion, texture), cognitive event-related potentials (ERP), and motor reaction times (RT). The aim of the first study was to evaluate if, in a normal subject, an information processing delay could be measured between low-level VEPs and texture-segregation VEPs (tsVEP), in order to determine which one was the more complex to process by the visual system. Results showed that texture segregation is a time-consuming process that could not follow variations as rapid as those possible for low-level processes, and that texture segregation thus reflects a more complex level of analysis. In the second study we wanted to determine if tsVEPs could help to better objectify and describe deficits in information processing occurring after TBI. We found an increase in tsVEP latency for TBI individuals compared to normal controls. These results suggested that complex visual analysis can be affected following traumatic cerebral injury, and that the tsVEP was able to detect deficits which remain silent with conventional clinical measures The purpose of the third study was to evaluate, using various ERP paradigms, visual and cognitive information processing in milder forms of symptomatic TBI. We also assessed the prognostic value of these electrophysiological techniques in regards to vocational outcome following specialized clinical interventions. Our results showed that the most complex measures (tsVEP, cognitive ERP, RT) were sensitive enough to reveal information processing deficits in mild TBI, and the speed of processing as evaluated with complex stimuli represents a good predictor of return to work.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qq765.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666829j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pattern Recognition, Visual.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evoked Potentials, Visual -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vision Disorders -- etiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evoked Potentials -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain Injuries -- complications.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain Injuries -- psychology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah128nj32r"><dcterms:title>Achievement goals, intrinsic goals, and musicians' performance</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lacaille, Nathalie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of the present program of research was to consider how two contemporary theories in the domain of human motivation---achievement goal theory and self-determination theory---could illuminate processes taking place during artistic performance. More specifically, achievement goal theory suggests that the goals one pursues are good predictors of how well one functions at the cognitive, affective and behavioral levels. Our aim was to explore the association between different types of goals (i.e., performance-approach, performance-avoidance, mastery, and intrinsic-aesthetic) and performing artists' affective states and performance. Educational research on achievement goals suggests that both mastery goals and performance-approach goals are beneficial for students, whereas performance-avoidance goals are harmful. Study 1 examined whether these results would generalize to the domains of music and sports. Elite athletes and musicians reported their goals prior to a peak and a catastrophic performance. The results among athletes mirrored findings in the educational domain with both mastery and performance-approach goals being associated with optimal functioning. The results among musicians, however, diverged in showing that performance goals were markedly more detrimental than mastery goals, and that intrinsic goals associated with a focus on aesthetic enjoyment were particularly helpful for musicians. Study 2 and 3 used a prospective design to further examine the relation of performance approach, performance avoidance, mastery, and intrinsic goals to performance and affective states of performing artists. Study 2 included actors, dancers, and musicians, and explored their goals prior to their end-of-the year public performance and subsequent emotional and performance outcomes. The results paralleled those obtained in study 1: both types of performance goals (approach and avoidance) were associated with negative emotional outcomes, while only intrinsic goals were associated with positive performance and emotional outcomes. Study 3 expanded on study 2 by exploring the association of various motives and the learning context with achievement goal orientation. The results again confirmed our initial hypothesis that intrinsic-aesthetic goals were those associated with better affective states and performance. Results also demonstrate that students who perceived the teacher as being supportive tended to adopt mastery and intrinsic goals. Together, the findings of our three studies provide support for the positive value of holding intrinsic goals in artistic performance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr59c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nj32r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motivation (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Athletes -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Musicians -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Goal (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579w87f"><dcterms:title>Investigating the role of the von Hippel Lindau protein in tumor suppression through regulation of extracellular matrix assembly</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kurban, Ghada.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The VHL disease is a multisystem tumor disorder resulting from inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. VHL tumors are highly vascularized and can metastasize in the case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). VHL was shown to operate along at least two evolutionarily conserved pathways with the first involving binding and degradation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) and downregulation of its target genes including transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This results in suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis. The second less extensively studied pathway involves regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the main focus of this thesis. We investigate the dependence of the VHL-ECM pathway on HIF and show, using in vitro and in vivo models that VHL leads to ECM assembly in a HIF-independent manner. We find that loss of the VHL-ECM pathway correlates with increased angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and tissue invasion. Our results lead to the identification of a novel VHL binding partner, collagen IV alpha 2 (COL4A2). We find this interaction to be direct and mediated by ER hydroxylation. We observe the VHL-COL4A2 interaction to occur at the ER prior to collagen IV secretion, leading to collagen IV network formation. Loss of this interaction is associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) activation, collagen IV remodeling and correlates with increased invasiveness and angiogenic tumor formation. We conclude that COL4A2 is the mediator of the VHL-ECM pathway. Collectively, these results provide an exciting venue linking the VHL tumor suppressor protein to ECM regulation and emphasize the importance of the VHL-COL4A2 interaction in suppression of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in the VHL disease.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd34w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w87f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hippel-Lindau Disease -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Extracellular Matrix -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carcinoma, Renal Cell -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Collagen Type IV -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hk20t"><dcterms:title>The conceptual design of robotic architectures using complexity criteria /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khan, Waseem A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In robot design, the selection of the best alternative among various candidates, generated at the conceptual stage, is a challenging problem. The information available at the conceptual stage of a robot-design job cannot be used in raw form to rank the concepts for design criteria that are typically used in robotics. Traditionally, these rankings are provided by the design expert, based on her or his judgment. The objective of this work is to provide a setting, in the realm of robot design, within which the performance measures are computable using the information that is available at the conceptual stage, hence easing the general decision process at hand. In this vein, we have proposed the use of complexity as a measure of the diversity content of a design solution at the conceptual stage. Lower kinematic pairs (LKP) are essential to define the topology of robotic structures. To rank these pairs, we propose to estimate the complexity of their associated surfaces. In this vein, a novel index, the loss of regularity (LOR), is proposed in this thesis. The LOR, based on the concept of diversity, measures the spectral richness of the curvature, and its rate of change, of the curve or the surface under study. Based on the LOR of the associated surfaces, complexity values are assigned to each of the LKPs, as a means to guide the mechanical designer in the conceptual stage of the design process. While the performance evaluation of a robot includes many criteria, we focus on: the elastostatic and the elastodynamic performances; workspace volume; actuation complexity and the life-cycle cost. A set of rules that expresses the relation between the above-mentioned criteria and the information available at the conceptual stage is first defined. Based on these rules, six complexity criteria are proposed. Means to evaluate the performance rankings for these criteria using the information at the conceptual stage are established next. Finally, a decision matrix is used to aggregate concepts. A comparison of three robots, i.e., a hybrid six-dof robot, the PUMA and DIESTRO, is provided, based on the proposed formulation. The hybrid robot, a serial-parallel system, was found to be the best alternative. Finally, we include the embodiment of the hybrid robot, where we have established its major link dimensions based on a kinetostatic performance criterion. 3D renderings of the robot and its key elements are also included.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd355.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk20t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Robotics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computational complexity.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pr40d"><dcterms:title>Human growth hormone receptor : developmental changes and gene regulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kenth, Gurvinder.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human growth hormone (hGH) plays an essential role in growth and metabolism and its effectiveness depends on the presence of a functional human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) in target cells. My research has focussed on several aspects of hGHR regulation: hGHR expression and signalling in fetal life, influences of common polymorphisms and cis- and trans-regulatory elements. My lab has shown that embryonic tissues express hGHR by the 3rd month of gestation. Although fetal serum hGH levels are 10x higher than postnatal GH levels, hGHR levels are 4-6x lower in fetal liver compared to postnatal. I examined whether there are also developmental changes in the hGHR forms and its signaling pathways. I did not observe changes in GHR isoforms. However, I demonstrated that fetal hepatocytes express JAK/STAT and SOCS families of signaling proteins from twelve weeks of fetal life but only at 30-70% of the levels in adult liver. It is controversial as to whether the hGHR exon 3 polymorphism can be correlated to GH responsiveness in GH-deficient individuals. However, I showed that there was no correlation between the hGHR exon 3 genotypes and final adult height or bone mineral density in a cohort of healthy Caucasian women. Regulation of hGHR expression was studied from three perspectives. (1) CpG islands and Sp binding sites were identified within the promoters of three ubiquitously expressed non-coding hGHR exons. I determined that these promoters are sensitive to CpG methylation and that the fetal liver hGHR gene methylation pattern was different from the adult, suggesting that, during development, hGHR expression may be controlled by methylation. I also demonstrated that Sp factors regulate ubiquitous hGHR expression. (2) GHR is expressed diurnally in murine liver, fat and bone. I found that two diurnal transcription factors (DBP, E4BP4) can interact to regulate ubiquitous hGHR expression. E4BP4 also inhibits expression of liver-specific hGHR mRNAs and, thus, may block their transcription in non-hepatic tissues. (3) GH is known to regulate expression of its own receptor. GAGA elements in the promoter of a ubiquitously expressing hGHR exon were shown to be possible growth hormone response elements. These studies have significantly advanced our understanding of what regulates hGHR expression under normal physiological conditions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644w30n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pr40d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptors, Somatotropin -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body Height -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human Growth Hormone -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone Density -- genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j4598"><dcterms:title>Resistively-loaded antenna designs for ultra-wideband confocal microwave imaging of breast cancer</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kanj, Houssam.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Confocal microwave imaging (CMI) has recently been suggested as a screening method for early detection of cancerous breast tumors. This recently proposed detection and imaging method relies on the dielectric properties differences between malignant and healthy breast tissue at microwave frequencies (1-10 GHz). A pulsed signal is launched by a transmitting antenna on the skin surface to penetrate into the underlying tissues. As the pulse encounters the tumor, it reflects off the malignant lesion and the reflection can be collected by a receiving antenna on the skin surface. The narrower the pulse signal used, the smaller the detectable tumor would be by such a method. However, as the narrow pulse contains a wide frequency range, the trans-receiving antenna must exhibit a broadband behavior. Further, it was recently demonstrated that a higher-resolution image can be obtained if a single antenna-element is replaced by a suitable antenna array. In addition, research indicates that further improvement of microwave breast cancer detection systems is possible by sensing the cross-polarized backscatter reflections from the malignant lesion. For this application, a compact broadband antenna design is a fundamental element of the system. Such a design will enable the development of the desired array with a large number of cross-polarized antennas. Motivated by this application and many other similar applications, such as biological sensing, through-wall imaging, ground-penetrating radars and fixed surveillance, this dissertation focuses on the design of an ultra-wideband (UWB) ultra-compact low-profile resistively-loaded antenna easily manufactured by standard printed circuit board (PCB) means with embedded passives. First, a planar antenna design, named "Dark Eyes", is presented. The antenna takes advantage of constant resistive loading in combination with favorable antenna geometry to achieve its broadband behavior. Second, the antenna is miniaturized to centimeter size while maintaining a comparable performance to that of the original one. Third, a complete microstrip-feed for the miniaturized "Dark Eyes" antenna is presented. Then, the antenna is studied in a cross-polarized arrangement for tumor detection and the advantage of this approach is demonstrated. Finally, a novel antenna design with an extremely broadband behavior and a very compact size is presented. This new design is simpler than the "Dark Eyes" antenna with an order of magnitude improved performance. Such a design is a key element in developing the multistatic microwave imaging system with a large number of cross-polarized antenna-elements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tg64h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j4598</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antenna arrays -- Design and construction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microwave imaging in medicine.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breast -- Imaging.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ultra-wideband antennas -- Design and construction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xn16t"><dcterms:title>Effect of twinning on texture and strain hardening in magnesium alloys subjected to different strain paths</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jiang, Lan, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The evolution of flow stress and microstructure during the deformation of two Mg-based (+Al, Mn, Zn) alloys has been studied under various conditions of temperature and strain rate. The tested materials were taken from AZ31 and AM30 extruded tubes. The effect of twinning was investigated by using uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression and ring hoop tension testing. Strain path change testing, i.e. tensile prestraining followed by uniaxial compression, was carried out to study the role of contraction and double twins on the subsequent deformation. Optical metallography and EBSD techniques were employed to study the microstructural development. The first part of the investigation focused on the flow stresses developed during deformation along the three different strain paths. It was found that at low temperatures (≤200°C), the flow behaviors are mainly controlled by twinning. At temperatures above 200°C but below 350°C, especially at a strain rate of 0.001s-1, the deformation is largely accommodated in partially dynamically recrystallized regions. As a result, the formation of voids in these regions causes premature fracture. The second part focused on the twinning behavior displayed during deformation to a strain of 0.15. The results indicate that the initial extrusion texture plays an important role in the formation of different types of twins and that the twinning behavior also depends on the strain path. {10-11} contraction and {10-11}-{10-12} double twinning are the dominant twinning mechanisms in uniaxial tension, while {10-12} extension twinning prevails in uniaxial compression and ring hoop tension testing. Grain size, temperature, strain and strain rate all have significant effects on the volume fraction of contraction and double twins. There is a sigmoidal relationship between the volume fraction of extension twins and the strain. The effect of grain size (in this grain size range) on the volume fraction of extension twins is small. For a given strain, at high strain rates, temperature does not have much influence on the volume fraction (below 200°C). In the third part of the investigation, the deformation texture associated with twinning was examined. The near 100% volume fraction of {10-12} extension twins gives rise to significant texture changes. By contrast, {10-11} contraction and {10-11}-{10-12} double twinning only make a small contribution to texture change due to the limited volume fraction of twinned material. Schmid factor analysis indicates that, for the {10-12} extension twins, all variants that are favorably oriented (i.e. with the highest SF values) can undergo rapid and complete twinning. For the {10-11} contraction twins, only variants in the TD component (11-20) &lt;10-10&gt; follow the SF criterion. The development of internal stresses, which somehow particularly affect the RD component (10-10) &lt;0001&gt; grains, may explain this difference. In the final part of the investigation, the effects of twinning on the strain hardening behavior and on ductility were studied. Different behaviors are shown to be responsible for the sharply contrasting strain hardening characteristics of the experimental flow curves. When a certain volume fraction (≥20% in the present study) is reached, contraction and double twinning generate net softening effects. Nevertheless, when they interact with extension twins, the hardening effect may predominate. On the other hand, extension twinning generally introduces a hardening effect. The hardening effect due to twin boundaries appears to be stronger than that from the volume fraction of extension twins, since the hardening associated with extension twinning cannot be explained by the volume fraction alone. Depending on the deformation conditions, twinning can be detrimental to the formability on the one hand but it can also be beneficial on the other.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838411p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xn16t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Magnesium alloys.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Strain hardening.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Twinning (Crystallography)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w333s"><dcterms:title>Iron homeostasis in the central nervous system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jeong, Suh Young, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Iron is an essential, yet highly reactive, metal that needs to be tightly regulated. Excess iron in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to free radical formation and neurodegeneration. My Ph.D. thesis work is focused on two animal models of neurodegeneration: one uses a null mutation of ceruloplasmin (CP), which in humans causes iron accumulation and neurodegeneration in the CNS; and the other is a gain of function mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in mice/humans. CP is a ferroxidase that converts highly toxic ferrous iron to its non-toxic ferric form. A GPI-anchored form of CP (GPI-CP), expressed by astrocytes, is the major form of CP in the CNS. In my Master's work, the role of CP in iron influx and efflux in vitro using astrocyte cultures from CP-/- and CP +/+ mice was characterized and revealed that iron efflux is completely absent while iron influx into astrocytes is unaffected in the absence of CP. For my Doctoral thesis, I continued to study the role of GPI-CP in astrocytes and showed that GPI-CP is physically associated with the iron efflux transporter ferroportin (FPN). I also assessed whether FPN, a transmembrane protein, is mobilized from non-lipid raft to lipid raft regions of the membrane in response to cellular iron status. Using astrocyte cultures incubated in different iron concentrations, I found that under high iron conditions, there is a rapid relocation of FPN into lipid rafts containing GPI-CP. On the other hand, cells treated with an iron chelator showed decreased FPN expression on the membrane. Therefore, formation of the GPI-CP/FPN complex is essential for cellular iron efflux and the generation of this complex is regulated by cellular iron levels. To understand how the lack of CP causes iron accumulation and neurodegeneration, I carried out a detailed analysis of iron accumulation, dysregulation of iron homeostasis proteins, and loss of astrocytes and neurons in the cerebellum of CP-/- mice during aging. Abnormal iron accumulation is first detected in CP-/- mice by 12 months and peaks at 24 months. Iron accumulation occurs in astrocytes, but not in Purkinje neurons and large neurons in the deep nuclei. The iron importer DMT1 is abnormally increased in these large neurons but not in astrocytes, while ferritin expression is increased in astrocytes. There is also a marked loss of astrocytes and Purkinje neurons in CP-/- mice with age. The loss of astrocytes is likely to be related to iron accumulation while the loss of the Purkinje neurons is likely due to the loss of astrocytic support and lack of sufficient supply of iron from astrocytes. To assess the contribution of iron to the pathogenesis of ALS, I studied the involvement of iron accumulation and the dysregulation of iron homeostasis in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1G37R). I found excessive iron accumulation in the large motor neurons and glia in the spinals cords of 12-month old SOD1 mice. There was dysregulation in the expression of iron homeostasis proteins, which correlate with the progression of the disease. This iron accumulation in the motor neurons may be due to impaired anterograde axonal transport, as evidenced by a nerve ligation study I carried out. Furthermore, purified mitochondria from SOD1 mice show increased iron accumulation, suggesting a role for iron in mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, treatment with a lipophilic iron chelator before the onset of clinical symptoms (8 months of age) extended lifespan by an extra 4.8 weeks, thus pointing to an important role for iron in the progression of disease. Iron in the CNS is thought to play an important role in many neuroinflammatory conditions due to its redox activity. My work will help further the understanding of how disruption of iron homeostasis can contribute to cell death under various neurodegenerative conditions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tg65s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w333s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ceruloplasmin -- deficiency.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iron -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -- physiopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Homeostasis -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebellum -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193d51v"><dcterms:title>Flexing the innate immune arm within the human central nervous system : implications for multiple sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jack, Carolyn Sarah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the inflammatory brain lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS), both infiltrating macrophages and their central nervous system counterparts, the resident microglia, are present in large numbers and, along with reactive astrocytes, are implicated as potential antigen presenting cells (APC)s. The demyelinating pathology associated with the infiltration of self-reactive T cells in MS requires local antigenic re-stimulation in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Human microglia and, less commonly, astrocytes, have been found to express APC molecules in MS brains. This, combined with the potential for production of immunomodulatory and toxic mediators upon activation, highlights the central role for these glial cells in neuroinflammation and, particularly, in MS. Toll-like receptors (TLR)s were recently identified as key mediators signaling the activation of innate immune responses. We hypothesized that TLR ligation by human microglia and/or astrocytes can trigger an APC-like maturation process in the CNS, tailored to the environmental ligand, which can then dictate and polarize subsequent immune responses. We further hypothesize that oligodendrocytes are particularly sensitive to injury mediated by specific reactive oxygen/nitrogen species produced following the activation of these glial cells. Expression and function of TLRs in the human brain was largely unknown at the onset of this work. Using cells isolated from surgically resected normal appearing white matter, we found that human microglia express mRNA for TLRs 1-9, whereas only TLR3 is expressed robustly by human astrocytes. By flow cytometry, we established that microglia strongly express cell surface TLR2 and intracellular TLR3, while TLR4 is expressed below detection levels. Astrocytes were found to restrict their protein expression and functional responses to TLR3. In contrast, microglia responded to the ligation of TLRs 2, 3 and 4. In line with its unique signaling, TLR3 induced the strongest activation program in microglia, characterized by high level production of classical pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), the essential polarizing cytokines IL-12 (concomitant with IL-10) and IL-23, known to result in Th1- and Th17-type CD4+ T cell responses, as well as the prototypical type I IFN response, including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and CXCL-10 production. TLR4- and, particularly, TLR2-mediated microglial activation was found to be more selective and less polarizing. Production of type I IFN and associated responses was absent downstream of TLR2. We hereby established that TLR-mediated activation of human microglia can instruct the subsequent mode of adaptive immune response. Both TLR3 and TLR4 ligation increased microglial MHC and classical co-stimulatory (CD80, CD86) molecule expression on the cell surface, while TLR2 led to a more limited response. Only TLR3 ligation induced CD40 expression. While TLR-mediated microglial activation did not result in increased allogeneic CD4+ T cell proliferation, the secretion of the classical Th1-cytokine IFN-gamma was significantly elevated in allogeneic co-cultures of TLR3 pre-activated microglia and CD4+ T cells. TLR3 ligation also induced significantly higher levels of T cell death in these co-cultures. TLR2-mediated pre-activation led to a trend towards Th2-polarized cytokine secretion (IL-5, IL-13) in these same cultures, while ligation of all three TLRs led to high level IL-6 responses, indicative of generalized activation responses. Collectively, these data indicate that TLR-mediated CNS innate immune cellular activation can be tailored to the environmental trigger, which can then shape the profile of the adaptive immune response. Nitric oxide (NO) and its more potent byproduct, peroxynitrite (ONOO), are implicated as microglia and astrocyte-derived toxic mediators in MS pathology. We established that human oligodendrocytes are surprisingly resistant to NO-mediated damage in vitro and, in fact, show increased metabolic activity following repeated exposure to NO. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were highly susceptible to ONOO--mediated cell death. We further establish that oligodendrocytes in MS lesions can display nitrotyrosine residues, indicative of ONOO- production and potential toxicity during the course of disease. In summary, TLR-signaling can dictate the activation profile of human CNS APCs and therefore subsequent local immune responses; furthermore, upon activation in the CNS, the production of ONOO- has the capacity to specifically injure oligodendrocytes, placing microglia and astrocytes at the core of the MS disease process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988p57z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193d51v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Microglia -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peroxynitrous Acid -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oligodendroglia -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiple Sclerosis -- physiopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Myelin Sheath -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitric Oxide -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j891m"><dcterms:title>The regulation of Msx genes by Wnt and BMP signalling during stem cell development /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hussein, Samer M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Wnt and the TGFbeta-related ligand, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), play a fundamental role at various stages throughout development, and their crosstalk modulates cell fate decision during neural induction and neural crest specification. They regulate key target genes, such as the Msx genes, to influence such early developmental events. In our first study, the ES cell model was used to address the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of Msx2 gene expression by Wnt and BMP signalling. We identified that BMP activation of Msx2 expression is completely dependent on Smad4, a central mediator of TGFbeta signalling, binding to specific sites (SBEs) on the Msx2 promoter. We also show that Smad4 cooperates with LEF1, a transcriptional mediator of Wnt signalling, to activate the Msx2 promoter, and LEF1 binding sites were required for the BMP response. Wnt signalling also activates Msx2, and this activation is dependent on the TCF/LEF1 binding sites and partially the SBEs. We further demonstrate an important finding and that is the Wnt pathway signals through Smad4 in the absence of BMP signalling to activate Msx2 expression. In the second study, and to address the biological relevance of this interaction, we differentiated wildtype (WT) and Smad4-/- ES cells towards a neural lineage. We showed that lack of Smad4 accelerates neural commitment and that Smad4 is required for neural inhibition by BMP. Our results also demonstrate that both Wnt signalling and Smad4 are required for neural crest induction, and that the Wnt-induced neural crest is dependent on Msx2. Overexpression of Msx2 induces neural crest differentiation in WT ES cells and rescues the neural crest phenotype in the absence of Smad4. Msx3 also rescued neural crest differentiation in Smad4-/- ES cells, but had a profound inductive effect on neuronal specification of WT ES cells. Taken together, our results identify a new molecular interaction between Wnt and BMP signalling, and a convergence on Msx genes during neural crest differentiation of ES cells. Our findings also improve our knowledge and understanding of early stem cell fate decisions and may lead to better manipulation and use of stem cells in treating degenerative diseases.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g375j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j891m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stem Cells -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Signal Transduction -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wnt Proteins -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Homeodomain Proteins -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neural Crest -- physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adr26z169x"><dcterms:title>The secret life of a novel cell adhesion molecule CAR : the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor in neuronal development</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Huang, Kuo-Cheng, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) is an adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily. CAR is expressed highly in the developing brain, but its physiological function is not known. Our in vivo subcellular fractionation of developing mouse brain and immunostaining of hippocampal neurons in culture showed CAR to be enriched in growth cones. Proteomic analysis of purified growth cones revealed that CAR binds tubulin and actin. In hippocampal cultures, CAR localized to areas of F-actin and microtubule interaction in the growth cone, and its proper localization was dependent on the integrity of both cytoskeletal systems. In addition, CAR immunoprecipitated with components of the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. Since all these interactors are implicated in neurite outgrowth, we hypothesized that CAR may play a role in this process. We demonstrated that neurons plated on coverslips coated with the extracellular domain of CAR display enhanced neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, the enhanced neurite outgrowth depends on expression of endogenous CAR. We have also shown that the extracellular domain of CAR is shed to the medium by a metalloprotease-dependent mechanism, pointing to the physiological relevance of enhanced neurite outgrowth mediated by this domain. Interestingly, CAR localizes to cholesterol-sphingolipid rich microdomains in developing neurons and coimmunoprecipitates with known lipid-raft signaling proteins such as nNOS, pointing to a possible function of CAR in lipid-raft signaling. These studies indicate that CAR is not just a virus receptor but is an important regulator of developmental processes in the brain.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fg42b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z169x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hippocampus -- cytology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Virus -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cell Adhesion.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neurons -- physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cx858"><dcterms:title>A harmonized and hierarchical method of quantifying upper extremity function post-stroke /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Higgins, Johanne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Only a small proportion of persons with stroke fully recover the use of their more affected upper extremity. The consequences of this are devastating as use of the upper extremity is of the utmost importance to the performance of daily activities. Rehabilitation post-stroke is now being offered in a variety of different settings including acute and rehabilitation hospitals, out-patient rehabilitation centers, at home through home-care and in the community. Evaluating improvement in upper extremity function is difficult because there is no agreed upon measure or set of measures. The proliferation of tests targeting a particular type of client (severe, high level), need (goal setting, clinical practice, research) or setting (hospital/clinic or home) has contributed to the difficulty in creating a harmonized view this construct. A crucial feature of any method for measurement is that true change is detected, the whole spectrum of ability is captured (most basic to most complex tasks), and that comparisons across people and over time are meaningful and not dependent on the units of measurement. It is not unusual to assess persons with stroke with three or four different tests and several questionnaires designed to capture actual use of the arm in daily activities. The measurement protocol currently requires all items of all tests be administered even though there are known redundancies. Summarizing recovery across this measurement spectrum is difficult and hinders communication across disciplines and rehabilitation settings. It has been argued that rehabilitation professionals need to move toward a common language of functional assessment. Using Rasch analysis, a single construct, in this case, upper extremity function, is measured using a ruler-like scale with items hierarchically ordered along its length. This measurement property permits evaluation of relative gains in function (a person has doubled their level function). When computer-assisted, items are chosen for administration automatically depending on ability and on the response to previous items. This yields an accurate estimate of recovery level using the fewest number of items and a minimum amount of time.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wn95w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cx858</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arm -- physiopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Outcome Assessment (Health Care) -- methods.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Upper Extremity -- physiopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebrovascular Accident -- rehabilitation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58ph455"><dcterms:title>Effect of FTDP-17 mutations on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tau protein in vitro</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Han, Dong, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Microtubule-associated protein tau binds to microtubules and stabilizes microtubule structure. By stabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, tau plays an important role in the maintenance of neuronal survival. Tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brains of the patients suffering from a number of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Missense tau mutations have been discovered to cosegregate with FTDP-17. The mechanism by which these mutations promote tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT pathology remains unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanism by which FTDP-17 mutations enhance tau hyperphosphorylation and promote tau pathology. In vitro phosphorylation of wild type (WT) tau and FTDP-17 mutant tau G272V, P301L, V337M and R406W by Cyclin-dependent-kinase 5 (Cdk5) (implicated in tau phosphorylation in AD and various tauopathies) was carried out. Tau (WT), which migrates as a single band of ~60 kDa in size, migrated as three bands with sizes of 60, 64 and ~68 kDa on an SDS gel upon phosphorylation by CdkS. Since tau isolated from NFTs migrates as three bands of sizes ~60, ~64 and ~68 kDa, these observations suggest that phosphorylation of tau by Cdk5 converts normal tau to diseased tau. Importantly, each FTDP-17 mutation promoted Cdk5 phosphorylation-induced conversion of normal tau to diseased tau. In addition, the FTDP-17 mutations also significantly reduced the ability of phosphorylated tau to bind and promote microtubule assembly in vitro. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) have been implicated in the dephosphorylation of tau in the brain. Since the phosphorylation state of a protein is regulated by the activities of kinases and phosphatases acting on that protein, the effect of various FTDP-17 mutations on tau dephosphorylation by PP1, PP2A and PP2B was analyzed. When expressed in HEK293 cells, tau (WT) was phosphorylated by the endogenous kinases of the cell. When transfected cells were lysed and incubated in vitro, endogenously phosphorylated tau was dephosphorylated by cellular PP1, PP2A and PP2B present in the lysate. Using specific inhibitors of PP1, PP2A and PP2B, dephosphorylation of WT and FTDP-17 mutant tau G272V, P301L, V337M and R406W by the above phosphatases was examined. It was observed that each FTDP-17 mutation selectively inhibited tau dephosphorylation by PP1, PP2A and PP2B in a site-specific manner. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that FTDP-17 mutations not only promote tau phosphorylation but also inhibit tau dephosphorylation. Furthermore, FTDP-17 tau mutations and tau phosphorylation synergistically act to promote tau dysfunction associated with NFT pathology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kf27c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58ph455</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>tau Proteins -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tauopathies -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429f01t"><dcterms:title>A model checking based framework for the trace analysis of distributed systems /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hallal, Hesham H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a formal framework for the analysis of execution traces collected from distributed systems at run-time by monitoring. It introduces the notions of event and message traces to capture the consistency of causal dependencies between the elements of a trace. The two formal trace models are based on the partial order and lattice theory, where the lattice of a partially ordered trace can be used as an efficient means to check properties on the trace. We formulate an approach to property testing where a partially ordered execution trace is modeled by a collection of communicating automata. Then, we prove that the automata-based model exactly characterizes the causality relation between the events/messages in the observed trace. We actually prove that the composition of the automata in the model is isomorphic to the lattice of ideals associated with the trace. To realize the proposed analysis approach, we discuss its implementation in SDL, where ObjectGEODE is used to verify properties using model-checking techniques. The implementation includes also building a library of 80 parameterized patterns for property specifications in the language GOAL of ObjectGEODE. Then, we illustrate the applicability of the approach to different application domains with examples, and we detail an industrial case study from the domain of radio mobile communications, where traces collected from GSM network systems are analyzed. Finally, we describe potential enhancements of the proposed causality models by improving the event trace model to allow for non-sequential processes in traces and the message trace model by ordering messages in traces based primarily on their contents rather than their timestamps. We also characterize the minimal edge decomposition of a partially ordered set useful in reducing the size of the automata-based model of a trace.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66347153.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f01t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>System design.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Execution traces (Computer program testing)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jv72p"><dcterms:title>Hardware related optimizations in a Java virtual machine</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gu, Dayong.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Java Virtual Machines provide a layer of abstraction supporting any services required for the execution of Java programs; from the viewpoint of Java programs, a Java Virtual Machine is a kind of "virtual hardware". However, fundamentally, any job of this virtual hardware is done by the real low level hardware, and behavioural changes in the virtual hardware are eventually reflected by performance variations in the real hardware. Investigating the real hardware performance is thus important for understanding the behaviour of higher levels, including virtual machines themselves and the Java programs they run. Hardware information also has significant potential for optimizing Java Virtual Machines and achieving better runtime performance for Java programs. In this thesis, we introduce a series of adaptive optimizations in a Java Virtual Machine based on hardware information. We investigate the recurrent behaviour apparent in hardware data and detect the recurrent, periodic phases, i.e., the repetitive behaviour, in high level program execution. These phase detection results can be used for a variety of purposes including optimization and program understanding. For example, phase data can be used to select only the representative portions in program execution for runtime profiling. This selective profiling technique achieves a similar accuracy to that of the continuous profiling with a significant workload reduction. Based on further hardware investigation results we roughly divide the lifetime of a program into different phases and dynamically apply appropriate hot method recompilation strategies which generally improve performance and demonstrate a real world optimization using our technique. Hardware information can also bring benefits to the selection of better garbage collection points. We implement a collector with a garbage collection point analytic model based on our hardware data analyzer and provide a deep study of the relative factors in collection point selection. Our approach and set of techniques highlight a problem for optimization development and a design that adaptively compensates. As hardware performance becomes an increasingly important factor it becomes a greater consideration in the construction of runtime environments, including Java Virtual Machines. We are able to show in our work that hardware monitoring can be the basis of both high level understanding and many new optimizations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hg68m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jv72p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Java (Computer program language)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Virtual computer systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer storage devices.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Memory management (Computer science)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js44d"><dcterms:title>Unsteady airfoil flow control via a dynamically deflected trailing-edge flap</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gerontakos, Panayiote.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The control of the flow around a harmonically oscillating NACA 0015 airfoil via a dynamically deflected simply-hinged trailing-edge flap was investigated experimentally at a Reynolds number of 2.46 x 105 by using a combination of techniques, including surface pressure measurements, hot-wire wake velocity surveys and particle image velocimetry flowfield measurements. The tests were conducted under deep-stall conditions, with special attention being focused on identifying the changes in the flow structures that led to the observed modified aerodynamic load characteristics, and on the evaluation of the effects of the prescheduled trapezoidal flap motion profile. In addition, light-stall and attached-flow oscillations were also considered, as were static flap deflections and higher harmonic flap motions. The results indicate that a trailing-edge flap imposed an effective camber in the trailing-edge region, and was highly effective in the control of the aerodynamic loads. This was achieved in large part by the manipulation of the lower flap surface pressure distribution via changes to the windward-side flow stream, and was unaffected by the state of the flow above the airfoil. The leading-edge vortex, the predominant flow structure over the airfoil, was only marginally affected in its strength and initiation. The results also revealed that both the flap angle and deflection rate contributed to the above observations, and that the active motion was crucial in preventing the flow separation observed over the lower flap surface for an equivalent static flap, which would have hindered its performance. Furthermore, control was limited to the duration of the flap motion, and, in general, no effect on the flow or aerodynamic loads was observed while the flap was withdrawn to its initial undeflected position. The detailed parametric study showed the characteristics of the flap motion profile to be highly influential on the degree of control. In the application of an optimum flap motion schedule to dynamic stall, the severe nose-down pitching moment decreased by 40%, the performance ratio improved by 30%, and the aerodynamic damping became positive and increased four-fold; this was, however, accompanied by a 20% reduction in the maximum lift.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55zc263.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js44d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Trailing edges (Aerodynamics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aerofoils -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stalling (Aerodynamics) -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hk213"><dcterms:title>Design of multiaxial accelerometers with simplicial architectures for rigid-body pose-and-twist estimation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cardou, Philippe.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Accelerometer arrays are used in biomechanics and other fields to estimate the rigid-body acceleration field and, thence, all kinematic variables describing the rigid-body displacements. However, the progress of this technology has been limited by that of micromachined gyroscopes, which turn out to be more accurate than accelerometer arrays in most applications. The work reported in this thesis aims at improving the accuracy of the angular velocity estimates provided by accelerometer arrays. The approach is twofold: A class of accelerometer mechanical architectures is proposed, with the goal of reducing the accelerometer cross-axis sensitivity, and robust algorithms are proposed to estimate the angular velocity from some or all components of the rigid-body acceleration field. The novel class of accelerometers is inspired from parallel-kinematics-machine (PKM) architectures, taking the accelerometer proof mass to be the PKM moving platform, and the accelerometer frame the PKM base. A common characteristic of the proposed PKM architectures is that their moving platforms are connected to their bases by n + 1 legs each, n = 1, 2, 3 being their respective number of sensitive directions. For this reason, the resulting class of accelerometers is referred to as "Simplicial Multiaxial Accelerometers" (SMA). A micro-scale version of the Simplicial Biaxial Accelerometer (SBA) was devised, designed, fabricated, and tested. Furthermore, the theory behind the estimation of the angular velocity from acceleration measurements is revisited. Hence, four algorithms are proposed, which allow for the estimation of the rigid-body angular velocity from centripetal acceleration measurements alone. Based on Kalman filtering, another method is proposed in order to obtain a rigid-body angular-velocity estimate from both the centripetal and tangential components of the rigid-body acceleration field.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fq49v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk213</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Accelerometers -- Design and construction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085p755"><dcterms:title>Trafficking of lysosomal proteins via the sortilin sorting receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Canuel, Maryssa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Delivery of soluble lysosomal proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes is dependent primarily on the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). The M6PR has been demonstrated to achieve and be recycled from the endosomal compartment through interactions with GGA, AP-1, and retromer adaptor proteins. However, in I-cell disease (ICD), in which the M6PR pathway is non-functional, many soluble lysosomal proteins continue to traffic to the lysosomes. The novel sortilin sorting receptor has been implicated in the M6PR-independent targeting of sphingolipid activator proteins. We therefore tested the hypothesis that soluble proteases that exhibit M6PR-independent trafficking are targeted to the lysosomes by sortilin in a process dependent upon AP-1 and retromer. Using a dominant-negative sortilin construct and an RNA interference (RNAi), we demonstrated that while cathepsin D transport is partially dependent upon sortilin, cathepsin H requires sortilin, whereas cathepsins K and L do not. Similarly, using RNAi, we observed that the anterograde trafficking of sortilin and its cargo required AP-1, while the retrograde recycling pathway necessitated retromer through an interaction with a YXXphi consensus site in the cytosolic tail of sortilin. Furthermore, analysis of detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) microdomains demonstrated the presence of sortilin and its ligands, but the absence of the M6PR and its ligands. Our results suggest that sortilin functions as an alternative sorting receptor to the M6PR and that uniquely sortilin and its ligands interact on sphingomyelin rich platforms in the Golgi apparatus.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977z607.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085p755</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptor, IGF Type 2 -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>RNA, Small Interfering -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cathepsins -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lysosomes -- enzymology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rs47f"><dcterms:title>Disseminated uveal melanoma : the seeds of metastases</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Callejo, Sonia A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Treatment of primary uveal melanoma (UM) appears to have no direct influence on the evolution of metastatic disease, as 50% of patients will die of metastases following successful local therapy. This fact suggests that undiagnosed malignant cells have already disseminated at the time of initial treatment. The purpose of the study was to detect early stages of tumor cell dissemination in the form of circulating malignant cells (CMCs) in UM patients during a prospective longitudinal study. CMCs were detected using nested RT-PCR with two markers: tyrosinase and Melan A. These markers were found in our first transitional study to be highly expressed in 46 cases of UM, as well as in CMCs and metastatic sites of our UM animal model. The RT-PCR technique was developed and evaluated in a second transitional study. Blood from 60 healthy volunteers was spiked with increasing concentrations of UM cells and evaluated with double-marker nested RT-PCR. The technique is highly specific (100%) with 70% sensitivity for Tyrosinase and 72% for Melan A. Further improvement on sensitivity was achieved by running multiple (n=10) RT-PCR per sample. With this approach, all samples tested positive regardless of the number of cell spiked, with no compromise in final test specificity. Finally, we identified CMCs in 29 of 30 UM patients. A total of 136 samples were collected during 18 months, with 2720 RT-PCR (10 RT-PCR per sample) performed. 119 samples (87.5%) tested positive; however, a low number of positive tests were recorded per sample (2 of 10 for Melan A and 1 of 10 for tyrosinase). CMCs were found in newly diagnosed, irradiated, enucleated, and observed patients regardless of tumor size at initial diagnosis and the time interval following treatment. In conclusion, we established that CMCs are present in the majority of UM patients. CMCs were detected at time of initial primary tumor diagnosis as well as many months to years following local treatment. As the survival of CMCs in blood in known to be limited, a source of replicating cells is necessary to maintain their longitudinal presence in blood. The intraocular tumor may be a first early source of CMCs. We can hypothesize that micrometastatic foci would become a secondary source of CMCs following primary tumor treatment. CMCs may extravasate and remain dormant, in a state in which replication may be balanced with cell release into the circulation, with no evidence of progressive tumor growth. The organs involved in tumor dormancy, the triggers that stimulate dormant cells to form macrometastases, and the appropriate patient selection for adjuvant therapy remain as attractive areas for future research.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354j83q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rs47f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Uveal Neoplasms -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lung Neoplasms -- secondary.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasm Circulating Cells -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liver Neoplasms -- secondary.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Melanoma -- pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q5186"><dcterms:title>Synthesis and regulation of gurken mRNA in the Drosophila germline</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cáceres, Lucía.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Asymmetric localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a post-transcriptional means of regulating gene expression. It is an important mechanism used early in development by a wide range of organisms to convert cellular asymmetry into complex patterns of cell fate. Some of the best-known examples of asymmetric transcript localization occur during the formation of the egg in Drosophila melanogaster. For example, during mid-oogenesis gurken mRNA, which encodes the Drosophila homologue of the vertebrate Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), becomes asymmetrically localized to the presumptive dorsal anterior region of the oocyte. Localized gurken mRNA is translated, resulting in local activation of the Drosophila Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to establish the oocyte dorsal-ventral axis. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms of gurken mRNA regulation within the oocyte, I first sought to understand the source of gurken production. Specifically, I asked whether the nurse cells, a cluster of germline cells attached to each developing oocyte, contribute to gurken mRNA production. To address this question, I developed an application of a standard mitotic recombination technique, which allowed me to generate a novel type of genetically mosaic female germline. In these mosaics, the nurse cells, but not the oocyte, could produce gurken . Using this system, demonstrated that nurse cells are involved in the synthesis of gurken and that this contribution is sufficient for axis specification. The finding that the nurse cells produce gurken implies the existence of a mechanism required for the transport of translationally repressed gurken mRNA from the nurse cells into the oocyte and to the dorsal anterior region. One candidate for this function is Squid, a member of the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). In squid mutant ovaries, gurken mRNA and protein are mislocalized along the entire anterior circumference of the oocyte. Since hnRNPs are implicated in the localization and translational regulation of their target transcripts, I asked if Squid is required in the nurse cells for proper regulation of gurken mRNA within the oocyte. To test this hypothesis, I generated squid germline mosaic egg chambers in which a subset of nurse cells could not produce Squid, and asked whether gurken mRNA synthesized from squid mutant nurse cells was normally regulated within the oocyte. In these germline mosaics, I found that gurken transcripts produced by nurse cells lacking Squid function are properly localized, indicating that Squid from the wild type nurse cells can function non-autonomously to localize gurken mRNA within the oocyte. In contrast, I demonstrated that Squid function is required in the nurse cells to maintain gurken in a translationally repressed state within the oocyte. My data thus show that Squid is required in the nurse cells to provide gurken mRNA with information that is necessary to regulate its translation, but not its localization, within the oocyte cytoplasm. These results uncouple two cellular functions of Squid, and illustrate a link between nuclear history and translational repression in Drosophila. Collectively, these results demonstrate a nurse cell contribution for gurken production, as well as the existence of a complex mechanism by which gurken mRNA is regulated during oogenesis. It will be interesting to determine if a nuclear history for translational regulation is a mechanism unique to the gurken transcript or if it is a general mechanism by which the translational repression of other transcripts is dictated by their nuclear history.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wn965.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q5186</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Embryology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Morphogenesis -- Molecular aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
