Continuity of care as a principle of health care  planning is losing ground in favor of new principles such as accessibility and  plurality of provision, but the long-term effects of these changes on the  utilization of expensive health services such as hospitalizations and emergency  department utilization are still unknown. Objective. To investigate among individuals aged 66 years or  older who have had an index visit to an emergency department (ED) whether there is  an association between the continuity with a primary care provider and the  likelihood of having an ED return visit 14 days after the index ED  visit. Conclusions. Among Quebec seniors, relational continuity of care  measured by UPC may not be an important protective factor against returning to the  ED after an index visit. The main study limitations to be considered in the  interpretation of these results relate to the use of administrative data, and  include potential misclassification of ED visits and return visits, inability to  distinguish planned from unplanned return visits, and residual confounding due to  covariates that were either not measured or measured at the ecological level (e.g.,  socioeconomic status). Research and policy implications. Further research, using  different data sources and measures, is needed to investigate the association  between continuity of care and ED utilization among seniors in Quebec.

Since d4E-BP null flies show  similar growth and development to control flies, the possibility of a conditional  phenotype was explored through stress treatments. Adult d4E-BP null flies show  sensitivity to oxidative stress, and d4E-BP null larvae die faster than controls  under starvation and protein starvation. Expressing a mutant d4E-BP that doesn't  bind to eIF4E in the d4E-BP null background does not rescue this stress sensitivity,  which suggests that wild-type stress resistance requires binding of d4E-BP to  eIF4E. The Drosophila forkhead transcription factor dFOXO is a  transcriptional activator of d4E-BP. There is a strong reduction of d4E-BP peptide  in a dFOXO null background. dFOXO null flies are also sensitive to oxidative stress,  and rescue of this sensitivity through ectopic expression of UAS-d4E-BP(wt) in a  dFOXO null background suggests d4E-BP is a downstream mediator of dFOXO oxidative  stress resistance.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f4056.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb4949035</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Cytogenetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Effect of stress on</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphoproteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrier proteins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic translation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6m311p88b"><dcterms:title>Mechanisms controlling ovulation in the garden snail Helix aspersa</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Geoffroy, Emile</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The gonad of the snail Helix aspersa is innervated by a branch  of the intestinal nerve. Here it is demonstrated that nerve stimulation causes  peristaltic contractions and the acceleration of cilia beating in the proximal part  of the hermaphroditic duct. Acetylcholine and serotonin induced peristaltic  contractions when applied without nerve stimulation. As well, serotonin induced the  acceleration of cilia beating. The neuropeptide FMRFamide caused dilation of the  hermaphroditic duct. Pharmacological blocking of acetylcholine and serotonin  receptors with concurrent nerve stimulation induced a dilation similar to that  caused by FMRFamide application. It is suggested that all three transmitters are  released from intestinal nerve terminals to facilitate oocyte transport during  ovulation. Nerve stimulation induced an increase in gamete transport rates. Because  several candidate chemical messengers failed to induce ovulation when injected into  the circulatory system, Helix aspersa appears to initiate ovulation differently from  related species. Whereas Aplysia and Lymnaea use hormones, Helix apparently signals  ovulation via the intestinal nerve.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247ds69n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311p88b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ovulation -- Regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Reproduction -- Regulation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913q47f"><dcterms:title>Study of the activity of P450 2D6 in organic solvents and of the potential inhibition of P450 enzymes by food supplements</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gaudineau, Cédric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We investigated the ability of CYP2D6 to catalyze  dextromethorphan O-demethylation in acetonitrile, chloroform, cyclohexane, and  dichloromethane.

The four planting dates studied were April  17 th, April 24th, May 1st and May 8 th. The impacts on yield if plants were  harvested after eleven week, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen weeks in the field were  investigated. The three risk reduction strategies considered were plants grown from  planting until June 2nd with no row covers, under floating row covers of spunbonded  polyester (Agryl P17, Plastitech) and under floating row covers made of clear,  perforated polyethylene (Plastitech). The results suggest that the floating row  covers can help plants reach the required market standards sooner that if no row  covers were used from the planting date investigated until June 2nd. At the earliest  two planting dates, the results suggest that row covers may significantly suppress  bolting and allow greater yields at earlier harvest dates. The results also suggest  that row covers may provide an advantage at later planting dates, as they may allow  for the plants to reach marketable standards sooner. The results also suggest that  there is a 50 percent chance of encountering bolting rate of 30 percent or higher if  transplanting plants on April 17th. The row covers reduced the probability that  plants will bolt to close to zero at for all four planting dates. The most  profitable strategy was determined to be planting on April 17th, growing the plants  under row covers made of spunbonded polyester (Agryl P17, Plastitech) from planting  until June 2nd and then harvesting after the plants had been in the field for  thirteen weeks.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w0492.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k684</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plastics in agriculture -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mulching -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Celery -- Québec (Province) -- Growth.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vernalization.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085k69d"><dcterms:title>Genetic interaction between H2 and NKC receptor genes confers innate resistance to cytomegalovirus infection</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Desrosiers, Marie-Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In mice, H2 and Ly49h genes determine natural resistance to  cytomegalovirus infection by alternate mechanisms.

Single domain magnetic particles represent  "1" or "0"; their stray field interaction controls the  propagation and manipulation of information. An inherent requirement for an MQCA  system is to know the conditions under which nanomagnets switch between the purely  "up" (1) and the purely "down" (0) state, and to control this  reproducibly. As a first step to study this, arrays of two types of permalloy  particles were designed, simulated, fabricated and imaged, and their switching  distributions ascertained. Individual particles were "peanut"-shaped, to  investigate the effect of a shape anisotropy for an elliptical particle. Particles  had long axes of 750 nm and 250 nm, but had identical aspect ratios. Particles were simulated with a public domain software package,  Object Oriented Micromagnetic Framework (OOMMF), fabricated by electron beam  lithography with standard lift-off techniques in the fabrication facility in  Sherbrooke, Canada, and imaged in vacuum using a custom built magnetic force  microscope in constant height mode with an in plane, in-situ magnetic field.  Ensemble hysteresis loops were obtained as was the average switching fields for both  arrays. The 750 nm particles were found experimentally to have a  two-step switching process. The first switch occurred at 60 +/- 16 Oe and the second  at 130 +/- 56 Oe. These results were nominally better than those obtained in a  previous study on similarly sized ellipses. Simulations on the 250 nm particles predicted that particles of  that size would have the single domain configuration as their virgin state, and  would have a one-step switching process. The switching field of a typical particle  was calculated to be 550 +/- 30 Oe. This was confirmed experimentally, where the  switching field distribution had its peak at 490 +/- 40 Oe. Thus, theory and  experiment are in agreement, within error.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526c877.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f1731</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w2853"><dcterms:title>Size does not matter, but shape does : a structural neuroimaging study of the anterior cingulate cortex in acute post-traumatic stress disorder</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Corbo, Vincent</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The neurobiological model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,  based upon the neurobiological model of fear-conditioning, states that the amygdala  is hyperactivated, while other, inhibiting structures, like the Anterior Cingulate  Cortex (ACC), are hypoactivated, therefore not fully inhibiting the amygdala. Two  structural neuroimaging studies have examined the ACC volume to try to comprehend  the hypoactivation of the ACC observed in subjects suffering from PTSD. Yamasue et  al.

Further analyses allowed us to be the first study to show that the  nature of the difference observed in grey matter density was a shape difference of  the ACC.

In addition to the change  in the oceanic regime on the continental shelf at the mouth of the Gulf of St.  Lawrence proposed by others, a large sediment oxygen demand along the LSLE though to  contribute to this DO depletion. To verify the latter hypothesis, I developed a  laterally integrated, two-dimensional model of the DO distribution for the bottom  waters of the Laurentian Trough. The fluid transport is parameterized in a simple  advection-diffusion finite-element grid where the sedimentation of organic matter  feeds the mineralization processes that lead to O2 depletion in the deep waters.  Using realistic parameters obtained from field data, the diagenetic model reproduces  the measured sediment oxygen demands (SODs) along the Gulf of St. Lawrence portion  of the trough but overestimates them in the lower estuary. Since our modeled estuary  DO levels are comparable to the measured DO values when a large SOD is applied, we  suggest that the oxygen fluxes, calculated from the DO gradients measured with  micro-electrodes across the sediment-water interface of cores recovered in the LSLE,  are underestimated.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t6944.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405s9913</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dd06f"><dcterms:title>Characterization of ocular and metastatic uveal melanoma in an animal model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Blanco, Paula L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Uveal melanoma is the most common primary malignant intraocular  tumor in adults.

Wood poles typically have a service life of  40-50 years but may be replaced prematurely when they fail or are damaged by  climatic loads or when they have degraded prematurely. The distribution network of  Hydro-Quebec comprises more than 2 million wood poles and the selection of an  optimal class of poles for new or refurbished lines can potentially represent  significant savings. In this project, wood poles from class 1 to 5 and steel poles  are considered for new or refurbished lines using life-cycle-cost  analysis. The evaluation of life-cycle-costs of a line for a service life  of 50 years was performed in two steps. A reliability model was first developed to  estimate the probability of failure of single poles with climatic loads. The results  of the reliability analysis were then integrated in an economic model that computes  the Net Present Value of construction costs and pole replacement costs associated  with failure under climatic loads of the whole line. Maintenance costs were  neglected in this study since they were determined to be approximately similar for  the various classes of poles. The results indicate that the Class 4 poles that are currently  used for the distribution network are not optimal from an economic point of view.  For distribution lines located in regions with moderate ice hazard expositions, a  Class 2 pole has a 15% cost advantage over the Class 4 poles. For distribution lines  located in regions with severe ice hazard expositions, a Class 2 pole has a 30%  advantage over the Class 4 poles.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042t612.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr27q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zh426"><dcterms:title>Seismic evaluation and retrofit of a precast concrete structure</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lim, Tik Lun William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A single-storey precast concrete structure constructed in 1963  with masonry-infilled walls was selected for a seismic evaluation. The structure is  located in the Montreal region, and is considered a post-disaster emergency building  since it houses spare parts for municipal facilities. The warehouse was first  evaluated through a visual inspection and identified as being seismically  vulnerable. A series of three-dimensional models of the structure were analyzed to  evaluate the seismic performance of the structure with respect to the seismic design  requirements of the 1995 and 1965 edition of National Building Code of Canada  (NBCC). The structural models were analyzed using a linear static analysis  accounting for the effects of different diaphragm configurations on the lateral load  resisting columns and the effects of masonry-infilled walls. The seismic analyses  showed that the warehouse does not satisfy either of the NBCC 1995 and NBCC 1965  requirements. A seismic rehabilitation scheme is proposed comprising the addition of  reinforced concrete shear walls, steel braces and an upgraded roof diaphragm. The  proposed retrofit satisfies the seismic design requirements of NBCC 1995. Finally,  the proposed seismic design provisions of NBCC 2005 are briefly summarized and the  impact of the new seismic design provisions on the retrofitted structure is  discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nh647.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh426</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z9030494"><dcterms:title>Critical strain for dynamic recrystallization during the constant strain rate hot deformation of Nb steels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chun, Geumju, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The presence of peak points in constant strain rate flow curves  is generally considered to indicate the onset of dynamic recrystallization (DRX).  However, not all materials display clear peaks when tested under these conditions.  It has been suggested that DRX is initiated when the strain reaches a critical value  epsilonc that is related to the peak strain epsilonp and that this critical strain  can be detected from the inflection point in plots of the strain hardening rate  theta against stress sigma, regardless of the presence or absence of peaks. This is  of importance because many works regarding DRX have been carried out by physical  simulation using laboratory torsion tests. However, one of the main problems in laboratory simulation is  that the inflection point for DRX is not easily determined, particularly in  microalloyed steels. This problem is rendered more difficult in torsion testing  because of the strain gradient along the radius of the specimen. As an alternative,  compression testing can provide more accurate data regarding the initiation of  DRX. In this work, the DRX behavior of three Nb microalloyed steels  was investigated using compression testing. Continuous deformation by axisymmetric  compression was employed in the temperature range 850 to 1050°C at strain  rates of 0.01, 0.1 and 1/sec. Stress-strain curves were obtained and then the  critical strains for initiation were calculated using a method based on the presence  of an inflection point at the moment of initiation. The critical strain was observed  to increase when the deformation temperature was decreased or when the strain rate  was increased. No significant effect of the level of microalloying addition on the  DRX behavior was detected within the range studied.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r150p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9030494</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88ch05x"><dcterms:title>Development of a design methodology for steel frame wood panel shear walls</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Branston, Aaron E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis provides details on the 109 specimen main testing  program as well as a summary of past wood frame and steel frame shear wall research.

It is recommended that the  EEEP methodology be implemented for all future steel frame/wood panel shear wall  data interpretation. The calibration of a resistance factor for use with the limit  states design philosophy consistent with the upcoming draft version of the 2005  National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) is also presented. It was found that a resistance factor (phi) of 0.7 provided  sufficient reliability and a reasonable factor of safety under the NBCC wind loading  case.

In addressing these concerns,  scholars have offered diverse frameworks generally emphasizing sanctions' design or  application. This thesis argues that the proper focus of concern is conceptually  prior to each of these. In fact, lacking political will has been characteristic of  sanctions cases and the root of sanctions' failures. Significantly, the cost-benefit  calculus informing policymakers' political will has been systematically incomplete.  Sanctions are often judged on their lifting, in the country on which they were  imposed, yet this unreasonably crops out broader sanctions' impact. Sanctions have  an understudied capacity for creating vacuums filled by indigenous influences, for  lastingly restructuring societies, and for affecting human capital, each in a manner  obstructive of post-conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction. This has vital policy  relevance given its impact on substantive international peace and security, the  breech of which initially spurs sanctions. Contemporary efforts in Iraq, Haiti,  Serbia, and South Africa are explored in illustration.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t914j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892b42w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economic sanctions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n396p"><dcterms:title>Automatic genre classification of MIDI recordings</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McKay, Cory</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A software system that automatically classifies MIDI files into  hierarchically organized taxonomies of musical genres is presented.

A similar program with Peru may  restart soon. Such operations are part of the Air Bridge Denial Program (ABDP), a  program that has been operating since the early 1990s designed to cut off the flow  of drug out of the Andean Region of South America. This thesis examines the history of the ABDP and the norms  applicable to shootdown operations under the UN Charter, customary international  law, the Chicago Convention, and human rights law to determine the specific  limitations of the prohibition. International law generally prohibits the shootdown  of international civil aircraft, and the nature of the shootdown operations can also  have human rights implications. This thesis then examines the circumstances under which  international law would excuse an otherwise unlawful shootdown of a civil aircraft.  Self-defense, the law of armed conflict and distress are ruled out as likely  candidates for use in the legal justification of the shootdown of drug  aircraft. The best defense for the conduct of ABDP shootdowns is the  defense of necessity as it exists under customary international law. The potential  harm to the essential interests of States threatened by drug trafficking combined  with the unique nature of the drug trade in the Andean Region is the ideal situation  for the invocation of necessity and provides the most sound international legal  justification for the conduct of shootdown operations in this  context.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139251v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296wz633</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708x07j"><dcterms:title>International liberalization of trade in textiles and clothing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nangendo, Aidah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Liberalization of textiles and clothing was one of the pillars  of the Uruguay Round under the WTO aimed at promoting economic growth, development  and alleviating poverty. For over 40 years this sector had been separated from the  established principles of liberal trade stemming mainly from protectionist  sentiments. The new regime established by the Uruguay Round aimed at integrating the  sector into GATT on the basis of its strengthened rules and disciplines in  furtherance of its general objective to liberalize trade. This change in  international trade rules is a phenomenal development that is bound to have an  impact on trade in other areas. The paper explores the liberalization process by  analyzing current trends in the textiles and clothing liberalization process. It  identifies opportunities and also highlights challenges the process presents to  participants in the sector. Although no precise picture of the trade following the  full integration can be drawn at this stage, there are some indicators of potential  winners and losers explaining both the praises and condemnation in the  liberalization debate from the various commentators.

Presently, eight isoforms of the NHE (NHE1 to NHE8) have been  identified that are targeted to distinct membrane compartments. The focus of this  study is to characterize in greater detail the biosynthesis and differential sorting  of two closely related organellar NHE isoforms, NHE6 and NHE7. Previous studies have  established that NHE7 accumulates in the trans-Golgi network and associated  endosomes, whereas the localization of NHE6 remains controversial. In one study,  HeLa cells transiently expressing low levels of a green fluorescent protein-tagged  construct of NHE6 showed close co-localization with mitochondrion-specific dyes.  However, when NHE6 was overexpressed in COS7 cells, significant accumulation was  observed throughout the cell in membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic  reticulum. To further address this discrepancy, NHE6 engineered to contain the  influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at its C-terminus (NHE6HA), was subcloned  into the ecdysone-inducible expression vector pIND and stably transfected into  Chinese hamster ovary cells that constitutively express the ecdysone receptor.  NHE6HA expression was stimulated by ponasterone A, an ecdysone analogue. The  localization of NHE6 was determined biochemically by subcellular fractionation of  cell lysates and visually by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of intact cells  using antibodies that recognize the HA-epitope and various organellar specific  markers. Similar studies were conducted with an NHE7-inducible mammalian expression  system. Our findings indicate that NHE6 is differentially processed through distinct  Golgi-dependent and -independent pathways, ultimately accumulating in recycling  endosomal vesicles. Little evidence was found to support sorting to mitochondria.
