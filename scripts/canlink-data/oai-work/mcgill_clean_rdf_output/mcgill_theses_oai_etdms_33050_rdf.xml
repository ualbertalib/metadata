Through use of an Escherichia coli luxAB transcriptional gene fusion library, our laboratory identified two clones whose luminescence increased in the presence of sodium selenite. The clones were designated strains LF20113 and LF20116. Cloning and sequencing portions of the two genes revealed that luxAB had inserted within two previously uncharacterized open reading frames, designated o219 and o393, which we have now named ginS and gutS, respectively. Transcription from these genes in response to increasing concentrations of sodium selenite was confirmed by RNA dot blot analysis. Primer extension analysis of the predicted promoter region of ginS revealed that the promoter was within the previously predicted protein coding sequence and thus, this gene is smaller than originally suspected. Expression of the GinS polypeptide in vivo demonstrated that the protein is approximately 22 kDa, which is also consistent with the smaller coding sequence. Homology searches have also shown that this protein is a member of the DedA family of proteins whose functions remain unknown. We have shown that three genes are down-regulated upon expression of the ginS gene product. These genes are clpX, b1169 , and gspC, and may indicate the involvement of ginS in a new pathway of protein transport in response to selenite exposure. Moreover, strain LF20113 is more sensitive to elevated concentrations of sodium selenite than the parental strain indicating a protective function for the gene. Characterization of the second selenite-responsive gene, gutS, revealed that this gene is not only transcribed in the presence of selenite, but also tellurite, as shown by measurement of luminescence from strain LF20116 as well as by measurement of transcription of gutS by RNA dot blot analysis.

It examines not only the state's Islamic institutions but also its political culture and policies towards Islam. The Acehnese theory of kingship during the period under study manifests a decidedly Islamic character. Deemed to possess both political and religions authority, the office of the sult&amp;dotbelow;an was viewed as necessary and its incumbent responsible for both the prosperity of his people and the enforcement of Islamic dogma. The court's policies towards Islam, given outward expression in elaborate religious rituals and ceremonies, reveal an imperial tradition in which the ruler himself was the head of the Muslim state, despite the apparent admixture of Southeast Asian elements. Other more traditional Islamic institutions were also fundamental to the Acehnese state. The 'ulama' played a significant role in both the religions and political spheres, while Islamic law became a dominant part of the judicial system, alongside adat (customary law and royal edicts/tradition). Jihad as well served to define the ideology of the state. In spite of its Southeast Asian appearance, therefore, the Islamic nature of the Acehnese state was more evident than in many other Muslim states in the region, such as fifteenth-century Melaka and seventeenth-century Mataram, a situation induced by geography, historical Islam, and the nature of Acehnese tradition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Feferspiel, Howard M.

Emotional problems can interfere with a return to family, social and work-related activities, and are associated with poor cardiac prognosis. Although many psychosocial intervention programs designed for this population have been evaluated, little is known about which components of the interventions are effective. The major aim of the present secondary analysis was to identify the types of patient-nurse interactions associated with a reduction in psychological distress in post-MI patients who participated in the Montreal Heart Attack Readjustment Trial (M-HART) randomized controlled study of home-based psychosocial nursing interventions. The sample for the present study included 431 patients (36.2% female) in the treatment group who received at least two home nursing visits over a two-month period. The types of concerns experienced by patients (those related to symptoms, treatment, uncertainty, interpersonal roles, and work/finance) and the types of nursing approaches undertaken during the first two home visits (cognitive, educational, emotionally supportive including reassurance/encouragement, listening and providing advice, and managerial) were examined in relationship to short-term changes in distress. These relationships were examined in the sample as a whole and also in subgroup analyses where gender and baseline level of depressive symptoms were taken into account. In the sample as a whole, reassurance/encouragement and listening were related to a reduction in distress, but mainly for patients who had physical symptoms and treatment-related concerns. The provision of advice for psychologically-related concerns such as fears was not associated with better outcomes. However, nursing approaches that were more directive (educational, cognitive and advice) appeared to have been linked to better outcomes in men, but less so in women, while listening was associated with reductions in distress in women, but not in men. Reductions in distress after the two visits was less common in patients with higher baseline levels of depressive symptoms, and those who presented psychologically-related concerns. Finally, patients who showed short-term reductions in distress had lower death rates, lower readmission rates, and a lower risk of reporting depressive symptoms at one year. These results highlight the importance of determining the types of intervention approaches that may be most effective in men and in women, and identifying patients who are more and less likely to benefit from psychosocial interventions such as those provided in M-HART. It is also particularly notable that post-MI patients whose short-term psychological distress is reduced by individualized psychosocial interventions appear to have improved cardiac prognosis and reduced depressive symptoms in the longer term.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Frasure-Smith, Nancy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204085m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kp79f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r725r"><dcterms:title>Molecular genetics and structure function of the calcium-sensing receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>D'Souza-Li, Lília.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor super family. It is involved in calcium homeostasis, helping to regulate the extracellular calcium set point by sensing levels of [Ca2+ o] and regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Mutations in the CASR gene can be either inactivating or activating and result in three phenotypes: (i) Inactivating mutations can present as (1) Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH), in which only one allele is mutated, and (2) Neonatal Severe Primary Hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT), in which both alleles are usually mutated; (ii) Activating mutations can present as (3) Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (ADH). The objective of this thesis is to understand the molecular genetics of diseases related to mutations in the CASR gene and to study the structure-function of CASR mutations. We searched for mutations in genomic DNA from affected individuals from FHH/NSHPT and ADH families and found seven (six novel) mutations in the CASR gene. We described the first splicing site mutation identified in the CASR gene, at position -1 in intron 2 (IVS2 -1 g &gt; t). The 3' splice site mutation leads to two aberrant transcripts, both excluding exon 3. In the process of studying the splice site mutation, we found that the splice site mutation is in a site normally used as an alternative splice site in primates. We also characterized the genomic sequence of this portion of the gene. We expressed four novel mutant receptors (R220W, G549R, A835T, C850851PVfs--2X981)and analyzed the consequence of the mutations on receptor function. We were able to define specific domains in the CASR involved in different receptor function. The mutation R220W showed reduced affinity to the ligand resulting in partial loss of function suggesting that it is located in a region important for ligand-receptor interaction. Mutation G549R, the first to be described in exon 6, is positioned in the distal portion of the extracellular domain (ECD) in a cysteine rich region, and is improperly folded and poorly expressed at the cell surface, suggesting that it is located in a region important for folding and overall structure of the receptor.

Three arrays of toy objects were constructed and shown to be comparable in difficulty on the basis of tests with undergraduate students. These arrays were then employed as the test material for examining memory with tasks of immediate or delayed recall within a single trial, in addition to learning-to-criterion across multiple trials. Normal control subjects and patients with unilateral resection from the anterior temporal lobe were tested. The patients had undergone either selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy or anterior temporal lobectomy that either spared or largely invaded the hippocampal formation. The only groups showing impairment were those with large resections from the right hippocampal region; this deficit was noted on immediate recall, delayed recall, and incremental learning of the spatial arrays. In 75 of the patients tested, postoperative magnetic resonance scans were used to measure the extent of tissue remaining in the medial temporal-lobe structures; from multiple regression analyses, the extent of right hippocampus remaining was found to be the best predictor of array-learning performance. The notion that the hippocampus encodes spatial information in a map-like or allocentric manner (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978) was explored by requiring normal control subjects and patients with unilateral temporal-lobe lesions to reconstruct the spatial arrays from a vantage-point other than that from which they had previously viewed the arrays. Contrary to prediction, the allocentric manipulation failed, in general, to elicit any additional impairment. Taken together, the results indicate that damage limited to the medial-temporal region in the right hemisphere is sufficient to disrupt memory for the location of objects.

It is shown that continuum elastic contact mechanical models are able to describe the interaction well with the inclusion of a simple adhesion potential. This is due in part to the lack of any mechanical instability throughout the approach of indenter to sample. This absence arises from the unexpected long range and hence mild force gradients of the observed surface force. The plastic response of the system is found to lie in a new regime beyond that reported in other submicron scale mechanical studies. Topological hardening to the theoretical crystal strength due to the exclusion of dislocations in a localized stress field has previously been reported. Here we report a general hardening beyond the dislocation nucleation limit which we attribute to extreme stress localization, below the natural dislocation width length scale. Occasional early onset of non-elastic response is observed, but found to be inconsistent with simple dislocation creation on energy grounds. Experiments were performed in ultrahigh vacuum at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Indentation of sharp single crystal W(111) tips with atomic structure characterized in situ by field ion microscopy was performed on atomically flat terraces of Au(111) oriented thin films fixed to a cantilevered mount. Cantilever deflections were measured by a sensitive differential interferometer to determine forces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grutter, P.

Restenosis after vessel injury is associated with a transient state of cell proliferation and bears many similarities with wound healing. It is known that ionizing radiation can delay or impair wound healing. One proposed approach uses the deployment of a radioactive stent and continuous low dose-rate treatment. Our experimental studies have been conducted to better evaluate the radiobiology of vascular cells and as a preamble to the design of an original radioactive stent based on a 45Ca-DTPA polymer-coated stent. We performed morphometric analysis of human coronary segments with restenosis. Most of vessel area was occupied by atherosclerotic plaque and neointima accounted for a limited part. Adventitial and medial thicknesses were significantly thinner than the atherosclerotic plaque and neointima. The medial layer was the most cellular. Our results indicated that target volumes for endovascular catheter-based brachytherapy or radioactive stents remain small. After delivery of doses such as proposed in the current experience, only a few thousand cells would remain clonogenic. Depending of the residual growth stimulus, this would create a permanent impairment or a significant delay in the healing and the restenosis process. We compared in vitro responses of human and pig fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells exposed to high dose-rate gamma irradiation. Using clonogenic assays, growth inhibition and filter elution techniques, we found that human and pig cells have similar radiation responses. Our results suggest that vascular cell lines cover a broad range of radiosensitivities without specific differences between cell types. We developed an experimental set-up to evaluate the in vitro effects of low energy beta-emitters on vascular cells. The complex is the 45Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (45Ca-DTPA) with a maximal energy of 255 KeV. There was a good correlation between calculated doses and doses measured by dosimeters placed at the bottom of petri dishes. However, it seems that doses administered to cell monolayers would be better evaluated by the dose calculated by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) instead of half the calculated dose, as previously suggested. We evaluated the dose-rate effect of vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to low dose-rate irradiation with the 45Ca-DTPA complex.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these malformations or dysfunction remain poorly characterized. We have used the B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a marker to identify novel transcriptional pathways that regulate cardiac gene expression. Functional analysis of the BNP promoter had previously led to the identification of positive cis-regulatory elements and the isolation of the GATA-4 protein, which is an important trans-activator of several cardiac genes. The present study demonstrates that cell specific transcription from the BNP promoter is dependent on a dominant silencer activity in the distal upstream regulatory region, which serves to restrict its ectopic expression both, in vitro and in vivo. We have identified two distinct repressor domains R1 and R2 and show that while both repressor domains contribute additively to silencing of the native promoter, R2 alone is sufficient to repress the BNP promoter in heterologous cells. R2 is conserved across species and displays significant homology to a neuron restrictive silencer element (NRSE). We demonstrate sequence specific DNA binding activity on R2 that is present in a variety of non cardiac cells where the gene is repressed, but absent in cardiomyocytes, reiterating that repression is an important mechanism in the transcriptional regulation of BNP. We have also investigated the potential role of cardiac enriched (GATA-4) and ubiquitous factors in regulation of BNP. We report that YY1, a known transcriptional repressor of muscle gene activity, is a positive regulator of BNP, and that it can synergise with the cardiac subgroup of GATA proteins (GATA-4 and GATA-6) to augment transcription. Collectively this work demonstrates that tissue restricted expression of BNP in vivo, is a result from the combinatorial interactions of both positive and negative factors, which include on the one hand, the GATA proteins that can activate the promoterin cardiac cells in conjunction with a variety of cell restricted and ubiquitous factors such as YY1 and on the other hand, repressor(s) that restrict its expression in non cardiac cells. Our results are among the first to clearly demonstrate the in vivo importance of repressors in cardiac specific transcription, and emphasize how transcriptional diversity can be created by a limited set of transcription factors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemer, Mona (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zq23z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935467s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j724j"><dcterms:title>Cancer, fulgurance : Robbe-Grillet, de l'avant-garde au paralittéraire</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beaulé, Sophie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this study is to analyse the web of meaning underlying the presence of plots and images from paralitterature in the work of Alain Robbe-Grillet. This presence is explained by a transformation in the bookmarket, cultural environment and literary landscape, and corresponds to the malaise in the social discourse raised by the crisis. The bookmarket changed rapidly in the years following the war. Its reorganization along industrial lines lead to recurrent periods of crisis. That part of the market consisting of mass produced books came under the influence of American popular fiction. This situation had repurcussions on the literary field. People no longer saw books and authors as special, and the readership of serious literature decreased markedly. The avant garde itself seemed exhausted. Works of paralitterature, on the other hand, entered in a process of legitimation. The New Novelists, and especially Robbe-Grillet, find in paralitterature expressions of the social discourse more powerful than those available in canonical literature. Popular fictions, rife with violence and agression, capture the worries and pessimism about society and the alienation of the individual. In Robbe-Grillet's work, the world is conceived as containing a cancer, one that threatens the social order. Reality is distorted in his fiction, and the characters are fragmented and lost in their imaginary world. The image of a cancerous society is crystallized in the motif of the ritual sacrifice of a woman. For Robbe-Grillet, though, this motif also suggests the origin of fantasy, and in doing so might rejuvenate the creative impulse. Behind the violence and eroticism of his fiction, then, and behind the anomia contaminating literature, is the desire to retrace the lightening of fantasy in the hope of dealing with both the modern world and the predicament of the novel, and possibly find a catharsis through it.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angenot, Marc (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps09v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j724j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Robbe-Grillet, Alain, 1922-2008 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956h56r"><dcterms:title>Localization of functional prostaglandin E2 receptors in the nuclear envelope</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bhattacharya, Mousumi, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prostaglandin E2 is thought to act via G protein-coupled plasma membrane EP receptors. For the first time, studies reported in this thesis provide several lines of evidence suggesting the presence of functional nuclear membrane EP receptors in a variety of cells and tissues, in both newborn and adult animals. Radioligand binding studies revealed that the kinetics of PGE 2 binding to plasma membrane and nuclear membrane fractions isolated from pig newborn brain, adult uterus and adult rat liver were similar; these tissues are known to express high levels of PGE2 receptors. However in each tissue, the relative distribution of EP receptors in plasma membrane and nuclear membrane differed. A perinuclear localization of EP1, EP3alpha and EP4 receptors was visualized by indirect immunocytofluorescence in cultured porcine newborn cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells over-expressing these receptors, in fibroblast Swiss 3T3 cells over-expressing EP1 receptor and in HEK 293 cells expressing EP1 receptor fused to green fluorescent protein. High resolution immunostaining of EP1, EP3alpha and EP4 receptors revealed their presence in the nuclear envelope of cultured porcine endothelial cells and in situ, in adult rat brain (cortex) endothelial cells and neurons. These nuclear membrane EP receptors were found to increase the transcription of two target genes (iNOS, c-fos) that are known to be stimulated by PGE2. Nuclear calcium transients were also modulated by stimulation of nuclear EP receptors and this appears to involve pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. The discovery of nuclear EP receptors opens new avenues for the intracellular actions of prostanoids.* *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Varma, D. R.

Andrei Sakharov contributed to this development by relying very substantially on his colleagues in North America and Western Europe in his battles to free Soviet society. He understood---as they themselves sometimes did not---to what degree the prestige of the Soviet Union's own military-industrial complex depended not only on the West's concrete achievements in science and technology, but on the political positions its scientists adopted in the Cold War. Hence this particular study, the purpose of which is to determine the historical significance of Sakharov's drive against the Soviet regime in the light of the reaction of his scientific colleagues in the West. Before 1968, Sakharov was known to a handful of Western scientists as the father of the Soviet H-Bomb, which partly accounts for the fact that many had doubts not only on the genuine nature of his reflections, issued that year, but on Sakharov's very existence. His deportation to Gorky in January 1980 undermined the hawks and sceptics in the West, and turned him into a global figure, characterized by original thinking, self-denial, legitimacy of purpose and undisputed moral authority. It did so on the basis of liberal philosophical principles with which most Western scientists found themselves in accord. Having reached an unprecedented level, their protests would play a crucial role in Sakharov's release by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986. This, however, came at a price---the boycott of scientific exchanges with the Soviet Union which was the ultimate gesture of solidarity with the cause Sakharov represented. For many scientists this was a soul-wrenching choice, made in the face of persuasive arguments for maintaining open relations with the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Nevertheless, due to its exceptional symbolism, Sakharov's exile even legitimized the concept of boycott for the more important national scientific societies in the West---which only shortly prior to 1980 were still reluctant to condone any sign even of public protest. This study makes use of previously unexplored material such as that of the Committee of Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov, and Shcharansky at the University of California in Berkeley. It also relies heavily on accounts by the latter and other scientists in the United States, France and Great Britain who took part in some of the events described, among them legendary figures such as Edward Teller and Henri Cartan.

The first step of this research project was to design, build and evaluate two processing rolls integrated in an experimental pull-type forage harvester. With a 12.7 mm theoretical length of cut setting, the processing rolls were used to treat alfalfa at a 1 mm clearance between the rolls. Samples analyzed at an animal research centre showed that processing increased the effective ruminal degradability of corn by 3% but did not improve the degradability of alfalfa. The presence of processing rolls in the forage harvester increased friction. The air inlet area had to be increased to improve particle flow and obtain maximum air outlet speed. The presence of crop processing rolls required an increase in blower speed of 10 to 20% to maintain the throwing capacity. Critical speeds were analyzed by the Transfer Matrix Component Mode Syntheses (TMCMS) method and three classical approaches using analytical models to predict deflections in the shaft. Experiments showed that the TMCMS method was very reliable and predicted the critical speed with an error of about 4% compared to 8% or higher for classical methods. Modal analysis also proved to be a simple and practical way to measure critical speed. A laboratory setup was built to investigate various mechanical adjustments: roll clearances of 4 and 6 mm for corn, and 1 and 3 mm for grass; eight peripheral speed ratios between 1.08 and 1.93; two levels of throughput (9 and 18 t fresh crop/h). Optimal adjustment will ultimately depend on animal response to various levels of crop breakage. A hydrodynamic model of chopped forage processed between rolls was developed to determine crop properties using an experimental database and subsequently predict the power requirement as a function of the configuration. Forage specific area was estimated using an experimental micro-screening method. A program was developed to calculate mechanical stresses within each roll of the crop processor as a function of working conditions and steel properties.

Information on this parasitoid is scarce and investigations of its biology and behaviour were conducted to optimize its mass-production, and improve our understanding of the A. kamali/M. hirsutus system. Host selection experiments showed that, of nine species tested, HMB was the only suitable mealybug species for A. kamali development. Third nymphal instar was the optimal stage for wasp mass-production since A. kamali progeny from this stage had a female biased sex ratio and it had a weaker immune response as evidenced by lower encapsulation rate than adult female HMB. Parasitoid functional response was of type III in variable-time conditions, ensuring the preservation of HMB population at low density, and of type II--III in fixed-time conditions, leading to a better use of HMB population in mass-rearing. Temperature and photoperiod had a profound impact on parasitoid fecundity, 26°C and LD 0:24 being the optimal condition to maximize A. kamali oviposition. Parasitoid body size was positively correlated to its fitness. Large parasitoids lived significantly longer, had a higher fecundity, and progeny emergence with a lower sex ratio than small ones. Studies on mating showed that A. kamali is arrhenotokous and that multiple mating is required to optimize progeny sex ratio. Progeny production by mated females was also higher than that of virgin females. Female parasitoid fecundity was negatively correlated to their density due to mutual interference. Under mass-rearing conditions, 75 female A. kamali per cage was the optimum. Finally, under stored condition, food supply and low temperature (20°C) appeared essential to sustain parasitoid longevity.

Their iconoclastic fervour in the context of Hindu India appears (at face-value) as an anomaly because image-worship is widely perceived as such a prominent feature of that religion. Is their image-rejection to be explained as a borrowing of an Islamic or Protestant attitude? Both men have been referred to as the "Luther of India," but is the label "Protestant" as also applied to their reformed Hinduism appropriate and what is suggested by this expression? The dissertation examines indigenous and foreign elements in the anti-idolatry polemics of both men and argues that explanation by diffusion from non-Indian sources is inadequate whereas explanation by independent invention is in need of nuancing. I explore the hypothesis that metaphysical arguments against images may be considered indigenous to India whereas moral arguments imply borrowing. I argue that although catalyzed by Western influence, nineteenth-century Hindu iconoclasm draws on Indian sources. The British presence in nineteenth-century India acts as the "stress" that triggers the particular diathesis (latent cultural predisposition) that manifests in the Hindu iconoclasm of these two reformers. The fact that the two men had very different backgrounds and degrees of integration with Islamic or British culture and yet both regarded image-worship as the central issue of reform suggests other grounds to explain their iconoclasm than borrowing or diffusion. I explore the formative events in their biographies that describe their individual disenchantment with images. Further, evidence is presented from their writings that indicates that a major concern for both men in the attack on "idolatry" was the disenchantment of religion and culture in the service of the development, unification, and modernization of Hindu India.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard P.

Previous work described the prominent actions of NT-3 during development, but its role in mature neurons was less clear. Because the re-expression of developmentally important molecules is often observed as neurons recover from injury, I investigated the following aspects of the NT-3/TrkC-receptor system in a specific population of intact and damaged CNS neurons, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs): 1. Detection and localization of NT-3 and its receptor in the retina. Using competitive RT-PCR, I detected low levels of NT-3 expression in the intact retinas of adult rats. Because RGCs represent only about 2% of the entire population of retinal neurons, I used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify the precise source of this neurotrophin. The NT-3 transcripts were only found in some RGCs and TrkC receptor was expressed by about 30% of RGCs. However, the actual co-localization of the trophin and its receptor could not be determined for technical reasons. The finding of TrkC receptor in one-third of RGCs of the mature animal clearly defined a specific sub-population of these neurons where NT-3 can be assumed to play a role. The limited expression of TrkC in adult RGCs contrasts with the high TrkC levels shown to be present in most developing retinal neurons (Ernfors et al., 1992). Furthermore, because most adult RGCs express the TrkB receptor (Jelsma et al., 1993), it is likely that specific but partially overlapping trophic factor dependencies are present in these neurons. The possible coexistence of both NT-3 and TrkC in RGCs also indicates the likelihood of an autocrine loop for the production and binding of this trophin within some of these neurons. 2. Expression of NT-3 and its receptor after injury. The experiments in the injured retinas demonstrated that the expression of neither NT-3 nor TrkC was enhanced in injured RGCs. In other words, axotomized RGCs did not reproduce the expression patterns for these two molecules that have been documented during developmental growth. In fact, the mRNA levels for TrkC and the related receptor, TrkB, were significantly down-regulated in the axotomized RGCs. Such a downregulation of these receptors provides a possible cue for further investigations of the transient response of axotomized RGCs to the prolonged administration of neurotrophins (Mansour-Robaey et al., 1994; Di Polo et al., 1998; Clarke et al., 1998). 3. Effects of exogenous NT-3 on injured RGCs . In a further attempt to understand the role of NT-3 in RGC survival and growth, I delivered NT-3 to axotomized RGCs via intraocular injections. Exogenous NT-3 displayed a variety of effects on injured RGCs, including a transient increase in the survival of only some of the RGCs, stimulation of axonal growth, and an up-regulation of the growth-associated molecule, GAP-43. Because the proportion of RGCs showing these effects correlated well with the numbers of neurons expressing TrkC, it is assumed that the restricted effects of NT-3 were due to its selective action on this RGC sub-population. The early effect of NT-3 on RGC survival and its later effect on axonal growth suggest that distinct intracellular signaling pathways may mediate these phenotypes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bray, Garth M.

On-line pulp potential measurements at the head of the copper flotation circuit were performed over a period of nearly one year. Windows of selectivity between the copper and zinc minerals were observed but the leading edge, and the width of the window were affected by the state of the sensor. Procedures for the verification of the state of the on-line sensor were established to ensure long term reliability of sensor. Sensitivity analysis of the pulp potential to modifiers, such as lime and sodium cyanide, suggested that these reagents could be controlled using the measured pulp potential to maintain the oxidation-reduction state of the pulp within the window of selectivity. A shorter study at the Kidd Creek concentrator indicated the presence of a window of selectivity between copper and zinc minerals but the leading edge and width of the window were different than that observed at Les Mines Selbaie. This suggests that the windows of selectivity are affected by ore and plant specific variables. Laboratory investigations on feed pulp samples demonstrated that collectorless flotation of the copper minerals was a significant contributor to copper recovery in the A-1 zone circuit. Unfortunately, collectorless copper recovery was limited to around 60% and only a small proportion of the silver could be recovered in this fashion. The addition of collectors such as Aerophine 3418A (sodium di-isobutyl dithiophosphinate) or sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX) was required to achieve high recoveries but the selectivity response of these two collectors was different. The selectivity obtained with SIPX could be manipulated by modulation of the pulp potential before or after introduction of the collector. However, Aerophine 3418A exhibited an irreversibility in that an oxidation of the pulp before its introduction usually lead to a decreased selectivity even if the pulp potential was reduced prior to flotation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J.

Bacterial superantigens are of clinical relevance since they cause diseases in human, but also for their potential as immunotherapeutic agents. More fundamentally, SAgs have always been valuable tools in gaining insights into the mechanisms of T cell activation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/peptide ligands. The work presented in this thesis addresses structural, as well as functional aspects of the interaction between SAg, major histocompatibility class II molecules and T cell receptor.

Monocytic cells are long lived and become ferocious producers of virus upon pathogen costimulation. This high level of viral replication may result from the activation of NF-kappaB transcription factors. In addition to orchestrating the host inflammatory response, NF-kappaB strongly transactivates the HIV-1 promoter, making NF-kappaB activation a double edged sword; stimuli that induce an NF-kappaB mediated response also lead to HIV-1 transcription. We have used two promonocytic cell models to investigate the regulation of NF-kappaB signaling and its functional role in HIV-1 infected myeloid cells. Experiments conducted in U937 and PLB-985 cells and their HIV-1 infected counterparts U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB, revealed that HIV-1 infected cells express constitutive NF-kappaB·DNA binding activity due to altered regulation of upstream kinases. The double stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the IkappaB kinase (IKK) are constitutively activated in these cells and lead to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory IkappaB proteins. Degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta releases NF-kappaB which translocates to the nucleus and activates responsive genes, including kappaB dependent NF-kappaB genes p105/p50, p100/p52 and c-Rel. These NF-kappaB subunits are increased in HIV-1 infected U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB cells and may contribute to constitutive NF-kappaB activation. In addition, IkappaBbeta is able to enter the nucleus and bind DNA bound NF-kappaB forming a ternary complex. IkappaBbeta shields NF-kappaB from dissociation by IkappaBalpha, maintaining transcriptionally active NF-kappaB. Degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta therefore releases active NF-kappaB, and IkappaBbeta additionally protects DNA bound NF-kappaB from inhibition from newly synthesized IkappaBalpha. We further examined the function of constitutive NF-kappaB activation and found it to be important for maintaining cell viability of HIV-1 infected cells. TNFalpha induced apoptosis inversely correlated with NF-kappaB activation in monocytic cells and inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activation resulted in apoptotic death in HIV-1 infected, but not uninfected cells. Therefore, it seems that HIV-1 induces NF-kappaB activation by modulating upstream kinases so that the cell can resist HIV-1 induced apoptosis. These results may have important implications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hiscott, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj09r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb24r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v471j"><dcterms:title>Multiple isoforms of rat DNA methyltransferase are encoded by the cytosine DNA methyltransferase gene and differentially expressed</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Deng, Jing, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tissue- and gene-specific DNA methylation patterns are hallmarks of vertebrate genomes and have been suggested to play a critical role in regulating genome functions. There is remarkable diversity of DNA methylation patterns. However, it is yet unclear what is responsible for this diversity. In this dissertation, Chapters Two and Three, we test the hypothesis that multiple forms of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase are generated from a single DNA methyltransferase gene (Dnmt1) in vertebrates in vivo. We show that diversification of the N-terminus of Dnmt1 occurs by two mechanisms, multiple transcription initiations and alternative splicing. The rat Dnmt1 initiates transcription from three sites at least: a distal promoter, and a downstream promoter in exon 3 and exon 4. In addition to alternative initiations, alternatively spliced N-terminus domains are also present in rat brain. Similarly, we show that the DNA methyltransferase domain of rat Dnmt1 is alternatively spliced in vivo, generating different in-frame variants of DNA methyltransferase in specific tissues. This process is developmentally regulated, and is induced in PC12 cells by nerve growth factor (NGF). Using this PC12 differentiation model, in Chapter Four, we further test the hypothesis that the expression of Dnmt1 is regulated with the developmental state of neuronal cells. We show that DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1) activity is sharply reduced 4 days after NGF treatment. Similarly, the adult brain expresses reduced levels of Dnmt1 activity. The abundance of Dnmt1 mRNA as well as the Dnmt1 polypeptide is down regulated. Downregulation of Dnmt1 parallels other indicators of withdrawal from the cell cycle such as p21 and prolife rating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and may not be required for initiation of PC12 differentiation. This temporal pattern is different from myotube differentiation where down regulation of DNA methyltransferase and demethylation is an early event and is proposed to play a causal role in differentiation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szyf, Moshe (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sb97z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v471j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gq010"><dcterms:title>Male mediated developmental effects of altering DNA methylation in the germ line</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Doerksen, Tonia Elaine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, 5-azacytidine, a drug which is incorporated into DNA and blocks DNA methylation, was administrated to male rats to determine its effects on male germ cell development and function. Chronic treatment at doses of 0 to 5.0 mg/kg for four, six, eleven or sixteen weeks were designed to expose different populations of germ cells. Males were mated with normal females to evaluate progeny outcome. Treatment of rats for four weeks, which exposes postmeiotic germ cells only, resulted in no changes in male reproductive organ weights, or abnormal progeny outcome. Treatment for eleven and sixteen weeks which exposes germ cells throughout spermatogenesis, resulted in dose-dependent decreases in testis and epididymal weights, and sperm counts, and increased preimplantation loss when embryos were examined at day twenty of gestation. Examination of embryos at day two of gestation confirmed that embryos sired by males treated with 5-azacytidine were abnormal and died prior to implantation. Six weeks of treatment, which exposes meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells, had an effect on male reproductive organs and progeny outcome intermediate between that of four and eleven weeks of treatment. 5-Azacytidine exposure resulted in abnormalities in testicular histology after eleven, but not six weeks, however closer evaluation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling detection in situ showed that germ cells were undergoing apoptosis after both exposure times. Analysis of DNA methylation levels in isolated germ cells and sperm indicated that 5-azacytidine caused decreases in DNA methylation in spermatozoa after 6 and 11 weeks of treatment, and 6 weeks of treatment caused decreases in DNA methylation of round spermatids, but not pachytene spermatocytes.

Analyzing six three dimensional reconstructions---with 11000--22000 raindrops each and with nominal rain rates in the range of 8--15 mm/hr.---we performed the first direct investigation of the continuum limit of a large number of particles in cloud/rain physics. Since the mean interparticle distance was 7--8 cm and the largest sphere has a radius of the order 2 m, our range of scales is only roughly a factor of 10. Nevertheless, we were able to show clear evidence that a non-trivial multiscaling limit was obtained at least for one rain event out of the two studied; the q th moment of the liquid water density in a radius r was found to scale with a nonlinear (but convex) exponent K(q), characteristic of multifractals. In contrast, when the particle positions were randomized, clear convergence to the classical (homogeneous) continuum was observed with K(q) = 0. By raising the raindrop volumes to a power n = 1/3, in order to improve convergence towards the continuum limit, the universal multifractal parameters of this quantity derived from the field of liquid water content were estimated to be alpha = 1.95 +/- 0.1, C1 = 0.05 +/- 0.01 and H = -0.01 +/- 0.01.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lovejoy, Shaun (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655j29h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032468b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jq458"><dcterms:title>The world trade system beyond 50 -- a historical analysis &amp; proposals for reform : revitalizing Cordell Hull's founding vision</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Watson, Peter S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis reviews the 50 year history of the GATT/WTO trading system in order to assess how far the system has achieved the goals and objectives of its principal founders, with a view to recommending proposals for completing the same in the context of the next major round of WTO negotiations. Emphasis is laid throughout the work on actions which need to be taken to ensure that the world trade system has a set of integrated rules which address the realities of increasing international economic interdependence. The conclusion of this work incorporates various steps that can be taken towards achieving this objective. A principal thesis of this work is that the actual achievements of the GATT/WTO system are less than those intended by Cordell Hull, the principal founder of what became the initial GATT arrangements, and, accordingly, a series of proposals are advanced to complete Hull's original vision. Most significantly, important elements of the failed Havana Charter, which was to establish the International Trade Organization (ITO), have yet to be incorporated into present GATT/WTO disciplines. In particular, the Havana Charter included provisions dealing with investment and private restraints on trade, which are now indispensable, as contemporary restrictions on the ability to truly contest international markets originate more from the internal structuring of domestic markets, rather than from border measures. This reality has been recognized in regional trading arrangements, and, accordingly, an examination of the principal non-multilateral trading systems is made in this respect, particularly the European Union, and the NAFTA. Based on a review of the need for the same, this work proposes new WTO disciplines for investment and competition policy, as well as a series of proposals to facilitate regulatory reform in services, the area in which they are most needed. Finally, a series of proposals are made to restructure the basic WTO agreements to remove inconsistencies which have evolved in the last 50 yews, and to facilitate truly effective P. market access, i.e. the ability to actually contest international markets. Collectively, these proposals are fundamental prerequisites to the orderly operation of the contemporary world trading system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gm614.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jq458</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>History, Modern.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n034n"><dcterms:title>Human rights and federalism in canada : two solitudes?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tran, Luan-Vu N., 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fundamental rights have been traditionally understood as prohibitions of state interference with the private affairs of citizens. Classic liberalism views human freedom generally as the absence of governmental restrictions, maintaining that happiness, prosperity and progress can be achieved only by limiting government. The dissertation challenges these traditional assumptions by showing that the protection of fundamental rights depends on both restraint and intervention of the state. Therefore, the realization of freedom, equality and justice should not be left to market forces but requires active governmental participation. The state assumes positive as well as negative obligations under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This means that governmental authorities, legislatures and courts must respect, protect and promote Charter guarantees. The Charter makes space for economic, social and cultural fights, which presuppose a cooperative and dialogical relationship between the three governmental branches (executive, legislative, and judicial bodies). The thesis also grapples with another issue in the current Canadian constitutional debate. It is widely believed that federalism is antagonistic to liberal values, in particular the guarantees of the Charter; that the nature and purpose of the Charter imply a superior role of Ottawa vis-a-vis the provinces because cultural diversity and decentralization of power undermine its effectiveness. The dissertation recasts the debate and proposes ways to reconcile human rights with federalism and its underlying objective---the preservation of cultural diversity. It offers an analytical framework that allows us to view fundamental rights and cultural pluralism as interdependent and indivisible values protected by the Canadian Constitution. The thesis concludes with a proposal for a multicultural interpretation of the Charter on the basis of which cultural differences can be identified and accommodated. It stipulates that a pluralistic constitutional discourse is possible insofar as the Charter is seen as a document establishing substantive and institutional conditions for Canadians to engage in deliberative democracy and, thereby facilitating communicative actions by citizens from all walks of life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, Stephen (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c439w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n034n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canadian Studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816p224"><dcterms:title>Les mécanismes de règlement des différends dans l'espace économique américain : les perspectives d'avenir</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lachapelle, Guy, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, after examining the evolution of both the economic situation over the recent past and of the various treaties and agreements that both inspired and responded to this evolution, we propose a resolutely legalistic procedure for dispute resolution to be included in a panamerican free-trade agreement that would encompass almost all countries of the American continent, in accordance with the objective announced by the heads of State who participated in the Summit of the Americas. We opt for institutional dispute resolution mechanisms that would intervene after any possibility of appealing a ruling by a lower forum has been ruled out, thus reducing the links between the political and juridical structures of the eventual treaty, recognizing that private parties may, in certain circumstances, have an inherent right to intervene in such proceedings. We favor the inclusion within the treaty itself---particularly as far as competition law is concerned---of substantive law that would be as comprehensive as possible, and suggest means for this substantive law to continue to evolve even after the treaty is concluded. Without setting aside a pragmatic approach which is always likely to help solve or avoid disputes, we have strived for the recognition by states of the inescapability of a strong legalistic approach, each element of which would be free of any suspected political meddling, if we really want the liberalization of exchange between countries of such diverse socio-economic conditions as those we find in the Americas. The objectives of a regional agreement on the opening of the economy and trade liberalization must be different from those of multinational agreements such as the WTO; otherwise, the existence of such agreements could not be justified. Each must provide for dispute resolution mechanisms adapted to its specific mission.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, Stephen J.
