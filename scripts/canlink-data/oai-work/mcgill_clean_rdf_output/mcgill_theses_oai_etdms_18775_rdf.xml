Loadflow feasibility is that property of a power network defining the theoretical limitations on the bus injections under which a steady state equilibrium exists.

This region is characterised by a set of supporting hyperplanes each of which defines an explicit necessary condition for loadflow feasibility on the bus injections. A quantitative measure of loadflow feasibility for an arbitrary given operating injection vector is defined through a computable scalar stability margin. This stability margin permits the loadflow feasibility of different injections and network structures to be quantitatively compared and analysed. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, F.D.

In 1949, at a meeting of the Case Work Section the first attempt at implementation of this proposal, was effected. A committee was set up to study this problem, and to acquaint the community with what an adequate programme of mental health should contain to meet the needs of the emotionally disturbed child.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, E.

W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Spanish Tragedy, in its original form, was written by Thomas Kyd (1558-94), probably during the period 1585-7. A dramatic adaptation of a tale of human passion--the revenge of Hieronimo, Marshall of Spain, on the murderers of his only son--The Spanish Tragedy soon became one of the most popular of Elizabethan plays. It achieved this distinction, as Dr. Boas points out, not because Kyd was a great poet, thinker, or moralist, but because he was a born dramatist with a talent for impressive rhetoric, for exploiting the full technical resources of the Elizabethan stage, and for adapting the Senecan tradition to suit the sympathies of contemporary taste.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duthie, G.

Hallowell (7) made use of the Rorschach test to analyze "Acculturation Processes and Personality Changes" among the Canadian Ojibwa. He compared two groups, one inland and one outland, and found evidence that distinct personality changes were taking place among the more acculturated outland group.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, E.

The thesis is concerned completely with overland transportation, and thus with railway transport. In it, we are concerned with the making of individual railway rates, and not with the broader problem of the general rate level. There are two major aspects to the subject. They are rate making from the viewpoint of railway management, and rate making as a subject of public policy. So far as the latter is concerned, we shall not in this thesis concern ourselves with freight rates as an aspect of national economic policy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marsh, D.

T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ever since the anesthetic and analgesic properties of nitrous oxide were discovered, the question of how nitrous oxide produces these effects has constantly arisen. Some workers claim that, since nitrous oxide is an inert and nontoxic gas, it does not influence the metabolic processes of body tissues. Others, however, feel that the anesthetic powers of nitrous oxide are either attributable to or accompanied by, inhibitory effects on the oxidative processes of the nervous system. This study was undertaken with the view to finding out if nitrous oxide directly affects the metabolic mechanism of the tissue cells, and if so which enzyme systems are most sensitive to its action.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.
