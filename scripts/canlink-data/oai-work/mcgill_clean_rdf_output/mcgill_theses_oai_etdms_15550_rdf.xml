In constructing a probability model for an experiment, the first step is a consideration of what are the possible outcomes of the experiment. We assume that all possibilities for the outcomes can be foreseen, and we refer to this collection of outcomes as the sample space H. An arbitrary outcome or point of this space is designated by x.

Although the liver probably plays an important role in this regard, the importance of extrahepatic tissues in steroid metabolism is becoming increasingly apparent. In 1948 Werthessen and collaborators (1, 2, 3) reported that incubation of estrone in blood resulted in destruction of the 17-keto function of the steroid accompanied by a loss of biological activity. On the other hand, Bischoff and associates (4, 5) incubated the red cells of rabbit or man with estrone and observed a marked increase in the biological activity of the added steroid. The discrepancy in the two sets of data was ascribed at the time to differences either in assay techniques or in experimental conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hobkirk, R.

Since then a great deal of research has been done on this distribution and the distributions stemming from it. It enjoys remarkable application in medecine, psychology, genetics, biology, physics, economics and other areas. This work is an attempt to present, in an organized manner, the existing knowledge of the Poisson distribution, and so, is basicly expository in nature, and definitely not original. Complete references are given throughout. The Poisson distribution and four generalized Poisson distributions are first introduced and various properties are developed, properties which are used in the later chapters on estimation and hypothesis testing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patil, G.

The beams were subjected to different loading conditions so that various combinations of shear and bending moment existed at the opening. A study of the stress distributions around the openings was made. The results were compared to the theories developed on the basis of the theory of elasticity and on the basis of the simplified method of the Vierendeel Truss solution. Expressions were derived for the stresses. The investigation showed the presence of high stress concentrations at the edge of the large circular opening and the reduction of the yield load capacity in every case examined. There was no reduction in the ultimate load capacity in the beams tested except in the case of pure bending.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gersovitz, B.

Today, the sugar-cane plant is cultivated in a number of countries in the tropics and subtropics--in many of which, conditions do not appear to be ideal. Because of the increasing demand for this commodity over so long a period and in so many diverse areas, sugar-cane has spread widely with the discovery and settlement of new lands, beginning in the 15th century. Subsequent expansion of European and world trade, vagaries of evolving geopolitics, and later, inter-commodity competition induced under differing political conditions helped to continue the spread of the plant. The sugar-cane which remains a major commercial crop, can benefit from a climatological investigation into its growth requirements, for this, in fact, has been very little investigated during the three hundred years of prominence and dispersal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, F.
