Using potential vorticity (PV) based diagnostics and an extension of piecewise PV inversion techniques that accounts for atmospheric water, the initial conditions of the Mesoscale Compressible Community model are altered by the individual removal of possible forcing features. Results from ensuing sensitivity tests are compared to the control simulation and changes in the structure and/or the intensity of ET/R are diagnosed. It is found that the existence of a trough upstream of the remnant TC is a necessary forcing for redevelopment and that larger north-south trough amplitudes result in stronger vortex reintensification. Transitions occurring in the equatorward entrance region of a baroclinic jet are likely to undergo baroclinic mode redevelopment, whereas those taking place in the poleward exit region of the jet usually take on tropical mode characteristics. Baroclinic mode storms are insensitive to the structure of the TC remnant; tropical mode redevelopment, however, rely heavily on both the circulation and the moisture associated with the ex-tropical feature. Considered pragmatically, the results of this study amount to a list of the key ingredients necessary for the ET/R of the storms studied, which will be of use in the forecasting of similar events. A broader application of the findings in the context of current ET research yields insight into both the dynamics and thermodynamics of these extreme events.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736666871.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sc61s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Earth Sciences - Atmospheric Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128d15c"><dcterms:title>Partner satisfaction and renewal likelihood in consumer supported agriculture (CSA) : a case study of The Equiterre CSA network</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Achuo, George</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558g34q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128d15c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organic farming -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consumer supported agriculture (CSA) is a mutually beneficial food system that is based on forward contracts between a farmer and consumers. CSA emphasizes organic production methods, and local production for local consumption. A review of the literature on CSA indicates that it is thriving as an alternative to the conventional food system. Yet, the sustainable growth of the CSA food system is threatened by high partner turnover. A case study of the Equiterre CSA network was done to identify causes of high partner turnover. 378 useable surveys, out of 500 sent out, were used to identify factors that influence satisfaction and the likelihood to renew the partnership. An ordered probit model was estimated for each dependent variable. Nine factors each were found to significantly influence satisfaction and the likelihood to renew partnership. Satisfaction with product quantity, quality and price, and partner perception of their ability to influence basket contents were statistically significant in the both models. Satisfaction with the location of delivery points was significant in the renewal model. In terms of socio-demographic variables, income and the number of children under 12 years in a household both had negative effects on satisfaction while age had a positive effect on renewal. A high correlation (r=0.7) between global satisfaction and renewal suggests that CSAs can reduce the turnover rate by delivering in areas that influence global satisfaction with the system. The results suggest that the single most important area in this regard is that of choice and variety of produce. A more flexible system of constituting baskets and a more diversified selection of produce may be useful areas of focus on the farmers' part.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consumer satisfaction -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sustainable agriculture -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht93p"><dcterms:title>Biology and control strategies for whitefly (Bemisia tabaci Gennadius) (Homoptera:Aleyrodidae) populations in Burkina Faso (West Africa)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Otoidobiga, Lenli Claude</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Field and laboratory investigations were conducted in Burkina Faso to diagnose the causes of severe outbreaks of Bemisia tabaci populations and gênerai failures of chemical control against this pest in cotton.

This research also considers the development of stabilizing feedback laws for bilinear systems. The relevance of bilinear systems is due to the fact that they result from the linearization of certain nonlinear control systems with respect to the state only.

Data were gathered through household interviews (n=76) and field visits (n=396) between June and November 2001. Results reveal marked variations in access to land and communal labor between and within communities. Household age, initial land wealth and initial inputs of labor are crucial in explaining land and labor inequalities within villages.

To date, the role that strontium modification plays in the precipitation process during the heat treatment is not well understood. The objective of the present work is to obtain a better understanding of the effect that strontium modification and heat treatment parameters exert on the properties of heat-treated Al-7%Si-0.3Mg alloy. The investigation consisted of a systematic measurement of the electrical conductivity and matrix microhardness of heat-treated coupons under different process conditions. Tensile properties were also measured and a transmission electron microscopy study of critical samples was done. The results obtained in this work indicate that the heat treatment of this alloy can be optimized. Solution heat treatment and artificial aging can be reduced and natural aging manipulated. The use of a continuous heating artificial aging is proposed. During the heat treatment of the A356 alloy under certain conditions not only does the precipitation of the Mg2Si occur, but also that of silicon. It was found that strontium modification does not influence the precipitation kinetics of the Mg2Si, but it does retard the precipitation of the silicon out of the matrix.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd350.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397b433</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117r10c"><dcterms:title>Carbon dynamics in northern peatlands, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roehm, Charlotte L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Biogeochemical carbon dynamics govern the ability of peatlands to storecarbon.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in milk was monitored by SB-ATR/FTIR spectroscopy, and changes in the concentrations of glucose, galactose and lactose during the process were successfully measured quantitatively. SB-ATR/FTIR spectroscopy was shown also to perform comparably to Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy for the determination of the alcohol content of distilled liquors and better than FT-NIR spectroscopy and comparably to transmission FTIR spectroscopy for the analysis of alcohol, total reducing sugar, total acidity and pH in wines. In addition, a set of 149 pre-analyzed wine samples was employed to develop and validate an SB-ATR/FTIR calibration for 11 different parameters and constituents in wines with the use of partial-least-squares (PLS) regression, demonstrating the potential utility of this method in the routine analysis of wines. The application of SB-ATR/FTIR spectroscopy and H2D-CS in the selection of wavelengths for multiple linear regression (MLR) calibration for FT-NIR analysis of ternary aqueous solutions of fructose, glucose and galactose was also investigated. NIR wavelengths were identified for the three sugars by H2D-CS of the SB-ATR/FTIR spectra of binary sugar solutions in relation to their FT-NIR spectra. An MLR calibration developed based on these wavelengths gave better results than PLS calibrations and comparable results to those obtained by MLR using wavelengths selected by examination of 1st and 2nd derivative spectra. H2D-CS was extended to include 2D correlations between high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and SB-ATR/FTIR data for the purpose of identifying HPLC peaks without the need to isolate the eluted compounds. The potential utility of this approach, termed spectroscopic/chromatographic 2D correlation (SC2D-C), was investigated by generating FTIR slice spectra corresponding to the HPLC peaks of wines spiked with sucrose, glucose and fructose and comparing them to 404 reference spectra in an IR spectral library. It was found that these constituents were correctly identified provided there was sufficient random variability of their concentrations in the samples analyzed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd899.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773x86v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Milk -- Composition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wine and wine making -- Analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lactose.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r0601"><dcterms:title>Corrective feedback and L2 learning : elicitation and recasts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ammar, Ahlem</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This quasi-experimental study was designed to investigate the effects of negative feedback on second language acquisition and to determine the potential benefits of two different negative feedback techniques, namely recasts and elicitation.

Social historians have demonstrated that the early modern English calendar was anything but stable, and that the nature of days and their observances was often hotly disputed. This is a study of how authors of literature reflected and produced calendar consciousness in the face of changing systems of time reckoning. I focus upon texts which explore alternative models of social time: Thomas More's Utopia, Edmund Spenser's Shepheardes Calender and Faerie Queene, William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and a cluster of texts published in 1603. These works share the recognition that calendars are at least as much the product of custom as they are of nature, and are therefore potentially open to social adaptation and political appropriation. The idea of custom as "second nature" is both an object of study in the dissertation and provides its general methodology and theoretical orientation. In early modern usage, "custom" could refer to much of what we might call both "ideology" and "culture." In its most general sense, however, custom simply referred to individual habit and social praxis, and was one means by which particular activities could be politically legitimated. My goal is to demonstrate what many early modern authors recognized: that a calendar is both a product of custom and a framework within which social behaviour is produced. When confronted with other systems of temporal organization, authors were encouraged to reflect upon their own, and to consider the possibilities in alternative social orders.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qv13w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r581</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calendars</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wj239"><dcterms:title>"Nickel precipitation by ozone oxidation in a semi-batch bubble reactor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Calzado Palomino, Luis Enrique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research aims to develop the use of ozone in nickel oxidation-precipitation from dilute solutions.

Parameters evaluated included: diffuser porosity, volume of liquid and superficial gas velocity. To calculate the mass transfer coefficient ("kL") interfacial area ("a") is estimated from gas holdup and bubble size measurements.

Icing is a serious and not yet totally mastered meteorological hazard due to supercooled water droplets (liquid water droplets at a temperature below the dew point) that impact on aerodynamic surfaces. Icing results in performance degradations including substantial reduction of engine performance and stability, reduction in maximum lift and stall angle and an increase of drag. A realistic ice accretion simulation is achieved if the three contributing factors: the aerodynamic flow field, the water droplet trajectories, and the thermodynamic ice accretion process, are accurately modeled. A new approach to in-flight icing analysis is formulated and validated into this work. The methodology presented in this thesis is intended to be based on modern CFD algorithms to develop a useable new ice accretion tool for aircraft and engines, including: the solution of the 3D compressible turbulent Navier-Stokes equations; the computation of the collection efficiency by an Eulerian method; and a new module for the three-dimensional ice accretion process. To successfully complete the work, an appropriate turbulence model has been added to the existing flow solver. Therefore a part of this work has been the implementation and validation of the Spalart-Allmaras model. This turbulence model appeared to be robust and easy to use even in situation of complex 3D flow patterns encountered in icing. The new ice accretion model is expressed with mass and heat transfer balance at the aerodynamic surface using partial differential  equations and four compatibility relations to close the system. An appropriate numerical scheme based on finite volume method is derived to solve the resulting system. 2D and 3D validations of the complete in-flight system (dry air flow field/droplets/ice accretion) conclude this work.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pq23j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qc02d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Mechanical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans064800d"><dcterms:title>"Ever since I know myself..." : questions of self, gender, and nation in a Dominican village</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Seller, Robbyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This goal of this study is to discern the ways in which women's subjectivities have changed through the processes of decolonisation, modernization, and nation building between the 1930s and 2000 in rural Dominica. The relationship between the shifting conditions of colonial and postcolonial life in its material, political, social, and cultural aspects, and the change in the discourses that relate to proper behaviour (moral discourses) are examined. I have explored the ways in which women position themselves with relation to these discourses (which could be called moral discourses), through how they employ them in their representations, and how they negotiate them, engaging them in the creation of what could be called an 'ethics of self.' The research, carried out over a one-year period in the village of La Plaine in Eastern Dominica, involved participant observation in the village; life history interviews with women of three generations; the analysis of skits and pageants; and documentary research involving primary and secondary sources. Several discursive themes emerged in the analyses: women's use of accounts of the past to critique the present, in what I have called critical nostalgia; the change in values epitomized by the notion of respect that formed the basis of local relations and which has begun to disappear with the change in governance and economic relations; the ambivalences involved in gender relations, especially those associated with expectations of women towards men and women's autonomy from men that derive from historical circumstances of colonization and decolonization; and the celebration and discursive dissemination of values that associate femininity with the political entity that Dominica has become. Differences found between women's expressions in both the discourses they engaged with, and in the particular ways they used them to frame their experiences, were related mainly to age and socio-historical changes, but also to socio-economic background.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053j303.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064800d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Social conditions. -- Dominica</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dominica -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex role -- Dominica.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A765373347"><dcterms:title>The efficacy of psychodrama in the treatment of oppositional and defiant adolescents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Singal, Sally</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study attempted to validate psychodrama as a treatment for oppositional and defiant adolescents.

However, the precise nature of this involvement remains a matter of debate. One hypothesis suggests that disrupting amygdala function eliminates the storage of memories formed during aversive conditioning, eliminating the production of internal responses that alter the expression of observable behaviors. Alternatively, lesions or inactivation of the amygdala may impair the modulation of memories in other brain regions and disrupt the ability to perform certain observable behaviors. The experiments reported in the present thesis examined these arguments by making multiple behavioral measures during exposure to unconditioned (US) or conditioned (CS) aversive cues. Amygdala activity was inferred from changes in c-Fos protein expression or activity was temporarily suppressed with muscimol injections. The relationship between the behavioral measures and the role of the amygdala in producing them was examined. Amygdala neurons expressing the c-Fos protein tracked exposure to the US and CS but did not coincide with expression of freezing. Temporary inactivation of the amygdala with muscimol injections before presentation of the US or exposure to the CS attenuated the expression of freezing and active place avoidance; two incompatible behaviors. Finally, temporary inactivation of amygdala activity blocked freezing, place avoidance, and memory modulation produced by the same posttraining exposure to an aversive CS. Since amygdala activation alone was not sufficient to produce freezing and inactivation of the amygdala eliminated freezing, place avoidance, and memory modulation, the results cannot be interpreted as reflecting a direct role for the amygdala in production of observable behaviors. The results also preclude the idea that memory modulation is the only function of the amygdala. Rather, the results of all three studies suggest that the amygdala stores an aversive representation of the US which promotes the expression of various behaviors, possibly through the production of internal responses reflecting an aversive affective state.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945t070.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t137b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Amygdaloid body.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fear.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Classical conditioning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sj45k"><dcterms:title>Between a rock and a soft place : postmodern-regionalism in Canadian and American fiction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacLeod, Alexander</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study calls for a re-evaluation of contemporary regionalist literary theory. It argues that traditional models of the discourse have been too heavily influenced by nineteenth century realist aesthetics and political ideologies. Because most scholars continue to interpret regionalist texts according to a resolutely empirical reading of geography, literary regionalism has fallen out of touch with the new kinds of "unrealistic," generic landscapes that now dominate North American culture in the postindustrial era. Drawing heavily on recent work by postmodern geographers such as Edward Soja, David Harvey, Michael Dear and Derek Gregory, this project updates regionalist theory by "re-placing" the artificially stabilized reading of geography that dominated the nineteenth century with a more self-consciously spatialized reading of what Soja calls our contemporary "real-and-imagined" places. By grafting together traditional regionalism and postmodern spatial theory we improve on both contributing discourses. In a "postmodern-regionalist" literary criticism, traditional regionalism sheds its reputation for theoretical naivete, while the elusive abstractions of postmodern theory gain a real-world referent, and a specific geographical index. When we "read postmodernism regionally" - - when we aggressively interrogate where this kind of fiction comes from and the places it represents - - we realize that the canons of postmodern fiction in Canada and the United States have been influenced by two very different spatial epistemologies. Rather than being "determined" by their real geographies, Canadian and American postmodernism have been more directly influenced by two different readings of geography. Works by Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, and Don DeLillo demonstrate that American postmodernism often interprets social space according to what Henri Lefebvre calls the idealistic "the illusion of transparency," while texts by Canadian postmodernists such as Robert Kroetsch, Wayne Johnston and Guy Vanderhaeghe tend to fall under Lefebvre's more materialistic "illusion of opacity." The ambiguous figure of Douglas Coupland - - a Canadian writer most critics treat as an American - - puts the spatial conventions of postmodernism in both countries in sharp relief. In an American postmodernism, dominated by generic suburban settings, regions will almost always be seen as imaginary projections, while in a Canadian postmodernism, dominated by the Prairies, regions will almost always retain some sense of their material reality.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s462f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj45k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canadian fiction -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>American fiction -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Regionalism in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Postmodernism (Literature)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tt82v"><dcterms:title>Identification of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci and epidemiological typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Amiali, Mohamed Nassim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Staphylococci strains are among the most widespread multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens in Canada. Rapid and accurate identification and epidemiological typing of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and its discrimination from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA) are crucial for appropriate therapy and for monitoring and limiting intra- and inter-hospital spread of epidemic MRSA strains. Although pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction methods for the identification of MRSA are reliable, they are technically demanding, time-consuming and inappropriate for routine clinical diagnosis. Moreover, no reliable method exists for discrimination of epidemic MRSA from sporadic MRSA and from GISA strains. The objective of the research described in this thesis was to investigate whether Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy could be used to distinguish MRSA from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA), CNS, including methicillin-resistant CNS, and GISA. The application of FTIR spectroscopy for epidemiological typing of Canadian epidemic MRSA (CMRSA) strains as well as their discrimination from sporadic MRSA was also assessed. FTIR spectra were recorded from intact stationary-phase cells grown on Universal Medium (UM™) and deposited and dried on a ZnSe optical window, normalized, and converted to first-derivative spectra. Various chemometric approaches were employed to cluster the different phenotypes of staphylococci species and to subtype five CMRSA strains based on the similarity of their infrared spectral fingerprints in narrow spectral regions selected by visual inspection and by employing a singularvalue decomposition (SVD) algorithm. Pairwise separation of MRSA from MSSA, BORSA, CNS, MRCNS, and GISA was accomplished by using principal component analysis (PCA), self-organizing maps (SOM), and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. These chemometric techniques were also successfully employed for epidemiological typing of the five CMRSA strains and their discrimination from  sporadic MRSA strains using a combination of different optimal spectral regions selected by SVD. These results demonstrate that FTIR spectroscopy has considerable potential as a rapid method for the identification of different phenotypes of staphylococci and epidemiological typing of MRSA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053j31c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tt82v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methicillin resistance.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Staphylococcus aureus.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Staphylococcus.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr1720426"><dcterms:title>Modelling of transport phenomena in a delta-shaped, four-strand tundish</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kim, Hyoungbae</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A full-scale physical model of a delta-shaped, four-strand tundish was constructed at McGill University to find optimal operating conditions for the tundish. The objective of this work was to determine how best to increase steel production rates by 14% over current tundish operating conditions, these being 12 tons/min with four 15.0 mm outlet nozzles for a 500 mm depth of liquid steel while maintaining steel quality levels. Two options were suggested: the normal head option uses 16.0 mm outlet nozzles and maintains the 500 mm tundish level, while the high head option uses 14.8 mm outlet nozzles and raises the depth of liquid steel within the tundish to 800 mm. The important effects of flow control devices on the hydrodynamic performance of the tundish were also tested, using two different types of flow modifiers: Impact Pad and Turbo-Stop. For a proper comparison between the two options, three aspects were investigated; vortex formation phenomena during tundish draining between ladle changes, Residence Time Distribution (RTD), and Inclusion Separation Ratios (ISR). Inclusion removal rates were studied experimentally with the aid of the aqueous" Liquid Metal Cleanliness Analyzer (LiMCA) system. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to visualize the actual instantaneous, or momentary, flows, thereby providing the data needed for time averaged velocity fields and turbulent kinetic energies. A mathematical model based on METFLO was developed to simulate these tundish operations numerically. The Renormalization Group turbulence model (RNG) as well as the standard high Reynolds number k-s turbulence model (STD) was implemented in order to simulate the turbulent flows within the tundish. The validity of METFLO was confirmed by PIV measurements and the numerical predictions of the RTD, and RRI matched the results of physical modelling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053j32n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr1720426</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773x874"><dcterms:title>Penetration resistance of basic refractories by copper converter melts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rodríguez González, Claudia Alejandra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The need for new refractories for copper converters is addressed in this thesis. Penetration resistance is viewed as the first property that must be evaluated for the selection of new refractories since it is known that melt penetration can promote or enhance the main wear mechanisms in copper converters: dissolution, erosion and spalling. Thus, a penetration test was designed where it is possible to control the oxygen potential and the "in-situ" formation of converter melts by injecting a mixture of inert gas and oxygen according to thermodynamic calculations. Initially, the effects of oxygen potential and matte grade on three different refractories (burned magnesite chrome brick, burned spinel bonded magnesite brick and spinel direct bonded) were studied using the operating conditions of copper converters. This allowed the selection of a potential candidate, the spinel direct bonded brick. Subsequently, the effect of time, temperature and melt composition on the penetration resistance of this candidate was studied and compared with the current refractory used in copper converter, namely burned magnesitechrome brick. The reactions occurring at the refractory pill-interface, the mechanisms and kinetics of penetration and the differences in performance were determined. In addition the mechanism of dissolution and penetration of magnetite coatings applied into basic refractories were elucidated since it is considered important when proposing new solutions and alternative refractories to avoid or reduce wear in copper converters.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xb757.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773x874</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n289"><dcterms:title>High temperature oxidation of low carbon steel</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kim, Bae-Kyun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The quality of steel may be seriously affected by the surface defects that appear on slab surfaces after hot rolling. These defects are related to iron oxidation and, in order to reduce the occurrence of these defects, it is necessary to better understand the formation of iron oxides during high temperature oxidation and the oxide descaling mechanisms. However, systematic research tools and experimental strategies for addressing these issues have not yet been developed. In addition, the mechanisms of oxide cracking and failure have not been understood. In this thesis, research tools and strategies are proposed for studying the high temperature oxidation of low carbon steels. These tools allow the presentation of new data on the phase composition of iron oxides at elevated temperature, characteristics of iron oxide formation, oxide microstructure and texture, oxide defects, and stress distributions in different oxide layers, as well as residual stresses. The microscopic model that was proposed for description of oxide failure allows better understanding of the mechanism for surface defect formation during hot rolling. To describe the dynamics of phase composition changes in textured oxides at elevated temperature, a new phase analysis method is proposed. This x-ray diffraction phase analysis is based on the Rietveld and Dickson's methods, and is used for investigating the effect of alloying elements on the oxidation process. This method was also adopted to track in-situ phase composition changes during high temperature oxidation of commercial low carbon steels. The structure of oxides on low carbon steels, pure iron, and Si-steels was systematically examined by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). It is demonstrated that OIM can be an invaluable tool for visualizing the oxide microstructure texture and studies of oxide defects. In order to simulate industrial hot rolling of oxidized steel sheet, high temperature oxidations tests were made in the tube furnace up to 950°C, in air. The oxidation process and microstructure development were described using OIM maps including image quality (IQ) and inverse pole figure (IPF) maps. The three different iron oxides phases could be distinguished and the characteristics of oxides with different oxidation histories were compared. Iron oxides developed during high temperature oxidation consisted of wustite (FeO), magnetite (Fe304), and hematite (Fe20s) structures with varying texture, grain shape and size. In order to understand the mechanical properties of iron oxides, residual stresses in the three iron oxides phases were assessed using a specially designed x-ray stress measurement system. The stress distributions in the oxide layers were also simulated using finite element simulation of the hot rolling process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j761p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988n289</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Metallurgy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j3334521"><dcterms:title>Electroviscous particle-wall interactions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tabatabaei, Seyed Mahmood</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A theoretical analysis is presented to determine the forces of interaction between an electrically charged cylindrical or spherical particle and a charged plane boundary wall when the particle translates parallel to the wall and rotates around its axis in a symmetric electrolyte at rest. The electroviscous effects, arising from the coupling between the electrical and hydrodynamic equations, are determined as a solution of three partial differential equations, derived from Cox's general theory, for electroviscous ion concentration, electroviscous potential and electroviscous flow field. It is a priori assumed that the double layer thickness surrounding each charged surfaces is much smaller than the length scale of the problem. Using the matched asymptotic expansion technique, the electroviscous forces experienced by the cylinder and by the sphere are explicitly determined analytically for low and intermediate Peclet numbers, but small particle-wall distances. The solution for the sphere-wall interactions is extended to arbitrary particle-wall distances analytically for the tangential component of the force and numerically for the normal component of the force by the use of a bipolar coordinate system. The tangential and normal components of the electroviscous force experienced by the sphere-wall interactions for both arbitrary particle-wall distances and arbitrary Peclet numbers are also determined numerically by the use of the finite difference approximation in the bipolar coordinate system. It is found that the tangential force usually increases the drag above the purely hydrodynamic drag, although for certain conditions the drag can be reduced. Similarly the normal force is usually repulsive, i.e. it is an electrokinetic lift force, but under certain conditions the normal force can be attractive.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p041m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3334521</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Chemical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n204135m"><dcterms:title>Interruption and alterity : dislocating communication</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pinchevski, Amit</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This project attempts to question the way the relation between communication and ethics has traditionally been conceptualized, and to offer an alternative perspective on that relation. An implicit premise in many communication theories is that successful communication is ethically favorable, particularly in facilitating ideals such as greater understanding, participation and like-mindedness. Contrary to that view, this project proposes that ethical communication may lie in the interruption of communication, in instances wherein communication falls short, goes astray or even fails. Such interruptions, however, do not mark the end of ethical communication but rather its very beginning, for it is in such moments that communication faces the challenge of otherness. Mobilizing relevant ideas from the work of French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas to the field of communication studies, this project proposes the concept of interruption as the main correlative between ethics and communication. The investigation then sets out to explore three limit-cases in which the stakes of ethical communication are most crucial: understanding and misunderstanding, communicability and incommunicability, and silence and speech. The discussion employs a distinctive approach to study the place of alterity in communication: dislocation—a double gesture which implies both tampering with the proper activity of communicational procedures and pointing to the ethical possibilities opened up by interruptions. The issues above are addressed through critical analyses of themes such as: universal language or the undoing of Babel; the ethical significance of misunderstanding and the challenge introduced by translation; autism as a paradigmatic case of incommunicability in medical, scientific and social discourses; the epistemological status and the ethical stakes of incommunicability; and, finally, the ethical dimension of free speech, the significance of silence and the responsibility to the silent Other.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s237x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204135m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Communication -- Moral and ethical aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communication -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tp11w"><dcterms:title>Pore development in meat products during deep-fat frying</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kassama, Lamin Samboujang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The relationships between moisture loss and oil uptake and their effects on porosity, pore size distribution and pore structure during deep-fat frying of chicken breast meat were investigated.
