Thus, the national and international communities have been forced to take measures to cope with this problem, seeking to balance the needs of all interested parties. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the aircraft noise problem on the national and international levels. Each chapter highlights a distinct area of the problem. Chapter 1 covers the technical aspects of aircraft noise measurement, as well as recounts the general history, sources and effects of aircraft noise. Chapter 2 focuses specifically on the noise certification standards developed by the United States and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Chapter 3 discusses the liability issues of aircraft noise on the international level, concentrating primarily on the 1952 Rome Convention and on attempts to formulate an international instrument dealing with Liability for Damage Caused by Noise and Sonic Boom. Chapter 4 examines liability issues in the United States, defining various legal theories available. Finally, Chapter 5 articulates some methods that have helped to reduce or to mitigate the effects of aircraft noise in noise-sensitive areas.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n321w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zz574</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257g98p"><dcterms:title>The evolution of global airlines : the role of airline mergers, franchises and alliances in the re-development of international air transport regulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Racic, Milan A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Air transport is by its very nature one of the most international of economic activities. However, until fairly recently, its regulatory framework has been premised on an overriding nationalism developed and maintained on the basis of the following: substantial ownership and effective control provisions found in national legislation and most bilateral air transport agreements; restrictions on cabotage found in national legislation, most bilateral air transport agreements and Article 7 of the Chicago Convention; and the related national restrictions on the right of establishment applicable to national carriers. However, as the international component of the air transport industry has grown in importance, the tenets underlying this restrictive regulatory system are increasingly coming into question. This thesis examines the development of international airline co-operation and integration, namely by way of mergers, franchises and alliances, in the face of the existing regulatory obstacles. It examines the legal impediments to, the form of, and the costs and benefits of each of these integrative methods and their various derivatives. Finally, it traces the regulatory responses to these integrative activities, and explores the possibility and methodology of creating a truly global airline, both in form and in function.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maanappel, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m154.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257g98p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gz17h"><dcterms:title>Settlement of anti-dumping cases by price undertaking : the European Community and United States practice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Perone, Francesco.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The GATT Anti-Dumping Code provides that anti-dumping proceedings may be concluded without the imposition of duties if the exporters of the dumped product offer undertakings which the authorities of the importing country consider acceptable.

These new systems will result in less individual state control than currently exists. With multiple service providers crossing sovereign airspace boundaries, a space-based component and a greater role for pilots in selection of flight profiles, these new systems will create an increasingly complex ATS liability environment. Statutes governing and limiting the liability of state ATS providers will thus have less relevance than in the past with the withdrawal of the state as provider of ATS and its replacement by corporate service providers. Liability insurance and contractual liability limitation thus assume greater importance.

In most instances, code-sharing operations divert traffic from other carriers rather an stimulating and generating new traffic. If the parties were direct competitors prior to code sharing operations, the resulting harm on competition will undoubtedly negate the benefits which may accrue towards passengers. However, the main concerns, from the passenger's viewpoint, are that of disclosure of the operating carrier and the certainty of the applicable liability regime. Furthermore, the passenger must receive clear details of the joint product without being deprived of information concerning other available options. The growing use of international code-sharing has resulted in airlines searching for potential partners without proper evaluation of the consequences. Similarly, regulators face the daunting task of defining, articulating and enforcing a clear, consistent policy on the matter. This paper will initially examine the nature of code-sharing, its perceived benefits and thereafter discuss the prevailing regulatory regimes. Subsequently, a detailed discussion on the probable legal implications will be undertaken and finally concerns of the airlines will be addressed in order to identify essential elements which should be dealt with by the agreement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sj253.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz74k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462742j"><dcterms:title>Interactions entre le droit des sûretés sous le Code civil du Québec et la loi sur les banques</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lacroix, Marie-Hélène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to provide a precise and exhaustive study as well as an analysis of the place occupied by the banking security under Quebec Law in relation to the coming into force of the Civil Code of Quebec on January 1st 1994.

To date, this air transport has been effected through the use of an intermediate stop station in Hong Kong, in order that both States may avoid the recognition of the other as the legitimate "Chinese Government". However, Hong Kong will revert to the PRC in 1997. As a result, the issue of nonstop flights between Taiwan and the Mainland takes on an added urgency. This issue is not merely political. In terms of air carrier liability, Taiwan is party to the Warsaw Convention and the Warsaw Convention as Amended by the Hague Protocol, only through its tenuous link with Mainland China. Is the Convention applicable to Taiwan in this case? A number of arguments favoring applicability of the Convention are discussed and found to be wanting. In the alternative, the principle of conflict of laws is proposed as an applicable solution. Since Taiwan and the PRC have a civil law system while Hong Kong has a common law system, the respective legal regulations governing damage compensation in aviation cases differ. The case of liability following a hijacking is used to demonstrate how regulations of the three jurisdictions differ significantly. This leads to a serious problem, namely, "forum shopping". The fact that judicial assistance is not yet practiced between the three jurisdictions creates a further problem in that decisions coming from the different courts cannot be recognized and enforced in the other jurisdictions. In light of all of the foregoing, the existing legal systems cannot adequately address the legal problems of air carrier liability in this region. As a result of these inadequacies, an alternative mechanism for resolving the issue of air carriers' liability is suggested. This suggested pragmatic approach may also be found applicable for updating existing air transport legal systems elsewhere in the world.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw58j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b539g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cw07p"><dcterms:title>Aviation terrorism and the Warsaw convention</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jakob, J.

Par ailleurs, la mise en place de l'Accorrl Clénéral sur le Commerce des Services (GATS) comme partie intégrante de la nouvelle Organisation Mondiale du Commerce (OMC) est la manifestation au niveau des institutions de l'importance croissante des services industriels dans le commerce international.
Parmi la variété des services, les services financiers, tels que les opérations bancaires, jouent un rôle cru(..ial dans les économies nationales. Un système bancaire fonctionnel, fournissant au marché Ic:s flux nécessaires en capital est synonyme de st:lbilité, de crédibilité et de la compétitivité internationale d'une économie nationale. La libéralisation du commerce international des services financiers peut davantage améliorer l'efficacité du système économique et le bien-être du consommateur, mais aujourd'hui le commerce 1Jbéral des services financiers est encore confronté à diverses barrières, en particulier dans le domaine particulièrement sen5lble qu'est celui du système bancaire. Les barrières naturelles au commerce transfrontalier des services bancaires ont été surmontées par l'accroissement de la capacité des services à être commercialisés, ceci grâce aux nouvellestechnologies dans le domaine de l'information et de la communication. Le GATS est synonyme d'une approche multilatérale dans le but de dépasser les barrières niglementaires au commerce international des services. L'ouverture mondiale cies marchés bancaires nationaux aux banques étrangères, à savoir la mise en place d'l,;n droit d'établissement est le point central de la libéralisation en ce qui concerne le secteur bancaire. A part les défauts structurels évidents du GATS, cette approche multilatérale pour la libéralisation est de plus en plus concurrencée par les approches régionales, à savoir les zones de libre échange et les unions douanières. De plus, dans le secteur bancaire, en réaction au nombre très important de faillites et il la crise des économies nationales, en 1995 la libéralisation elle-même est concurrencée par une tendance globale de plutôt reréglementer et d'harmoniser les règlements existants plutôt que de les libéraliser davantage.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>In 1986, the inclusion of trade in services, including financial services, into the multilateral GATT Uruguay Round on trade liberalization stood for the official worldwide recognition of services as being internationally tradable and important for national economies. The establishment of a General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), as being an integral part of the new World Trade Organization (WTO), is the institutional manifestation of the increasing importance of the service industries in international trade. Within a variety of services, the financial services, such as banking, play a crucial role in national economies. A functioning banking system, providing the domestic industry with the necessary flow of capital, equals stability, credibility and international competitiveness for a national economy. Liberalization of international trade in financial services may further increase economic efficiency and the welfare of the consumer, but today liberal trade in financial services is still faced with various barriers, especially in the highly sensitive banking system. Natural barriers to cross-border trade in banking services were overcome by the increased tradability of services through new information and communication technologies. The GATS stands for the multilateral approach to overcoming the regulatory barriers to international trade in services. The worldwide opening of domestic banking markets to foreign banks, namely the provision of the right of establishment, is the main topic of liberalization with respect to the banking sector. Aside from obvious structural shortcomings of the GATS, this multilateral liberalization approach is increasingly challenged by regional approaches. namely free-trade areas and customs unions. Furthermore, in the banking sector, as a reaction to the huge amount of bank failures and national economic crises, liberalization itself is challenged by a global tendency rather to re-regulate and to harmonize existing regulations than to further liberalize.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mestral, A.

These preliminary considerations will show the topicality of those legal aspects as to hospital ethics committees. The author will then focus on the potential civil liability of all actors evolving within the hospital setting for the participation of those committees in the medical decision making process. In theory, this participation could arguably entail rather easily the liability of the health care providers and of the hospitals. The ethics committees, on the contrary, seem to be more protected. This thesis suggests nonetheless that the obligations related to the participation of the ethics committees to the medical decision making process are significant. Hence, it stands to reason that the creation of ethics committees should be evaluated with care.

The present thesis analyzes the new trust and situates it within a broader perspective through comparisons with the Common law trust and an examination of the alternative approaches to fiduciary institutions in Civil law jurisdictions. The notion of patrimony by appropriation implies that the corpus of the Quebec trust constitutes ownerless property. Despite its novelty, we find that the concept is compatible with the civilian theories of droit subjectif and patrimony, as well as with the other parts of the new Code. The Quebec solution is also able to emulate most of the Common law trust's functional advantages, namely its versatility and flexibility, efficient management and protection of the beneficial enjoyment. Close attention is given to the intricate analysis of the beneficiary's legal position. The examination of alternatives to the Quebec approach reveals that several theoratical constructions may be complemented by specific provisions furnishing the necessary functional advantages. It is precisely these accompanying features which will largely determine the success of a general fiduciary institution adopted in Civil law countries. Since the new Quebec trust is endowed with both a satisfactory conceptual framework and an advantageous juridical regime, it should be considered as an interesting model by jurisdictions attempting to introduce a modern trust-like device.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bruerley, J.

Modulation of the H-reflex recruitment ratio was measured. Ten normal subjects and five patients who had suffered an acute vestibular lesion were tested. Since this rotation involved otolith and neck inputs, a control experiment assessed the contribution of neck inputs separately. Neither otolith and neck inputs combined nor neck inputs alone had a demonstrable effect on alpha motorneuron pool excitability. These observations contradict results in the literature.

These methods allow flow analysis information to be extracted directly from a high-level representation of the source programs, even in parallel. To achieve this goal, we develop and utilize the Extended Abstract Syntax Tree (EAST), and the Symbol Table Data Relational Tree (STDRT) representations, to perform our flow analysis based on these structures. By these approaches, the compiler is able to keep the most useful information and apply this information during various optimization stages. We also introduce several scheduling algorithms for parallelizing the flow analysis phase. An experimental compiler and its results support the usefulness of these methods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35696394.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t126t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h1603"><dcterms:title>Converting graphic musical data to a machine playable form</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wilk, Randy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper describes a method for converting the output musical data files from an optical music recognition (OMR) system to a machine playable MIDI format. In this method, the data from the music recognition system is parsed a number of times to convert the graphic data to discrete musical events. On the first pass, information about the staves is extracted. The second pass organizes the musical symbols into a musically meaningful sequence and assigns them to one of the staves. The third pass uses the cartesian location of the symbols and their proximities to one and other to determine initial pitches and durations. The fourth pass treats rhythmic symbols and modifies durations. The data is then formatted according to the MIDI standard and output to a machine playable standard MIDI file. Good preliminary results have been obtained from a small set of OMR examples. This paper also presents a possible schema for including graphic musical data in a standard MIDI file through the creation of a new MIDI chunk type.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pennycook, B.

Previous research has shown that both of these plants respond well to endomycorrhizae with a resulting improvement in plant growth and yield. Although many studies have been conducted on endomycorrhizal inoculation of transplants most were looking at the end result, i.e. yields, and did not focus on changes occurring at the transplant stage. This series of experiments was conducted to look at the effect of inoculation at the transplant stage. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Parris Island Cos) and pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. Hybrid Bell Boy) were inoculated with Glomus intraradix Schenck &amp; Smith and Glomus versiforme (Karst.) Berch. Experiments involved testing the effect of different growing media, different container volumes and different light sources on the growth of endomycorrhizal lettuce and pepper transplants. In all experiments the amount of growth enhancement due to endomycorrhizal inoculation was low or negligible. Colonization rates were generally low, probably due to low light levels. Transplants grown in larger volume containers were generally larger than those grown in smaller containers. The transplants grown in the soil and compost based media were larger than those transplants grown in the artificial media. Growth of lettuce and pepper transplants was affected differently depending on the light source used. Some interactions between the light source and the endomycorrhizal treatments was observed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, K. A.

Interactions between the ocean and the overlying atmosphere, as well as oceanic processes, are investigated in order to explain the variability in the SST associated with the two converging western boundary currents in this region: the Brazil and the Malvinas Currents. The pattern of interannual variability of SST displays a dipole-like structure in the vicinity of the confluence of the two currents. That is, the SST fluctuations in both currents are roughly out-of-phase: warm episodes in one current accompany cold episodes in the other. It is suggested that the variability in the oceanic advection of the currents accounts for part of the observed variability in SST in the confluence region, the dipole pattern being associated with the strength of the temperature gradient in the confluence. The pattern of variability of the air-sea heat exchange associated with the observed SST fluctuations displays a distribution of ocean-to-atmosphere flux anomalies roughly out-of-phase with those of SST. It is concluded that the SST fluctuations associated with the Brazil and Malvinas Currents are related to the variability in both the air-sea heat exchange and the oceanic advection of the currents. The warm and cold events observed in the currents are associated with distinct atmospheric circulation patterns. Thus, it is suggested that changes in the atmospheric circulation on interannual timescales induce anomalies in the air-sea heat exchange, which have been found to be partly responsible for the variability in SST of the Brazil and Malvinas Currents.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mysak, Lawrence (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Straub, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r760b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m1525</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical Oceanography.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vn00r"><dcterms:title>Utilization of magnified visual feedback in the maintenance of finger position</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vasilakos, Konstantinon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigates the interaction between increased gain in the visual feedback loop and motor control of the periphery. Subjects were asked to maintain a constant finger position while utilizing magnified visual feedback. The accuracy of each trial was quantified by taking the standard deviation (trial-error) of the finger position. Trials performed under magnification have lower trial-errors than trials without magnification. The change in trial-error between trials with and without magnification proves greater than the difference between trials at any two magnifications. In contrast, the differences between individual subjects is often greater than the difference between performances at individual magnifications. At higher magnifications performance seems to be limited by the tremor. Trial-error is approximately 2 times the tremor-intensity. When applied to microsurgery these results are in accord with earlier research including results suggesting that the level of magnification used in microsurgery is not the most significant factor in achieving good results, and that tremor is the limiting factor in microsurgical tasks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glass, Leon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10ws35f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vn00r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht761"><dcterms:title>Anthropometry and diet of Mohawk schoolchildren in Kahnawake</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Trifonopoulos, Mary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Anthropometry, dietary intakes and food preferences of Mohawk children in Kahnawake were studied.

Our premise is that a recognized and fully documented direct access storage technique called Multidimensional Paging or Multipaging would provide a well balanced storing structure for this category of data. Since multipaging uses a multidimensional perspective on the information to allocate it to pages in secondary storage then spatial data, which is fundamentally multidimensional by nature, would surely offer a suitable profile. First, we attempt to evaluate the efficiency of multipaging on static files and to suggest possible modifications to the standard algorithm to better serve spatial data. Our solution to this problem consists in compressing the pages that overflow. Because geographical information is often a representation of occurences of Nature, we hypothesize that Fractal Geometry, which serves to formalize a mathematical description of such elements, could provide the theoretical background to derive an efficient fractal-based compression algorithm. An appreciable improvement is obtained by compressing the pages of the multipaged administrative regions data that exceed their capacity: $ alpha=0.7272$ and $ pi=1.0$. The outcome of these experiments led us to elaborate a mixed system based on two relatively different approaches: multipaging and fractal-based data compression. The first part consisted in the implementation of the standard static multipaging algorithm using a relational database management system named Relix. The other approach was developed using the C programming language to accommodate some particularities of the multipaged spatial data. The preliminary results were encouraging and allowed us to establish the parameters for a more formal implementation. Also, it brought out the limits of the compression method in view of the intended usage of the data. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T. H.

Ithaca. A single spore isolate of B. lactucae was produced and was identified using lettuce differential lines each of which had known gene for resistance. Potted lettuce plants were inoculated with the isolate and incubated at 15 C, at 100% relative humidity for 24 h and then at a relative humidity lower than 70%. Seven days later, the plants were submitted to five different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 C) and six durations of leaf wetness (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 h). The number of spores produced was determined at the end of each wet period. After 4 h of incubation no spores were observed at any of the temperatures. Highest number of spores was found at 10 and 15 C for more than 10 h of DLW. The rate of sporulation rapidly increased between 8 and 10 h for all the temperatures, including 25 C, where the amount of spores produced was very low. The observed number of spores was transformed into proportion of maximum sporulation (PMS) by providing each data by the maximum number of spores observed for each experiment. The Richards model was used to describe sporulation as a function of leaf wetness duration and the rate and maximum value expressed as a function of temperature. This approach resulted in a three-dimensional equation that explained 87% of the variation in the PMS. Spore viability was also estimated for each temperature and DLW. It was zero after 6 h of incubation and reached almost the maximum after 10 h for all the temperatures. The sporulation model was validated under field conditions and it predicted high, medium, low, or no sporulation in 8 out of 11 times.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kushalappa, A.
