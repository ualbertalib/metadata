Plants were cut at 5 different stages of maturity, and the degree of lignification determined for each stage by methods of plant histology. These individual stages were then fed to sheep and feces examined for undigested lignified elements. Lignification is initiated in the xylem, very early in the life of the plant; bundle cap cells and parenchyma tissue adjacent to the vascular strands are characteristically differentiated into elements of varying lignin content with progressive maturity. Fecal excretions on plant residues for each of the 5 cuttings proved that comminution, and henceforth digestibility of plant tissues, is directly influenced by stage of maturity and degree of lignification of the plants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raymond, L.

The method of evaluating pressure drop for turbulent non-isothermal runs by assuming that these runs occur isothermally at a temperature mid-way between the surface temperature and the mean bulk temperature of the fluid, first developed by McAdams for certain oils, is also tested for a number of selected runs.

The loss, to the Japanese, of the principal source of natural rubber created an urgent need for four carbon compounds to be used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber. It was suggested at that time that if diol could be produced in substantial volume it could be used as an intermediate in the production of butadiene. The first investigation was undertaken by the Northern Regional Research Laboratories, United States Department of Agriculture, in 1942, to study the production of diol by the fermentation of corn or wheat mashes. [...] This thesis is divided in two parts. The first work reported in Part I involved certain preliminary experiments with Aerobaclllus polymyxa and Aerobacter aerogenes. An effort was made to confirm a previous report (1) that a cellulose decomposing organism, designated N4, produced diol when grown on a wheat mash. Later, a search for diol producing organisms was conducted among starch and cellulose decomposing bacteria isolated from the soil by Alarie (2). One of these was found to yield a butanol soluble substance which was determined as diol by the method of Johnson (3). In Part II, extensive work on the fermentation of carbohydrates by this organism is reported.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

Furthermore, increasing the dose of 1-thyroxine in the thyroxine treated group, resulted in a reversaI of the progressive tumor growth potential with regression and complete extinction of a significant number of the established mammary tumors in this group. Histologically, tumors of the thyroidectomized and control groups were identical, while a characteristic morphologic variant was seen only in the mammary tumors of the 1-thyroxine treated group. Since the effect was not universally seen throughout the sections examined in any single tumor nodule, it is postulated that tumors are composed of heterogeneous cell populations, one of which is endocrine-dependent or sensitive to the effects of 1-thyroxine administration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shragovitch, I.

An investigation was initiated into the metabolism of glucose, a nutritional source of energy, in order to determine the cause of the energy loss. The maximal operation of the electron transport mechanism was found to be limited by the poor availability of both a hydrogen donor and cytochrome c. Mongrel dogs were subjected to hemorrhagic shock. Slices and homogenates of mucosa were incubated in the presence of radioactive glucose (C-1, C-6, or uniformly labelled). The QO2 of the slices and homogenates was found to be depressed after shock. Carbon dioxide production by the control mucosa occurred predominantly via the pentose cycle. There was only a slight increase in the activities of the pentose cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle after shock. There was an increased lactate production after shock, not all of which could be accounted for in terms of glucose. Thus, although there are significant changes in carbohydrate metabolism, they are not as great as those seen in previous studies on ATP synthesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McArdle, H.

Contractions of the isolated whole bladder were recorded on a smoked drum. Decentralization produced an approximately three-fold increase in sensitivity to acetylcholine. Denervation did not change the sensitivity to acetylcholine. McN-A-343, a muscarinic agent was significantly less effective after decentralization and ineffective after denervation. Neither procedure changed the sensitivity to potassium. Atropine antagonized low but not high doses of acetylcholine. This antagonism was less marked on the decentralized than on the control bladder. The lack of supersensitivity after denervation is consistent with the "dual action" hypothesis for acetylcholine suggested by Koelle (1961). McN-A-343 seems to act indirectly in this preparation. Histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and andrenaline had little or no effect on the bladder and could not be used to demonstrate an expected supersensitivity after denervation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eade, N.

Gilpinia hercyniae was first discovered in America in the fall of 1930 in the Gaspe Peninsula. How long it had been active in this country has not been determined, but at that time it had already severely defoliated spruce over some 2,500 square miles in the interior of the Gaspe Peninsula. The spruce sawfiy is presumed to have been introduced at least several decades ago (6). Like many organisms introduced without their native enemies, it increased rapidly in population and by 1939 had spread eastward throughout the Maritime Provinces, westward through the Province of Quebec into eastern Ontario. By this time it was also present in the New England States, as far south as Connecticut and west as New York. In 1941 the first sample of the species was received from Newroundland( 6). The peak of the infestation was reached about 1938 when an estimated 12,000 square miles were heavily infested (9). Tallies in 1942 in the Gaspe peninsula showed about 75% by volume of the white spruce dead, and about 45% of the black (8). The decline ot the outbreak coincided with the appearance of diseased larvae. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.

Results showed no significant arterial hypoxemia or "shunting" in the two forms of experimental shock periodically hyperinflated - (i) hemorrhagic, and (ii) superior mesenteric artery clamping; morbidity and mortality were lower in the hemorrhagic shock hyperinflated than in the hemorrhagic shock not hyperinflated. Sham control groups showed pathological lesions similar to shocked groups.

The experiments directed attention to the ducts ability to resist toxic substances, such as those that may be present in a diseased pancreatico-biliary system. Experiments were conducted on eighty nine healthy cats, which were standardised nutritionally. The experiments showed that these so-called toxic agents, under the conditions reported in this thesis, caused no permanent ill-effect, but that incubated infected bile proved to have potent mucolytic and cytotoxic effect. AIso, it became clear that mechanical factors, such as quantity of infusate, pressure, etc. were able to alter the results and it is possible that this variation may effect already reported experimental findings. Finally, it was concluded that a low grade infection in the biliary tree can in a patho physiological system, initiate pancreatic inflammatory disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, A.

Others (147, 148, 149) have worked on the catalytic hydrogenation of pyrogallol and gallic acid (XLV) and have successfully isolated some of the stereoisomers of the cyclohexane analogs of these aromatic compounds. the object of the present work is to study the chemical reduction of gallic acid (XLV) and trimethyl gallic acid (XLVI) by means of sodium and isoamyl alcohol. Complex polyhydric phenols are more or less readily available from the lignin portion of hard or soft wood or from bark. In Canada, where large quantities of lignin and bark are available as waste products from the forest industries, the production of useful chemicals from these materials might become of considerable economic importance. The study of the chemistry of the simpler polyhydric phenols might, therefore, open up important ways in which lignin and bark could be utilized.[...] It was one of the aims of this research, to determine under what conditions the reduction of the benzene ring of trimethyl gallic acid, (XLVI), could be accomplished while keeping hydrogenolysis of the bond between the ring carbon and the ether (or hydroxyl) oxygen at a minimum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

The results obtained indicate that there is no significant difference between the mean plasma levels of estrone and estradiol in the two groups. The plasma estriol, however, is considerably higher in the breast cancer patients. This elevated estriol suggests an increased activity in estrogen metabolism. An attempt was made to determine the site of this increased activity in three patients with breast cancer by measuring the estrogen level in the peripheral plasma and in mammary vein plasma obtained during mastectomy. Comparison of the values obtained for each patient suggests that the mammary tumor is not the site of increased metabolic activity. When the mean plasma estrogen levels of breast cancer patients were compared to those found in patients with metastatic cancer (Table X1), no significant difference was found between the two groups. The foregoing work indicates that it is not justifiable to conclude that the metabolic disorder of estrogens noted in patients with breast cancer is peculiar to this specific disease until sufficient knowledge exists regarding estrogen metabolism in other diseases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Browne, J.

Subjects exercised upright on a bicycle ergometer. HR was measured by ECG chest electrodes, Qc by the N20 method, V02 by collection of mixed expired air and V by a dry gas meter. Results were; 1. work capacity increased by 10% or more in the hockeyists, but maximal HR, Qc, V02 and V were not increased, 2. these parameters were remarkably constant among all athlete groups in the trained state, except that skiers had a higher V02 which may be a prerequisite for excellence at this sport rather than a training effect. Findings at submaximal work loads provided an explanation for the increased work capacity following seasonal training. Thus, a decreased HR, Qc and V at any given submaximal work load characterized the trained state. Since work after training causes less stress on cardio-respiratory function than it did before training, a higher maximal work capacity is possible with no increase in maximal cardiorespiratory dimensions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milic-Emili, J.

These methods depended on the fact that the p-toluene sulfonyl (tosyl) esters of primary, as opposed to secondary, alcohols gave quantitative yields of alkyl iodide when treated with sodium iodide in a ketone solvent.

Lipoprotein metabolism in the rat was studied by use of labelled precursors in the form of palmitate and leucine. Lipid of the very low density lipoprotein turned over at a faster rate than that of the other lipoprotein fractions. The protein moiety was found to be removed from the plasma at a rate comparable to that of lipid. Studies with puromycin treated and hepatectomised rats demonstrated the dependence of lipid release upon continuous protein synthesis at the site of lipoprotein formation in the liver. These results are discussed in relation to the current carrier theory of lipid transport.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.

For example, catechol and guaiacol have been obtained by zinc dust distillation (1), protocatechuic and veratric acids by alkali fusion (2, 3, 4) and vanillin and syringaldehyde by nitrobenzene oxidation (5, 6) of lignins. Accordingly, pyrogallol and, later, vanillin were chosen as simple analogs of the phenolic substances which are normally bleached. Since hypoiodite is a milder oxidizing and halogenating agent than hypochlorite, it was felt that a preliminary investigation of the action of alkaline iodine on these phenols would be more likely to yield positive results, which might be correlated later with those obtained in parallel experiments using chlorine. Extensive rate studies have revealed that the action of these hypohalites on pyrogallol and vanillin is greatly dependent on the hydroxyl ion concentration of the system and can be divided in all cases into two phases, an initial “fast”, followed by a “slow” reaction. A number of products have been isolated from these reactions at various pH levels, and some light was thrown on the nature of the reactions, whether one of oxidation or of halogenation, in the particular cases studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.
