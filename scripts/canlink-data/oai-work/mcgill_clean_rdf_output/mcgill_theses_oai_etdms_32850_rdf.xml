It has been found that these nonionic copolymers can form 2D surface micelles as has been found for ionic diblocks such as polystyrene-b-poly(vinyl pyridinium iodide) diblocks. This suggests that formation of surface micelles is a general phenomenon among AB diblock copolymers. Both structural parameters (aggregation number, aggregate size distribution, corona length and thickness, morphologies, boundaries etc.) and the response to conditions (temperature of the subphase, surface tension of the subphase, hysteresis, compression rates, etc.) have been explored for the monolayers formed from these materials. Many of these diblocks exhibit plateaus or inflections in their isotherms. Experimental data allow for the calculation of the thermodynamic parameters $ rm ( Delta S sb{t}$ and $ rm Delta H sb{t})$ associated with the transitions. Differences between the $ rm Delta S sb{t}$ and $ rm Delta H sb{t}$ values observed with the nonionic diblocks in question and the ionic diblocks studied before suggests that the nonionic diblocks monolayers have unique properties. Different mechanisms of the transitions(s) are proposed for samples which have one transition plateau or inflection and samples which have multiple transitions or inflections. A scaling theory-based calculation of the corona length and $ pi$-A isotherm are reasonably consistent with experimental data and thus provides a useful tool in these studies. Selected properties (i.e. subphase surface tension, waiting time etc.) for several ionic diblocks were also studied. Finally, the minimum chain lengths for circular micelles were calculated using a scaling theory methodology.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lennox, R.

It was found that PTHRP gene expression was increased in cultured rat H-500 Leydig tumor cells by serum and growth factors; in contrast, gene expression was decreased by glucocorticoids, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and androgens. These effects on PTHRP were mostly accounted for by an alteration of gene transcription. The biosynthesis and processing of PTHRP were assessed by transfection of PTHRP cDNA into COS-7 cells, a cell line which does not endogenously produce PTHRP and which lacks the major prohormone convertases except furin. Analysis of the molecular forms of PTHRP after transfection revealed that the main species generated was an amino-terminal fragment PTHRP (1-36). Antisense furin cotransfection with PTHRP into COS-7 cells resulted in the production of bioinactive pro-PTHRP. Antisense furin cDNA was also introduced into H-500 cells by transfection. As a result, pro-PTHRP processing was blocked and bioinactive pro-PTHRP was also produced in these cells. In addition, these H-500 cells now exhibited a reduced growth rate in vitro. When these tumor cells were inoculated into Fisher rats, tumor growth in vivo was very much attenuated and the animals did not develop the syndrome of hypercalcemia which occurred in control animals; moreover, the animals displayed an extended survival time. These results indicate that furin is a processing enzyme for the conversion of pro-PTHRP to mature PTHRP and PTHRP not only induces hypercalcemia when it is over produced but also may promote tumor progression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rabbani, Shafaat A.

For example, in brain synaptosomes, only EP$ sb3$ subtype was present in the newborn, and both EP$ sb2$ and EP$ sb3$ subtypes existed in the adult; EP$ sb1$ subtype was not found in the brain synaptosomes. In contrast, in brain microvessels, more than 80% of EP receptors were of EP$ sb1$ subtype with small amount of EP$ sb3$ subtype. No EP$ sb2$ subtype was detected in the brain microvessels. In order to determine whether high levels of prostaglandin in the newborn downregulate EP and FP receptors, newborn pigs were treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, ibuprofen or indomethacin. The inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the newborn pigs significantly increased EP and FP receptor densities as well as receptor-coupled IP$ sb3$ and cAMP production in brain synaptosomes and microvessels of the newborn to levels found in the adult; this effect could be prevented by co-treatment of membranes with stable PG analogs. Vasoconstrictor effects of PGE$ sb2$ and PGF$ sb{2 alpha}$ on cerebral microvessels of the newborn were also increased. These findings suggest that the relatively low EP and FP receptor densities in the newborn brain are caused by the high levels of prostaglandins and that these receptors and their functions can be upregulated by reducing prostagladin levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chemtob, Sylvain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Varma, Daya R.

The key idea is that one should only retain those axioms and theorems concerning the most recent state estimate of the controlled machine. This information is sufficient to evaluate the truth of conditional control formulas which only depend upon the current state estimate of the controlled machine. As a result, a Markovian fragment system is demonstrated to have virtually the same control power as a full COCOLOG system. Further, it is shown that a Markovian fragmented system has a complexity of logical deduction which is time-dependent while a full COCOLOG system has a complexity which increases monotonically with time. In order to formulate the analysis and synthesis of hierarchical systems, a hierarchical structure based upon the notion of dynamical consistency is presented. The underlying motivation for this notion is that high level dynamics should be consistent with low level dynamics. The major part of this investigation is carried out for the so-called in-block controllable partition lattices, which are the lattices of partitions for which each block element constitutes a controllable submachine. We show that most controllable finite state machines have at least one non-trivial in-block controllable partition machine. It is also shown that, subject to in-block controllability, the resulting partition machines are controllable if and only if the base machines are controllable. A consequence of this construction is that a state-to-state reachability problem can be decomposed into reachability problems at different levels of abstraction. In terms of this theory, a hierarchical control system is a set of control systems associated with a chain from the top element to the bottom element of the in-block controllable partition lattice of a controlled machine. As an extension of regular COCOLOG, we give the HICOLOG formulation of hierarchical logic control. The basic contribution is the construction of a system wherein a high level logic controller makes its control decisions with respect to the information available to it and communicates its commands as control objectives to the associated low level logic control systems; this is continued down the chain of systems in a given hierarchical lattice. Information flows up the hierarchy in the form of abstract statements concerning the system state. The notion of dynamical consistency is extended to hybrid systems so as to define the set of dynamically consistent hybrid partition machines associated with a continuous system ${ cal S}$. It is shown that it is possible to define an in-block controllable hybrid partition lattice for ${ cal S}$ and this permits the hybrid control of a continuous system ${ cal S}$ to be formulated within a lattice theoretic hierarchical control theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Caines, Peter E.

Autoantibodies to these antigens are detected frequently in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and involved in the pathogenesis of lupus skin lesions. Although the mechanisms responsible for the induction of these autoantibodies and immunologic tissue damage are unclear, one possibility is that Ro autoantigens are expressed on the cell surface and induce an immune response. Cell surface expression of Ro antigens has been reported previously following ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation or estrogen stimulation of human keratinocytes. In this thesis, the effect of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the surface expression of Ro antigens and calreticulin on human fibroblasts and keratinocytes was investigated using a fixed cell enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, flow cytometry (FACS) analysis and immunoblotting. CMV infection of cultured human fibroblast cells was found to increase the cell surface expression of calreticulin, but not 60kD/Ro antigen. However, CMV infection, in combination with UVB irradiation, synergistically induced the expression of 52kD/Ro antigen, but not 60kD/Ro or calreticulin, on the surface of these cells. This enhanced expression of 52kD/Ro autoantigen on CMV and UVB treated cells was significant and specific, compared with untreated cells, cells infected with CMV or irradiated with UVB only, and cells subjected to other treatments including low pH. These studies were then extended to human keratinocytes, which are relevant to the skin disease associated with the presence of anti-Ro antibodies in SLE. Human CMV was demonstrated to be capable of infecting keratinocytes in vitro and induced the surface expression of 60kD/Ro antigen, but not 52kD/Ro and calreticulin, on human keratinocytes. As there was no increase in total cellular expression of 60kD/Ro antigen after viral infection, 60kD/Ro antigen appears to be redistributed from the</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shuster, Joseph (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dh36j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v708v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278v810"><dcterms:title>Some catalytic and stoichiometric reactions of titanocene and chiral ansa-titanocene derivatives with silanes and siloxanes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Xin, Shixuan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several types of catalytic and stoichiometric reactions of titanocenes and chiral ansa-titanocenes were studied. Dimethyltitanocene (DMT) and rac- (EBTHI) TiMe$ sb2$ (EBTHI = ethylene-1,2-bis (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)) are effective catalyst precursors for hydrosilation of a variety of ketones when using in conjunction with secondary silanes. A catalyst generated by in situ reaction of enantiomerically pure S- (EBTHI) TiX$ sb2$ (X = Cl, 1/2(S-1,1$ sp prime$-binaphthyl-2,2$ sp prime$-diolate)) with MeLi catalyzes hydrosilation of dialkyl ketones to give, after hydrolysis, the enantioenriched secondary alcohols in up to 70% ee. This result compares favorably with the best chiral-phosphine/Rh catalysts for asymmetric hydrosilation of dialkyl ketones. DMT and rac-(EBTHI) TiMe$ sb2$ are also very active catalyst precursors for cross dehydrocoupling/co-intramolecular hydrosilation of allylic and homoallylic alcohols with secondary silanes. This is the first time such reactions catalyzed by group 4 metallocenes have been reported. Photochemical stoichiometric reactions of DMT and rac-(EBTHI) TiMe$ sb2$ with hydrosiloxanes in the presence of pyridine produce two novel Ti(III)-pyridine complexes Cp$ sb2$Ti(Me)(Py) and rac-(EBTHI) Ti(Me)(Py). Their structures were characterized by X-ray crystallography and EPR spectroscopy. Stoichiometric reaction of rac-(EBTHI) TiMe$ sb2$ with phenylmethylsilane gives a Ti(III) hydride dimer, rac-((EBTHI)Ti($ mu$-H)) $ sb2$, which is the first structurally characterized Ti(III) hydride dimer without a bridging organic ligand. EPR spectroscopic study revealed that the dimer exists in equilibrium with its monomer in solution. Reaction of this hydride dimer in the presence of excess phenylphosphine produces a Ti(IV) diphosphanediyl complex, rac-(EBTHI) Ti(PPh)$ sb2$, in quantitative yield. The structure of rac-(EBTHI) Ti(PPh)$ sb2$ was also characterized by X-ray crystallography.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harrod, John F.

The sea-ice anomalies in Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea are found to be related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Southern Oscillation (SO). From the application of a spatial Student's t-test and a Monte Carlo simulation, we found that sea ice responds significantly to the SO event only in summer, and to the NAO event only in winter. A spectral analysis shows that sea-ice cover in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea responds to the SO and SAT fluctuations at about 1.7 year, 3-5 year and about 8-10 year periods. In addition, a sea-ice signature associated with the so-called "climate jump" during the early 1960s was found. The ice thickness and ice-melt date data are also used to verify the above findings. In part 2, the three-dimensional ocean general circulation model of Blumberg and Mellor (1983, 87) was used to simulate the winter and summer ocean circulation in Hudson Bay under specified atmospheric forcing and runoff. This model uses vertical sigma coordinates and horizontal orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. The vertical viscosity and diffusivity are computed using the Mellor-Yamada (1982) second-order (2.5) turbulence closure, while the values for similar horizontal parameters are calculated using the Smagorinsky (1963) parameterization. The new version of this model uses the semi-implicit scheme for the shallow water equations (Casulli, 1990). A consistent, modified radiation boundary condition has been developed for the surface elevation and the normal barotropic velocity for the universal multi-level, baroclinic model with strong vertical stratification. The surface cyclonic circulation in summer and winter, due in part to the boundary inflow from Roes Welcome Sound to the northwest of the domain, has been well simulated. In part 3, a dynamic thermodynamic model of sea ice with viscous-plastic rheology (Hibler, 1979; 1980) is used to simulate the seasonal cycle of sea-ice motion, thickness, compactness, and growth rate in Hudson Bay under monthly climatological atmospheric forcing. The simulated results for ice cover in other seasons also compare favourably with the observed climatology and with measurements from satellites. In particular, the model gives complete sea-ice cover in winter and ice-free conditions in late summer. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mysak, L. A.

The findings result in distinctly different past histories and present patterns of homosexual behaviours among the two serostatus subpopulations. Low internal expectancy of control over health repeatedly relates in distinctive patterns with the areas of level of happiness, condom usage, and hish-risk sexual behaviours. High internal expectancy of control relates significantly to knowledge-related variables. The physician plays a pivotal role as the source of useful information in this at-risk population. The study population as a whole reports accurate knowledge about HIV and AIDS. The men have reduced high-risk behaviours, increased safer sexual behaviours, and implemented the changes advocated.

The emotional reactivity of subjects differing in weight and restraint was also examined. Forty female and 40 male subjects were classified as high, moderate, or low on Body Mass Index (BMI), and as high, moderate, or low on each of the factors of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ; Stunkard &amp; Messick, 1985). Mood was manipulated by exposing all subjects to a challenging cognitive task, which had been made insoluble for half the subjects. All subjects were then asked to taste and rate a variety of cookies. Mood was evaluated using self-report measures and by monitoring changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance. Distressed male subjects with high scores on two TFEQ subscales were found to eat significantly more than their non-distressed counterparts. Female subjects with high scores on the third TFEQ subscale were shown to eat less when distressed. Weight was found not to have a significant effect on the amount consumed by male or female subjects. There was some evidence to suggest that females with high scores on two TFEQ subscales are more emotionally reactive than those scoring lower. The evidence for increased reactivity in restrained males was weaker. There were no differences in reactivity as a function of BMI. Differences in emotional reactivity could not account for observed differences in eating among groups varying in restraint. The results suggest that, as has been found for female subjects in other studies, restrained males are also susceptible to the breakdown of control that leads to overeating in the face of distress. They should be included in future examinations of restraint.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ditto, Blaine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc476.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw20c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Self-control.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stress (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Appetite.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Obesity -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f4627108"><dcterms:title>Molecular analysis of polima cytoplasmic male sterility in Brassica napus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Singh, Mahipal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To identify region(s) of the mitochondrial genome that might be involved in specifying the "Polima" (pol) cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) of Brassica napus, transcripts corresponding to 14 mitochondrial genes and DNA clones representing $&gt;$90% of the mitochondrial genome of Brassica campestris were analyzed in nap (male fertile), pol (male sterile) and nuclear fertility-restored pol cytoplasm plants. CMS-correlated transcriptional differences among these plants were detected only with the ATPase subunit 6 (atp6) gene. Sequence analysis of the atp6 gene regions of pol and nap mitochondrial DNAs show that rearrangements in the pol mitochondrial genome upstream of atp6 have generated a chimeric 224-codon open reading frame, designated orfJ224, that is cotranscribed with atp6. In male sterile plants, most transcripts of this region are dicistronic, comprising both orf224 and atp6 sequences. In fertility restored-plants, genes at either of two distinct nuclear restorer loci specifically alter this transcript pattern, resulting in predominantly monocistronic atp6 transcripts. The effect of the restorer locus on orf224/atp6 transcripts does not seem to be tissue or developmental stage specific. orf224 comprises a portion of the mitochondrial gene, orfB, fused to sequence of unknown origin. The pol mitochondrial genome contains an apparently functional copy of orfB. The expression of the atp6 region is developmentally regulated in pol plants such that levels of monocistronic atp6 transcripts are increased in seedlings as compared to the floral tissue. Preliminary data indicate that the chimeric gene, orf224, is expressed at the protein level in pol plants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brown, Gregory G.

The contribution of chlorine containing gas bubbles, of intermediate reaction products generated by the chlorination process, as well as evaporation through the melt surface, to the removal of calcium and/or sodium has been documented quantitatively. Experimental parameters investigated were chlorine concentration in the gas bubbles and gas flow rate. The measurement of frequency of bubble formation at the tip of the gas bubbling nozzle enabled the surface areas of the bubbles to be estimated which in turn enabled melt phase mass transfer coefficients for the bubbles to be calculated. It was demonstrated that the removal of calcium and sodium followed first order reaction kinetics with respect to calcium and sodium concentrations. The removal of the above mentioned elements was represented well by a kinetic model in which mass transfer of sodium and calcium in melt phase was rate limiting. In the case of the magnesium containing alloys, the MgCl$ sb2$ salt phase that was generated during chlorination was found to have a profound effect on the removal of calcium and sodium. The contribution of the salt phase to the removal of these elements was calculated to reach as high as 60%. In commercial purity aluminum, however, while the major contribution to the removal of calcium was from the chlorine containing gas bubbles, the major contribution to the removal of sodium was calculated to be evaporation of sodium through the melt surface.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R.

The discourse of male rhetoricians defines a subordinate place for women in the order of language. The English formal controversy arguments over the nature of women in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries similarly deploy tropes of male precedence and female subordination to restrain women in the symbolic order and to inhibit any form of female discourse. In order to construct an effective defense a female apologist must reconstitute herself by working within and subverting these constraints. Early Stuart drama provides numerous instances in which women confront and contest the pre-established limits for female speech in their efforts to defend themselves and/or their sex. However, in the dramas selected for this scrutiny, despite the forceful defense strategies that female characters use in their attempts to negotiate their negative positions in language, they are ultimately marginalized. My final chapter therefore examines the rhetorical strategies whereby in her life and writing one woman author, Elizabeth Cary, successfully appropriated and transformed the gendered tropes into compelling female defenses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lieblein, Leonore (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj79c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935462d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English drama -- Early modern and Elizabethan, 1500-1600</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj1393619"><dcterms:title>Difference models of visual cortical neurons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dobbins, Allan C. (Allan Charles)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Difference operations are ubiquitous in the visual cortex. The central hypothesis in this thesis is that a nonlinear difference model can account for the functional properties of three different classes of visual cortical neurons. Abstractly each of the different neurons can be understood in terms of the same difference model although the computations they perform can be entirely different. Endstopped neurons respond to short or highly curved oriented patterns. Their behaviour results from the difference in activation of their classical receptive field and inhibitory endzones. Two models of endstopped neurons are evaluated mathematically and by computer simulation. It is concluded that a model with displaced complex cell-like endzones is both more computationally robust and more consistent with the physiological evidence. Other visual cortical neurons have inhibitory zones which are displaced normally rather than tangentially with respect to the neuron's receptive field orientation. These sidestopped cells are selective for narrow patterns. In other visual cortical neurons the side inhibition is derived from a different eye than the classical receptive field. Because of the geometry of projection these are referred to as binocular Near and Far cells. A difference model of sidestopped and Near and Far neurons is developed which captures their principal features. Neurons in visual cortical area MT of primates have been shown to exhibit a velocity-specific antagonism between the receptive field and a surrounding region. It is argued that center-surround antagonism is an attempt to resolve competing constraints. Signal reliability increases with spatial averaging, but the variation of the flow field invariably increases with area. A unifying perspective is that difference models provide a means of estimating the range over which a visual quantity is constant or linear. Varieties of these models exist with a more refined property--selectivity for sign of contour curvature or, under certain circumstances, the sign of convexity of the surface generating a binocular disparity or motion field.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zucker, S.

In the former the influence of spin-orbit scattering on the enhanced electron-electron contribution to the resistivity has been, for the first time, clearly displayed. As the spin-orbit scattering rate increases, this contribution decreases rapidly to finally vanish at extremely high spin-orbit scattering rates. Furthermore the analysis shows that the current weak localization theory gives an accurate description of the experiments irrespective of the level of spin-orbit scattering. In icosahedral Al-Cu-Fe alloys, detailed study of the low temperature resistivity shows that the magnetoresistance and the temperature dependence of the resistivity data are consistent with the predictions of quantum corrections to the conductivity theories. The success of these theories in this alloy system is attributed to intense electron scattering due to disorder. The spin-orbit scattering and the electron wave-function dephasing rates are extracted from fitting the magnetoresistance. The dephasing rate is found to vary as AT$ sp{p}$ with $p sim1.5$; a characteristic of electron-electron scattering in the strong disorder limit. An antilocalization effect has also been directly observed in the temperature dependence of the resistivity in one of the samples.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Strom-Olsen, John O.

The designs of two different BISD circuits (one with, and the other without, self-repair capability) appropriate for repairable, embedded, (single-metal and single-polysilicon layered) CMOS static RAMs, are presented. The implementation of a BISD circuit--with self-repair--requires 15% extra area in a 16K SRAM, and 5% extra area in a 64K SRAM. The BISD circuit contains a reduced-instruction-set processor, which executes diagnosis algorithms stored in a read-only memory, and which uses some extra lines to access the memory. The new algorithms employ "hybrid serial/parallel" operations to access the memory when external repair is available, or "modular" operations to access it when self-repair is required.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Agarwal, Vinod K.

Joint-torque control laws are examined. For large values of drive inertia, it may not be possible to use a fixed torque control law. For sufficiently small drive inertias there always exists a fixed decentralized joint-torque control law that will asymptotically stabilize the fast dynamics. An analysis of high gain joint-torque control laws is presented. Acceleration feedback is examined. High gain acceleration feedback from collocated drive angles does not destabilize the fast dynamics.

First, a unitary matrix is derived which transforms a Hermitian Toeplitz matrix into a real Toeplitz plus Hankel matrix. Some properties of this transformation are also presented. Second, we solve the inverse eigenvalue problem for Hermitian Toeplitz matrices. Specifically, we present a method for the construction of a Hermitian Toeplitz matrix from an arbitrary set of real eigenvalues. The procedure utilizes the discrete Fourier transform to first construct a real symmetric negacyclic matrix from the specified eigenvalues. The algorithm presented is computationally efficient. Finally, we derive a new order recursive algorithm and modify Trench's algorithm, both for eigenvalue decomposition. The former development is of mathematical interest; whereas, the latter is clearly of practical interest. The modifications proposed to Trench's algorithm are to employ noncontiguous intervals and to include a procedure to detect multiple eigenvalues. The goals of the modification are to improve the rate of convergence. The modified algorithm presented utilizes three root searching techniques: the Pegasus method, the modified Rayleigh quotient iteration with bisection shifts (MRQI-B), and the MRQI with Pegasus shifts (MRQI-P). Simulation results are provided for large matrices of orders 50, 100, 200, and 500. Application of the algorithms to Pisarenko's harmonic decomposition, an important signal processing problem, is presented.

However, the role of basic science knowledge and principles in clinical medicine is the subject of considerable controversy. The study examined the understanding of complex biomedical concepts related to cardiovascular physiology. Subjects at various levels of expertise were presented with questions and problems pertaining to the concepts of cardiac output and venous return. The experiment employed the combined methods of a cognitive science approach to problem-solving with a focused clinical interview approach common in science education research. The results indicated a progression of conceptual models of the circulatory system as a function of expertise. This was evident in subjects' explanations and applications of these concepts. The study also characterized the etiology of significant misconceptions and biases, evident in subjects' reasoning at each level of expertise. This research has implications for a theoretical model of conceptual understanding in complex science domains, as well as, implications for medical instruction. It is proposed that the development of a clinically-relevant epistemology of basic science knowledge could contribute substantially to a revised medical curriculum that could impart a more robust conceptual understanding of biomedical concepts to medical students.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patel, Vimla L.

The concept of festive laughter is derived from the theory of Mikhail Bakhtin, and is related, in this thesis, to the culture of low life in O'Casey's Dublin. Through a detailed analysis of O'Casey's plays, this study shows how the forms of laughter function to interrogate the hegemonic political, economic, and cultural discourses of the Irish society of his time. The Dublin trilogy counters the nationalist ideology and its constructions of history, while the later comedies focus on the issues of cultural domination and religious authoritarianism. This negative critique of the dominant order is accompanied, in these plays, by a celebration of the rich energy of popular, collective life, and its capacity to resist domination and to create an alternative society. The study concludes by focusing on the festive nature of O'Casey's theatre.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.

In this thesis I show that neonatal rat nodose and superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons express three voltage-gated K currents: a non-inactivating delayed rectifier type current (IK); a rapidly inactivating A-current (IAf), and; a slowly inactivating A-current (IAs). The channels that underlie IAf and IAs differ in their voltage-dependent, kinetic and pharmacological properties, but share the same single channel conductance, suggesting that rapidly and slowly inactivating A-channels are distinct subtypes of the same basic channel. My preliminary molecular biology experiments establish an approach for identifying the genes that encode for IAf, IAs and IK channels on SCG neurons. By studying the expression of IAf, IAs and IK on peripheral neurons during the first 2 postnatal weeks, I showed that there is no change in the expression of the 3 currents on nodose neurons, whereas the outward current on SCG neurons changes significantly from one dominated by IAs to one dominated by IAf. These results indicate that the pattern of developmental expression of similar types of K channels can differ for each neuron type. Next, I investigated various factors involved in the postnatal control of expression of K channels on SCG neurons. I demonstrated that neither preganglionic nor target factors influence postnatal changes in K currents. However, I observed that neonatal SCG neurons that develop in culture without other cell types lose their expression of IAf and IAs, suggesting that extrinsic factor(s) are involved in the regulation of the expression of these currents. I showed that this loss of A-currents is due, in part, to the absence of a soluble factor provided by nonneuronal cells. In addition, my analysis of the different patterns of expression of voltage-gated K currents suggests that peripheral neurons use intrinsic mechanisms to coordinate their expression of IAf, IAs and</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741t43j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b07g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w908k"><dcterms:title>Autoradiographic localization and characterization of natriuretic peptide binding sites in the rat central nervous system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wróbel-Konrad, Edyta M.

The studies presented in this thesis were undertaken primarily to provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms of action of natriuretic peptides on the central nervous system (CNS). Using autoradiographic and cross-linking techniques, the precise cellular localization, specificity, and subtypes of natriuretic peptide binding sites in selected areas of the rat CNS were established. ANF binding sites are evident primarily on the basolateral plasmalemma of the epithelial cells in the choroid plexus and on plasmalemma of axons, dendrites, and astrocytes in the areas postrema. This cellular localization is consistent with the notion that circulating natriuretic peptides may exerts their effects via a CNS locus. Furthermore, evidence is provided that ANF binding sites are not only specific to ANF, but also to BNP, whereas CNP exhibits a distinct receptor selectivity. Finally, these studies provide a regional localization of three subtypes of natriuretic peptide receptor. In contrast to binding sites with characteristics of natriuretic peptide receptors A and B, which are detected in a number of CNS areas, natriuretic peptide receptor C is detected in only a few CNS structures. These studies are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of natriuretic peptides action on the CNS.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xw60q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w908k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
