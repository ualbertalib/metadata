The beneficial effect of some of these materials on vitamin C has been shown, but the results have been predominantly qualitative. This study, involving the administration of vitamin C to 128 guinea pigs, was designed to determine the extent to which rutin enhanced the apparent biological value of ascorbic acid. The odontoblast method of vitamin C bioassay was used. Rutin increased the apparent biological value of ascorbic acid by approximately 50%, when the vitamin was supplied in suboptimum amounts for normal tooth development, either in crystalline form or from a natural source. As the level of ascorbic acid intake, without rutin, approached optimum, the beneficial effect of added rutin was negligible. These results could be explained by the assumption that rutin prevented "in vivo" oxidative destruction of the administered ascorbic acid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.

The author's experimental work substantiates this theory and shows that the losses for any one geometrical design are approximately a constant proportion of the relative dynamic head.

Although Minkowski himself rejected the quaternionic calculus as "too narrow and clumsy for the purpose in question", Silberstein has strongly advocated the cause of quaternions.

Any inherent study of this kind must be carried through at least a three year period, to allow for the necessary reciprocal crosses within the progeny of the initial mating to bring forth Inherent differences existent within the parental types. The results which are presented in this thesis are therefore representative of the FI generation, but cannot be considered definite until future generations are studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boyes, J.

Without a great deal of imagination these swarming animals may appear not unlike a highly viscous liquid, each individual insect playing the role of an individual molecule. For instance, a large number of brown flour beetles has the peculiar appearance of slowly spreading brown molasses at room temperature, and, at a slightly higher temperature, that of thick lubricating oil. Further, the mass may be poured through a funnel and their volume measured with a graduated cylinder. These are the most obvious of their fluid characteristics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.

To the best of this writer’s knowledge, there has been no recent text devoted to a thorough examination of the subject and only sporadic interest has been shown by researchers. Sigmund Freud, the father of modern psychiatry, began his learned observations by analyzing the mental health of adults. He soon arrived at the conclusion that the onset of mental illness can usually be traced to the period of post natal development and followed through to adulthood.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Waddington, M.

One, stemming from Carlyle, conceived leadership to be one or more traits in the person of the leader. The other, formulated in its most extreme form by Marx, maintained that leaders exist only insofar as they satisfy the needs and purposes of followers; they are the creation of the led. It is this dichotomy which has been breaking down in recent discussions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, E.
