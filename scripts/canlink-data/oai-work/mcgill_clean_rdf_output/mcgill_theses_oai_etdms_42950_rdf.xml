With the goal of identifying  protective factors that prevent youth from escalating from social gambling to  serious problem gambling, this research examined the relationship between family  cohesion, school connectedness, coping and adaptive behaviours, mentor  relationships, achievement motivation, involvement in conventional organizations,  and the development of three health-compromising outcomes---youth problem gambling,  substance abuse, and involvement in multiple risk-taking behaviours (e.g., smoking,  unsafe sexual activity, and reckless driving). The sample consisted of 2,179  students, ages 11 to 19, in the Province of Ontario. Family and school connectedness  were associated with decreased involvement in excessive gambling, substance use, and  multiple risk-taking activities. Furthermore, an examination of the effect of  potential protective factors on a set of risk factors predictive of adolescent  problem gambling suggested that family cohesion plays a role in the prediction of  probable pathological gamblers and those at risk for developing a gambling problem.  These findings were interpreted with respect to their implications for the  development and implementation of prevention programs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn33m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r140f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teenage gamblers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Youth.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gamblers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848r07b"><dcterms:title>The changing face of community based environmental decision-making in Huitzilac, state of Morelos, Mexico /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Frias, Gisela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Awareness of environmental degradation has stimulated inquiry  into the relationship between humans and the environment, increased the demand for  ecological conservation, and contributed to the idea of "sustainable  development". Community based decision-making has emerged as a crucial focus in  environmental management and sustainable development research. This dissertation  examines community based environmental decision-making in an area where traditional  institutions for communal land holding are facing pressures of modernisation. The  dissertation examines the potential, limitations and challenges these institutions  face, from a community based perspective, if they are to function as effective  vehicles for local environmental management and sustainable development. Drawing on  the United Nations ideas of North-South partnerships for development, and on the  recognition that access to information is critical in environmental decision-making;  the dissertation also explores academic-community partnerships as a means of  enhancing community based environmental decision-making. The research uses a case  study approach with qualitative and participatory methodologies to explore  traditional and emerging decision-making bodies in a rural, resource-based,  community. The study draws on conceptual insights from the fields of conservation,  development, environmental decision-making, natural resource management, land tenure  and commons property research, and from popular education and participatory  research. Through examining the comunidad of Huitzilac in the state of  Morelos, Mexico, this study identifies the importance of the shared history of  struggle for land as a factor facilitating collective action in comunidades. The  internal organization of comunidades however, is found to present limitations for  facilitating community based and sustainable decision-making. Notably, the  membership of comunidades is not representative of diverse community based actors  and interests, and the mandate of these communal land-holding institutions does not  address environmental protection or sustainability. Factors external to community  based decision-making structures such as the increased accessibility to markets,  perceived changes in conditions for agriculture and governmental conservation policy  are found to have repercussions on community based environmental decision-making.  Internal and external factors are combined with one another in intricate ways  resulting in the weakening of traditional institutions and resulting in  environmental degradation and social turmoil. Academic-community partnerships, studied through the creation  and analysis of ACCES, Academic and Community Cooperation for Environmental  Sustainability, were found to contribute to community based environmental  decision-making by creating conditions for community organizing and action for  groups marginalized from the traditional communal decision-making mechanisms.  Through a process that integrates popular education and academic research,  characterized by flexibility, the promotion of information and awareness, and the  promotion of values such as trust and cooperation, academic-community partnerships  can facilitate community based organizing for environmental decision-making and  action.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zf023.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r07b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental management -- Mexico -- Morelos (State) -- Decision making.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Commons -- Environmental aspects -- Mexico -- Morelos (State)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental management -- Mexico -- Morelos (State) -- Citizen participation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wj87k"><dcterms:title>Hearing (unheard) voices : aboriginal experiences of mental health policy in Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Macdonald, Mary Ellen, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The focus of this dissertation is the mental health experiences  of Aboriginal people in Montreal as they interface with health policy, and lack  thereof, for this population. Drawing on anthropological fieldwork from Montreal, Eastern  Quebec, and Ontario, this thesis endeavours to unravel the jurisdictional tapestry  that Aboriginal clients must negotiate when seeking services in Montreal. Using an  ethnographic methodology, this project provides an understanding of the ordering of  health services for Aboriginal clients from street-level to policy  offices. This thesis draws on three theoretical areas (theories of  illness, aboriginality, and public policy) to explicate four themes that emerge from  the data. Analysis moves along a continuum between the illness experience and the  macro-social determinants of politics and bureaucracy that impact the health of the  individual as well as support and organize systems of care. Discussion of Theme #1 (evolution of mental health and wellness  categories in health theory, policy and practice) and Theme #2 ( the culture concept  in health policy) demonstrates that despite the progressive evolution of concepts in  health theory and policy, Aboriginal people generally do not find services in  Montreal that provide culturally-sensitive, holistic care. Discussion of Theme #3  (barriers to wellness created by jurisdiction) argues that jurisdictional barriers  prevent clients' access to even the most basic and rudimentary services and that  such barriers can actually disable and increase distress. Discussion of Theme #4 (  Aboriginal-specific services) looks at the pros and cons of creating an  Aboriginal-specific health centre in Montreal. Together, these four themes show that understanding Aboriginal  people in Montreal requires contextualizing their embodied experience within the  colonial history and institutional racism which characterizes many healthcare  interactions, and clarifying the bureaucracy that complicates the search for  well-being. Montreal's Aboriginal problematic is located in a system characterized  by entrenched bureaucracy, jurisdictional complexity and injustice, these elements  mapping onto Aboriginal reality with serious repercussions for individual identity  and well-being. Hearing the voices of Aboriginal people in Montreal as they seek  out care for mental health problems requires the resolution of jurisdictional and  policy clashes that currently silence their suffering. This thesis endeavours to  advance this crucial social agenda.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scott, Colin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128b41k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wj87k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Mental health services -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indigenous peoples -- Mental health services -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988k39d"><dcterms:title>A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility study of lung transplants /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vasiliadis, Helen-Maria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. Lung recipients are faced with life-threatening  complications which may impede in reaching an acceptable overall clinical and HRQOL  level. Furthermore, the reported costs associated with the rigid follow-up care and  expensive drug regimen raises the question whether this intervention is  cost-effective. Objectives. To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness  (C/E) and cost-utility (C/U) of lung transplantation (L-Tx) according to the health  system perspective. Methods. A C/E and C/U analysis of L-Tx was carried out on 124  patients accepted unto the Quebec L-Tx waiting list (1997--2001). Survival was  presented in mean life years (LY). HRQOL and utility were assessed using the SF-36  and standard gamble; they were studied cross-sectionally and longitudinally on a  group of patients. Utility was used in the computation of the QALY. The economic  impact of L-Tx was based on direct medical costs for 3 time periods: the waiting  list, the transplant procedure and post-transplant phase. In the incremental C/E and  C/U ratio, the costs for the procedure and follow-up care were compared to those  during the waiting list, which served as an estimate for costs without  transplantation. Estimates were modeled beyond the study period based on registry  data. Simulating different person-time experiences during the waiting time (1 to 6  years) and post-transplant phase (1 to 8 years) tested key assumptions. Costs were  based on provincial and national data and were discounted at a rate of  5%. Results. The estimates were based on the 1,090.0 and 1,421.5  person-months contributed by the cohort (N = 124) to the waiting list and  post-transplant phase (N = 91), respectively. The mean LYs and QALYs gained were  0.57 (95% CI: 0.36--0.78) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.36--0.78), respectively. HRQOL was  higher on average for all domains in lung recipients versus candidates. Utility  scores were also higher in recipients as compared to candidates: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69,  0.83) versus 0.17 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.22). The estimated total average cost per patient  without Tx was $15,015 or $1,708 (95% CI: $1,327--$2,090) per month. The L-Tx  program induced an additional screening cost of $9,622 per patient. The average cost  of a transplant procedure was $49,314 (95% CI: $39,216--$69,465). The average  post-Tx follow-up cost per patient per month in the first, second, third and fourth  year was $2,804 ($1,840--$3,792), $1,643 ($1,090--$2,291), $1,749 ($804--$2,690) and  $971 ($768--$1,175), respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Collet, J.-P.

Despite its less invasive nature, stent implantation remains limited by  in-stent restenosis within the stent struts. Although systemic administration of  therapeutic drugs has shown disappointing results, the local delivery or  presentation of therapeutic molecules/drugs/genetic material is a promising area for  development. The work that forms the basis of this thesis attempts to develop  new devices or new strategies to achieve more efficient delivery of therapeutic  biomacromolecules to the vascular walls during revascularization procedures. The  work can be divided into three 3 Parts: (I) Modification of endovascular stents by  hybrid coatings: two strategies involved the surface modification of the devices by  plasma polymerization, followed by covalent immobilization of hyaluronan conjugated  or able to be conjugated with a bioactive component (peptides/proteins or  radionuclides). The last section of the Part I described the development of  bioactive coating based on the Layer-by-Layer self-assembly of polysaccharide  multilayers. (II) Development of a biodegradable membrane-covered stent: A  chitosan-PEG blend has been used to engineer a biodegradable membrane-covered device  for endovascular procedures. This membrane-covered device was able to sustain  physiologic pressure, showed very small water permeability, displayed an appropriate  haemocompatibility and could be used for drug delivery. (III) Development of  nanocoatings to be self-assembled in situ onto the vascular wall: self-assembled  multilayers have been investigated to protect damaged arteries and to control the  healing processes by efficiently delivering therapeutic biomolecules to the vascular  wall. These nanometric coatings have been deposited onto blood vessel by the  Layer-by-Layer technique and have shown great potential for drug delivery of various  macromolecules such as NO-donor or plasmid DNA.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tabrizian, M.

Successful virus replication requires  entry into tropic cells, usurping of the cellular machinery, and the production of  progeny virions to initiate further rounds of infection. Establishment of the  antiviral state in response to virus begins at the site of infection and requires  the initiation of a preexisting signaling network designed to inhibit virus  replication and aid in the establishment of this coordinated immune response.  Integral components of this network include the IRF-3 and IRF-7 transcription  factors that play essential roles in the cellular response to infection through  virus induced phosphorylation by an unknown virus activated kinase. The objective of  this research was to elucidate the viral antigen(s) required to induce the  phosphorylation and subsequent activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7, to identify the  molecular component(s) required in this activation process, and to decipher the  mechanism(s) by which cellular recognition of virus infection initiates this  antiviral response. We demonstrate that activation of this signaling network,  following RNA virus infection, is dependent on viral entry, viral transcription, and  viral translation and propose that the molecular requirements governing activation  of IRF-3 and IRF-7 are the result of viral byproducts formed during the process of  cytoplasmic RNA self replication; including both the formation of double stranded  RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Following cellular recognition of these motifs,  signal transduction networks converge onto an IKK-related kinase structure composed  of adaptor proteins bound to two kinase subunits, TBK-1 and IKKepsilon, which we  propose to be essential components of the virus activated kinase. We demonstrate  that TBK-1 or IKKepsilon activation results in the establishment of an antiviral  state that renders cells non permissive to viral replic</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hiscott, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x191k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh227</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interferons -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>RNA Virus Infections.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw579"><dcterms:title>Maori identities and visions : politics of everyday life in Auckland, New Zealand</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagné, Natacha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Indigenous peoples around the world have been involved,  especially since the 1970s, in nationalist or sovereigntist movements, as well as in  struggles for decolonization, self-determination, and recognition of their rights.  Maaori of Aotearoa/New Zealand are engaged in just such processes and, particularly  since the 1960s and 1970s, as part of the Maaori "cultural renaissance".  Since about 70% of Maaori live in urban areas, cities---Auckland in  particular---have become important sites of affirmation and struggle. This study,  which falls within the field of urban anthropology, is an investigation of what  being Maaori today means and how it is experienced, in particular in the city. The  sense of place of Maaori living in Auckland and the appropriation of space in the  urban context are important dimensions of this study. It explores the complexity of  Maaori relationships to the urban milieu, which is often perceived as an alien and  colonized site; the ways they create places and spaces for themselves; and the  ongoing struggles to (re)affirm Maaori identities and cultural aspects considered  important elements of these identities. The focus of this research is on everyday  life and "ordinary" Maaori (in contrast to elites). It reveals the  significance and importance to Maaori affirmation and resistance of the extended  family and certain types of "city houses" which are based on  "traditional" marae (Maaori traditional meeting places) principles. In  contrast to many studies that have stressed the assimilation pressures of the urban  milieu and global forces on indigenous societies, this research underlines processes  of (re)affirmation. It shows how indigenous visions, and ways of being are  maintained and even strengthened through changes and openness to the larger society.

Participants worked on three  internal medicine cases from the computer-based learning environment, BioWorld. The  analyses focused on general performance measures, problem solving operators and  knowledge states, and post-problem reflection activities. Verbal protocol data was  collected and examined using a coding scheme developed and implemented with the  N-Vivo software. Students and residents differed in overall diagnostic accuracy, and  significant differences were found in solution time and the number of utterances  made for cases of varying difficulty. Differences in the use of operators and  knowledge states are highlighted, although the groups were quite similar on many  measures. The experts spent considerably more time working on case history  information, consistently engaged in planning, and always generated the correct  diagnosis (among others) in response to case history information. During  post-problem reflection students used more case history data than residents. Expert  models highlight the experts' problem solving cycle that consisted of reviewing  data, identifying hypotheses, and planning. Post-questionnaire results indicate that  participants found the cases to be interesting, useful for learning, but not  especially difficult. Finally, several implications are drawn for the future  development of BioWorld for medical training.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n846z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z647</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medical education.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diagnosis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Data processing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Problem solving.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jr70h"><dcterms:title>Equivalence and nonequivalence of the microcanonical and canonical ensembles : a large deviations study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Touchette, Hugo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents an in-depth study of statistical mechanical  systems having microcanonical equilibrium properties, i.e., energy-dependent  equilibrium properties, which cannot be put in correspondence with their canonical  or temperature-dependent equilibrium properties.

Although Shah Ismail has received extensive treatment in both  historical chronicles and modern historiography, this dissertation locates the  development of his cult in the legendary versions of his life story. In this  respect, the Turkish "Minstrel Tale" (hikaye) is fundamental to the  transformation of Shah Ismail's significance in the sectarian context. This  dissertation also traces the development of his pious significance through both the  "authentic" poetic works of Shah Ismail, as contained in his earliest  collections of poetry, as well as the poetry attributed to Shah Ismail by the  Alevi-Bektashi. It is further demonstrated how the poetry attributed to Shah Ismail  is integrated into ritual structures. Through the examination of these disparate  literary genres, this thesis accounts for Shah Ismail's legacy as it transformed and  endured within a pious context beyond his lifetime and beyond his  empire.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kb26g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n387q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nosairians -- Iran</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sufis -- Iran</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ismāʻīl I, Shah of Iran, 1487-1524</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z582g"><dcterms:title>Phase behavior and oxidation of organic wastes in supercritical water</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fang, Zhen, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>De-inking sludge and its contaminants were studied in  supercritical water (SCW), where temperature and pressure are above water's critical  point of 374ºC &amp; 22.1 MPa. Phase behavior of pure organics in the sludge  were studied with a diamond anvil cell (DAC) technique, and optical &amp; FT-IR  microscopes. Oxidation experiments in SCW were performed in batch and flow reactors  for the complex sludge and pure decachlorobiphenyl (10-CB). From the visual observations in the DAC, homogeneous phases with  water were found for cellulose at 329ºC; for naphthalene (NT) at  383ºC; for benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) at 508ºC and for polystyrene (PS) at  570ºC. Adding O2 shifted the formation of the single phase to lower  temperature. Complete dissolution of 10-CB occurred only when excess O2 was present  (at 548ºC with 225% excess O2 or at 450ºC for 596 s with 93% excess  O2). Adding Na2CO3 significantly enhanced dissolution rate of 10-CB, for example,  using 2.5-mol% Na2CO 3, complete dissolution was achieved at 434ºC even with  low O 2 concentration (69.5% theoretical O2). The homogeneous conditions are important for the oxidation study  of the sludge in batch reactors. Oxidation experiments of heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cd)-,  NT and BaP-contaminated sludge in SCW were conducted. It was found that all organics  in the sludge, including stable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons could be almost  completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O. The water-soluble heavy metal salts were  effectively removed by precipitation to insoluble oxides and salts with little  leachability. During the oxidation of 10-CB at 225% excess O2, only 99.2%  destruction rate was obtained accompanied by severe corrosion of the reactor.  However, using 100% theoretical Na2CO3, all 10-CB was destroyed at 159.5% excess O 2  with little corrosion. 10-CB was also successfully destroyed in a flow  reactor. Oxidation pathways of the major components of the sludge and a  sequence of corrosion reactions were proposed. It can be concluded that the SCW oxidation process is an  effective technique for the destruction of organic wastes including very stable  hazardous compounds (e.g., BaP &amp; 10-CB) due to the homogeneous conditions of  chemical reactions and removal of heavy metals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kozinski, Janusz A.

Many reports lead to the hypothesis that a high axonal neurofilament burden  and a large axonal caliber account for the selective vulnerability of motor neurons  affected in ALS (Kawamura et al., 1981; Sobue et al., 1981; 1987). Transgenic mice  expressing a mutant form of SOD1-linked to familial ALS and having one disrupted  allele for each neurofilament gene were generated to address this issue. Despite a  40% reduction in neurofilament content and a decrease of large axonal caliber from  5--9 mum to 1--5 mum, these mice did not show an extended life span, nor did they  display an alleviated loss of motor axons. These results do not support the idea  that high neurofilament content and large axonal caliber are responsible for the  selective vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS. Peripherin, a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein is  also expressed in spinal motor neurons, and is present together with neurofilaments  in axonal spheroids of ALS patients, suggesting that this protein could be involved  in the pathogenesis of ALS. Moreover, mice overexpressing a peripherin transgene  develop a late-onset motor neuron death characterized by the presence of IF  inclusion bodies (Beaulieu et al., 1999a). In a first attempt to clarify the role of  peripherin in ALS, peripherin knockout mice were generated. Peripherin null mice  were viable, reproduce normally and did not exhibit overt phenotype. However, they  did show a 34% reduction in the number of L5 unmyelinated sensory fibers  demonstrating a requirement of peripherin for the proper development of a subset of  sensory neurons. Finally, in order to investigate whether peripherin contributes  to the pathogenesis of ALS, mutant SOD1 mice were generated in a peripherin  overexpressing background and a peripherin depleted background. Unexpectedly,  upregulation or suppression of peripherin expression had no effect on disease onset,  mortality and motor neuron loss in mutant SOD1 mice. Taken together, these results  provide compelling evidence that peripherin is not a key contributor of motor neuron  degeneration associated with toxicity of mutant SOD1.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Julien, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c098g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405s985z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zt84g"><dcterms:title>Amiodarone and the risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation : analysis of time-dependent exposure using nested case-control and survival analysis methodologies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Essebag, Vidal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The nested case-control design is an efficient method of  sampling from a cohort that is increasingly used in cardiovascular research to study  causal relationships. This methodology can be used to analyze data from large  administrative databases to evaluate potential cardiovascular adverse effects of  medications. Using a nested case-control approach, this study investigated whether  amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF) was associated with an increased  risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker insertion. This previously  unpublished adverse effect of amiodarone was evaluated in a province-wide database  of Quebec residents with AF and a previous myocardial infarction. We found that  amiodarone use was associated with a greater than twofold increase in the risk of  permanent pacemaker insertion after adjusting for potential confounding factors and  exposures to other cardiovascular medications. The effect of amiodarone dose on this  risk was then evaluated with survival analysis using Cox regression with  time-dependent covariates. The risk of permanent pacemaker insertion was found to be  dose-dependent and greatest during the initial months of treatment when higher doses  of amiodarone were used. The effect of amiodarone dose was reanalyzed using nested  case-control methods in order to compare nested case-control and survival analysis  approaches for evaluating time-dependent exposure. Expectedly similar risk estimates  were obtained with superior computational efficiency using nested case-control  methods. In conclusion, amiodarone is associated with a dose-dependent increased  risk of permanent pacemaker insertion that should be taken into consideration when  initiating amiodarone therapy for elderly patients with AF. The nested case-control  design is a useful alternative for analysis of a cohort with time-dependent  exposure, particularly when studying rare outcomes in large  databases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pilote, Louise (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h2513.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zt84g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p768c"><dcterms:title>Binge antecedents and consequences in bulimic syndromes : an examination of the roles of dietary restraint, affect and dissociation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Engelberg, Marla J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explored possible underlying processes of bulimic  behaviours by conducting a naturalistic examination into binge antecedents and  consequences. Main hypotheses were derived from contemporary theories of  binge-eating behaviour, which postulate that dietary restraint, negative affect, and  dissociative phenomena (i.e., lapses in self-awareness) may precipitate and maintain  bulimic symptoms. A secondary aspect of this study was to determine whether or not  personality variations influence individuals' sensitivity to processes that may  precipitate binge eating or that may shape binge consequences. A sample of 39 women  with bulimia-spectrum eating disorders provided "on line" self-reports on  eating episodes, urge to binge, behavioural and cognitive dietary restraint,  negative and positive affect, and dissociation, with samplings obtained in response  to random prompts, and before and after every eating episode. Across participants,  recording with the daily diaries spanned 7- to 29-day intervals and resulted in a  total of 3,204 recordings. Multilevel modelling analyses indicated that increases in  behavioural dietary restraint preceded stronger urges to binge. Affect was also poor  prior to actual binge episodes and seemed to worsen after bingeing. In addition,  dissociation was likely to be present prior to and after bingeing. These results  suggest that processes linked to dietary restraint, affect, and dissociation  potentiate, trigger, and/or maintain bulimic behaviours. In contrast, the results  did not consistently support the role of personality traits as moderators of binge  antecedents or consequences. The present findings suggest that binge eating is a  multiply determined behaviour that is linked to diverse cognitive, behavioural, and  affective processes. Recommendations for future research and clinical implications  are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Steiger, Howard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bm19s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p768c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bulimia -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xc356"><dcterms:title>Processing and properties of high carbon microalloyed steels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>El-Wazri, Abdelbaset M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Five steels were used in the present work to investigate the  dynamic, static and metadynamic recrystallization behavior of hypereutectoid steels  of 1% carbon, alloyed with high silicon and microalloying levels of vanadium.  Compression tests were performed using single and double hit schedules at  temperatures between 875--1100ºC, strain rates of 0.01s-1 -1s-1, and  inter-pass times of 0.1--500 seconds and 0.1--30 seconds for static  recrystallization and metadynamic recrystallization, respectively. For dynamic  recrystallization, it was found that an increase in carbon and vanadium content led  to smaller grain sizes. Equations were generated that can be used to predict the  critical strain for dynamic recrystallization. Of interest is the finding that there  is an activation energy for deformation specifically associated with dynamic  recrystallization (i.e. peak strain). This activation energy associated with the  peak strain is lower than that associated with the steady state stress. This is  contrary to Sellar's original observation that the peak strain is a function of the  activation energy for deformation according to the Zener-Hollomon relationship. The  static recrystallization kinetics were measured, and the appearance of 'plateau'  regions where softening is arrested for a period of time was used to quantify the  kinetics of strain-induced precipitation and generate the precipitation temperature  time diagrams for the three steels. Despite the wide range of V levels, the steels  exhibited very similar precipitation kinetics at all temperatures tested, being  particularly close below 950ºC. A kinetic equation for static  recrystallization is proposed which takes the V and Si concentrations into account.  The metadynamic recrystallization results show that there is a transition strain  region in which both static and metadynamic recrystallization take place during the  inter-pass time.

This requires  extending the scope of program analysis and compiler optimization from traditional,  sequential programs to concurrent programs. Naumovich et al. proposed May Happen in Parallel (MHP) analysis  that determines which program statements may be executed concurrently. From this  information, compiler optimization improvements, as well as analysis data on  potential program problems such as dataraces can be analyzed or  discovered. Unfortunately, MHP analysis has some limitations with respect to  practical use. In this thesis we present an implementation of MHP analysis for Java  that attempts to address some of the practical implementation concerns of the  original work. We describe a design that incorporates techniques for aiding a  feasible implementation and expanding the range of acceptable  inputs. The MHP analysis requires a particular internal representation  in order to run. By using a combination of techniques, we are able to compact that  representation, and thus significantly improve MHP execution time without, affecting  accuracy. We also provide experimental results showing the utility and impact of our  approach and optimizations using a variety of concurrent benchmarks. The results  show that our optimizations are effective, and allow more and larger benchmarks to  be analyzed. For some benchmarks, our optimizations have very impressive results,  speeding up MHP analysis by several orders of magnitude.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n12r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf43n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892b389"><dcterms:title>Smoke and mirrors : reflections of policy and practice for those with a mental illness and who are in conflict with the law</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thibault, Kathleen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examined the use of language in the development and  implementation of mental health policy.

The narratives of these advisers have  come to dominate the most Westerners popular conception of the Arab uprising. Most  scholars have portrayed the British advisers to the Arab Revolt as  "pro-Arab." The aim of this thesis is to challenge that portrayal through  a careful analysis of the writings (published and unpublished) and actions of the  four advisers: T.E.

By examining the advisers' published accounts and the  available archival resources the contrast between the rhetoric surrounding their  legends and the actual practice of their war experiences will be laid bare. The goal  of the thesis is to use primary sources to demonstrate, in various areas of their  relationships with Arabs, a discourse of superiority versus inferiority. This work  has consequently attempted to present a less altruistic agenda emerging from the  advisers' wartime conduct. In its place I have demonstrated numerous instances where  they coerced and enforced their own interpretation of Arab desires and even an  "Arab" identity onto the Revolt itself and furthermore, cemented these  interpretations into Western popular culture.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj18r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j1505</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Young, Hubert, Sir, 1885-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lawrence, T.

The final GEQ consists of three positive expectancy scales (i.e.,  Enjoyment/Arousal, Self-Enhancement, Money) and two negative expectancy scales  (i.e., Over-Involvement, Emotional Impact). Significant gender, age and DSM-IV-MR-J  gambling group differences were identified on the scales of the GEQ. Stepwise  logistic regression among gamblers was performed separately for males and females to  predict group membership into either social or problem gambling categories. The  results of this study suggest that non-gamblers, social gamblers, at-risk gamblers  and PPGs differ in their expectancies of the positive and negative outcomes of  gambling behavior. In particular, PPGs highly anticipate both the positive and  negative outcomes of gambling. Among males, these perceptions differentiate those  who gamble excessively and those who do not. For females, on the other hand, outcome  expectancies may have less predictive value.

James M. Gustafson's  theocentric ethics, which centres value on God, can accomplish this in the religious  sphere. Gustafson's ethical theory also has the potential to work within nontheistic  secularism as a way of construing all things as interrelated and interdependent.  Underlying Gustafson's theology and value theory is a commonsense ontology, which  appreciates evidences from the sciences, affective orientation, and resembles  certain webs of beliefs held by many outside religious communities. In order to  illustrate the transition to secular Gustafsonian ethical theory, functional  surrogates of theology found in secular philosophy, and particularly in the work of  Mary Midgley, are identified. Gustafson's ethical theory is used to identify certain  obligations and restrictions with regard to environmental ethics.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg83k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx500</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental ethics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Christian ethics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gustafson, James M. -- Ethics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vp095"><dcterms:title>Agréable désordre? : le domaine du plaisir dans deux romans de Prévost</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pépin, Elsa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis is to analyse the evolution of the  concept of pleasure in the literature and the history of ideas of the beginning of  the 18th Century in France, through the study of the upheaval of sensibility carried  out by Prevost's worried hedonism. In order to better understand the progressive  transition of the semantic and lexicological concept of pleasure in the theoritical  literature, we examine the philosophical and moral treaties on pleasure as well as  the definitions found in the dictionnaires of the time. The study then focuses on  two novels by Prevost: L'Histoire du chevalier Des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut and  L'Histoire d'une Grecque moderne. These novels stage two experiences of pleasure  which contribute to shape a new architecture of man characterised by instability and  inconsistance. Prevost's hedonism redefines the position of the social, moral and  psychological being according to certain features which lead to a particular  aesthetic of disharmony.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr765.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp095</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Prévost, abbé, 1697-1763 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pleasure in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hedonism</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
