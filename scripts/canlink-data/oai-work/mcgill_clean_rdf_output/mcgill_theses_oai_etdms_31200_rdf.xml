The K$ sb{ rm M}$ of histidase solution and the K$ sb{ rm M}$ apparent of microencapsulated histidase were both 20mM. Encapsulation of histidase resulted in increased stability of enzymatic activity of storage temperatures of 4$ sp circ$C and 37$ sp circ$C.

In vitro experiments to evaluate the feasibility of microencapsulated histidase for possible experimental therapy in histidinemia were carried out. These experiments evaluated the effectiveness of encapsulated histidase in depleting histidine. Three different volume ratios of histidase loaded artificial cells to substrate solution were tested. A ratio of 1:100 allowed 25% histidine depletion after 120 hours. A 1:50 ratio allowed 35% histidine depletion after 72 hours. A 1:25 ratio allowed 40% histidine depletion after 24 hours.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t0420.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s598f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh88b"><dcterms:title>Lawful measures of retaliation in international air law</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jaeger, Kurt</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Unilateral remedies such as non-forcible reprisals, counter-measures and sanctions remain prevalent means of enforcement in international aviation relations.

The emergence of new principles is also evident in the draft of the International Law Commission on State responsibility. In an effort to combat unlawful interference with international civil aviation, an increasing number of States have expressed their willingness to take concerted counter-measures against offending States. ICAO is the logical forum for discussion and resolution of aviation matters of world-wide concern and should, therefore, act as a fact-finding body and/or dispute settlor in cases of controversy. States should also be more willing to resort to arbitration as provided for in their aviation agreements and should address explicitly the problem of enforcement when negotiating future air law treaties.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv64z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh88b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m778g"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of the effect of heat on the slurry technique for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gervais, Lyne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A sample introduction system was developed with the goal of improving the efficiency of introduction of slurries into an inductively coupled plasma for atomic emission spectrometry. The system consisted of a Legere nebulizer with a heated spray chamber followed by a condenser. A capillary injector tube of 1.0 mm i.d. was required to minimize the signal variations caused by fluctuations of the injection gas. Comparing with a conventional slurry system, the hot system increased the transport efficiency by 2 for liquid and solid samples while it decreased the water content of the aerosol by 38%: 9.3 mg/min compared to 14.8 mg/min. The heated chamber increased the signal intensities by a factor of 11 for liquid samples and by 3 for solid samples. The use of a hot nebulization gas did not contribute further to the signal enhancement of the system. The large difference in slopes of calibration curves for liquids and solids resulted in low accuracy for the analysis of marine sediments: less than 50% in general. Poor efficiency of decomposition of the solid particles is considered the cause of low accuracy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x85x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m778g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z98t"><dcterms:title>Attenuation correction for SPECT imaging of the brain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kemp, Brad J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Attenuation and scatter are limiting factors in image quality and quantitation of organ function by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). To correct brain images for attenuation an effective water/tissue attenuation coefficient of 0.12 cm$ sp{-1}$ (at 140 keV) or larger has been recommended in order to compensate for the additional bone (skull) attenuation. It has been determined that the reconstructed images are overcorrected in the centre by 5%, and the optimum correction occurs for a reduced coefficient of 0.09 cm$ sp{-1}$. The overcorrection is due to increased attenuation at the edges of all projections where the path length through the bone is greater, although the bone also increases the scatter at the projection edges. A correction scheme which uses effective bone and water coefficients was developed to compensate for the attenuation. Alternatively, prior to attenuation correction, a common scatter correction was found to be effective in explicitly removing the bone and water scatter.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv74q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z98t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf976"><dcterms:title>Immunocytochemical characterization of components of the hemopoietic microenvironment in the mouse fetal liver</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gill, Jagjit Singh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The fetal liver plays an important role in hemopoiesis during mammalian development. Morphological and immunocytochemical studies were carried out to identify and characterize cellular components that may be responsible for producing the liver hemopoietic environment. Cytospot preparations, from fetal livers of 11-18 days gestation, reacted with specific antibodies enabled us to characterize and quantitate the different cell populations. Light microscope observations also showed areas of close cell associations involving two classes of central cells and peripheral erythroid cells. Such associations were distinguished based on their immunocytochemical characteristics (AFP vs. Mac-1 central cells) and quantitative appearance throughout cytospots. The presence of these significant cell associations was also observed in ultrastructural studies that produced further characteristics of these central cells. Characteristic lipid inclusions, glycogenic particles and positive AFP reactions were localized to central hepatocytes. Macrophages in cell associations contained numerous phagocytic particles and distinct peroxidase activity within the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. Extra-cellular matrix components of electron dense nature were noted to emanate from delicate cytoplasmic processes that appeared to keep these associations intact. Fibronectin positive reactions were also specifically localized to central hepatocytes in cell associations. Further morphological and immunocytochemical features of these cell associations in the liver hemopoietic microenvironment are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx02p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf976</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526d619"><dcterms:title>Lettuce stunt : effect of Pythium populations and interactions between Pythium tracheiphilum and nematodes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gracia, Javier</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research has focused on the determination of natural populations in the fields, the effect of different inoculum densities on lettuce growth and a study of the association of this fungus with two nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans Cobb and Meliodogyne hapla Chitwood).

The effect of different inoculum densities was measured at different stages of growth, and only in those plants inoculated 2 weeks after seeding were differences significant and consistent. Some evidence of the detrimental effect of wounding the root system prior to attack by the fungus led to studies of the relationship between this fungus with either P. penetrans or M. hapla. In the first case a negative interaction seemed to exist; no significant increase of the damage caused to the lettuce was observed.

The Reichswehr attempted to draw German industry into relations with the Soviet state in order to secure the manufacture of military machinery and support troop training. By 1922, the foundation for collaboration between German industry, the Reichswehr and the Soviet Union/Red Army had been laid. The Treaty of Rapallo, concluded by government officials that were privy to the activities of the Reichswehr, removed the threat of a western consortium against the Soviet Union, and ensured the growth of the Reichswehr's alliance with the Soviet state.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354g47f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547s64m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Germany -- History -- 1918-1933</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soviet Union -- Foreign relations -- Germany</dc:subject><dc:subject>Germany -- Foreign relations -- Soviet Union</dc:subject><dc:subject>Germany.

These phonological processes include voice, manner and place assimilation as well as deletion and coalescence. The goal of this thesis is to account for these seemingly disparate processes by introducing universal constraints on the representation of segments in non-linear phonology. Deriving these processes from the principles of a theory of representation is beneficial because such an analysis is not possible in a theory that appeals only to rules. The result is a theory of phonology with greater explanatory adequacy than a theory that relies on rules. Chapter 1 contains a review of the history of the representation of segments and the representation of assimilation as well as a discussion of the theoretical assumptions used throughout the thesis. Chapter 2 contains a discussion of the phonological processes as they occur during the formation of prenasalized consonants. These processes are shown to be triggered by the representation of prenasalized consonants and a theory of underspecification. Chapter 3 proposes an analysis of the universal characteristics of nasal-obstruent place assimilation which is then extended to explain some universal properties of consonantal assimilation in general.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp940.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc844</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Assimilation (Phonetics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phonetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zh914"><dcterms:title>Modelling solar irradiance on a slope under a leafless deciduous forest</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rowland, James D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates variations in solar irradiance incident upon sloping surfaces under deciduous forest in winter. A model is presented for prediction of solar irradiance at the surface which accounts for slope inclination and orientation, surrounding topography, isotropic absorption of solar radiation by the crown space, and shadows cast by the stem space. Field data from two sites of different slope and aspect attest to the validity of the model; errors, based on 20-minute averages of instantaneous values, are 15.5% (RMSE) and $-$1.9% (MBE). Error is partially due to reliance upon global radiation measurements above canopy at a different site (partially cloudy conditions) and sampling error (sunny sky conditions). The variability of solar irradiance at the surface, and in the error of predicted values, is found to vary with sky condition, solar zenith and incidence angles, and slope orientation. However, integration to hourly and/or daily time periods improves model performance significantly.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rj16j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh914</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Solar radiation -- Models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Solar radiation -- Measurement</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35t968v"><dcterms:title>Fricke radiation dosimetry using nuclear magnetic resonance</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Podgorsak, Matthew B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The spin-lattice relaxation rate R$ sb1$ of irradiated Fricke solution was studied as a function of the absorbed dose D.

Since very little has been written on this topic in Occidental languages, it has been necessary to provide (1) a descriptive account of the ancient Armenian music; namely, vibassan, koosan, folk and sacred traditions; (2) a presentation of ashoogh poetic forms, rhyming schemes, and accentuation patterns, which are summarized for the first time in a chart with corresponding sources; (3) a chapter on Armenian tzayns as a background to the melodic analysis and codifications of Sayat Nova's melodies, which is contrary to the accepted practice of codifying these melodies with Greek modal names. Professor Nigoghos Tahmizian's analysis of Sayat Nova melodies was used as a starting point. Furthermore, through analysis based primarily on available secondary sources, certain conclusions have been obtained: such as, the unity of rhythm/meter with language conventions, presence of specific melodic patterns, cadential endings, intervallic patterns and ranges in Sayat Nova melodies, as characterised by individual tzayn codifications. Further research is suggested to clarify codification of poetic forms, tzayn designations, and specifically, to solidify accentuation conventions of the Armenian language and of its dialects.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj29v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r73x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Folk songs, Armenian -- Armenia (Republic) -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Armenia (Republic) -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Armenian poetry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sayatʻ-Nova, 1712-1795</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wh21j"><dcterms:title>Fenthion as a secondary poisoning hazard to American kestrels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hunt, Katherine A.

Indices in retrospect including only production traits indicated that, for Holsteins, fat yield was the trait most heavily selected for between 1978 and 1987, followed by protein percent and then milk yield. Fat percent and protein yield had negative index weights throughout the nine year period. In Ayrshires, similar weights were observed except that milk yield index weights were negative throughout the nine year period. It was found that the relative weight placed on type was small and did not affect the relative weights place on production traits. Within Holsteins, differences in bull selection when multiple services were required to successfully service a cow indicated that selection for overall size was reduced in later services. Within Ayrshires, there were no differences in any production or type trait within multiple services.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv78k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g861</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Breeding -- Selection indexes.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t322t"><dcterms:title>A logic minimization algorithm for synthesis of strictly irredundant networks /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Huang, Yi O.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many efficient ways for two-level logic minimization of Boolean functions have been presented. They can obtain the minimum number of product terms and no product terms can be replaced by a product term with fewer variables. But the minimal result obtained from the previous cube-based algorithm is prime and irredundant only for some of the connected outputs and therefore the network that results from the multilevel synthesis might have redundancy and hence untestability. In this thesis, we present a logic minimization algorithm for synthesis of strictly irredundant networks. The key point is that any stuck-at fault in the two-level minimized network should be propagated to every output which is connected. This algorithm is based on the concept of PLA testing and fault simulation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kv01r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t322t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644s786"><dcterms:title>Pour un theatre "dialectique" : étude comparative de deux pratiques esthétiques les Mains sales et Mère courage et ses enfants</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vinciguerra, Maria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the theoretical foundations of Brecht's and Sartre's "dialectical" theatre. Proceeding first from their most significant theoretical writings, it then studies representative plays--Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder and Les Mains sales--in an attempt to make explicit the relationship between theory and artistic practice. The textual analysis proper develops certain aspects of theme, structure and reception which in turn reveal meaningful differences and contradictions. Sartre's "dramatic" theatre in fact evidences a sort of ideological creativity whereas Brecht's "epic" theatre presents a more primordial artistic creativity. Therefore, though the concept of dialectical theatre (essentially political and/or historic) is a common thought-structure to both dramatists, its actualization differs. I will argue that Sartre's work shows a view of the art process as ideologically predetermined and almost ineluctable. Brecht's more primordial work, on the other hand, shows process as a creative anagnorisis, more immediate and archetypal. In the last chapter, I will give an overview of the changes in consciousness produced by these approaches of "dialectical" theatre and substantiate these by criticism that has dealt with the subject.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szanto, George H.</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f959q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s786</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brecht, Bertolt, 1898-1956.

Electromyographic (EMG), joint angular displacement and temporal distance parameters were simultaneously recorded as subjects walked on a treadmill while 0% and 40% of their body weight was mechanically supported by an overhead harness. The effects of 0% and 40% BWS while walking with and without parallel bars and at different treadmill speeds was further investigated in a subgroup of 8 subjects. In general, 40% BWS led to a decrease in prolonged EMG activity of proximal muscles, a decrease in premature activation of distal muscles as well as a decrease in clonus. Such changes in EMG activity were evident especially during more demanding external conditions such as walking without parallel bars or at faster treadmill speeds. A general decrease in EMG mean burst amplitude for lower limb muscles was also noted. Sagittal angular displacement profiles revealed a straighter trunk and knee alignment during initial and midstance. Forty percent BWS appeared to facilitate gait by allowing subjects to walk for longer periods and to walk at faster treadmill speeds. Increases in stride length, single limb support time and decreases in total double support time were also noted with 40% BWS at comparable treadmill speeds. The results this study suggest that BWS facilitates the expression of a more normal gait pattern.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s6008.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b4508</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vc662"><dcterms:title>Study of deformation characteristics of the Donkin-Morien tunnel development</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gilby, John L.

During the period May 1983 to December 1984, a geotechnical research programme was carried out in the Donkin-Morien tunnels by Golder Associates Ltd. The research programme included the monitoring of the performance of the TBM and drill and blast drivages, and the study of the thrusting characteristics and rock-interaction of the TBM excavation. The main emphasis of the research programme was on the collection of field data, which was to be made available in the form of a comprehensive report. The information gained from the programme was also used during the tunnel drivages to monitor the performance of the installed support and enable changes in the support and advance methods. Throughout the research programme the author was resident on site at the Donkin-Morien Mine and was responsible for all aspects of the research project.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9031147.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vc662</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085m38m"><dcterms:title>The 'national' presses and the campaign in North-West Europe /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vasko, Michael A.
