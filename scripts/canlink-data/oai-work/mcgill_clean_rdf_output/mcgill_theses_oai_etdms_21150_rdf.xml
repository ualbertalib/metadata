through which the French Revolution is represented within a corpus of selected novels published between 1789 and 1800 in four national literatures, namely the French, English, American and Italian. By applying a methodology which defines itself as both sociological and narratological, we have sought to reevaluate a period traditionally excluded from literary historiography, by means of a survey and a listing of the novelistic fiction produced in the four fields. We have then inserted our quantitative data which clearly shows the steady growth in the production of novels as well as in the reading public during the 1790's, within the context of pre-revolutionary novelistic discourse from about 1760 onwards. Our overall aim has then been to set up a general typology of literary narratives produced during the revolutionary period according to the model of circulation and reception of works which tends to establish the problematic implications of each text as well as its degree of conformity to narrative conventions canonized by tradition, so as to point out each instance in which a narrative emergence or displacement of literary themes has given rise to a representation of the French Revolution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angenot, Marc (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k805j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w566x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fiction -- 18th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>France -- History -- Revolution, 1789-1799 -- Fiction -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gx06s"><dcterms:title>Le développement industriel d'une région du proche hinterland québécois, la Mauricie, 1900-1975 /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brouillette, Normand.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Technological development at the turn of the twentieth century, more specially in the hydroelectricity industry, has brought the industrialization of several regions. It has been particularly the case in Quebec, after 1900, when the growth of new industrial groups such as pulp and paper, electro-metallurgy, etc... had given way to the structuration of Quebec's industrial space-economy. After a rapid industrial growth, which has been maintained until the end of the fifties, the Quebec's "inner periphery" regions, which have developed on these industrial groups, have known a slow down when it was not a steady decline. Through a detailed analysis of the strategies put forward by the industrial firms of the Mauricie region, which is a fairly representative region of the Quebec's "inner periphery", this study emphasizes on the mechanisms and processes of industrial growth and decline which is experimented today by several regions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq423.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx06s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economic development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mauricie (Québec) -- Economic policy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industries -- Québec (Province) -- Mauricie</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mauricie (Québec) -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hs730"><dcterms:title>The relationship between religion and state in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Yassini, Ayman.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation examines the relationship between religion and state in Saudi Arabia.

It is the state religion, its source of political legitimacy, it shapes state policies and activities, and serves as the moral code of society. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that the state, because of its monopoly of force and resources, and the need to maintain autonomy, can not tolerate an autonomous religious domain that would compete with it for the loyalty of citizens. The state will extend its authority to the religious domain and utilize religious leaders and institutions to perpetuate its policies. This state will make use of religious values to strengthen its authority and legitimacy. It will not hesitate to suppress religious institutions if they challenge its authority.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt653.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs730</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religion and state -- Saudi Arabia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saudi Arabia -- Politics and government.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saudi Arabia -- Religion.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dd25n"><dcterms:title>Formal aspects of metaphor : a study in structural poetics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bailin, Alan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is concerned with the formal analysis of metaphor.

This study defines three new groups; the Georgeville Group (Precambrian) and the Iron Brook and MacDonald Brook Groups (both Cambrian). The Georgeville Group records a progressively deepening depositional environment, from basalt and interbedded marbles at the base giving way to greywackes and shales. Basalts have ocean-floor affinities, but also show some island-arc characteristics. The Georgeville Group may have been deposited in a marginal basin, possibly related to the Precambrian island arc volcanism in southeastern Cape Breton. Possible correlatives include the Mona Complex in Anglesey, Wales. In the late Precambrian the rocks were polydeformed, metamorphosed (greenschist facies) and post-tectonically intruded by gabbro and alaskite. Cambrian rocks unconformably overly the Georgeville Group and consist of either fluviatile to shallow marine sediments (Iron Brook Group) or laterally equivalent interbedded sediments and volcanic rocks (MacDonald Brook Group). Basalts are alkalic, and probably erupted in continental extensional tectonic regime. The succession is similar to other Avalonian rocks of Cambridge age. Thrusting and isoclinal folding, probably during the Taconic Orogeny, is attributed to local transcurrent fault movement, possibly during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. Part 2 of this study focused on the late Precambrian intrusion of a water-rich gabbro (appinite) into marble and basalt of the Georgeville Group. Contamination of the wet magma by the host rocks probably resulted in supersolidus mobility of elements with variations in X(CO(,2)) in the magma and in the fluid phase. Trends closely mimic those expected from crystal fractionation and may be attributed to variable partitioning between H(,2)O-rich silicate melt, CO(,2)-rich silicate melt and a CO(,2)-rich vapour. Alteration trends in the host basalt are virtually opposite to those in the intrusive rock suggesting exchange between them. The extent of alteration defines the edge of the transport system. These processes may account for the occurrence of felsic dykes near the contact zones and for a nearby stock of alaskite. More generally, super-solidus mobility due to variations in X(CO(,2)) may be an important mechanism of fractionation, causing compositional gradients in silicic magma chambers similar to those caused by crystal fractionation. This type of mobility may also be significant in the genesis of bimodal or mixed alkalic-tholeiitic suites.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p10j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz35j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology -- Nova Scotia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Magmatism -- Nova Scotia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geology, Structural.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708x43d"><dcterms:title>State variable analysis of flow localization in work hardening materials</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Christodoulou, Nicholas C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Large strain tensile tests were carried out on OFHC Cu and 99.99% Al with the aim of determining the first and second order work hardening and rate sensitivity coefficients. The tests were performed at room temperature and 473 K and at constant true strain rates in the range 5 x 10('-4) to 10('-1) s('-1). With the aid of a diameter transducer, which was set up to measure and control the rate of reduction of the diameter of the tensile specimen, the strain rate at the minimum cross-section was held constant well beyond the point of maximum load. A second diametral sensor was constructed for use at elevated temperatures. In order to extend the range of conditions covered, constant strain rate compression tests were also performed on Cu at 698 K. In a further series of experiments, tensile tests were carried out on Cu and Al samples at 293 and on Al specimens at 473 K in which the flow localization process was followed by photographic means. It was observed that the values of the rate sensitivity of the work hardening rate B(,(sigma)) beyond the maximum load are not negligible, but that they are less than 1, in opposition to the theoretical predictions of Kocks et al('(47)). Furthermore, it is shown that, contrary to the suggestion of these workers, the rate sensitivity at constant work hardening rate N is not the material coefficient that controls the growth of strain rate gradients at large strains. The material coefficients determined using the diametral transducer were employed for the numerical integration of the second order differential equation describing flow localization proposed by Kocks et al('(47)). This equation was integrated at the minimum cross-section of the sample, and the solution is compared with the one calculated by integrating the first order differential equation proposed earlier by Jonas et al('(10)). As expected, the strain measurements obtained from the flow localization experiments are reproduced more closely by the second order solution than by the first order one largely because of the non-negligible values of B(,(sigma)). However, at large deformations, there is a discrepancy between the experimental observations and the predictions of the second order theory. This is attributed to the development of triaxial stresses at these strains. A possible modification of the second order treatment is suggested, based on the gradient in the Bridgman correction term.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q486t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x43d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Strain hardening.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dislocations in metals.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metals -- Plastic properties.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fs165"><dcterms:title>Proterogyrinus scheelei Romer and the early evolution of tetrapods</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Holmes, Robert, 1950-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Proterogyrinus scheelei Romer, from the Upper Mississippian of Greer, West Virginia is one of the earliest known members of the amphibian infraorder Embolomeri. The primitive, eogyrinid-like skull conforms to Panchen's allometric plot of the British eogyrinids. The only distinct autapomorphy is a raised pineal foramen rim and an acuminate median ridge on the skull table posteriorly, flanked by deep bilateral pockets. The kinetic junction extends from the otic notch anteriorly to the posterodorsal corner of the orbit. The braincase, bearing no ossified roof, is composed of separate otic-occipital and sphenethmoid units, the latter being undivided. The vertebrae are similar to those of embolomeres, except that the pleurocentrum retains a dorsal suture in adults, and the intercentrum, unossified dorsally in adults, is a ventral crescent. The presacral count is 32. The atlas-axis is reptiliomorph. Zygapophysis structure indicates that the column must have undergone axial rotation during lateral flexion. The limbs and girdles are similar to those of Archeria, except that they are slightly stouter. Humerus structure is primitive. Range of limb movement, at least in the pectoral limb, is very restricted. An almost total lack of autapomorphies indicates that Proterogyrinus is a primitive member of the stem family (Proterogyrinidae) of the infraorder Embolomeri. Although most of the supposed autapomorphies of anthracosaurs that were formerly thought to preclude them from reptile ancestry are not considered to be valid, there are no identifiable synapomorphies with reptiles either, making it impossible to support close relationship between the two groups.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tz425.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fs165</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tetrapods -- Evolution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anthracosauria.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gd83r"><dcterms:title>The influence of confinement on the propagation of near limit detonation waves /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Donato, Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reports on a detailed experimental investigation of near limit ethylene-air detonation phenomena in tubes. The different detonation regimes were determined as a function of ignition energy, composition and stability for a specific tube diameter. The dependence of single head spin detonations on the tube diameter was further investigated. This study has revealed that the different near limit regimes are governed by the acoustic coupling with the tube walls and can be influenced by the energy of the ignition source. The effective source energy and the distance over which this energy will support a detonation phenomenon have been quantified. It has been shown that the characteristic detonation cell size of the mixture can be obtained by matching the cell length to the spin pitch of the mixture in which the single head spin phenomenon is first observed. In addition, a model for predicting the detonation cell sizes as a function of composition is presented. The detonability limit in a tube has been defined as the composition for onset of spin in this tube. The cell size correlation was effectively used in order to predict the critical tube diameters and minimum ignition energies for unconfined situations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t013j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd83r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Detonation waves.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
