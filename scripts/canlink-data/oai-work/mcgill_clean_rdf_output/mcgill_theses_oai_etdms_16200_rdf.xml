According to this theory, a superior, either belonging to the military or a civilian, may be found criminally liable because of crimes committed by his subordinates, if he failed to warn them or punish them after the fact. Recognized as valid ground for personal criminal liability since World War II, the theory of criminal liability of the superior was codified in the Rome Statute creating the International Criminal Court. In this Statute, negligence is an acceptable standard to find a military superior criminally liable. In other words, liability is incurred if the military superior should have known that his subordinates were committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide even if, in fact, he did not have such knowledge. Specifically, this thesis will explore the link between the concept of superior responsibility and the standard of negligence. The nature of both concepts will be analysed in a comparative perspective, borrowing from international, Canadian and French law. The author begins with a review of the theory of superior responsibility, exploring its history, its triggers and its nature. The author then studies negligence as a concept, both in internal and international law to see in what context this standard is acceptable. Then, the author explains why the standard of negligence was accepted as a valid ground for criminal liability of the superior, and assesses the wisdom of this decision.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h515.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fq48k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Superior orders (Criminal law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Criminal liability (International law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Negligence, Criminal -- France.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Negligence, Criminal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Negligence, Criminal -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pv187"><dcterms:title>Le droit de la filiation entre ciel et terre : étude du discours juridique québécois</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bureau, Marie-France, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis submitted undertakes an analysis of legal discourse in Quebec filiation Law. In particular, the author seeks to understand why this field---in marked contrast to other sectors of the civil law---continues to be influenced by natural law theories. The principle focus of the study is the period from 1980 to the present. The discourse analysis approach helps to shed light on the considerable number of reforms which took place in a relatively short period of time and gives context to contemporary interrogations of the foundations of the Law of filiation. Given that many scholars are now questioning the incoherence of the current norms, and deploring the alteration of this field of law, it is important to sketch a picture of the larger influences and values which nonetheless present continuity in the civilian tradition. From a constructivist point of view, the author's contribution to this field is to systematize the thought and vision of the scholars involved in this area of law in order to identify the various influences on them, and the range of ideas and disciplines which they invoke in justifying their theoretical vision. Filiation has been described, in different periods, as revealing a divine order, as representing the core unit of society in the national image, as translating into law a set of natural facts or as an immutable anthropological order which secures the psychological balance of subjects. This analysis of the dominant discourse suggests that the rules of filiation have, throughout, been seen to represent a transcendent order, one superior to positive law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fc861.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pv187</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Paternity -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g3730"><dcterms:title>La contribution des organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) à la justice internationale /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Breton-Le Goff, Gaëlle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>La participation des organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) aux travaux des organisations intergouvernementales et des grandes conferences internationales est un phenomene desormais connu, reconnu et etudie.

La presente etude s'y attelle donc en demontrant a travers l'analyse du role et de l'impact des ONG, leur contribution a la "judiciarisation" de la societe internationale, a la collectivisation de la justice internationale et a sa communautarisation. Se faisant, ce travail s'inscrit dans une approche sociologique du droit et emprunte a une vision systemique de la societe internationale. Desormais, la realisation de la justice internationale n'est plus du seul domaine inter-etatique. Si elle continue de se manifester par la multiplication des juridictions internationales, elle s'exprime egalement dans la propension de plus en grande de l'individu et des ONG a participer a la justice internationale et a en revendiquer l'exercice. La multiplication des tribunaux populaires ainsi que la participation accrue des ONG a la creation de nouveaux mecanismes de surveillance des traites ou de juridictions demontrent l'ampleur du phenomene de judiciarisation. Davantage encore, les diverses formes d'interventions des ONG aupres des individus et des juridictions favorisent sans aucun doute l'activite judiciaire internationale dans des termes qui depassent largement les interets individuels du litige. Par ailleurs, les tribunaux populaires s'emparent de cette fonction juridictionnelle pour proposer des lieux alternatifs de reglement des differends. La pression exercee par les ONG sur l'activite contentieuse internationale est l'illustration d'une prise en charge collective, independante des Etats, des interets individuels et collectifs. Toutefois, la defense de ces interets par les ONG correspond a une vision du juste et du droit ideal qui ne concorde pas necessairement avec l'etat du droit positif. La procedure d'Amicus curiae s'avere devant bien des juridictions un instrument privilegie d'inflexion de la norme. Quand bien meme des limites inherentes au droit et aux juridictions freinent les tentatives d'influence normative des ONG, l'etude de l'impact des memoires d'amicus curiae deposes par elles demontre cependant leurs contributions au developpement normatif du droit international et au dialogue juridictionnel.

Dedicated to the study of the dynamic response of bodies in contact and to the mathematical description of the contact phenomenon, contact dynamics modeling has been and remains an intensive area of research with numerous applications in the engineering practice, such as mechanism analysis and design, aerospace engineering, robotics, bioengineering, sports, computer engineering and material engineering. However, contact dynamics behavior is not easy to model because of the complex dependencies on the properties of the contacting bodies, including the geometry of contact and kinematic configuration, the inertia and material properties, the contact surfaces properties and many other system parameters. This thesis is devoted to the investigation of rigid body contact dynamics modeling and aims to contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of the contact phenomena. The research work in this thesis deals with three topics: classical rigid body impact analysis, compliant contact force modeling and non-colliding rigid body contact formulation, the three in parallel serving to fulfill the thesis objectives. In the classical rigid body impact analysis, we propose an integral formulation as an extension of the earlier work by Keller, with the goal of overcoming several deficiencies of Keller's formulation. On the topic of compliant contact force modeling, we investigate the accuracy of Hunt-Crossley type of nonlinear models and propose an energy-consistent model which is "exact" within the general assumptions of the Hunt-Crossley modeling approach. Then, an experimental study of the sphere-plate impact is conducted using two experimental set-ups for different impact speeds to assess the validity of the Hunt-Crossley modeling in both elastic and plastic impact categories. This study represents the first documented attempt at the validation of this model, and also produced a database of new impact measurements. Finally, a novel contact dynamics formulation is developed for non-colliding contact scenarios where two or more rigid bodies are in a continuous contact at multiple contact locations. The proposed formulation features a closed-form solution for the normal contact forces for general contact geometries and also allows loss of contact. Uniqueness and existence analyses are also conducted using the amenable mathematical structure provided by the formulation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72pb95w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c614f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Contact mechanics -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278x90c"><dcterms:title>X-ray intensity fluctuation spectroscopy of the ordering in Cu3Au</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Yongfang, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cu3Au is a classic model for the experimental investigation on the transitional process because of its very long relaxation time from the disordered to the ordered state. When Cu3Au is quenched from higher temperature above its critical temperature (383°C) to some temperature below its critical temperature, the small regions of ordered phase (domains) form in the background of disordered phase. As time evolves, large domains grow at the expense of small domains. X-ray intensity fluctuation spectroscopy (XIFS) is a technique using coherent X-rays to measure the fluctuations of the diffracted intensity (speckle patterns) from the sample. During the ordering process, the structure of the sample changes, so does the speckle pattern. In this thesis, we use XIFS to investigate the dynamic process of the order-disorder phase transition taking place in the sample Cu3Au. The sample is quenched from 420°C to three different lower temperatures 378°C, 370°C and 355°C. A CCD detector is used to record the (100) superlattice Bragg peak and the speckle pattern. We analyze the Bragg peak and summarize its properties. The universal scaling law is tested and is observed to be in good agreement with the theory. The average domain size (inverse of Bragg peak width) obeys the power law t1/2. This part is refereed to as one-time (incoherent) analysis in the thesis. Second, we calculate the two-time correlation functions, also called two-time (coherent) analysis. As expected, two-time correlation function also follows some universal scaling law. In the small time limit, a linear relationship is found between the correlation time T (width of two-time correlation function) and average time t¯ = (t 1 + t2)/2. In the large time limit, T∝t¯1/2. The more interesting and exciting results we obtain are that the correlation time has an unpredicted behavior for the first dozens of minutes and the coherent factor (peak height of two-time correlation function) has a dependence on time and on the wave vector. The possible explanations are proposed and discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xg46b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278x90c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Order-disorder in alloys.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gold-copper alloys.</dc:subject><dc:subject>X-ray spectroscopy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sh21b"><dcterms:title>The role of CBP/14-3-3 in the regulation of initiation of DNA replication in budding yeast /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yahyaoui, Wafaa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Over the past several decades, the S. cerevisiae replication system provided excellent tools to study the initiation of DNA replication, and has built basic models to understand this process in higher eukaryotes. Therefore, identification and characterization of budding yeast replication initiation proteins, and their associations with replication origins, have significantly advanced our knowledge of eukaryotic DNA replication. Taking advantage of this tool, I studied the role of the cruciform binding protein CBP/14-3-3 in the regulation of the initiation of DNA replication in the budding yeast. CBP/14-3-3 was previously identified as an origin binding protein, and both its cruciform and origin binding activities are cell cycle regulated. In this thesis, I investigated the two fundamental activities of 14-3-3 proteins involved in DNA replication, namely the cruciform binding activity and the regulation of initiation of DNA replication. First, I studied the effect of deleting the potential cruciform binding domain in human 14-3-3ε on the cruciform and origin binding activities. I found that 14-3-3ε protein, when expressed in yeast as the sole member of 14-3-3 protein family, was able to complement the bmh1- /bmh2- S. cerevisiae, conserved its cruciform binding activity, and associated with the yeast origins of replication ARS307 and ARS1. The data gave evidence for the universality of the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to replication origins. Deletion of the alpha5-helix in 14-3-3ε resulted in a decrease in the cruciform and the origin binding activities of the protein. Furthermore, the mutant cells had a reduced ability to maintain plasmid stability, suggesting a direct role of 14-3-3 proteins in the initiation of DNA replication. Next, I investigated the role of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of initiation of DNA replication. I demonstrated that the yeast 14-3-3 homologues, Bmh1 and Bmh2: (1) bind to chromatin and to ARS1 in a cell cycle dependent manner, the binding being maximal at GI phase; (2) associate in a complex with ORC and MCM proteins; and (3) are required for normal cell cycle progression, being essential for S phase entry. I also investigated the mechanism by which 14-3-3 proteins regulate the initiation of DNA replication and found that they are essential for the association of MCM proteins with and their maintenance onto chromatin during G1 phase. We showed also that 14-3-3 proteins require ORC for their association with the chromatin during G1 phase. In summary, I showed that 14-3-3 proteins are novel initiator proteins that play an integral role in the initiation of DNA replication by being essential for pre-RC assembly and maintenance during G1 phase, through binding to cruciform DNA forming at yeast replicators.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s389w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sh21b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA-Binding Proteins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA Replication -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f9645"><dcterms:title>Dynamic resource allocation in multiuser multicarrier fading environments</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Xu, Yang, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Interference among users results in the degradation of signal quality and leads to poor performance in multi-user interference systems such as DSL system, ad-hoc wireless network. Study of the interaction of interference among users in the network is crucial for achieving better system performance. Efficient utilization of available resources in an interference system has two major complementary approaches: interference cancellation and resource allocation. The principal objective of this thesis is to develop efficient resource allocation algorithms that can optimize joint perfounance of multiple users in multi-user multi-carrier interference channels. Such resource allocation problems in multi-user interference channels can be formulized as nonconvex optimization problems. The search for the optimal solution is very challenging for these problems: conventional local optimization techniques are only capable of finding local optimum; In addition, resource allocation problems encountered in practice generally are large-scale ones, as the number of users or the number of sub-carriers in the system is typically large. For instance, digital subscriber lines (DSL) system, which is employed as a motivating practical model in this dissertation, has thousands of sub-carriers and large number of lines residing in a binder that cause interference to each other. Designing distributed and centralized resource allocation strategies to achieve good optimality and complexity tradeoff for multi-user interference systems by exploiting the underlining problem structures is the main focus of this thesis. This thesis develops two dynamic resource allocation strategies, responding to different requirements that might arise in various practical scenarios of DSL environment: one is a low-complexity, quasi-distributed algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance with very little centralized coordination; the other is a centralized algorithm based on global difference of convex (d.c.) optimization that guarantees optimal performance with substantial complexity reduction. Our global d.c. approach reveals the hidden convexity of nonconvex optimization problems in interference systems, which were once thought of completely being devoid of any convexity structure. The d.c. structure provides a general framework for designing efficient global optimization algorithm for resource allocation in multi-user interference channel. In particular, a modified prismatic branch and bound (PBnB) is proposed to find global optimum efficiently and its global convergence is also established by analysis. Furthermore, motivated by the observation that the excessive transmission power penalty incurred by zero forcing (ZF) precoding scheme with user selection algorithm for MIMO Broadcast (BC) channels contributing to sum-rate capacity loss, we also explore joint power allocation and interference pre-cancellation (precoding) for wireless MIMO BC channels. A channel inversion regularization (CIR) strategy is proposed to replace ZF as the precoding scheme to alleviate the excessive transmission power penalty and we formulate the maximization of the sum-rate capacity with CIR precoding into d.c. structure and thereafter its global optimum can be achieved with PBnB algorithm. Moreover, we propose a local optimization method based on gradient projection (GP) to achieve near-optimal solution efficiently and we also conduct asymptotic analysis to show that the proposed CIR precoding scheme can achieve asymptotically optimum sum rate equal to that of dirty paper coding (DPC) strategy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j4580.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f9645</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>MIMO systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Digital subscriber lines.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jq32f"><dcterms:title>Characterizing and predicting ultrafine particle counts in Canadian homes, schools, and transportation environments : an exposure modeling study with implications in environmental epidemiology</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Occupational Health</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Weichenthal, Scott Andrew.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Airborne particulate matter has a negative effect on respiratory health in both children and adults, and the ultrafine fraction of particulate air pollution is of particular interest owing to its increased ability to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs. In this investigation, our objective was to characterize ultrafine particle (UFP) counts in homes, schools, and transportation environments and to develop models to predict such exposures. A number of important determinants of UFP exposures were identified including ambient temperature and wind speed for transportation environments, outdoor UFPs for classrooms, and electric oven use, cigarette smoking, indoor relative humidity, and volume for homes. In general, our findings suggest that classrooms and transportation environments may be more suitable for UFP exposure modeling than homes. However, large diesel vehicles and in-school UFP sources had a negative influence on model performance, and future studies should include factors such as traffic counts/characteristics, vehicle ventilation settings, and in-school UFP sources to improve the predictive performance of the models presented. Nevertheless, our findings are encouraging in that we demonstrate for the first time the possibility of obtaining UFP exposure estimates for homes, schools, and transportation environments using models based on ambient weather data and other readily available determinant information. As such, similar models may be useful in population-based studies interested in the potential health effects of UFP exposures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g852r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jq32f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Particulate Matter -- analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Particle Size.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weather.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air Pollution, Indoor -- analysis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225f715"><dcterms:title>Characterizaton of human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) gene expression in human adipocytes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wei, Yuhong, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Human growth hormone (hGH) is a key regulator of postnatal growth and metabolism, exerting its effects through a specific cell-surface receptor, hGHR. Eight hGHR mRNAs are produced by the hGHR gene due to transcribing from different 5' non-coding exons. Four (V2,V3,V5,V9) are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the others (V1,V4,V7,V8) are present only in normal postnatal liver, suggesting that different promoter usage is a mechanism for developmental and tissue-specific regulation of the hGHR gene. hGH influences adipose tissue development and function. By 5'RACE screening of a human adipocyte cDNA library, I determined that the V2 transcript is the predominant (~90%) hGHR mRNA expressed in fat cells. Although five novel mRNA variants (VA-VE) were isolated, they were demonstrated to be widely expressed minor hGHR transcripts, instead of adipocyte-specific. Using the human SGBS preadipocyte cell line, I showed that total hGHR mRNAs increase significantly during adipocyte differentiation, primarily due to increases in the V2 transcript, reaching a maximum with maturity. The predominance of the V2 variant in all cells examined to date led us to carry out an in-depth study of the V2 promoter. Two major transcriptional start sites were identified that were identical for SGBS preadipocytes, liver and kidney. Transient transfection analysis of the 5' flanking region of V2 confirmed its promoter activity in multiple human cell lines. Similar transcriptional profiles were observed in SGBS pre- and mature adipocytes, with much higher V2 promoter activity seen in mature adipocytes, suggesting that increases in adipocyte factor(s) play a role in V2 promoter regulation. The V2 proximal promoter is TATA-less, with several characteristics of a housekeeping gene promoter. Cis-elements for Ets1, CHOP and Hes1 were found in the proximal promoter and within the V2 exon. They exert either positive (Ets1, CHOP) or negative (Hes1) regulatory effects on V2 transcription when their respective transcription factors are over-expressed, via direct binding (Ets1, Hes1) or interaction with other proteins (CHOP). These sites likely regulate hGHR expression in response to extra-cellular (developmental, growth, stress) signals. Thus, transcriptional regulation of hGHR V2 in human cells, including adipocytes, is the result of a complex interplay by multiple factors, to ensure sufficient local production of hGHR throughout life.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kf263.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f715</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>5' Untranslated Regions -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liver -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Expression Profiling -- methods.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adipocytes -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kidney -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712mb48c"><dcterms:title>Sphere-decoding for underdetermined integer least-square communications problems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Ping, 1978 Nov. 26-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Underdetermined detection problems can arise in communications, e.g., multi-user detection for overloaded CDMA-based systems, MIMO systems with the number of receive antennas smaller than that of transmit antennas. They can be formulated as underdetermined integer least-square (ILS) problems, and many conventional suboptimal detection schemes lead to poor performance, whilst standard sphere-decoding (SD) algorithms, which can achieve optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with low complexity for full-column-rank ILS systems, cannot be directly applied. The principal objective of this dissertation is to develop efficient detection algorithms based on SD for the underdetermined detection problems, which can approach the optimal performance. Most of Generalized SD (GSD) algorithms, recently proposed to solve undetermined ILS problems, have to transform an M-QAM constellation (with M&gt;4) into multiple QPSKs, and hence result in unfavorably enlarged problem size and increased complexity. In contrast, this dissertation proposes a GSD algorithm (called lambda-GSD) by transforming the underdetermined system into a full-column-rank one and then utilizing SD algorithm on the transformed problem, which can circumvent the problematic size increase for high QAMs. As a result, the proposed lambda-GSD algorithm keeps the original problem size for all modulation constellations and the efficiency is considerably improved for M-QAM (with M&gt;4). We perform union-bound performance analysis and derive the criterion to choose the design parameter lambda. The performance analysis shows that lambda-GSD can provide the exact optimum ML performance for constant-modulus constellations and an ML-approaching performance for non-constant-modulus constellations by judiciously choosing lambda. Theoretical complexity study is an important and challenging issue for an algorithm. By exploiting the underlying transformed matrix structure, we derive closed-form formulas to approximate the expected complexity of lambda-GSD for various modulation types. A lower bound on the expected complexity exponent is also analytically established. The consistency between the theoretical and simulation results on the number of searching FLOPS indicates that the analytical complexity formulas can capture the key complexity characteristics of the proposed lambda-GSD algorithm and can also serve as references for other GSD algorithms. To speed up the searching, we consider two following aspects. One is to propose an improved lambda-GSD version that alleviates the possible ill-conditioned transformed structure by a systematic method to choose lambda. The other is to develop efficient radius setting strategies. A linear-programming approach is used to calculate the initial radius for hard-decision SD and GSD; and a radius updating strategy combined with a simple initial radius setting is developed for soft-output list-sphere-decoding (LSD) and list-generalized-sphere-decoding (LGSD) algorithms, which reduces greatly the searching complexity as compared to the fixed radius setting strategy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30px40m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mb48c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Signal processing -- Digital techniques.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Code division multiple access.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Estimation theory -- Data processing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coding theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Least squares -- Data processing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>MIMO systems.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988p56p"><dcterms:title>Spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment of coral reef fishes to the west coast of Barbados (West Indies) : an approach using a novel standard unit of settlement habitat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vallès Rodriguez, Henri.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is in a manuscript-based format and consists of a collection of papers of which I am first author.

DG functions to maintain cell polarity via interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoplasmic proteins. DG is expressed from a single gene encoding a pro-peptide cleaved into two distinct subunits: the ligand-binding alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and the transmembrane beta-dystroglycan (beta-DG). Both subunits associate non-covalently and form the core of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). The DAPC stabilizes membrane proteins and its function is necessary for cell polarity and survival. The DG complex is thought to function as a classical single-pass transmembrane receptor where ligands binding to alpha-DG transduce extracellular cues to beta-DG and across the plasma membrane to intracellular partners. Nonetheless, the molecular structure and protein interactions of the two DG subunits suggest independent functions in coordinating stabilization of cell surface proteins. I studied the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the surface of cultured myotubes as a model for specialized organization of muscle membrane proteins involving DG function. To assess the contribution of the extracellular and intracellular interactions of alpha- and beta-DG, I have used adenoviruses to express full-length and deletion mutants of DG in DG -/- myotubes. I showed that alpha-DG is properly glycosylated and targeted to the myotube surface in absence of 13-DG. Extracellular interactions of DG modulate the area and the density of agrin-induced AChR aggregates and are responsible for targeting laminin to these aggregates. I showed that extracellular interactions of alpha-DG are sufficient to mediate laminin-induced AChR aggregation and that this requires Src-family kinases, protein kinase A, and phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways. Thus, the association of alpha- and beta-DG in skeletal muscle coordinate independent roles in signaling, indicating that DG functions as a non-classical receptor. Furthermore, I suggest that alpha-DG functions in cis via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptors. The potential for cis interactions within the ECM allows for recruitment of multiple transmembrane pathways, and this mechanism may be utilized by the DG complex in its functions for muscle cell survival, synapse formation and ECM assembly. In addition, I showed that DG regulates endocytosis via interaction with dynamin, and DG colocalizes with dynamin in cortactin-rich membrane ruffles in fibroblasts. Finally, laminin-DG interactions are involved in the formation of complex AChR aggregates on the surface of myotubes possibly via interaction and regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827g32t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b955f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dystroglycans.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Myoneural junction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dystrophin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neuromuscular Junction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892f64j"><dcterms:title>A probabilistic model to learn, detect, localize and classify patterns in arbitrary images /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Toews, Matthew.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a new, probabilistic model for describing image patterns arising from classes of visually similar objects, such as faces or brains. The model describes patterns in terms of a high level geometrical structure referred to as an object class invariant (OCI), which is invariant to nuisance parameters arising from the imaging process. The OCI itself is not directly observed from images, but can be inferred via a probabilistic model based on generic, spatially localized image features. The OCI model can be learned from a large set of natural images containing pattern instances with minimal manual supervision, in the presence of background clutter, illumination changes, partial pattern occlusion, multi-modal intra-pattern variation (e.g. faces with or without sunglasses), geometrical deformations (i.e. translations, rotations and magnifications) and viewpoint changes. In addition, it can be automatically fit to new images in similar difficult imaging conditions. Due to the general nature of the OCI model, it has a wide range of possible applications, and its importance is demonstrated in the research fields of computer vision and medical image analysis. In computer vision, the OCI model results in the first viewpoint-invariant system for detecting, localizing and classifying object instances in terms of visual traits. Experimentation on face and motorcycle imagery demonstrates the OCI model can be used to learn, detect and localize general 3D object classes in natural imagery acquired from arbitrary viewpoints. Viewpoint-invariant OCI detection performance is shown to be superior to that of the multi-view formulation which models viewpoint information explicitly. A data-driven algorithm demonstrates the existence of stable OCIs, which can potentially be identified in a fully automatic fashion. The first results in the literature are established for sex classification of face images from arbitrary viewpoints and in the presence of occlusion. In medical image analysis, the OCI model results in the first parts-based anatomical model of the human brain, where subject images of a population are described in terms of a collage of conditionally independent local features or 'parts'. The model is the first to explicitly address the situation where one-to-one correspondence between different subjects does not exist due to natural inter-subject variability. Experimentation modeling the human brain in MR image slices demonstrates that the OCI model is capable of robustly identifying and quantifying anatomical structures in terms of their geometry, appearance, occurrence frequency and relationship to traits such as sex in a population, in cases where other models cannot cope.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x4852.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892f64j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Image processing -- Digital techniques -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pattern recognition systems -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optical pattern recognition -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Image analysis -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s6057"><dcterms:title>Analyzing, modeling, and improving the performance of overlay networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thommes, Richard Winfried.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis consider factors impacting the performance of certain overlay networks. We present models and make a number of novel contributions in the form of proposed improvements. Congestion of the underlying network affects any overlay network. Congestion control schemes rely on quick and accurate aggregation of link shadow prices calculated by individual routers. We present a deterministic packet marking algorithm which allows routers to encode these prices in the ECN field of the IP packets traversing the link, and allows the receiver to estimate the total path price. We show, through simulation, that the performance of our algorithm exceeds that of a previously proposed random marking scheme in a number of scenarios, particularly when the prices are time-varying. The class of Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are extremely popular for file-sharing. Two phenomena have emerged which reduce the efficacy of P2P networks. One is pollution: the presence of corrupt or mislabeled files. The other is the presence of viruses specifically designed to spread over P2P networks. Once downloaded and executed, these viruses typically produce multiple copies of themselves in order to increase their proliferation in the network. We present models based on the field of epidemiology to examine the propagation of viruses and polluted files in the networks. A number of simulations indicate the effect various model parameters have on the extent to which pollution/viruses become prevalent in the network. We also consider the effect of object reputation schemes designed to lessen the impact of these problems, and determine their effectiveness under various conditions. BitTorrent (BT) is an especially efficient and popular P2P protocol. It divides files into small segments, thus enabling peers to upload to others before they have completed downloading the entire file. The most significant issue with BT is a potential lack of fairness, meaning peers may upload much more data than they download. To address this issue, we present three modifications to the protocol intended to increase fairness. We present a simplified model of BT and conduct simulations which illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed modifications.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591c70p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s6057</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Peer-to-peer architecture (Computer networks)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer viruses.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Downloading of data.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354j82f"><dcterms:title>Genome-wide identification of target genes to vitamin D and analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic properties</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tavera Mendoza, Luz Elisa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), also know as cholecalciferol, is still best known as a regulator of calcium homeostasis. However more recent studies have revealed the pleiotropic actions of 1,25D 3, including immune and nervous system modulation, and cellular proliferation and differentiation. Epidemiological and model studies have revealed the anticancer properties of 1,25D3, which modulates gene transcription through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). This dissertation is composed of four different studies that focus on the molecular and genetic events that underlie the anticancer properties of 1,25D3. Our first set of experiments was a genome-wide exploration of cognate 1,25D3 response elements (VDREs), described as direct or everted repeats of PuG(G/T)TCA motifs separated by 3 or 6 bp at the promoters of 1,25D3 target genes that are recognized by the VDR. Our study identified over 3000 conserved VDREs and 158 human elements regulated in oral cancer cells. Expanding on this study, we then provided both molecular and genomic evidence that 1,25D3 and retinoic acid, another cancer preventive agent, can signal through a newly characterized common response element. This response element is an everted repeat of the consensus PuG(G/T)TCA motif separated by 8 bp (ER8). We characterized the ER8 element on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19ink4d gene and provided evidence that induction of this gene through the ER8 element by either ligand mediates cell cycle arrest and prevents autophagy by 1,25D3. Furthermore, well-differentiated squamous carcinoma cells (SCC) are sensitive to 1,25D3, whereas poorly differentiated SCC cells are partially resistant. This brought about the investigation of the effects of 1,25D3 combined with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TSA on 1,25D3-resistant SCC4 oral cancer cells. We found that SCC4 cells were highly sensitive to this combination, which induced G 2/M arrest and mitotic catastrophe. Finally, since single compound therapy is more advantageous from the pharmacotherapeutic point of view than multiple compound therapy, we created triciferol, a hybrid molecule which combines 1,25D3 agonism and HDAC inhibition. Triciferol behaves like both 1,25D3 and TSA as it activates 1,25D3 target genes with similar potency to 1,25D3, acetylates histones and induces G 2/M arrest and both mitotic catastrophe and autophagy in cancer cells. The work presented in this dissertation contains multiple original contributions to the 1,25D3 field as it provides: (i) insights on the direct target genes underlying the physiological actions of 1,25D3; (ii) evidence for cross-talk between 1,25D3 and RA, while uncovering the role of p194D in cell survival; (iii) support for the notion of 1,25D 3 insufficiency in the population may reduce the efficacy of HDACi chemotherapy; and a demonstration of the feasibility of combining HDAC inhibition with VDR agonism in 1,25D3 analogues to enhance their therapeutic potential.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mn483.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354j82f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell -- drug therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Calcitriol -- agonists.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Histone Deacetylases -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calcitriol -- analogs &amp; derivatives.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mouth Neoplasms -- drug therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cholecalciferol -- therapeutic use.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n2042673"><dcterms:title>The dynamics of two-dimensional cantilevered flexible plates in axial flow and a new energy-harvesting concept /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tang, Liaosha, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis studies the dynamics of two-dimensional cantilevered flexible plates subjected to axial flow and proposes a new energy-harvesting concept, the flutter-mill, utilizing the flutter motions to generate electrical power. The nonlinear model of the cantilevered flexible plate is developed using the inextensibility assumption. The panel method, in particular the unsteady lumped vortex model associated with a dynamic vortical wake, is used for calculating the aero/hydro-dynamic loads acting on the plate. The investigation of the dynamics of this system is conducted systematically in the multiparameter space involved, in order to give a comprehensive picture of the global dynamics of the system. The influence of various factors on the dynamics of the system are discussed, including the length of the upstream rigid segment, the material damping and the viscous drag. Moreover, the dynamics of the system in a variety of modified configurations, i.e., with the gravitational force taken into account, with parallel solid walls, an additional spring support, an additional concentrated mass, an oscillating angle of incidence in the undisturbed flow, and two identical parallel plates, is also studied. The energy transfer between the cantilevered flexible plate and the surrounding fluid flow is examined. Based on the analysis of energy transfer, the concept of a flutter-mill, which utilizes the self-induced vibrations of a cantilevered flexible plate in axial flow to generate electrical power is proposed. The performance of this device is preliminarily evaluated and compared to other wind-energy converters. Design considerations of the flutter-mill are summarized in the light of the dynamics of the system, in both the basic configuration and various modified configurations. Finally, experiments with cantilevered flexible plates in axial flow are conducted in a vertical-type water tunnel. The experimental observations are compared with the simulation results based on the present theory.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c183c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n2042673</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Flutter (Aerodynamics) -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plates (Engineering) -- Aerodynamics -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wind energy conversion systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonlinear oscillations -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g3748"><dcterms:title>Microbial diversity and activity in permafrost and ground ice from the Canadian High Arctic</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Steven, Blaire.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have developed methods to obtain pristine permafrost/ground ice samples from the Canadian high Arctic and demonstrated that these methods are suitable for both culture-dependent and culture-independent microbiological analyses. In an initial study, the culturable microbial community in a 9 m deep permafrost sample was dominated by spore-forming genera of Bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes while the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were also represented. Phenotypic characterization of the isolates indicated a predominantly psychrotolerant and halotolerant microbial community. A culture-independent survey of the microbial diversity in this sample revealed higher diversity, as Bacteria from 6 phyla (Actinobacteria, CFB, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomyces , and Proteobacteria) and both of the major Archaea phyla (Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota ) were identified. Differences in the abundance, diversity, and activity of the microbial communities in distinct horizons of a permafrost/ground ice core were investigated using a combination of culture-independent methods, aerobic plate counts and a novel method for detecting microbial activity at subzero temperatures, developed during this thesis. The active layer, permafrost table, and permafrost horizons showed similar microbial abundance and diversity. The microbial community in ground ice was less abundant and diverse. The culturable microbial community from the active layer was composed of Bacteria related to the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, CFB, and Firmicutes while all of the isolates from the permafrost were related to spore-forming Firmicutes. No viable cells were recovered from the ground ice. Microbial activity was detected in all of the Eur3 horizons, including low levels of activity at near ambient subzero permafrost temperatures. Many of the isolates from the permafrost had low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to characterized species. A polyphasic characterization of one of these potentially unique isolates was undertaken to better define its taxonomy. The isolate (Eur1 9.5) was differentiated from related species based on its morphology, fatty acid profile and growth characteristics and represents the type species of a new genus, namely Tumebacillus permanentifrigoris . This work demonstrates that Canadian high Arctic permafrost is a unique environment that harbors a diverse microbial community with members capable of activity at near in situ temperatures. In comparison, ground ice is a relatively inhospitable environment and supports low microbial abundance, diversity and activity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fc879.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g3748</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Permafrost -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacteria -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Archaebacteria -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ice cores -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microbial populations -- Nunavut -- Ellesmere Island.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw3763b474"><dcterms:title>Functional characterization of zinc cluster transcriptional regulators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Soontorngun, Nitnipa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Zinc cluster proteins form a major class of fungal-specific transcriptional regulators in Saccharmyces cerevisiae. They are characterized by a well-conserved zinc cluster motif essential for DNA recognition. These regulators are implicated in transcriptional control of genes involved in various cellular processes such in sugar metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, gluconeogenesis, ergosterol biosynthesis and pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR)/stress response. A classic example of zinc cluster protein is Gal4, a regulator of galactose catabolism. However, a number of zinc cluster genes encode putative regulators with unknown function. A phenotypic analysis of zinc cluster deletion strains has implicated them in certain pathways. Rds2 was identified as a regulator of PDR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as it confers resistance to an antifungal agent. A genomewide location approach (ChIP-chip) was employed to assign roles for Rds2. Results showed that Rds2 plays a major role in glucose metabolism. It functions as an activator and a repressor of gluconeogenic genes during the diauxic shift. It also mediates sensitivity to the antifungal drug azoles by regulating the expression of genes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Its ortholog in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, Cwt1, is also involved in glucose metabolism but not in PDR. Functional relationship among known PDR regulators in S. cerevisiae was uncovered in a phenotypic analysis of double deletion of zinc cluster genes. Altogether, this study provides new insight regarding the roles of zinc cluster regulators in transcriptional control of genes involved in multiple physiological process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913t42p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763b474</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc Fingers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Candida albicans -- drug effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drug Resistance, Fungal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Azoles -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- drug effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transcription Factors -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526g78w"><dcterms:title>Neurovascular degeneration and angiogenic regeneration in hyperoxia-exposed premature subjects</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sirinyan, Mirna.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neonates that survive very preterm birth have a high prevalence of cognitive impairment in later life. A common factor detected in premature infants is their postnatal exposure to high oxygen tension relative to that in utero. Hyperoxia is known to elicit injury to premature lung and retina. However, the potential role of exposure of the developing brain to elevated O2 levels has been relatively overlooked. We hypothesized that cerebral damage may in part be due to hyperoxia-mediated microvascular degeneration; therefore, the central aim of this work was to elucidate how hyperoxia affects the newborn cerebral vasculature and impacts brain function. Studies on the exposure of pups to elevated O2 concentrations demonstrate that hyperoxia leads to cerebral microvascular degeneration, diminished brain mass and cerebral functional deficits. The mechanisms implicated in hyperoxia-mediated deleterious effects include an upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and a downregulation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). The imbalance in nitric oxide (NO) production and antioxidant defences favours the formation of nitrating agents in the microvessels, and decreased expression of NF-kappaB and the dependent VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Following the cerebral microvascular obliteration, we observed a process of reparative angiogenesis which begins in areas of insult; thus, we used the retina as a model to investigate potential novel mediators implicated in this regenerative neovascularization process. We demonstrated a novel concept whereby the Krebs cycle intermediate succinate governs retinal angiogenesis during post-ischemic revascularization of the developing subject by acting through its specific cognate GPCR, GPR91. Collectively, the data suggest that early severe microvessel loss in response to hyperoxia is an important contributing factor to decreased brain function. Furthermore, novel data implicate succinate in exerting angiogenesis by mediating its effects through GPR91, unveiling novel properties for this Krebs cycle metabolite, consistent with linking tissue oxygenation to vascularity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn15j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526g78w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Animals, Newborn.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Retinal Degeneration -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrates -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Retinal Vessels -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxygen -- adverse effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microcirculation -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain -- pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94ht262"><dcterms:title>Physical parameters of very small diameter 10 MV x-ray beams for linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sham, Edwin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Physical aspects of very small diameter X-ray beams used for a linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery are presented in this thesis. A 10 MV linac was used as the radiation source. Very small 10 MV photon fields with diameters of 1.5 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm are produced by special collimators attached to the treatment head of the linac. The radiation beam data were measured with a small field diode detector as well as radiographic and radiochromic films. Measured beam parameters were compared with the same parameters calculated with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. For very small photon fields with diameters on the order of the focal spot size, MC calculations show that both the percentage depth dose (PDD) distributions and dose profiles are sensitive to the focal spot size. A simple sliding slit technique was developed to measure the focal spot size and shape for accurate MC simulations of very small diameter beams. The measured focal spot of the 10 MV linac is elliptical in shape and fitted by a Gaussian distribution with full-widths-at-half-maximum (FWHMs) of 2.05 mm and 1.34 mm in the principal axes of the ellipse. A Gaussian circle equivalent in area to the experimentally determined focal spot ellipse was used in MC simulations. The resulting PDD and beam profile calculations are in good agreement with the measurements. Dynamic radiosurgery with very small diameter photon beams was carried out using the 10 MV linac. Radiosurgical isodose distributions were measured with radiographic films in a spherical head phantom and calculated with the MC technique. A good agreement between the measured and MC-calculated isodose distributions for very small diameter fields is achieved. The displacement of the center of the measured isodose distributions relative to the laser-defined isocenter was on the order of 0.7 mm. All these results show the potential of linac-based radiosurgery with very small diameter photon beams for clinical use.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2677030b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht262</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Photons -- therapeutic use.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radiosurgery -- methods.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445ch812"><dcterms:title>p-adic deformation of Shintani cycles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shahabi, Shahab.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this thesis is to generalize to elliptic curves a classical formula of Hecke. This is chiefly achieved through studying p-adic deformation of certain Shintani cycles attached to a real quadratic field K and an elliptic curve E/Q of conductor N. Assume that all the prime divisors of N are split in K. Also suppose that E has multiplicative reduction at a prime p, and denote by fE the newform attached to E via Shimura-Taniyama, and finally fix a quadratic unramified character G of Gal(K¯/K). We (1) construct a p-adic analytic function Lp (E/K, G ; kappa) which interpolates a G -twisted sum of Shintani Cycles associated to the weight-k -specializations of a Hida family hE arising from Hida's theory applied to fE; (2) give a factorization of Lp (E/K, G ; kappa)2 into the product of two Mazur-Kitagawa p-adic L-functions. We will prove that Lp (E/K, G ; kappa) vanishes at the point kappa = 2 to order at least two, provided further that E/Q has at least two primes of multiplicative reduction. Our main result expresses L''p (E/K, G ; 2), up to a non-zero rational fudge factor, as the product of the formal group logarithms of two global points on E defined over the narrow Hilbert class-field of K; (3) show finally, in the spirit of Gross and Zagier, that the two points just alluded to are both of infinite order if and only if the complex L-function L(E/K, G ; s) vanishes to order exactly two at the central point s = 1.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430823n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445ch812</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>p-adic analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>L-functions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33s1167"><dcterms:title>Self-assembled monolayers : characterization and application to microcantilever sensors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Seivewright, Brian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The assessment of silicon nitride microcantilevers as solution phase sensors and the understanding of the forces at play within these are the principal focus of this thesis. Microcantilevers with different self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on their top and bottom surfaces were prepared using metal sputtering and thermal evaporation. These dual-coated microcantilevers were shown to be more stable to thermal fluctuations than single-sided microcantilevers. Control of the bottom-side surface chemistry of the microcantilevers is shown to be possible with alkylthiolate SAMs. A microcantilever-based liquid cell and a new microcantilever structure were designed, implemented, and characterized. This microcantilever system was assessed as a sensor in solution and was used to investigate the differential surface stress resulting from chemical and physical stimuli. The stability and reproducibility of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid SAMs were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry on polycrystalline gold electrodes. The observed voltammetric peak magnitude and position were modeled by accounting for the kinetics of dissociation of the carboxylic acid groups. This surface reaction was then extensively studied in the microcantilever system. Microcantilevers functionalized with acid-terminated SAMs on one surface and alkyl-terminated SAMs on the other surface are responsive to pH changes. Differential surface stress vs. pH measurements allow for the determination of the surface pK1/2 of acid-terminated SAMs. The pK1/2 of surface-bound acid moieties is shown to be ca. 2 pH units higher than the equivalent solution-phase carboxylic acid. The forces responsible for the observed differential surface stress are evaluated. Although functionalized microcantilevers do respond to pH changes, there remain problems with signal reproducibility and hysteresis. The prospects for development of the microcantilever system into a laboratory tool are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301498r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s1167</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Monomolecular films.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Silicon nitride.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electrochemical sensors.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t2902"><dcterms:title>Microwave transmission-line-based chirped electromagnetic bandgap structures</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schwartz, Joshua D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the concepts of chromatic dispersion and chirp are far from new in the world of wireless microwave communication, their application has always been constrained by the limited bandwidths, insertion losses and integration issues of dispersive devices. Often, a microwave designer seeking to incorporate chirping would fall back on surface-acoustic-wave structures, which are very lossy and do not easily penetrate into the GHz frequency-band, or else photonics-based solutions (e.g. chirped fiber Bragg gratings), which provide high bandwidths but incur integration and cost issues. This is in part due to the perceived lack of a convenient dispersive structure in electronics that is sufficiently low-loss and broadband in the GHz frequency range. Such a structure has in fact been recently demonstrated: it is a chirped electromagnetic bandgap (CEBG), and our work has explored its potential in a number of ultra-wideband sub-systems designed to perform a variety of signal processing tasks. Of particular interest is the close-fitting synergy between the operational frequencies of this new structure and the rapidly emerging ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology, which strives to handle signals with fractional bandwidths that can exceed 100%---a task for which CEBGs are well-suited. This thesis details the first demonstrations of several practical microwave sub-systems made possible by employing dispersive CEBG structures implemented in transmission-line technologies at a bare minimum of cost and complexity. Many of these demonstrations challenge the assumption that transduction to the optical or acoustic domain is required in order to perform dispersion-enabled tasks on very broadband electrical signals. Among the first-time demonstrations explored in the course of this thesis are: (1) passive, real-time Fourier transformations using CEBG structures, enabling time-domain measurement and processing based on the frequency content of signals; (2) UWB tunable time-delay systems, capable of voltage-controlled, continuously-adjustable nanosecond-scale delays; (3) temporal imaging systems, for which we demonstrate a 5X time-magnification system for distortionless bandwidth-conversion; and (4) multi-frequency resonators designed to pass a number of resonant channels in a very broad stopband. Each demonstrated system represents a simple, fully-electronic solution to challenges facing the microwave community in subjects as diverse as analog-to-digital conversion, UWB communication, and arbitrary waveform generation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289n54j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t2902</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Strip transmission lines.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Photonic crystals.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r4691"><dcterms:title>fMRI studies of Broca's area in sentence comprehension</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Santi, Andrea.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Broca's Area (ie, Brodmann Areas (BA) 44 and 45) has been associated with syntactic comprehension since the 1970s. In particular, aphasia and neuroimaging studies have shown that Broca's area distinguishes between sentences with subject extraction (ie, The horse that &amp;squf; is kicking the bear is brown) compared to object extraction (ie, The horse that the bear is kicking &amp;squf; is brown). The extracted argument is referred to as a filler and the position from which it is extracted is referred to as a gap and the relationship between them as a filler-gap dependency. Based on these results, functional accounts of Broca's area in sentence comprehension have been formulated that range from verbal Working Memory (WM) to General-Syntactic to Specific-Syntactic. Predictions of these three types of accounts were tested across 4 fMRI studies. Study I contrasted long-distance argument extraction to another syntactic dependency---Reflexive Binding---to see if there was activation overlap in Broca's area for the two dependencies in accordance with a general WM (verbal or syntactic) account. Study II presented a methodological improvement on Study I by parametrically varying the distance of the dependent elements in both dependencies. The results from Study I and II indicate that Broca's area is sensitive to WM demands in sentences with extraction but not those with Reflexive Binding. Study III investigated fMRI adaptation to the two syntactic complexity factors---extraction type (object vs subject) and relative clause position (center-embedded vs right-branching). While anterior Broca's area (BA 45) adapted to extraction type only, posterior Broca's area (BA 44) adapted to both complexity factors. Finally, Study IV used parasitic gap constructions with their pronoun-containing alternative to investigate whether Broca's area is sensitive to gap-filling in addition to filler-to-gap distance. There was no evidence that Broca's area is sensitive to gap-filling in addition to filler-to-gap distance. Collectively, the results indicate that anterior aspects of Broca's area are specific to filler-gap dependencies and particularly to the filler-to-gap distance (ie, storage processes for the filler), whereas posterior aspects of Broca's area are more generally engaged in syntactic processing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60d1162.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r4691</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Auditory Perception.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Linguistics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psycholinguistics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Frontal Lobe -- physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bq16k"><dcterms:title>The role of leptin as a neuroimmune mediator of inflammation /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sachot, Christelle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent discoveries have demonstrated that actions of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin are not limited to its role as a regulator of energy balance and that it affects other biological systems including the immune system. This was based on observations showing that several inflammatory stimuli, such as the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of the immune mediators cytokines, also triggers leptin release in the periphery. Importantly, some of the newly discovered actions of leptin such as its interaction with cytokines and its pyrogenic property suggested that this hormone could be acting as a neuroimmune signal of systemic infection and inflammation; yet this role remained to be demonstrated. In a first series of experiments, we have shown that neutralization of circulating endogenous leptin using a leptin antiserum (LAS) significantly attenuated LPS-induced fever, reduction of appetite and hypothalamic Interleukin (IL)-1beta mRNA expression in rats, all of which constitute part of the host's response to infection. Some of the actions of leptin closely resembled those mediated by IL-6, which is widely considered as the main circulating pyrogen. Our observations suggest that unlike IL-1beta, there are no direct functional links between leptin and IL-6 and probably that both act in parallel to mediate the LPS-induced "sickness-like" responses. Another interesting aspect that leptin shares with cytokines is its capacity to relay a peripheral signal through the activation of neural afferents. However, we have shown by using vagotomy surgery that despite published data in support of this notion, the vagus nerve does not constitute a major route for mediating the regulatory effect of leptin on daily food intake and body weight. A fundamental finding from these studies indicated that the kinetics of leptin induction in the circulation by LPS did not correlate with its functional role in mediating LPS induced fever and anorexia. These results suggested that an alternative source/sight of action of leptin is involved. We hypothesised that the most likely possibility was white adipose tissue (WAT), which presented a target for LPS actions and an important source of cytokines. Our results suggest that in this tissue, leptin could be acting in a paracrine manner to modulate cytokine release into the circulation. Collectively, the findings from this thesis unequivocally demonstrate a role for leptin as a neuroimmune mediator in inflammation, which includes significant interactions with cytokines both at the level of the brain and the periphery where WAT appears to play a significant role.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bj48n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bq16k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Inflammation -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipopolysaccharides -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leptin -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain -- immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
