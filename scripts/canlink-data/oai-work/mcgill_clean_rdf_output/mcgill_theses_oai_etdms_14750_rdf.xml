The oldest rocks are part of a volcanic- sedimentary assemblage which occurs in the southwest along a N.60o- E.-trending belt. The volcanics, consisting of andesite, dacite, hornblende rock, rhyolite, quartz-feldspar porphyry, tuff and agglomerate, contain interlayered lenses of greywacke, iron formation and siltstone. The hornblende rock represents, in most places, the coarsergrained portions of thick lava flows, but it may in some instances be of magmatic origin. The volcanic-sedimentary rock sequence is isoclinally folded along east-west, or nearly so, axes, and it dips steeply to the south. The volcanics are altered and somewhat recrystallized, and the mineral assemblage is that of the lower amphibolite facies and, in places, that of the upper greenschist facies.

It is partly the purpose of this thesis to find under what limitations this model will result from a quantum - mechanical calculation that includes band structure. Besides this, the conditions under which a quantum-mechanical electron-gas model produces the right wavevector dependence of the dielectric constant are found.

Despite this large outpouring of literature, much of it polemical, and intended mainly to denigrate, or to exalt, Mary, important aspects and persons of the period have been neglected. The sixteenth century was an important turning point in European history. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reid, W.

For those who are by nature combative Snow--a former physicist of brilliance, as well as a stern reviewer of fiction, popular novelist and active politician--has provided some of life's more tolerable moments. Snow has outraged critics with his opinions on the modern novel. He has outraged literary historians and assorted critics with his opinions on the Industrial Revolution, the polarization of the literary and scientitic cultures, and the desirable course of present day education. He continues to delight and outrage critics with his novels. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLennan, H.

An interview was conducted with eacb mother to elicit underlying attitudes to her child and to establiah her basic cultural value orientations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935638r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514np80d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work. </dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zm191"><dcterms:title>The Deweras Formation south of the Umfuli River, Rhodesia.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1965</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bliss, Neil Welbourne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Deweras Formation between the Umfuli and Umniati Rivers consists of an upper series of arkoses and shales, (Arenaceous Series), a middle sequence of tholeiitic lavas, (Volcanic Series), and a lower discontinuous series of quartzite and conglomerate, (Basal Sedimentary Series).
