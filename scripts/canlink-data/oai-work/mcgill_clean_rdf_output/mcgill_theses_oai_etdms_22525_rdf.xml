First, the intramolecular electrophilic cyclisation of substituted allylsilanes, vinylsilanes and enol ethers was attempted. Reactions with the allylsilane moiety indeed gave the desired ring system, whereas the vinylsilanes failed to give any cyclisation product. In order to easily introduce oxygen functionalities in the rings, enol ether cyclisations were also attempted but did not produce the expected bicyclic systems. Secondly, the intramolecular nucleophilic cyclisation of free amines bearing suitable leaving groups was attempted, providing an easy method for the formation of the indolizidine system, with an interesting entry into the synthesis of biologically active polyhydroxylated alkaloids Swainsonine and Castanospermine. The synthesis of these two natural compounds, as well as some of their analogues, using the successful nucleophilic methodology was attempted. Finally, the regioselective and stereoselective introduction of hydroxyl groups into the pyrrolidine ring system was studied in order to prepare mono- and di-hydroxylated pyrrolidines for the synthesis of the aforementioned natural products.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st44v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc84c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j646c"><dcterms:title>Characterization of the NERNLP family of DNA regulatory proteins</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Autexier, Chantal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Proteins of the Ner/Nlp family have been characterized in order to identify the evolutionarily conserved protein domains important to their structure and function. The homologous DNA-bonding Ner proteins of closely related temperate coliphages Mu and D108 regulate the transcription and transposition of the phage genomes by binding to nonhomologous DNA operators. In order to precisely define the DNA-binding domains of Mu and D108 Ner, recombinant Mu and D108 ner genes were constructed and the DNA-binding and pseudoimmunity properties of the recombinant proteins were examined. D3112 is a Mu-like transposable bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which was proposed to encode a ner-like gene termed cip. In order to determine if cip is equivalent to ner, the D3112 left end was sequenced. Six possible open reading frames (ORFs) for Cip were identified, yet none were found to be biochemically homologous to Ner. However, an E. coli gene (nlp) which encodes a Ner-like protein (Nlp) has recently been identified. This gene product, when overexpressed in a cya crp*l strain, stimulates expression of the mal operon. We have demonstrated that nlp is not essential for E. coli viability and stability. The nlp gene is transcribed in E. coli and sequences homologous to nlp have been identified in the Enterobacteriaceae, but not in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies indicate that Nlp, like its Ner counterparts, may play an important regulatory role and that these functions may be mediated by conserved protein structures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128b719.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j646c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj79g"><dcterms:title>Cumulative effects in auditory stream segregation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rogers, Wendy Laurel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nine experiments were done to test three theories of auditory stream segregation and to investigate some conditions under which segregated tones re-integrate.

The Test Sequence always had tones that alternated rhythmically between two frequencies. Rhythm and total duration of Induction Sequence tones were varied in the first two studies. Similarity of Induction and Test Sequences aided segregation whereas rhythmic predictability and longer tone durations in the Induction Sequence did not. Frequency alternation during the Induction Sequence was not necessary to induce segregation in the Test Sequence. The effects of sudden and gradual changes in lateralization, spatial location and sound level were investigated also. The data suggest that explaining segregation by peripheral processes is inadequate and that, once a distinct percept emerges from an auditory scene, properties derived from the percept (particularly changes) are fed back to control the ongoing analysis of that scene. A neural adaptation to stimuli with constant properties may form part of this analysis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430556k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj79g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auditory perception.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychoacoustics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jc19n"><dcterms:title>A numerical method for confined unsteady flows related to fluid-structure interactions /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bélanger, François.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis elaborates three aspects in the field of flow-induced vibrations associated with annular geometries. A method to find the unsteady fluid forces on a cylinder oscillating in annular turbulent flow is developed by considering the superposition of the turbulent fluctuating quantities on potential flow. The theory is compared with experiments. Then, the unsteady fluid forces acting on the vibrating cylinder walls of non-uniform annular configurations are computed by a method which performs the accurate time integration of the Navier-Stokes equations. It is the extension for unsteady flows of the method of artificial compressibility used for steady flows. A time-discretization of the momentum equation using a three-point-backward implicit scheme is introduced, and the addition of pseudo-time derivative terms to the semi-discretized equations, including artificial compressibility in the continuity equation, allows to use time-marching solution techniques thereafter. Finally, the integration method used for the Navier-Stokes equations is combined with the equation governing the dynamical behavior of a structure in order to perform the fluid-structure stability analysis of this system in the time domain.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tz32x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jc19n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rf360"><dcterms:title>Line transversal algorithms in the plane</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Egyed, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Consider the following fundamental geometric problem: given a family of convex sets in the plane, does there exist a line that intersects every member of the family?

In general, $ Omega(n log n)$ time is required to compute a line transversal of a family of n objects. In this thesis, it is shown that several line transversal problems can be solved in $O(n)$ time. The problem of computing a shortest line segment that intersects every member of a family of objects is also considered. In particular, $O(n log n)$ time algorithms are proposed for computing a shortest transversal of a family of n lines and of a family of n line segments.

One-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed that MAbs P3D and 1B6 react with $ beta$-tubulin from a number of filarial and intestinal nematodes, but not with tubulin from protozoan and mammalian cells. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE demonstrated that MAb P3D recognizes two isoforms of $ beta$-tubulin and 1B6 recognizes one. Limited proteolysis showed that MAb 1B6 reacted with the amino-terminal fragments and MAb P3D with the carboxyl-terminal fragments of $ beta$-tubulin. The effect of anti-B. pahangi MAbs on the viability of adult B. pahangi was assessed using MTT assay. It was found that MAbs P3D and 1B6 caused an 80% and 40% reduction respectively, in worm viability, whereas anti-chick MAb 357 or mebendazole drug had no effect. Immunogold labelling of B. pahangi demonstrated the presence of tubulin in the median and basal layers of the cuticle, hypodermal layer and somatic muscle blocks, as well as the uterus of B. pahangi. The reduction in the viability of worms may, therefore, be due to the disruption of microtubules in the body wall muscle of B. pahangi.

In the sliding plate rheometer various shear tests were used to determine the relationship between the slip velocity and wall shear stress, and based on the experimental observations both steady state and dynamic slip models are proposed that are consistent with experimental observations. In the capillary flow studies the dependence of the slip velocity on wall shear stress, pressure, temperature and molecular parameters of molten polyethylenes was studied and the results were used to formulate a general slip velocity model. Because the slip velocity depends on pressure and thus varies with position in capillary flow, the Mooney procedure in determining the slip velocity is not appropriate. A modified Mooney technique is proposed to analyse the capillary data in cases where the slip velocity is a function of both wall shear stress and pressure. Using the slip velocity model, the steady state and unsteady state equation of motion was solved in capillary flow, and the calculated results were found to agree with the experimental results to a satisfactory degree. The oscillating flow regime was studied in detail, and the slip flow model was found to predict several features of this flow regime very well. Finally, the effect of interface conditions (surface coatings and metal of construction of slits) on both wall slip and melt fracture was studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, John M.

All Directors General, the chief executive officers of the cegeps, were surveyed. The data indicated that the majority of cegeps employ the components of Keller's strategic planning process.

Narrow (3-5 km) thermal halos around the Cretaceous Monteregian intrusions show limited thermal effects of these plutons on their country rocks. Maximum burial depth and paleogeothermal gradients were determined from fluid inclusion trapping temperatures and pressures, and from organic reflectance. IC improves with increasing R$ sb{ rm o}$ during pre-orogenic and postorogenic burial diagenesis, but improves only slowly compared to R$ sb{ rm o}$ in contact metamorphic zones.

Because of the existing school system division along religious lines, the average school catchment area is too large for all schools to become central places for their communities. Second, the formal participation offered to parents does not allow them any real involvement in school life. We propose a geographical method for a local population to contribute to the staging of local school life. For local values to penetrate the school, they must first be identified. We conducted analysis of the school landscape at geographical scales ranging from the neighborhood to the classroom, in order to show how this landscape expresses values which can be evaluated by a local community. For our purposes, we conceive of the landscape as a theater or a stage set.

The considered sulfite processes are neutral-sulfite (NS), neutral sulfite-anthraquinone (NS-AQ), neutral sulfite semichemical (NSSC) and neutral sulfite semichemical anthraquinone (NSSC-AQ). In preliminary studies, an experimental design was tested and optimum kinetic conditions were found so that penetration and diffusion would not be the rate-controlling steps and the amount of anthraquinone would not be reaction limiting. Delignification and carbohydrate degradation rate expressions for both NS and NS-AQ pulping were developed. Research was extended to develop delignification rate expressions for NSSC and NSSC-AQ pulping. The degree of delignification was measured by determining the lignin content of the pulp. Carbohydrate content in the pulp was estimated from the difference between the pulp yield and the residual lignin in the pulp. Reaction temperature and pulping chemical concentrations were held essentially constant in all kinetic experiments. Isothermal experiments were conducted in the temperature range between 165 and 180$ sp circ$C. A concentration of 150g/l sodium sulfite with a liquor-to-wood ratio of 62 was used.

The rates of delignification were determined at 175$ sp circ$C over the concentration range of 54 to 154 grams sodium sulfite per liter. It was observed that the reaction rate orders with respect to sodium sulfite charge were 0.3 and 0 for the delignification rate of NS and NS-AQ pulping respectively. The applicability of the H-factor for predicting pulping characteristics during NS-AQ and NSSC-AQ pulping was confirmed. The role of anthraquinone as a redox catalyst in NS-AQ was investigated. It was observed that anthraquinone is reduced in NS liquor, and that the redox cycle is involved in NS-AQ pulping.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wd516.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t85w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hj96c"><dcterms:title>Regulating the workplace in industrial Ontario : the origins of occupational health and safety policy, 1880-1914</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jennissen, Theresa E.

Together they formed the basic regulatory framework that endured in Ontario until the 1970s. The rise of industrial capitalism and the growth of the private market in the mid-1880s brought forward the factory system which depended on an unskilled labouring class and the use of power-driven machinery. Thus system of production created many risks for workers including accidents and diseases, and resultant financial problems caused by an inability to work. The role of, and interactions among, workers, employers, and the state were key in determining the particular patterns of policy development. Although health and safety policies provided only minimal protection to workers, while at the same time causing little disruption to business, the policies were more beneficial to workers when labour played an active role in the policy-making process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g51x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj96c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Industrial hygiene -- Ontario</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industrial safety -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c60m"><dcterms:title>Emotional consequences of communication disorders in childhood</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hobbs, Charlotte A.

This thesis examines whether children with communication disorders are more likely to have emotional and behavioral problems than those who are healthy or those with other chronic disorders. It also studies whether children with communication disorders are more likely than the comparison groups to develop mental health problems or to persist in having these problems as young adults. To answer these questions, cross-sectional and cohort analyses were conducted on 2,638 children from the Ontario Child Health Survey and 11,744 children from the British National Child Development Study. Children with communication disorders from both studies were found to have more emotional and behavioral problems than those who were healthy or those with chronic physical disorders. In neither sample, however, was there evidence to conclude that these psychological problems increase or persist in early adulthood. The implications of these findings for public health and clinical practice are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tz34g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c60m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278t84m"><dcterms:title>Differentiation of regnerated retinal ganglion cell connections in the superior colliculus of adult hamsters</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carter, David Alexander</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Following axotomy, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can regrow lengthy axons through peripheral nerve (PN) grafts and form connections in a natural target, the superior colliculus (SC) (Vidal-Sanz et al., '87). I investigated the morphologic differentiation of such connections in adult hamsters. By electron microscopy, the internal structure, synapses, and postsynaptic targets of the regenerated RGC axon terminals resembled those of normal RGC terminals in the SC, although the regenerated synapses and some of the terminals were larger than normal. By light microscopy, regenerated RGC arbors demonstrated similarities to the pattern of normal RGC arborizations in the SC. In addition, in long term qualitative studies there was no appreciable loss of intrinsic retinal neurons following optic nerve section. This anatomic evidence for the re-establishment of neural circuitry in adult hamsters corresponds to the results of physiological studies which have demonstrated that these connections are functional and can mediate visual activation of SC neurons (Keirstead et al., '89).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t276x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t84m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mq608"><dcterms:title>Behavioral investigation of the basolateral amygdala and of the pyriform cortex in rats</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beaulieu, Nicole</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The experiments reported in the present dissertation investigated the contribution of the pyriform cortex and of the basolateral amygdala to three classes of affective behavior: conditioned aversions, conditioned preferences, and neophobia. It was demonstrated that lesions of the pyriform cortex cause an impairment in the acquisition of aversions to olfactory, but not gustatory, stimuli and that this impairment is not secondary to alterations in primary olfactory function. The acquisition of a preference for a particular odor paired with reward was also shown to be impaired by such lesions. These results are discussed in terms of the rich innervation of the pyriform cortex by olfactory fibers, and of its projections to sub-cortical structures. Ibotenic-acid lesions of the basolateral amygdala caused a significant deficit in conditioned taste aversion, whereas these same lesions did not affect conditioned odor aversion. This dissociation was examined in light of the differences in anatomical projections from the olfactory and gustatory cortical areas to the basolateral region. The performance of animals with electrolytic lesions of the basolateral amygdala on a conditioned taste- and a conditioned odor-preference task raised some important questions concerning the contribution of this neural structure to stimulus-reward associations. The last two experiments demonstrated that the pyriform cortex plays an important role in neophobia, a role that is not limited to olfactory stimuli. This suggests that the analysis and subsequent transmission of olfactory information is critical to the expression of the neophobic response.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j359.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq608</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cerebral cortex.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conditioned response.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amygdaloid body.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t0064"><dcterms:title>Regenerative responses of injured adult rat retinal ganglion cells : axonal elongation, synapse formation and persistence of connections</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vidal-Sanz, Manuel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To characterize the regenerative responses of adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) neurons, their potential for axonal elongation, terminal growth, and synaptogenesis has been investigated in the retino-collicular system of the adult rat. For these studies, an experimental paradigm has been developed in the adult rat which consists of the total substitution of the optic nerve by an autologous segment of peripheral nerve (PN). The PN segment is used to promote axonal growth from axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and to direct this growth towards the superior colliculus (SC), which is their main target in the normal CNS. In light and electron microscopic studies, after the application of retrogradely and orthogradely transported tracers and immunocytochemical markers, it has been documented that: (i) Up to 10% of the original RGC population can regenerate axons along these PN segments for distances that surpass those that separate the retina from the SC; (ii) Upon arrival at the interface created by the PN segment and the SC, some of the regenerated retinal axons extend and appear to arborize in the superficial layers of the SC for distances of approximately 500 $ mu$m; (iii) The retinal axons are capable of terminal differentiation and synapse formation in the SC, and; (iv) Re-formed axonal terminals, analyzed 16-18 months after connecting the retina to the SC, are not different from those observed in age-matched controls.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc876.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t0064</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wk06k"><dcterms:title>Decodage de l'exposition professionnelle par l'analyse de particules extraites du parenchyme pulmonaire</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Occupational Health</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dufresne, André.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Occupational histories collected during interviews in an epidemiological study and then expressed as types and levels of occupational exposure have been compared to the results acquired in a physico-chemical analysis of the particles extracted from pulmonary parenchyma of forty-two subjects with different types of cancer.

Fragments of tissue that had been formolated or covered in paraffin were used after having been standardized by two pathologists. The preparation and analytical protocols were validated so that a representative number of particles could be counted and "reasonably" characterized from their morphology and their chemical composition by transmission electron microscopy and laser microprobe mass analyser. A Kappa test revealed that there was a limited correlation at the 5% level of confidence between the work history history and physico-chemical estimators for the group of subjects exposed to asbestos fiber (k = 0.475, p = 0.001), a 10% level for the group with silica exposure (k = 0.213, p = 0.089) and at a 5% level in the unexposed nonsmoker group (k = 0.417, p = 0.003).

We discuss in detail two methods for measurement of electron beam kinetic energies, describe our technique for the measurement of the optical density versus dose relationship for radiographic films, and present the experimental set-up for the measurement of the spatial spread of electron dose distributions for pencil and broad electron beams. The Fermi-Eyges theory for the small angle multiple Coulomb scattering describes the spatial electron distribution in scattering media. The spatial spread of a pencil electron beam in a phantom as predicted by the Fermi-Eyges theory is an increasing function of depth in phantom irrespective of the depth. Our experiments, on the other hand, show that the spatial spread indeed increases with depth until depths close to 2/3 of the practical electron range, but at larger depths the spatial spread saturates, then decreases and vanishes at depths greater than the range of electrons in the material. To describe the observed saturation and the decrease of the spatial spread at depths beyond 2/3 of the practical electron range we introduce an electron absorption term containing four empirical parameters into the original Fermi differential equation and show that its solution describes the experimental results obtained for pencil electron beams of various energies in polystyrene, cork and aluminum phantoms. We also compare with experimental results the spatial electron dose distributions predicted by the Fermi-Eyges theory and the modified Fermi-Eyges theory for collimated broad electron beams.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g89c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g71n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Electricity and Magnetism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445cf05t"><dcterms:title>Pyridine complexes of cobalt (II) isothiocyante in non-aqueous solvents : a thermodynamic study.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Simmons, Gloria Janet.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cf063.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf05t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cobalt -- Isotopes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pyridine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722h967m"><dcterms:title>A study of transfer in bright and dull children.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shannon, Elizabeth Baillie.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj049.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h967m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Learning, Psychology of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intellect</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462628h"><dcterms:title>Semi-empirical, all-valence-electron, molecular orbital theory.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1967</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sichel, John Martin.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f203j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462628h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Molecular orbitals</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mq62t"><dcterms:title>Set and the perception of words</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1968</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Skanes, Graham R.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06988331.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq62t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Perception.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
