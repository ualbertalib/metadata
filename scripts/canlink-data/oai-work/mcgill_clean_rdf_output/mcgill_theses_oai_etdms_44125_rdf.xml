The central question that I seek  to answer is "What other narratives of nationhood and citizenship are there  than those of membership in the American or Canadian states?" Mohawks and other  Iroquois nations have long asserted their ideological, and in the case of some,  economic independence from the governments of Canada and the United States. My  multi-sited research illustrates that this historical assertion is more than  rhetoric; it is also a practice or " praxis," as Mohawks configure  citizenship across the imposed borders that separate their reserves from cities and  states from states. This dissertation engages contemporary theories of nationhood,  historical and contemporary ethnographic literature on the Iroquois, as well as  contemporary literature in political theory and policy to examine the gendered and  sometimes racialized contours of Indigenous nationhood and citizenship across  borders. Kahnawake Mohawk narratives and the choices that they entail have  implications for the way that all "post-colonial" nationals attempt to  imagine and construct their place and their membership within and beyond the  boundaries of their communities and that of the state.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trigger, Bruce G.

Minh-ha), and writing as feminist practice (DuPlessis). These share what I call a  feminist poetics; I develop the concept of "sympathy" (the transmission of  symptoms from one body to the next) to explain how they nourish one another. I  recount their poststructuralist context, and outline key historical influences, such  as the student protests of 1968, the nascent women's movements in France and North  America, and feminist cultural production in the 1970s. I then describe their  poetics---the textual, grammatical, and semantic strategies used to undermine the  patriarchal symbolic. I focus on the status and function of the female body in this  feminist poetics, and suggest the body provides it with a non-essentialist  theoretical foundation. I conclude by evaluating two models that best describe these  writing practices: the palimpsest and the matrix. While the palimpsest, with its  textual allusions, is an attractive model, I suggest that the matrix offers two  advantages: its corporeal connotations and its emphasis on writing as  process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaite, B.

The latter are usually negotiated privately among the generators  and loads and result in long-term agreements of the order of days to months. The  bilateral contracts can be firm or non-firm but in all cases they stand for physical  rather than financial obligations to generate a certain amount of power at some bus  and to consume it at some other specified point in the power network. The power  consumed by the loads that does not come from bilateral contracts is supplied by the  pool generation, and is traded in the so-called spot markets whose time horizons can  range from a day to as close as one hour. In this combined market model, all ancillary services including  transmission losses and congestion management are supplied by the pool. The market  clearing process identifying the scheduled generation levels and the nodal  electricity prices (also known as locational marginal prices) is defined by the  solution of an optimal power flow which minimizes the total offered generation cost  plus any curtailment or non-curtailment costs. This optimization, which is performed  centrally by a system operator, simultaneously satisfies the power balance at all  the network buses while respecting the power flow limits in all lines including  transmission losses. In particular, the market clearing process takes into  consideration generation limits imposed by the bilateral contracts, a constraint  which as this thesis demonstrates can have a profound impact on the market  performance. The performance of the combined pool/bilateral market is  evaluated both technically and financially. The technical performance of a specific  market is measured in terms of the pool and bilateral generation levels, by the  degree of transmission congestion and by the transmission losses. The financial  performance of individual market participants is based on the nodal prices, power  transfer rates, as well as on the revenues and expenditures of both generators and  loads. Simulation results indicate that careful coordination of the  pool and bilateral trades is essential as certain mixes can force out of merit  generator operation, unnecessary transmission congestion, lower generation revenues,  and higher consumer payments. This is particularly so if the bilateral contracts are  firm. In order to lessen the consequences of inefficient  pool/bilateral mixes, a variation of the combined pool/bilateral market is also  examined under which the participants may submit curtailment offers for their firm  contracts and non-curtailment bids for their non-firm contracts. The market clearing  procedure in this case determines the levels of generation, the nodal prices, as  well as the levels of contract curtailment. Finally, the Aumann-Shapley unbundling procedure is applied to  the combined pool/bilateral model with firm contracts. This enables the  decomposition of the generation levels into three different service components,  namely pool generation, bilateral generation, as well as a generation term supplying  ancillary services attributed to the bilateral trades. The unbundling procedure also  calculates the corresponding costs associated with these "unbundled"  services and allocates them among the different market participants. This service  and cost unbundling process is then implemented into a Pay-as-Bid pricing mechanism  and compared with the conventional marginal pricing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, Francisco D.

(1) To  estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis in Canada. (2) To estimate the effect of  initial bone mass on bone mineral density (BMD) decline rates over a period of three  years. We employ data from the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (Cantos), a  prospective, fixed cohort study comprised of 9,423 randomly selected subjects from  nine different regions in Canada. For the first objective, Cantos had a relatively low  participation rate (42%), so that selection bias is a concern. The Cantos study  design, however, included a brief risk factor questionnaire for those invitees that  declined further participation. These risk factors were then used to estimate the  missing osteoporosis status for non-participants using Bayesian multiple imputation,  thus adjusting for nonresponse bias. Both ignorable and non-ignorable imputation  models are considered. Complicating study of the relationship between the initial BMD  and rate of decline is the issue of measurement error, which can cause a spurious  negative association between the rate of change in a variable and the initial value  of the variable. A novel variation on the Bayesian methods of Richardson and Gilks  (1993b) is used to adjust for measurement error in both the initial and year three  BMD values. After adjusting for selection bias, prevalence increased from  negligible in the youngest age group to 38.9% for women and 15.4% for men in the 80+  age group. Selection bias was estimated to be relatively small, except in the oldest  age group, where the bias was 2.4% for women and 5.4% for men. For women the unadjusted relationship between the rate of  decline of BMD and initial BMD is negative, -0.040 (95% CI = -0.053; -0.028).  Correcting for measurement error results in estimates closer to zero. For example,  using a hierarchical model with measurement error correction yields an estimate of  -0.030 (95% CI = -0.050; -0.009). For men the unadjusted relationship between rate  of decline and initial BMD was -0.026 (95% CI = -0.043; -0.009). Correcting for  measurement error using the hierarchical model yields a much lower estimate of  -0.013 (95% CI = -0.041; 0.016). It is clear that ignoring measurement error results  in a heavily biased estimate of the effect of initial BMD on rate of decline of BMD  for both women and men. The measurement error adjusted estimates were of a lesser  magnitude than the unadjusted estimate, with reductions of approximately 25% to  50%. The results from this thesis can be used to make decisions about  osteoporosis treatment in Canada. Knowledge of the prevalence rates in Canada is  useful to public health planners in allocating resources. Knowledge of the  relationship between initial levels of BMD and subsequent decline in BMD allows  better public health decision making, for example, in deciding whether to focus on  bone health early in life, or whether it is more important to prevent decline later  in life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joseph, Lawrence (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zf066.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc04s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv9353473"><dcterms:title>Biochemical and genomic analysis of bile salt hydrolases from Bifidobacterium strains</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kim, Geun-Bae, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three different types (A, B, and C) of bile salt hydrolase from  different Bifidobacterium strains revealed during the purification study showed the  type-specific characteristics in their electrophoretic migration and elution  profiles from anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographic columns.  The subunit molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE was around 35 kDa and the native  molecular mass in all types of BSH was estimated to be between 130 and 150 kDa by  gel filtration chromatography, indicating that all BSH enzymes have tetrameric  structure. From the isoelectric focusing, pI value of 4.45 was obtained with type B,  but type A and C BSHs showed similar pI values of around 4.65. While the N-terminal  amino acid sequences of types A and B were highly homologous (19/20), six out of  twenty amino acid residues were different in the N-terminal sequences of types A and  C. As the type A bsh gene was cloned from a strain of B. longum and  the nucleotide sequence became available from the GenBank, our study has focused on  the cloning and characterization of the type B and C bsh genes from Bifidobacterium  strains. The type B bsh gene was cloned from B. bifidum ATCC11863 and the  DNA flanking the bsh gene was sequenced. The 951 by-long bsh gene encoded a  316-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 35 kDa and a pI of 4.48. For the  first time in the genus Bifidobacterium, the transcriptional start point of the bsh  gene was identified by primer extension analysis. Furthermore, Northern blot  analysis revealed that B. bifidum bsh was transcribed as a monocistronic unit,  contrary to that of B. longum bsh. Despite a high level of sequence similarity among  the bsh genes, a BSH type-specific primer set based on the variable regions of bsh  genes was designed in order to differentiate B. bifidum strains from the other  species of Bifidobacterium commonly detected in the human gut. The type C bsh gene was cloned from a bile salt tolerant strain  of Bifidobacterium and the DNA flanking the bsh gene was further identified by a  thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) technique. The 945 by-long bsh gene  encoded a 314-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 35 kDa and a pI of 4.71. A  predicted BSH promoter (Pbsh) sequence was experimentally verified and the  transcriptional start point of the type C bsh gene was determined by primer  extension analysis. An operonic structure including the type C bsh gene and two more  ORFs, which were found within a complete set of a promoter and a transcription  terminator, was identified in this study for the first time in the genus  Bifidobacterium, and the polycistronic bsh transcript was revealed by RT-PCR and  Northern blot analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, Byong H.

Hence, the de-inking sludge needs to be treated before being disposed of. Sludge  combustion is a proven disposal technology, which generates fly ash containing a  portion of the heavy metals that may leach out under uncontrolled conditions. The  aim of this thesis is to implement a new multi-zone temperature combustion technique  (Low-High-Low temperature combustion, LHL) to help contain and immobilize the heavy  metals within fly ash particles. During the LHL, the waste will be initially fed  into a low-temperature zone (&lt;1100 K) and then subjected to the  high-temperature treatment (~1480 K) that will be followed by another  low-temperature zone (~1100 K). This dissertation describes the detailed design and construction  of a novel pilot-scale combustion facility, called the Multi-Mode Combustion  Facility (MCF), used as a multidisciplinary research tool for investigating the  thermal remediation of contaminated solid residues. The MCF is capable of operating  in two different modes: Fluidized-Bed combustion mode (FBC) and Single burner  furnace mode (SBF). However, this project focuses on the FBC mode (minimum  fluidization velocity of 0.42 m/s and bed temperature of 1073 K). This research compares the combustion characteristics of  de-inking sludge obtained in the LHL and in the conventional combustion techniques.  The following properties of particulates were studied: morphological evolution of  solid particles, structural porosity, metals interactions with fly ash particles,  and leachability. The LHL's final supermicron spherical fly ash went through a  molten phase with submicron particles attached to the fly ash particles surfaces.  Thus, reducing its porosity to 19%. However, the amorphous final fly ash obtained in  the conventional technique reveals 32% porosity. It was found that the physical  characteristics of the final LHL's fly ash are the main cause for the reduced heavy  metals leachability rates of 0.18, 0.046, and 0.92% for Cd, Cr, and Pb,  respectively. The conventional technique had 53.28, 16.79, and 5.20% of Cd, Cr, and  Pb respectively, leaching out due to the high porosity percentages. In conclusion,  the LHL technique allows for controlling the heavy metals emission from FBCs, while  using a waste to energy approach and maintaining environmentally acceptable gas  emission levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kozinski, Janusz (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt27f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vb86b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fly ash -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluidized-bed combustion.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Waste paper -- Recycling -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Incineration -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fp441"><dcterms:title>Cost-effectiveness decision analyses comparing covered to uncovered self-expandable metal stents to elective or on-demand polyethylene stent changes in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Da Silveira, Eduardo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. Endoscopic placement of stents is the preferred  treatment for palliation of obstructive symptoms in non-operative candidates but  significant differences in procedure and stent-related costs, patency of stents  survival of patients exist. Aim. To determine the cost-effectiveness of two  strategies using Polyethylene (PE) stents (PE with replacement on demand; PE with  routine exchange every 3 months), as well as uncovered (U-SEMS) and covered  self-expandable metal stent (C-SEMS) in the management of distal malignant biliary  obstruction. Methods. A Markov model comparing four different initial approaches was  designed: (1) PE stent with replacement on demand (PE-D); (2) PE stent changed every  3 months (PE-Q3); (3) U-SEMS or (4) C-SEMS. Probabilities and parameters for  distribution were abstracted from randomized controlled trials and imputed to a  12-month time horizon. Effectiveness was calculated as number of occlusion-free  months. Procedural and complication-related costs were obtained from the Canadian  Institute for Health Information and a Provincial perspective was adopted. A  probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis using Monte Carlo simulations was utilized  to obtain a posterior joint distribution for costs and effectiveness. Average and  incremental net health benefits, probabilities of cost-effectiveness and value of  information were determined across a range of willingness to pay (Rc) values.  Results. PE-D has the lowest CE ratio, followed by C-SEMS at an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $146.64$/month of stent patency. C-SEMS has the  lowest CE ratio under the following scenarios: probability of survival at 12 months  greater than 83%, ERCP costs higher than $1,282.90, cost C-SEMS less than $1,485.60  and cost ratio between ERCP and C-SEMS greater than 0.4. In the probabilistic  analysis, PE-D is the strategy with the highest probability of cost-effectiveness  for willingness to pay values lower than $150.60. How Conclusion. Conditional to the willingness to pay and current  Canadian costs, PE-D and C-SEMS are the strategies with the highest probabilities of  cost-effectiveness. However, a significant level of uncertainly remains and wrong  decisions will occur given the existent information. Acquisition of further  knowledge to decrease the uncertainty level may be indicated if it costs less than  the opportunity losses.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117p40p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp441</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483j86p"><dcterms:title>Nod factor recognition and response by soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr) under abiotic and biotic stress conditions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duzan, Haifa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plants possess highly sensitive perception systems by which they  recognize signal compounds originating from microbes. These molecular cues play an  important role in both symbiotic and pathogenic relationships. Establishment of the  soybean (Glycine max)-Bradyrhizobium symbiosis is orchestrated by specific signal  molecules exchanged between appropriate plant and microbe partners: flavonoids as  plant-to-bacteria signals, and Nod factor as bacteria-to-plant signals. How this  signaling process interacts with stress conditions (abiotic and biotic) is the  subject of this thesis. The abiotic stresses were suboptimal growth temperature, low  pH, and salinity. Suboptimal growth temperatures affected the ability of the  microsymbiont, Bradyrhizobim japonicum, to perceive nod gene inducers (genistein)  and produce Nod factor. Nod Bj-V (C18:1, MeFuc) production by B. japonicum strains  523C and USDA110 was strongly affected by suboptimal growth temperature. Nod factor  production declined with temperature, from 28 to 15°C. Strain USDA110 was  more affected by decreased temperature than strain 532C. Decreased Nod factor  production at low temperature was due to both decreased bacterial growth and lower  production efficiency (Nod factor per cell). When a 1:1 mixture of Nod factor Nod  Bj-V (C18:1, MeFuc) and Nod Bj-V (Ac, C16:0, MeFuc) was applied to soybean roots,  root hair deformation increased as Nod factor concentration increased under  stressfully low temperature and low pH conditions. High salinity stress strongly  reduced the root hair deformation caused by Nod factor, and increasing the  concentrations of added Nod factor did not over come this. Exogenous application of  Nod Bj-V (C18:1, MeFuc), from strain 532C, to soybean root systems under two root  zone temperatures (RZTs---17 and 25°C) reduced the progression of disease  (powdery mildew---Microsphaera difussa) development on soybean leaves; this effect  increased with Nod factor concentration and was gr</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, D.

One approach to increasing system  capacity is to lower the bit rate of telephone speech. A typical telephone  conversation contains approximately 40% speech and 60% silence or background  acoustic noise. A reduction of the average coding rate can be achieved by using a  Voice Activity Detection (VAD) unit to distinguish speech from silence or background  noise. The VAD decision can be used to select different coding modes for speech and  noise or to discontinue transmission during speech pauses. The quality of a telephone conversation using a VAD-based coding  system depends on three major modules: the speech coder, the noise coder, and the  VAD. Existing schemes for reduced-rate coding of background noise produce a signal  that sounds different from the noise at the transmitting side. The frequent changes  of the noise character between that produced during talk spurts (noise coded along  with the speech) and that produced during speech pauses (noise coded at a reduced  rate) are noticeable and can be annoying to the user. The objective of this thesis is to develop techniques that  enhance the output quality of variable-rate and discontinuous-transmission speech  coding systems operating in noisy acoustic environments during the pauses between  speech bursts. We propose novel excitation models for natural-quality reduced-rate  coding of background acoustic noise in voice communication systems. A better  representation of the excitation signal in a noise-synthesis model is achieved by  classifying the type of acoustic environment noise. Class-dependent residual  substitution is used at the receive side to synthesize a background noise that  sounds similar to the background noise at the transmit side. The improvement in the  quality of synthesized noise during speech gaps helps in preserving noise continuity  between talk spurts and speech pauses, and enhances the overall perceived quality of  a conversation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d704p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr212</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sw31x"><dcterms:title>Systematic approach to the protection design of transmission networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>El Arroudi, Khalil M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis introduces a new approach to the protection of power  transmission systems wherein all the component activities associated with system  protection design are gathered together in one integrated environment referred to as  the Unified Approach to transmission system protection. These activities consist of  automatically generating the most probable abnormal events in the network and  analyzing the resulting consequences that arise from these abnormalities. From this  analysis, the appropriate characteristics are determined for the relay under study  as part of the performance specification of that relay. The proposed Unified approach overcomes the disadvantages that  are associated with the current approaches in which the performance specification is  carried out on an ad-hoc basis. In such approaches, it is required to run various  programs to estimate the consequences of various types of abnormal events. The  results are then reviewed by a protection expert who takes into account various  critical situations particular to the system under study and a relay performance  specification is produced. In the development of the concept of the proposed Unified  Approach , the ultimate objective is to propose a systematic methodology that will  result in improved efficiency in terms of engineering cost and protection design  methods. The engineering cost is reduced since this methodology requires a minimum  human intervention to process the complex tasks involved. Similarly, the protection  design methods are enhanced by the proposed methodology so that they can be  processed relatively quickly, be an integral part of power system design, cover all  possible events, remove protection design redundancy, specify protection systems  according to the power system needs, consolidate protection methods, assure the  desired consistency, optimize transmission capacity and assure the security of the  power system and the protection system at all times.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joos, Geza (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365567r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw31x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h250t"><dcterms:title>Determining the value of processes and information structures for new product development</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kong, Linghua, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis focuses on the new product development (NPD) process  and the organizational structure which supports the process.

The thesis then demonstrates that, despite theoretical obstacles, many  novels and poems from Quebec touch upon the Shoah and express a feeling of guilt  towards the victims as early as the 1950's. The last chapter postulates that since  the 1980's, fiction has acquired a greater legitimacy and narrative forms used to  represent the Shoah have diversified, due to the gradual disappearance of direct  witnesses as well as the interval of time separating writers from the  tragedy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz87p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj597</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945), in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935351p"><dcterms:title>The angel story : a study of the interpretation of Genesis 6:1-4 in the Jewish literature of the Second Temple period</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Miller, Shem</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The story of the "sons of God" in Genesis 6:1-4 has  attracted the attention of Jewish texts from its inception, on account of its  obscure character and positioning before the story of the Flood.

Reducing  the amount of NFs in motor axons and thereby reducing axonal caliber, did not slow  down motor neuron disease in SOD1G37R mice. Moreover, increasing the density of NFs  in axons by human NF-L overexpression did not accelerate pathology either.  Therefore, it is concluded that a high NF content and a large caliber of axons may  not account for the selective degeneration of motor neurons in ALS mice.  Surprisingly, an accumulation of NFs in perikarya of motor neurons by overexpression  of NF-H or by knockout of NF-L, was associated with a slowing down of disease  progression of SOD1 G37R mice. Evidence is presented that these NF accumulations may  protect motor neurons by acting as a phosphorylation sink against a deregulation of  cyclin-dependent-kinase5 (Cdk5) activity and by preventing the hyperphosphorylation  tau, a microtubule-associated protein. Following this finding, we further analyzed members of the Cdks  family. Of particular interest was the finding that Cdk4, a regulator of the G1/S  checkpoint of the cell cycle, was upregulated at the protein levels and mislocalized  in nucleus of motor neurons in SOD1G37R mice. An increase of Cdk4 activity was also  detected in SOD1G37R mice and it was associated with the abnormal phosphorylation of  the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) at Cdks phosphorylation sites. Interestingly,  treatment of SOD1 G37R mice with minocycline, an anti-apoptotic/anti-inflammatory  compound, concomitantly lessened the upregulation and mislocalization of Cdk4 as  well as the deregulation of Cdk5. Moreover, perikaryal NF inclusions in SOD1 G37R  mice, a phosphorylation sink for deregulated Cdk5, attenuates the upregulation and  mislocalization of Cdk4. Taken together, these results indicate that Cdk4 activation  and mitotic signaling in motor neurons are subsequent to Cdk5  deregulation. As revealed by chimeras mice generated by cell aggregation, the  disease induced by SOD1G37R is non-cell autonomous. The expression of the mutant  protein was not sufficient to trigger pathology in a CNS environment enriched with  wild-type cells. This suggests a potential contribution of glial cells in disease.  Generation of SOD1G37R mice lacking IL-1beta, a pro-inflammatory cytokine derived  from glial cells, demonstrated however that this cytokine does not play a leading  role in motor neuron death in this system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Julien, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g0723.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666503s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g808m"><dcterms:title>Quality changes in raw and processed potatoes as influenced by storage conditions and bacterial soft rot disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nourian, Farideh</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Potato ranks fourth after wheat, rice and corn as a major food  crop.

Kinetics of quality changes during cooking and frying of  potatoes were evaluated. Potatoes were cooked at 80--100°C or fried at  160--190°C for selected times and their texture and color were evaluated.  Results showed that texture values of cooked potatoes decreased with the progress of  cooking, and the rate of texture changes at each temperature was found to be  consistent with two pseudo first-order kinetic mechanisms. Textural values of fried  potatoes increased with frying time and followed a first order kinetic model. Cooked  potatoes were less bright, more red and less yellow in color as compared to raw  samples.

The redox reactive portion  of the enzymes is the isoalloxazine ring system of the flavin cofactor. It is known  that the protein environment modulates the redox potential of the flavin, for  example, "tuning" its redox potential to favor either a one-electron  transfer (electron transfer proteins) or a two-electron transfer (oxidation  reactions). This thesis presents an in depth structural study of the flavoenzyme,  cholesterol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.6) from Streptomyces sp. SA-COO (SCOA) a  multifunctional enzyme that oxidizes and isomerizes 3-beta-hydroxysteroids. This  work was pursued in order to further our understanding of the mechanisms through  which the protein interacts with the isoalloxazine system and modulates reactivity.  Previous kinetic experiments have identified an active site asparagine (N485) and a  histidine residue (H447) both of which are critical to the oxidative activity of the  enzyme. On an atomic scale the role of the asparagine residue was unknown. Using  mutagensis and crystallographic techniques we have characterized this novel N-H  ··· pi protein-flavin interaction. SCOA crystals  diffract to sub-atomic resolution providing us with a unique view of the protein  bound isoalloxazine system. These atomic resolution maps have revealed unexpected  structural features that were not previously apparent in the 1.5 A resolution of  SCOA. For example, a second narrow pathway leading directly to the isoalloxazine  system was discovered, which has provided a more complete mechanistic understanding  of the reactions catalyzed by SCOA. Five atomic resolution structures of SCOA at  varying pH values are reported. Differences among these structures provide insight  into the affect of pH on protein structure and have revealed structural differences  resulting from an inadvertent reduction of the cofactor.

Both Met and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF) regulate epithelial cell dispersal and morphogenesis and are deregulated in  several human tumors. At the onset of this thesis, little was known about the  signals that regulate these events. In this thesis I have defined the involvement of  the Crk adapter protein in Met-dependent anchorage independent growth, cell  spreading, cell dispersal, invasion and morphogenesis. The disruption of focal  adhesion signaling in Met transformed fibroblasts is associated with the loss of  Crk/p130Cas and Crk/Paxillin complexes. In contrast, Crk associates with Cbl and  Gab1 in Met transformed fibroblasts. A role for Crk/Gab1 coupling in anchorage  independent growth is proposed based on the retention of these complexes in Met  transformed fibroblasts grown in suspension and their ability to enhance JNK  activity. Using MDCK epithelial colonies, I demonstrated that mutants of Crk lacking  the amino terminal SH3 domain inhibit HGF-stimulated lamellipodia formation, cell  spreading and breakdown of adherens junctions. Moreover, when overexpressed, wild  type Crk can promote all of these events in the absence of HGF. Consistent with the  elevated Rac activity observed in cells overexpressing Crk, the ability of Crk to  promote these events is Rac-dependent. The overexpression of Crk results in the  formation of a molecular complex containing Crk, Paxillin, GIT2 (an ARF-GAP) and  beta-PIX (a Rac exchange factor) that relocalizes to focal complexes in cells at the  edge of the colony. The formation of this complex is critical for the ability of Crk  to mediate lamellipodia formation and cell spreading, as mutants of Paxillin that  fail to associate with Crk or GIT2, or that do not target to focal adhesions,  inhibit these processes. Consistent with the involvement of Crk in HGF cell  dispersal, the coupling of Gab1 with Crk is requi</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Park, Morag (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf093.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xx79c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nb773"><dcterms:title>Platelet activating factor receptors : nuclear localization and signaling in microvascular endothelial cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marrache, Anne Marilise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has been postulated that intracellular binding sites for  platelet activating factor (PAF) contribute to pro-inflammatory responses to PAF.  Isolated nuclei from porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (PCEC)  produced PAF-molecular species in response to H2O2 . Using fluorescent-activated  cell sorter analysis, we demonstrated the expression of PAF receptors (PAFR) on cell  and nuclear surfaces of PCEC. Confocal microscopy studies performed on PCEC, Chinese  hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing PAFR and on isolated nuclei from PCEC also  showed a robust nuclear distribution of PAFR. Presence of PAFR at the cell nucleus  was further revealed in brain endothelial cells by radioligand binding experiments,  immunoblotting, and in situ in brain by immunoelectron microscopy. Stimulation of  nuclei with PAF evoked a decrease in cAMP production and a pertussis toxin  (PTX)-sensitive rise in nuclear calcium, unlike observations in plasma membrane,  which exhibited a PTX-insensitive elevation in inositol phosphates. Moreover, on  isolated nuclei C-PAF evoked the expression of pro-inflammatory genes inducible  nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and was associated with  augmented ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB binding to DNA consensus sequence;  COX-2 expression was prevented by MEK/ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB inhibitors. This study  describes for the first time the nucleus as a putative organelle capable of  generating PAF and expresses its receptor, which upon stimulation induces the  expression of pro-inflammatory gene COX-2.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chemtob, Sylvain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx201.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nb773</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
