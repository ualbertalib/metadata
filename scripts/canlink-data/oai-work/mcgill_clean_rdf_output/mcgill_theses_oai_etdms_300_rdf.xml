In the present study I have examined this polymorphism at the molecular level to determine whether differences exist in the biochemical functions of these two p53 variants. No differences were observed in their sequence-specific DNA binding abilities, nor in their ability to be targeted by HPV-18 E6 oncoprotein for degradation by ubiquitination in vitro. However, differences were observed in the ability of these two variants to function as transcriptional activators: p53 Pro-72 was more transcriptionally active than p53 Arg-72. I propose that the polymorphism at codon 72 may affect the structure of the N-terminal transactivation domain of the p53 protein, which would then have an effect on the ability of these variants to interact with transcription factors in order to initiate transcription of target genes and function as a tumor suppressor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Matlashewski, Greg (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd147.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft41q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antioncogenes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transcription factors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphoproteins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genetic polymorphisms.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jn453"><dcterms:title>On partial semigroup models for the Lambek calculus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kalisz, Piotr.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several collections of partial semigroup models for the Lambek Calculus are described and results regarding soundness and completeness of the Lambek Calculus with respect to those collections of models are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambek, Joachim (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r80p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn453</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h157s"><dcterms:title>Salt stress, and phosphorus absorption by potato plants cv.

Nine clones of the cultivar were evaluated for their salt tolerance at the vegetative stage by using in vitro culture. Four concentrations of NaCl (0, 40, 80, and 120 mM) were used in the experiments. The first experiment was carried out to study the effect of salinity on P absorption by using radiophosphorus ($ sp{32}$P) as a marker. P absorption showed a quadratic relationship with time. In general, there was a significant reduction in P absorption as the NaCl concentration increased in the nutrient medium. However, the root tip concentration of $ sp{32}$P increased with increased salt concentration. When P concentration in the nutrient medium was increased, $ sp{32}$P activity was also increased with time at 120 mM salt concentration. The activity of radiophosphorus decreased on root tips when P concentration in the nutrient medium was increased to 2.5 mM P. The second experiment was conducted in tissue culture using nodal cutting bioassay. The plant morphological parameters of shoot length, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root length, root fresh weight, and root dry weight were reduced for all nine clones as salinity increased. The clone PEI#1 (tu) exhibited high salt tolerance characteristics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barthakur, N. N.

The cadherins are a superfamily of integral membrane proteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell adhesion and are involved in the formation of intercellular junctions. The cadherin subtype, known as N-cadherin, mediates the interaction between the germ cells and Sertoli cells of the testis. Previous studies have shown that estrogens are able to modulate N-cadherin mRNA levels in the 7-day-old mouse testis. I have examined the estrogen effects on N-cadherin protein levels in the testes of 21-day-old rats. The rats were injected with either 17$ beta$-estradiol, the anti-estrogens Tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, or estradiol in combination with ICI 182,780. Immunoblotting analysis of testicular proteins shows that N-cadherin levels in the 21-day-old rat are stimulated by estrogen. Treatment with anti-estrogens decrease N-cadherin levels. Administration of estrogen was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of anti-estrogen treatment. The results obtained from these studies indicate that the effect of estrogen on testicular N-cadherin levels is mediated through the estrogen receptor. Estrogen receptor levels within the testis are not altered by exogenous estrogen, but can be affected by treatment with anti-estrogen. These experiments support the hypothesis that estrogens play an important role in spermatogenesis. In addition, the results provide insight into how disruption of testicular estrogen responsiveness can reduce fertility and why chronic anti-estrogen treatment results in disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blaschuk, O.

The primary objective was to assess the effect of removing water from a beaver pond for one year had on the subsequent productivity of the wetland. Productivity was estimated by sampling water chemistry, standing crops of aquatic invertebrates, vertebrates, algae and vegetation composition and distribution in naturally occurring and managed beaver ponds of varying ages during 1994 and 1995. Three ponds in each of the following categories were sampled; managed ponds reflooded in 1993, managed ponds reflooded in 1991, naturally occurring beaver ponds reflooded in 1992-93, and naturally occurring old flood ponds ($&gt;$5 years old). Results from this study indicate that beaver pond productivity is negatively affected by flooding duration. Removal of a portion of the beaver dam on old flood ponds may be an effective means of rejuvenating the wetland. Positive effects on the productivity of the wetland should be realized for several years after reflood. Variability in results indicates that other environmental variables were also affecting the overall productivity of beaver ponds.

Islets and ducts were isolated from hamster pancreata. Islets were purified on a bovine serum albumin gradient. Primary duct cultures were passaged twice for cell purification. Duct-conditioned medium (DCM) was collected from duct cultures passaged twice. The islets were allocated to three experimental groups: (1) 100 islets alone; (2) 100 islets + 80 tertiary ducts and (3) 100 islets in 25% DCM. All tissues were embedded in rat tail collagen for the duration of the study. The influence of pancreatic ductal epithelium on islet cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), islet morphology, and islet-cell proliferation was examined. As determined by inverted microscopy, 17.3% $ pm$ 1.8 of the islets cultured alone, demonstrated central necrosis, in comparison to 4.6% $ pm$ 1.0 of the islets co-cultured with ducts (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Specific cell death detection ELISA indicated that DNA fragmentation in islets cultured alone (0.23 $ pm$ 0.04), was significantly increased compared to islets cultured with ductal epithelium (0.09 $ pm$ 0.02) (p = 0.03). At 27$ sp circ$C, 60.5% $ pm$ 8.8 of the islets cultured alone showed peripheral cell disintegration, in contrast only 2.6% $ pm$ 0.3 (p $&lt;$ 0.001) of the islets cultured with ducts. Tritiated thymidine incorporation into islets cultured with ducts (235.8 $ pm$ 33.9) was 120% higher than that in islets cultured alone (96.3 $ pm$ 18.8) (p = 0.01). Similar results were obtain from the third experimental group, when ductal epithelium was substituted with DCM. In conclusion, pancreatic ductal epithelium can stimulate islet cell survival and growth. This effect appears to be mediated in a paracrine manner by the release of factor(s) from the ductal cells into the media.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rosenberg, Lawrence (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x5878.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p017j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d6159"><dcterms:title>Multivariate morphometric analysis of seasonal changes in overwintering arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Idrus, Muhammad Rijal.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study developed a robust technique for the assessment of morphometric differences among overwintering northern fish populations. Arctic charr were sampled soon before the freeze-up and just after ice break-up at two subarctic Quebec lakes. A homogenous sample of 397 fish was used. Regression analyses of the length-weight relationships and their derived condition indices were insufficient, due to their inherent limitations, to recognize the differences between sampling groups. A series of multivariate analyses (canonical, stepwise and discriminant analysis), based on eleven morphometric characters of the fish, provided a better assessment. The analysis recognized the distinctions between sampling groups, correctly classified 70-100% of the fish into their appropriate groupings, and indicated that body height measured at the anal opening was the most discriminatory variable. Landmark variables related to shape differences were effective in discriminating fish according to their lake of origin, whereas length and weight variables, which closely reflected the size differences, were better at distinguishing seasonal changes. The study provides a simple, efficient assessment method based on phenotypic variations to explain different survival strategies, and the associated life history traits, adopted by fish.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Curtis, Mark A.

There was a significant negative correlation between lipid peroxidation and cell proliferation. Growth inhibition and lipid peroxidation were reduced by zinc in BT-20 cells but not in MCF7 cells.

The consensus is that the primary mechanism by which phytosterols modify lipid profiles is through altering the absorption of cholesterol. This thesis examined the effects of phytosterol mixtures on (i) de novo cholesterol synthesis rates and appearance of de novo cholesterol into the cholesterol ester pool through the use of deuterium incorporation, as well as, (ii) plasma lipid and sterol concentrations in normolipidemic humans. The initial investigation of this thesis compared the effects of diets based on either corn oil, olive oil, or olive oil plus phytosterol mixture on cholesterol metabolism. Each treatment was administered for 10 days in a cross-over design to 16 normolipidemic humans. In addition to confirming prior conclusions that corn oil was more effective than olive oil at decreasing plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentration, this study was one of the first to determine that the differential effects on cholesterol metabolism observed in humans consuming corn versus olive oil is due, in part, to the higher concentrations of plant sterols naturally found in corn oil. The second study presented in this thesis investigated the differential effects on sterol metabolism of phytosterol mixtures either enriched with sitostanol or sitostanol-free administered for 10 days in 11 normolipidemic humans. The results of this study demonstrated that only the phytosterol mixture containing low doses of sitostanol decreased plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and increased the circulating HDL/LDL ratios; thus, the sitostanol-enriched phytosterol mixture was a more effective cholesterol-lowering agent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, P.

As part of this project, researchers in the Microelectronics and Computer System (MACS) Laboratory at McGill University are developing a reconfigurable free-space optical backplane architecture capable of supporting terabits per second (Tbps) throughput. The optical backplane can be dynamically reconfigured to support the switching schemes used in both multiprocessor systems and in telecommunication systems. In this thesis, we will consider the performance of the optical backplane when it is configured to support a 160 Gigabit per second (and a 640 Gigabit per second) ATM switch in a standard telecommunication environment. In this thesis, we assume that the backplane is configured to support a traditional 3-stage crossbar switching system, with electrical switches in the first and third stages, and optical switches in the second stage. A discrete event simulation model is developed to analyze numerous architectural variations of this opto-electronic switching system. Through simulations, we illustrate the tradeoffs between the complexity of the optical switches in the second stage and the performance of the system, measured in terms of the throughput, delay and loss rate.

The underpredicted acceleration of Hurricane Opal by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's (NCEP) operational eta model during landfall and over-land passage is investigated using quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV) inversion. We identify and explain model errors in the evironmental steering flow using a systematic procedure including removal of Opal's cyclonic circulation that builds upon previous work. The eastern ridge associated with the anticyclonic QGPV was persistently forecasted too weak and too distant from Opal, though the forecast of this feature improved at shorter ranges. The anticyclonic contribution to the retrieved flow increased from $-$11% of the observed vector (inhibiting the motion) to 15% (aiding the motion). This increase of 3.8 m s$ sp{-1}$ is alone sufficient to explain the slow forecast. The eta forecasts likely did not sufficiently resolve the advection downstream of storm outflow and subsequent ridge building. This error propagated through the forecast cycle and prevented phase-locking with the ridge and increased flow. Representation of the ridge improved following advection of the outflow over the more dense U.S. upper air network. This study emphasizes the need for accurate upper-air analyses and offers a real-time application of QGPV inversion that decomposes the steering flow. The need for further research into the intimate relationship between storm intensity and subsequent storm track is stated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gyakum, John R.

Thus, exon 8 codes for three amino acid residues (Gin-Asp-Gln), which may potentially be present or absent in human prosaposin. Recently, it was shown that the alternative splicing of the prosaposin gene may be tissue specific and that a possible function of the three amino acid insertion could be to alter the binding specificity of saposin B towards different glycosphingolipids. We have recently cloned the murine SGP-1 gene and found that it also contains the 9 bp exon 8. In the present study we have used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to study the distribution of the alternatively spliced mRNAs in several tissues. We have also used Northern Blot analysis to confirm the expression and stability of these transcripts, and light microscope immunocytochemistry to examine whether or not alternative splicing affects the translation of the mRNA transcripts into mature proteins.

Results showed that preservatives could completely inhibit mold growth for 2-40d depending on concentration and pH used. Gas packaging (60% or 80% CO$ sb2$), oxygen absorbents, alone or in combination with potassium sorbate, could also inhibit mold growth for $&gt;$40d at ambient storage temperature using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach. The effects of various methods of applying potassium sorbate into pizza crusts via direct incorporation into the batter, surface spraying, and impregnation of packaging material with potassium sorbate to control mold spoilage of pizza crusts were also investigated. Results showed that the antimicrobial effect of potassium sorbate was negligible when the packaging material was impregnated with the inhibitor but more pronounced when it was incorporated directly into the dough or sprayed onto the product's surface. The inhibitory effect of potassium sorbate increased as both the pH and the inoculum level decreased. Shelf life studies using low concentrations of potassium sorbate (1000 and 2000 p.p.m.) and MAP, alone and in combination with each other, showed that potassium sorbate, gas packaging or oxygen absorbents (Ageless FX) could extend the shelf life of pizza crusts and decrease the growth rate of molds, bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, when pizza crusts were packaged in 60% CO$ sb2$ or with an oxygen absorbent, in combination with potassium sorbate (1000-2000 p.p.m.), a shelf life of 42d was possible without compromising the sensory shelf life of the product.

In particular, we recall the Gleason cover of a topos which is a universal construction of a De Morgan topos covering the given one. This construction is then used in connection with the Hahn-Banach theorem in any topos of sheaves on a locale, and in order to obtain the real closure of an ordered field in any topos of sheaves on a Boolean space. We also show that an algebraic analogue of (DML) may be related to the Zariski spectrum of a ring.

The interaction of the $ alpha$-hydroxycarbonyl moiety of a reducing sugar with an amino compound can result in a complex series of changes. The identification and isolation of the key intermediates, known as the Amadori rearrangement product (ARP) and Heyns rearrangement product (HRP), can provide a greater understanding of the browning process. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of 1-hydroxyacetane provided qualitative and quantitative information of the behavior of this $ alpha$-hydroxycarbonyl compound in various aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. The carbonyl peaks (in the 1750-1700 $ rm cm sp{-1}$ absorption region) due to the keto and aldehydo forms of 1-hydroxyacetone (acetol) in the pure state and in deuterium oxide $ rm(D sb2O)$ were assigned. Upon addition of the acid-base catalysts (triethylamine, 5% NaOD and 5% DCl) additional peaks were detected in the alkene region (1700-1650 $ rm cm sp{-1})$ due to the formation of enediols by enolization. The examination of analogous hydroxycarbonyl structures (1-hydroxy-2-butanone, glyceraldehyde, glycoaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone) provided the means to confirm the assignments of the carbonyl and enediol bands. The integrated intensity of the carbonyl peak of 1-hydroxyacetone centered at 1720 $ rm cm sp{-1}$ was determined for dilute solutions in $ rm D sb2O.$ The integrated molar absorptivity of the carbonyl band was calculated to be 3674 L/mol/cm. In addition, the effect of concentration and temperature on dimer dissociation was investigated. The effect of solvent and temperature on enolization was also studied. Time run analysis of the carbonyl-amine reaction of 1-hydroxyacetone with pyrrolidine provided the basis for a kinetic study of the rearrangement process in the early stage of Maillard reaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yaylayan, V.

Cycles were initiated by the periodic build-up and decline of fourth instar larvae. These major competitors for food resources appear to be responsible for the release of a cascade of events which allowed the intermittent flow through of larvae from the first to the third instar. Under both optimal and suboptimal conditions of food availability, the introduction of high densities of P. elegans cercariae resulted in a decrease in the production of adult mosquitoes. Although the parasite reduced competition by preferentially removing fourth instar larvae and hastened the development of surviving instars, such survivors were exposed to the effects of the parasite as soon as they reached the fourth instar.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rau, M.

Recently, the recessive rfp allele, or a tightly linked gene, was found to act as a dominant gene, designated Mmt, in controlling the production of additional, smaller transcripts of two other mitochondrial loci. The results presented in this thesis reveal that Mmt-specific transcripts lack sequences found at the $5 sp prime$ end of the full-length transcripts of these loci and contain a common sequence, UUGUGG, which maps immediately downstream of their $5 sp prime$ termini. A similar sequence, UUGUUG, is found within orf224 downstream of the major Rfp-specific $5 sp prime$ transcript terminus; these hexanucleotide sequences may serve as recognition motifs in the generation of Mmt- and Rfp-specific transcripts. These results suggest that Rfp/Mmt is a novel nuclear locus affecting the expression of multiple mitochondrial gene regions, with different alleles or haplotypes affecting different mitochondrial genes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brown, Gregory G.

The three regions experience similar climatic conditions (semi-arid Mediterranean climate) but have different soil textures, varying from sandy loam to clay. The study involved 74 farms all of which had been irrigating for more than 3 years prior to this study, with well water of different salinity values (0.44 to 14.1 dS/m). All of these farms operated with similar cultural practices. Results indicate that the wheat yield response function to irrigation water salinity differs between the three regions. The irrigation water threshold salinity value beyond which wheat yield started to decline, was found to be 6.5 dS/m, 3.5 dS/m and 1.2 dS/m in the Khabur low plains; Aleppo south plains and Shedadeh area respectively. Wheat was more salt tolerant to irrigation water salinity in sandy loam soils than clay loam soils. The three threshold values obtained in this study are different from the "universal" value of 4 dS/m which is proposed in current literature. The "universal" value was obtained from artificially salinized field plots seeded under non-saline conditions. In addition, it was found that salt accumulation in the soil profile increases as soil clay content increases. The results demonstrate the necessity of establishing regional water quality criteria when planning the use of saline water sources for irrigation in semi-arid regions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bonnell, R.
