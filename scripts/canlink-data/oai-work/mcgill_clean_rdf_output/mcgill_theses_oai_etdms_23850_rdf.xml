The ability of predicting swell, using rheological properties of the resin, would help the design and operation of plastics processing equipment. Different techniques for predicting swell are reviewed. A computer program has been written to predict steady-state, isothermal extrudate swell in annular and circular dies. The equations of motion and continuity have been solved along with selected constitutive relations. Newtonian, power-law and the viscoelastic Maxwell and Giesekus rheological models were chosen. The Galerkin formulation of the Finite Element Method has been used to solve the system of differential equations. The predictions for Newtonian, power-law and Maxwell models have been verified with existing experimental or numerical results when available. The results for the swell of Maxwell and Giesekus fluids have been compared at the same levels of elasticity. The effects of inertia and gravity on extrudate position and swell have been studied. Different geometries of an annular die (converging, diverging) were also examined.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn98f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999784v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plastics Technology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Applied Mechanics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m5273"><dcterms:title>The performance of distributed simulation with clustered processes /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boukerche, Azzedine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As the applications being modeled by discrete event simulation become more complex the resources required for these simulations become prohibitively large. Distributed simulation offers a promising solution to this problem, but creates a new set of issues and trade-offs. This thesis focuses on distributed simulation algorithms based on a conservative approach with clustered processes. A multiprocessor based, distributed simulation testbed PARADIS, has been designed and implemented on a hypercube iPSC/2. Using this testbed, the performance of the TNE/DLTNE algorithms is investigated. A distributed knot detection algorithm and a distributed artificial deadlock algorithm were developed in order to detect, respectively, inter-processor deadlocks and artificial blocking. The later algorithm avoids PARADIS having to call the knot detection algorithm too quickly. Empirical performance evaluation of PARADIS showed that a significant speedup over a serial simulation might be obtained. The experiments showed also that the number of processes that are assigned to a single processor and the lookahead play an important role in the speedup of the simulation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz44g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m5273</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A00000114j"><dcterms:title>The neighborhood : a progressive presentation from the traditional to contemporary</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ali-Zadeh Rastan, Soheil</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the phenomenon of communal habitation--from a traditional scene to a contemporary vista--in terms of a historical progression.

In other words, urbanization, according to this thesis, is neither a mere physical pattern exhibited by fellow architects and planners, nor a sole social model manifested by some social reformers. Rather, it is a communal art the beauty of which is adorned by dwellers' goodwill and their spirit--a spirit that consequentially achieves a pleasing physical milieu, and attains a pleasant social environment.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf75x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000114j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neighborhood</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50ts757"><dcterms:title>The Shajarat Al-Kawn attributed to Ibn ʻArabī : an analytical study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Alibhai, Shams</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study aims to understand the subject matter of the Shajarat al-Kawn.

Forty female volunteers between the ages of 24 and 45 completed the MPASS Tour and subsequently the Evaluation Questionnaire. Results showed a positive response to the MPASS Tour. The participants generally enjoyed using the computer program and indicated that the MPASS Tour had increased their awareness of their attitudes, preferences, and goals related to physical activity.

Analysis of complex I subunits indicated deficient synthesis of the 20 kDa subunit in the severely affected patient. In the milder patient, subunit abnormalities were not detected. Fibroblasts from a patient with facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD), showed reduced oxidation of alanine and succinate through the ETC.

As the work progresses, this theme becomes omnipresent, in the narrator under the guise of a wish; this theme is travel. At first glance, it is the very movement of travelling (real and imaginary) which propels the text. Although all Proustian characters travel, the richness of this theme is most eloquently expressed in Marcel. For this character, travelling takes on many forms: dreamed, accomplished, and written; it becomes at once real and mythic. It has often been said that the Recherche told the story of a literary career. Given this, it seems that the search for writing is an integral part of this narrative of travel. Let us say that the very construction of the story, which is more related to the imaginary than to a real description of Venice, emphasizes the transition of reading to writing. It is this passage we wish to illustrate in this master's thesis; for Marcel, the act of reading is intimately connected to his desire of travel.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n50v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rm52k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Venice (Italy) -- In literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proust, Marcel, 1871-1922 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Travel in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462664c"><dcterms:title>The effect of two types of video tape instructions on the resequencing performance of female tennis players at different skill levels /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gendron, Stanley C.

Scalar quantization is the first approach evaluated. Results show that Line Spectral Frequencies require significantly fewer bits than reflection coefficients for comparable performance. The second approach investigated is the use of vector-scalar quantization. In the first stage, vector quantization is performed. The second stage consists of a bank of scalar quantizers which code the vector errors between the original LPC coefficients and the components of the vector of the quantized coefficients. The approach is to couple the vector and scalar quantization stages. Every codebook vector is compared to the original LPC coefficient vector to produce error vectors. The second innovation into vector-scalar quantization is the incorporation of a small adaptive codebook to the large fixed codebook. Frame-to-frame correlation of the LPC coefficients is exploited at no extra cost in bits. The performance of the vector-scalar quantization using the two new techniques is better than that of the scalar coding techniques currently used in conventional LPC coders.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000115t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h147</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak35695584"><dcterms:title>Gravity and light : looking through the architecture of Jean Cocteau</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Galvin, Terrance</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis examines a select amount of poesie by the artist Jean Cocteau, and through interpretation, explores the architecture of his work.

The model used is a direct extension of the Pink model for the main transition of pure lipid bilayers. Cholesterol is introduced as a bulky, rigid molecule with no internal degrees of freedom. The model is able to account for the chain melting of lipid molecules, and is expected to be valid at low cholesterol concentrations. A minimal model for the transport of ions across membranes is used to predict the changes in the passive permeability of lipid-cholesterol bilayers for different cholesterol concentrations and different lipid chain lengths. The model assigns different probabilities of transfer to bulk, clusters and interfaces. The main assumption is that, defects due to bad packing at interfacial regions, cause the membrane to be leaky and allow the ions to permeate it. Therefore the model assigns a high probability of transfer to the interfacial regions. A peak in the permeability is observed near the transition temperature, which is in accord with experimental data. The results show an increase in the passive ion permeability for increasing cholesterol concentration for the three systems under consideration. Also, an increase in the membrane permeability is predicted for decreasing chain length for all the cholesterol concentrations studied.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t319h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db06b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biophysics, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451j68v"><dcterms:title>Medieval topics : perception, rhetoric and representation in the Middle Ages</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fluck, Katherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an architectural investigation of perception, depth and representation.

The non-perspectival, medieval representations studied in this paper, are not looked upon as primitive forerunners of renaissance perspective, but as being expressive of a completely different notion and location of depth. In an attempt to access this "other" depth, the move from nonperspectival to perspectival perception and representation is looked at in relation to the change in perceptual values, brought on by the move from the largely oral culture of the Middle Ages, to the increasing textual culture of Renaissance and Modern ages. Perhaps without the fixity, neutrality and disengagement inherent in both perspectival and textual perception, architectural depth might return to the active world of human experience.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts77s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j68v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Perspective</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture, Medieval</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Composition, proportion, etc.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc85h"><dcterms:title>Sentence processing strategies by bilinguals</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Berdugo Oviedo, Gloria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sentence processing strategies by 10 bilingual speakers (Spanish: L1 and English: L2) were compared to 10 monolingual speakers of Spanish and 10 of English.

The structures, primarily of the form A$ ell$-Bi-Se-metal were fabricated by depositing thin films of the elements involved with evaporation techniques. All the diodes prepared showed rectification, which was strongest for the T$ ell$ samples and weakest for the Pt samples. Measurements made on the diodes included current-voltage, as well as, capacitance and resistance as a function of bias and frequency. In addition, preliminary photoelectric measurements were carried out for the first time on the Se-metal devices to determine the Schottky barrier heights. At low frequencies, an anomalous non-Faraday inductive effect was observed in many of the samples and in Se-T$ ell$ devices in particular. In these samples, the effect appeared to be correlated to the presence of the semiconducting compound SeT$ ell$, which was detected by x-ray diffraction in the samples after several days of storage. With Pt counterelectrode samples, inverse rectification was observed, due possibly to the formation of an ohmic counterelectrode contact but a rectifying back contact. From current versus voltage and capacitance versus voltage measurements, it was found that, despite the presence of interface states, the Schottky barrier heights determined for freshly made samples decreased with increase of metal work function.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j70w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp71n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bj341"><dcterms:title>A tuberculosis outbreak in a native community : HLA linkage analysis and evaluation of diagnostic tests</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Miller, Mark A.

Of 66 evaluated subjects, 52 (79%) became newly-infected, twenty-four (46%) of which developed disease. Chest radiography was the single best diagnostic test (sensitivity 92%; specificity 100%), after which neither demographic variables nor skin test reactivity detected additional disease in a multivariate discriminant analysis. Without radiography, tuberculin skin test reactivity and the subject's age together were significant but poor predictors of disease (model sensitivity 74% and specificity 64%). All diseased adults, but only 46% of children, produced culture-positive specimens (p = 0.006). Therefore, children with suspected disease should be treated, regardless of culture results. No linkage was found between HLA type and disease occurrence in any model. Higher lod scores were obtained by reclassifying subjects' phenotypes, but linkage was excluded up to a recombination fraction of 0.20. Neither HLA class I loci nor a closely-linked recessive susceptibility locus is a major factor in tuberculosis disease development in this Canadian Indian family.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r4234.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bj341</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58pf126"><dcterms:title>Boiotia in the geometric and archaic periods : population, settlement, and colonisation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Classics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>De Angelis, Franco</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines Boiotia in the Geometric and Archaic periods (ca. 1050-500 BC), concentrating on three aspects in particular, namely population, settlement, and colonisation. A brief chapter introduces the reader to Boiotia, the setting, which gives the relevant background to later developments. In chapter II, it is argued that Boiotia participated rather extensively in emigration during the Dark Age, leaving the homeland, with the exception of a few refuge settlements, somewhat denuded of its previous population. The following chapter not only builds on this latter point archaeologically but also looks at the development of settlement, focusing primarily on the fact that settlement, and presumably population, grew steadily in Boiotia until well into the Classical period. The final chapter is divided into two parts; it first examines the secure cases of Boiotian colonisation and then the doubtful or possible instances. After considering possible socio-political factors, the discussion is taken in another direction. The search for metals is suggested, and the study ends with a plea for a systematic study of whether land-shortage was really as paramount a cause of Greek colonisation as presently believed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh804.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf126</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Voiōtia (Greece) -- Colonization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Voiōtia (Greece) -- Population</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p5767"><dcterms:title>A study of some aspects of intensive management of spring barley in south western Quebec /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Maloba, Elizabeth Wanga</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three experiments were carried out to evaluate the applicability of the intensive management system to barley production in Quebec. In the first experiment, the effects of three levels of nitrogen fertilizer and ethephon (Cerone) on the performance of cultivars were tested. The aim of the second experiment was to test the effects of fungicide application and row width. In the third experiment, conventional and intensive management techniques were tested on three soil types. High levels of nitrogen increased the grain protein content and thus improved the feed quality of spring barley. Application of ethephon reduced plant height but also reduced the number of grains per head. A fungicide by row width interaction resulted in a reduced seed size and weight in the narrow rows. The effects of intensive management on yield were inconsistent and were influenced to a large extent by the prevailing weather and soil conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655h808.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p5767</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Barley -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Barley -- Yields.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wp02t"><dcterms:title>The ambient electromagnetic environment in metropolitan hospitals /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boisvert, Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Electric field levels between 30 and 1000 MHz were predicted using a free space propagation model, and then measured in three major hospitals in downtown Montreal.

Although the absolute values of predictions were often unreliable, they acceptably predicted the type of electromagnetic environment actually observed at different hospitals. Results from both sets of measurements were closely related, suggesting continued future development of lower-cost BOTES measurement techniques. None of the fields encountered were above the limit prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) susceptibility standard for medical devices. Correlations of survey results and of previous reports of device malfunctions in the rooms surveyed suggest that compliance with the FDA standard should be mandatory rather than voluntary. Results obtained by industry-standard techniques were used to simulate the effect of measured electromagnetic environments on typical biomedical equipment, and the simulations show that disruptions of the normal operation of medical devices are to be expected.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf13g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wp02t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c393g"><dcterms:title>Detection of nucleoplasmic glycoconjugates using lectin cytochemistry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Paniccia, Rocco</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The lectins Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA 1), Ricinus communis 1 (RCA 1), Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA), and Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) which are specific for L-fucose, D-galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and D-mannose respectively, have been used to localize cytochemically the presence of these sugar residues in certain human, mammalian, and amphibian cell types.

On the North Island, females carry univalent W chromosome and both sexes have 0 to 15 supernumerary chromosomes. Frogs from Great Barrier Island have a conventional 2n = 22 karyotype, with no sex chromosome differentiation in C-banded mitotic chromosomes. However, the lampbrush chromosomes of a Great Barrier Island female show evidence of heterogamety. This suggests that presumed ancestral female heterogamety has persisted on Great Barrier Island and given rise to a WZZ-female/ZZ-male sex chromosome system on the North Island. A repeated sequence, Lh1, varies greatly within populations in copy number and distribution on genomic EcoRI fragments. In situ hybridization revealed the variable presence of large Lh1 arrays on supernumerary chromosomes and two autosomes. The extensive Lh1 variability implies that, like the supernumeraries, it is more selfish than functional in the L. hochstetteri genome.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r424d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150k37g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Leiopelmatidae -- Evolution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leiopelmatidae -- Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vp72x"><dcterms:title>Some properties of three-way layouts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bérubé, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We consider various properties of the general three-way layout in experimental design, and begin with the information or C-matrices that play a key role, particularly with row-column and two-way elimination of heterogeneity designs.

Four different types of canonical correlations and associated canonical efficiency factors are considered and their connection with connectedness and orthogonality examined.
