Ninety-one amateur golfers completed two questionnaires and a participant profile. The perception of their physical ability in general was measured by the Physical Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Perceived Golf Ability Questionnaire was developed to assess their perceptions of golfing self-efficacy. Respondents were asked to play 15 consecutive golf games and record their scores on an especially designed detailed scorecard. The participants' data were divided into five levels of performance based on their handicap indexes. It was hypothesized that players having greater skills (low handicap indexes) would have higher general perceived physical self-efficacy, than those having lesser skills (high handicap indexes). It was also hypothesized that the more golf-specific self-efficacy measure would be a better predictor of performance on the golf course. ANOVA and hierarchical regression analyses were employed to determine the predictive values of the two measures of perceived physical self-efficacy of actual golf performance. The general physical self-efficacy measure did not predict performance whereas the more golf-specific measure was a significant predictor of performance on the golf course. The ability of specific items of the golf self-efficacy measure to predict performance of various shots in golf was also examined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Neil, Graham (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655j529.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r71q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Golf</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-efficacy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Athletic ability</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sports -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zs60z"><dcterms:title>Rhetorical dimensions of speech representation : a study of the speeches of Jesus in the gospel of Mark</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fast, Lesley D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis argues that non-argumentational strategies of persuasion in the major-length speeches of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark account for a considerable part of the author's intended persuasive effect. Gospel criticism has typically read these speeches as deposits of possible authentic words of Jesus, as evidence of Christology or as links in the plot of Mark's narrative while rhetorical criticism of the Gospels has focused upon Jesus' shorter utterances as argumentation within episodes. However, the speeches are not consistently logical or argumentational and they stand out in the larger narrative as extended stretches of Jesus' voice. Treating the four longest units of Jesus' speech as rhetorical units in their own right (Mk 4:11--32; 9:39--50; 12:1--11; 13:5--37), the thesis attempts to show how these texts might have worked to persuade Mark's audience towards change in action or attitude. Although neither argumentation at the rational-conceptual level nor the context of the narrative are denied, attention is focused on the rhetorical force of the speeches themselves and the features designed to affect the audience at the level of feeling or emotion. Persuasive goals are discernable in the speeches not only in what Jesus argues but also in the way he talks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henderson, Ian H.

The assumption behind the racial dichotomy that defines whites and blacks in oppositional positive and negative terms presumes that identity is structured along race stereotypes. This belief is evident in the differing responses to Eminem's affiliation with hip-hop culture and through the extent in which he employs hip-hop cultural forms, styles, and traits into his rap image. Although a popular mainstream artist, Eminem (and his "thug" Slim Shady alter ego) maintains his credibility within hip-hop circles by using elements of parody, play, and persona to depict his satirical views of American life. Finally, the systematic attacks against Eminem that label him as deviant are rarely levelled against other black rappers, exposing the different societal expectations that exist for whites and blacks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, William (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd93s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57ns896</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music and race</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hip-hop</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43p011w"><dcterms:title>Effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on exercise-induced muscle injury</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Germain, Geneviève</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of HBO2 therapy on exercise-induced muscle damage.

Temporary muscle soreness was created using a single-leg eccentric exercise task involving the quadriceps femoris. Over the next 14 days, measurements were obtained on muscle soreness, leg circumference, quadriceps peak torque, quadriceps average power, fatigue and plasma creative kinase. After eccentric exercise, plasma CK levels and perceived muscle soreness were elevated but were not different between HBO2 and control groups.

The efficiency of this regulation suggests that PP2C and CFTR are associated within a regulatory complex. Previous work has shown that PP2C and CFTR can be co-immunoprecipitated and reversibly coupled by exposing cell lysates to the hydrophilic cross-linker dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidyl proprionate]. While it is clear that PP2C can associate with CFTR, the nature of the interaction between them has not been defined. The goal of this study was to identify specific region(s) within CFTR that mediate this interaction. The interaction between CFTR and PP2C was strong enough to be reproduced in the absence of cross-linking agents, supporting its physiological relevance. We then translated CFTR in vitro and incubated it with cell lysates containing endogenous PP2C, however interaction between the proteins was not observed under these conditions. Since the association seemed to require some factor present in cells, a distal fragment of CFTR was expressed in vivo and used for pull down assays. PP2C was co-purified under these conditions, suggesting an interaction between PP2C and the C-Tail of CFTR. To further narrow down the region of interaction, three residues within the C-Tail (Y1424, LL1430/1431) that had been shown previously to interact with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, a known PP2C substrate and possible targeting protein) were mutated to alanines. When this mutant was used in a pull-down assay, no association with PP2C was observed, consistent with a role for AMPK-binding residues and AMPK in the association of PP2C with CFTR.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hanrahan, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t96r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq425</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139394v"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of conventional and microwave heating systems for food processing based on TTI kinetics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tong, Zhen, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Thermal kinetics of enzymatic time-temperature integrators (TTIs) were experimentally evaluated under both conventional and microwave heating systems in the pasteurization temperature range (50 to 90°C).

Normal elderly volunteers were recruited based on their subjective complaints of memory and/or depression and grouped as a LOW, MODERATE or HIGH cortisol secretor, based on salivary cortisol levels measured over the course of one year. Subjects were administered neuropsychological tests and psychosocial and environmental questionnaires that have been known to differ with different stress profiles. Results revealed that subjective complaints of memory and depressive symptomatology were not significantly related to hypersecretion of cortisol. Diurnal and seasonal cortisol secretory patterns did, however, differentiate HIGH secretors from MODERATE and LOW secretors such that there was a loss of diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity in the HIGH secretor group. Additionally, psychosocial questionnaires focusing on locus of control revealed that LOW secretors externalized control mechanisms more than MODERATE secretors. The possibility of lack of cortisol rhythmicity as a correlate of chronic hypersecretion of cortisol in young-elderly individuals as well as changes in locus of control mechanisms during aging are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lupien, Sonia J.

The overall aims of this three-year study were to determine whether the feeding habits of the two raptor species are selective and to determine if waterfowl is a preferred prey group. The diet was determined through pellet analysis, prey remains and direct nest observations during the nestling growth period. Availability of most prey species was assessed through small mammal trapping and by conducting waterfowl censuses. It was determined that both raptors select for duck species.

First, a screen was performed to identify mutants with altered numbers of intestinal nuclei using a reporter transgene specific to the intestinal nuclei. The intestine displays three different cell division patterns; mitosis, karyokinesis and endoreplication, therefore, in this screen we could potentially isolate mutants in genes affecting any of these different cell cycles. An F2 semi-clonal screen was performed and mutants with fewer or supernumerary numbers of intestinal nuclei were isolated. One mutant, rr31, with twice the wild type complement of intestinal nuclei was mapped and the defect was subsequently shown to be due to a gain-of-function mutation in the cell cycle phosphatase cdc-25.1. Further characterization of the cdc-25.1(gf) mutant, showed that the extra intestinal cells arise from an additional division of the intestinal cell precursors during embryogenesis, and that this phenotype is unique to the intestinal lineage.

Shift-share based decomposition analyses the magnitude and pattern of disparity and controls for industrial structure. Weighted regression is used to combine provincial and rural/urban effects. The findings support theories that emphasize provinces as units of analysis. The rural/urban results gave qualified support to urban theory.

Interestingly, overexpression of Bcl-2 in these PrP-/- cells protects against serum deprivation, suggesting that PrP may function like Bcl-2 to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. Based on this idea, this thesis demonstrates that PrP is a potent protective agent against Bax-mediated death of cultured human primary neurons. This neuroprotective function appears to require the presence of the octapeptide repeat region of PrP. Surprisingly, while the majority of PrP resides on the cell surface as a glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored protein, the GPI anchor is not required for the neuroprotective function of PrP. In contrast, PrP needs trafficking past the cis-Golgi to be effective against Bax since its neuroprotective function is sensitive to brefeldin A and monensin treatments. On the other hand, we have established a yeast-based assay to analyse the function of PrP against Bax. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>LeBlanc, Andrea C.

The following treatments were studied: no-till (NT), reduced tillage (RT), and conventional tillage (CT) practices, with residue (R) and without residue (NR). Nitrogen fertilizer was applied at a rate of 180 kg/ha in granular form (experiment I), and in solution form a year later (experiment II). In both experiments, water was applied 5 times over 3 to 4 weeks duration, with each application lasting for 30 minutes. Each column received an average of 24 mm water in experiment I and 32 mm in experiment II. Soil moisture contents were measured and water for $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N concentration determination sampled at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m depths, following each water application. In each experiment I, higher nitrate-nitrogen concentrations ($ lbrack rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N)), occurred at the 0.1 and 0.2 m soil layers in RT and CT treatments initially, but less leached to lower layers, while more $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N leached to lower depths (below 0.4 m) in the NT treatment. In experiment II, more $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N leached below 0.4 m in RT and CT than in NT treatments. Conventional tillage exhibited the lowest drainage rates. Tillage and residue effects were significant only at early stages (4 hours or before) at some depths of experiment I ($P&lt;0.05$). Maximum $ lbrack rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N) occurred at 0.4 m depth in all treatments. LEACHM-N estimated more $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N leaching below 0.4 m in RT and CT treatments than in NT treatment. The model performed poorly only immediately after fertilizer application, showing up to 50% deviation from observed data. Although LEACHM-N overpredicted $ lbrack rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N) in the 0.2 m soil layers in all treatments, estimations remained within standard deviations of observed data. NTRM performed well below 0.4 m depths, but often underpredicted $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N leaching at shallower depths. From both the laboratory experiments and mathematical simulations it was concluded that when fertilizer is applied in granular form, no till practice is undesirable because deeper $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N leaching (below 0.4 m) occurs. Reduced tillage may be the preferred choice in such a situation. When fertilizer is applied in solution, reduced and conventional tillage practices are undesirable because deeper $ rm NO sb{3 sp{-}}$-N leaching occurred. No till practice may be a better choice in such a case.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C. A.

Drying of black liquor to solids contents in excess of 92% is a pre-requisite for some of the new black liquor recovery cycles being examined. An experimental drum dryer was designed and built to evaluate the performance characteristics and effects of various operating parameters thereon. Appropriate ranges of parameters such as steam jet temperature and velocity were examined experimentally to quantify the optimal operating conditions for the formation of black liquor film on the drum surface as well as the drying kinetics. To permit scale up of the laboratory scale data to industrial size a two-region mathematical model was developed to simulate the impinging jet flow and the drying of the black liquor film. Both polar and three dimensional cylindrical coordinate systems were employed for solving the governing transport equations. A modified low Reynolds number version of the $k sim varepsilon$ turbulence model was selected after a careful evaluation of the predictions of various $k sim varepsilon$ models for impingement flow and heat transfer. The computed heat transfer distribution on the film surface was applied as the boundary condition for the quasi unsteady one-dimensional diffusion model for the liquor film. Agreement between experimental data and results of the model was found to be satisfactory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mujumdar, A. S. (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kubes, G. J.

The mirage effect technique was applied to the dynamic diffusion of solutions containing ionic species through a perfluorosulphonated ionomer membrane.

The algorithms presented here are simple, more general, and/or more efficient than existing methods for solving similar problems.

(Dajan James)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Elevated glucoconicoid levels have becn shown to inhibit synaptogenesis, enhance susceptibility to excitotoxic insults and impede normal central nervous system (CNS) development. Though virtually every cell in the hippocampus expresses relatively high levels of both MR and GR, the various cell fields differ considerably in their sensitivity to glucoconicoids. This thesis examined the cellular expression of MR and GR using in situ hybridization in animal and human models known to encompass changes in hippocampal neuron plasticity and/or survival. Entorhinal cortex lesioning (ECL), a well characterized model of reactive synaptogenesis in the rat, was found to cause a transient yet robust decrease in GR mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus 24 hours following lesioning while CAl levels increased significantly as compared to sham-treated controls. In contrast, MR mRNA expression was unaltered in all cell fields. This study suggested that the transient decline in GR mRNA observed during a period of active synaptogenesis might dampen the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on this process. Since stimulation of the entorhinal cortex is known to result in intrahippocampal release of glutamate, we tested the hypothesis that increased glutamate release might underlie these changes in GR. For this purpose, animals injected with kainic acid (KA) were examined at several intervals following injection. KA injection, which results in both direct stimulation of glutamate receptors as well as massive release of glutamate, was also found to selectively decrease GR mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus but not in CAl over the first 12-24 hour post-injection. At longer time intervals, GR mRNA levels eventually decreased in the CAl as compared to sham-injected controls, as expected from the cell loss occurring in this region. Interestingly, MR mRNA levels displayed a uniform decrease in all hippocampal cell fields. These findings suggested that glutamate was likely to be the signal regulating GR expression in the hippocampus. Moreover, the selective reduction in GR expression in the dentate gyrus may decrease susceptibility of these cells to glucoconicoid endangerment. We also investigated the role of corticosteroid receptors as mediators of neuronal plasticity during normal hippocampal development in the rat, a period characterized by high glutamate levels. Overall GR mRNA expression was low during the first 2 weeks of development coinciding with a period of process outgrowth and synapse formation. GR mRNA levels were even lower in actively dividing dentate granule neurons during this same period. Highest levels of GR rnRNA expression, occurring at different times for both CA cell fields and dentate granule cells, coincided precisely with their previously described periods of final stage maturation. Since increased hippocampal glutamate release is a common feature in these models, our findings suggest that cell-specific dynamic changes in corticosteroid receptor expression in response to glutamate may underlie the differential effects of glucoconicoids on synaptic reorganization and neuronal survival in the dentale gyrus. It has been well established that in aged animais, decreased hippocampal corticosteroid receptors are associated with glucocorticoid hypersecretion, hippocampal neuropathology and cognitive impairments. Surprisingly, we found no change in individual cellular expression MR and GR mRNA in aged, cognitively-impaired and cognitively-unimpaired rats as compared to young adults. Similarly, no difference in the expression of either conicosteroid receptor was observed in Alzheimer's patients and age-matched control subjects. Since elevated glucocorticoids are hallmarks of both these models, we have postulated that relatively elevated levels of corticosteroid receptors within hippocampal neurons in these models may enhance their susceptibility to glucocorticoids' deleterious effects on plasticity and neuronal survival.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cette these examine l'expression cellulaire des minerclocorticoides (MR) and des glucocorticoides (GR) par hybridation in situ dans plusieurs modeles, animal et humain, demontrant des changements importants de plasticite neuronale et/ou de survie neuronale dans l'hippocampe. La lesion du cortex entorhinal chez le rat, un modele bien connu de synaptogenese reactive, produit une baisse importante et transitoire des niveaux d'ARN messager (ARNm) des GR dans le gyrus dente pendant les premieres 24 heures apres lesion, alors que dans le champ CA1 de l'hippocampe, ces niveaux sont significativement eleves pas rapport aux animaux controles. A l'oppose, l'expression des ARNm des MR demeure inchangee dans toutes les regions del'hippocampe. Cette etude demontre que la baisse transitoire d'ARNm des GR observee dans une periode de synaptogenese accrue, pourrait temperer les effets inhibiteurs des glucocorticoides dans ce processus. Puisqu'il est bien etabli que la stimulation du cortex entorhinal cause une liberation importante de glutamate dans l'hippocampe, nous avons postule que cette augmentation pouvait causer les variations d'expression observees ci-dessus. Nous avons examine des animaux injectes a l'acide kainique (AK) a differentes intervalles apres le traitement. Au dela, les niveaux d'ARNm des GR diminuent dans le CA1 par rapport aux controles, compte tenue de la perte cellulaire dans cette region. De facon interessante, des diminutions des niveaux d'ARNm des MR ont ete observe dans toutes les regions de l'hippocampe. Puisque nos etudes demontrent que des changements dynamiques de l'expression des ARNm des corticosteroides peuvent influencer la capacite du neurone a former de nouvelles synapses ou a survivre, nous avons examine le role des recepteurs corticosteroides en tant que mediateurs de la plasticite neuronal pendant le developpement de l'hippocampe chez le rat. Les niveaux d'ARNm pour les GR sont encore plus faibles dans les neurones du gyrus dente que subissent une division cellulaire rapide pendant cette periode. Les niveaux les plus eleves de l'expression des ARNm des GR dans les neurones du gyrus dente et ceux du CA1 sont atteints a des jours differents, qui coincident aussi a leur maturation finale. Sachant que les niveaux de glutamate sont eleves dans tous ces modeles, nos resultats suggerent qu'en reponse au glutamate, des changements dynamiques d'expression des recepteurs aux corticosteroides specifique a un type cellulaire peuvent expliquer les differents effets des glucocorticoides sur la reorganisation synaptique et la survie des neurones dans le gyrus dente. Il est bien etabli que chez le animaux ages, une baisse des recepteurs aux corticosteroides dans l'hippocampe est associee a l'hypersecretion des glucocorticoides, a certaines neuropathologies de l'hippocampe et aux deficits cognitifs, De facon inattendue, nous n'avons observe aucun changement dans l'expression cellulaire des MR ou des GR chez les animaux ages atteints ou non de deficits cognitifs par rapport a de jeunes adultes. De plus, aucun changement des niveaux d'expression des recepteurs aux corticosteroides n'a ete observe dans le tissus de patients atteints de la maladie d'Alzheimer par rapport aux sujets controles. Puisque le taux eleves en glucocorticoide est caracteristique de ces deux modeles, des niveaux relativement eleves en recepteurs aux corticosteroides des neurones pourraient augmenter leur susceptibilite aux effets nefastes des glucocorticoides sur la plasticite et la survie neuronale.
