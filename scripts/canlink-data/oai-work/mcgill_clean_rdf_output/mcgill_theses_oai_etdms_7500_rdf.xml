But there are other happy hunting-grounds in English literature for the romanticist-hunter. Romanticism is not an exotic on English soil, but a truly native growth. The poets of every century, except the eighteenth, have been eminently romantic, and whenever an attempt has been made to "guide the stream of poetry through artificial channels" of classicism, the native instinct has very soon asserted itself and led it back to its river-bed.

Mr. Pitts concludes: "This investigation clearly demonstrates the importance of considering the secondary stresses in all bridge construction in which the rivetted or rigid joint is used. It further shows the nature of the subject to be such as to forbid of a quick determination of these stresses, and the impossibility of deducing definite rules or formulae".

Chem. Soc.95,1457) it was proved that the rotation of a racemised amygdalin solution is independent of thenature and of the concentration of the alkali and that the equilibrium point is independent of the temperature and of the concentration of the amygdalin. It was pointed out that racemic amygdalin could be partially resolved into its optical isomers. L-amygdalin or ordinary amygdalin was obtained pure from the racemic by recrystallization from aqueous alcohol and afterwards from water. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Walker, J.

The desire to practise that particular type ofdeception seems to have been in the air, though the age was slow to detect the majority of those frauds, which, as would be expected, vary markedly in their importance and complexity. Most of them were contrived by men young in years, some of whom were endowed with genius, a few of whom possessed talent, and yet others who could boast of neither. The reason for their prevalence at that particular period cannot be assigned readily, apart from the fact that the age was unique in its credulity, inclined to believe almost any hoax.

(I). The lex talionis was the foundation of the penal codes. Retaliation was recognized as a private right but vengeance was limited to the infliction of an exact equivalent of the injury received. (2) As the power of the State grew, retaliation became more and more a public duty and the Mosaic Code was gradually modified by thepractice of sanctuary and by the system of composition for injuriessuch as Wergeld- a certain sum of money paid as compensation for a certain injury, (3). Under the feudal system the Church and the State gained control of the punishment of crime.
