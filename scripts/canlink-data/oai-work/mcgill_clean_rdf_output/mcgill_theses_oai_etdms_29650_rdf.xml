This dissertation presents results of a study on the morphology, ecology, cryotic structure, and thermal regime of 6 palsas sites in the Schefferville area and offers a new categorization of these features based on their cryotic structure. Eighteen palsa sites were located within a 35 km radius of Schefferville and six of these sites were investigated in detail. Palsas ranged from 5.6-59.0 m in length and up to 1.1 m in height. Most were located in valleys formed by the strong ridge-valley topography of the Labrador trough. Analysis of plant macrofossils suggests a successional change from hydrophilic species 10-15 cm below the palsa surface to relatively xerophilic species on the palsa surface. The transition zone between these vegetation associations indicates when the peat surface was heaved above the water table and thus, the initiation of the palsa. Surface vegetation on the palsas is used to indicate stage or category of development. Lichens and shrubs combined with small amounts of bare peat suggest a stable palsa. Large areas of bare peat on the surface of palsas resulting from erosion indicates degradation. Healthy sedges on the palsa surface indicate aggrading conditions. Ground ice within palsas ranged from small discontinuous ice lenses within peat to large lenses at the peat mineral soil contact and within the mineral soil. The depth of snow on the palsa surface varied on both a temporal and spatial basis. Active layer depths were not greatly affected by the depth of winter snow. Climatic parameters, such as heating degree days and bright sunshine hours, were found to predict maximum active layer depths more accurately than Stefan's equation. This dissertation shows that palsas with both organic and mineral soil cores are common permafrost features in the Schefferville area</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pollard, Wayne H.

We have focused on two adhesion molecules, E-cadherin and CD44, looking for changes in their expression in human colon cancer. The intercellular adhesion mediated by E-cadherin has been shown to be altered in cancer. We have investigated the expression of E-cadherin in normal and tumorigenic colorectal mucosa by immunohistochemistry. Tumor samples showed a down-regulation of expression correlating with the degree of tumor dedifferentiation. The second adhesion molecule, CD44, has been previously associated with metastasis in animal models. We have shown by Northern blotting that mRNA splice variants with domains IV + V are specifically over expressed in carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry showed redistribution of CD44 to the cellular basal membrane. Thus, the aberrant expression of E-cadherin and CD44 could be associated with malignant progression in colorectal cancer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jothy, S.

Chapter I examines the historical patterns in each of these jurisdictions in relation to judicial review of arbitration, concluding that current differences are largely due to divergent economic and social conditions persisting over a substantial period of time. Chapter II outlines the thinking behind the UNCITRAL Model Law on International and Commercial Arbitration, contrasting the theories which attract support in other States with those in favour in England and Scotland. Chapter III examines the conclusions of the Mustill and Dervaird Committees which considered implementation of the UNCITRAL Model Law in England and Scotland respectively.

Such practical attention to the concept of caring in critical care is crucial to the therapeutic nurse-family relationship. The purpose of this study was to design and test an instrument to measure the perceptions of family members and nurses about the relative importance of 50 nurse-caring behaviors towards family members in critical care. The Family Care-Q Instrument (FCQI) was originally based on the Care-Q Caring Assessment Instrument designed by Larson (1981). Items not relevant to family nursing in critical care were eliminated from Larson's instrument and new ones were formulated. The newly designed instrument identifies two categories of nurse-caring behaviors, expressive and instrumental, which were further delineated into six sub-categories based on Watson's Theory of Caring and the literature on caring behaviors. The FCQI was translated into French. Evidence of internal consistency, stability and validity was established partially during the development and testing of the FCQI. A pilot study using the instrument was conducted. Perceptions of 20 family members and 38 critical care nurses of most and least important nurse-caring behaviors towards family members in critical care were assessed. Similarities and differences in perceptions were identified between nurses and family members in specific behaviors and in the most and least important behaviors. Overall, critical care nurses ranked the category of instrumental caring behaviors as most important, while family members identified the expressive category as most important.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gooding, Barbara Ann (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s1419.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b24j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sh49g"><dcterms:title>Reliable isokinetic evaluation of strength and neuromuscular fatigue to determine the effects of pyridostigmine in subjects with post-poliomyelitis syndrome</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kilfoil, Monica Rosemonde</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two subject groups, seven PPS (4 males, 3 females) and 15 normal controls (9 females, 6 males) were matched on the basis of age, height and weight and participated in this study. Three repeated measurements were conducted to evaluate the reliability of isokinetic measurement of strength (at 4 velocities) and fatigability (25 reciprocal contractions at 3.14 rads.s$ sp{-1}$). Data from two subsequent test days were used to evaluate the fatigue responses of the PPS subjects while ON or OFF pyridostigmine. Significant strength differences were seen between the two groups, however there was no observed difference in the rate of development of fatigue. Reliability of strength was demonstrated for the knee extensors and flexors of the PPS subjects after three consecutive test days. Fatigability of the knee extensors in PPS subjects could be tested reliably after three test days but more time would be required for reliable performance of the knee flexors. Reliability of strength and fatigability was seen for both the knee extensor and flexors of the normal controls after only two consecutive test days. A beneficial effect of the drug on fatigability was not seen in the three female PPS subjects, but was demonstrated in one male subject. The drug appeared to have a beneficial effect on strength in the remaining three male subjects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>St-Pierre, D. M.

This hypothesis was primarily based on the observations that the two types have different sex ratios and recurrence rates and that the NTD cases within one sibship are concordant for NTD type. In order to test this, the above figures were calculated in a sample of NTD probands from Montreal and Newfoundland. The findings were not consistent with the hypothesis. However, a previously unreported finding was observed: the frequency of twinning was significantly higher in the near relatives of upper NTD probands than in those of lower NTD probands or of controls. This curious association between upper NTD's and twinning may be explained by a familial factor predisposing to a delay early in development. This delay could also explain any differences observed in upper and lower NTD groups.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fraser, F.

The within-subjects standard deviation was calculated as a measure of intensity of mood change. Thirty-eight physical education students (18 men; M = 23.8 yrs, SD = 2.1 and 20 women; M = 20.4 yrs, SD = 1.6) participated in this study. Mood changes were measured along the Pleasantness and Energetic dimensions of the Affect Grid. Performance was assessed using the Bassin Anticipation Timer. It was hypothesized that: the fast mood changers would incur greater timing errors than the slow mood changers, men would perform with less error than women, and stimulus speed would have a significant influence on timing error. Mixed factorial ANOVAs with repeated measures on the last factor were utilized to compare mean timing error scores: constant error, absolute error, variable error, and total error, over two levels of frequency of mood change (fast/slow) and intensity of mood change (high/low) groups, two levels of gender (men/women) and four levels of stimulus speed (5/10/15/25 mph). Alpha was set at the.05 significance level for all statistical comparisons. Results showed that intensity of mood change had a significant influence on anticipation timing performance, frequency of mood change factor did not have a significant effect on timing error, men performed with less variability than women and stimulus speed had a significant influence on anticipation timing. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) results, showed that women scored lower on the negative mood states than men. Total mood disturbance for both men and women showed no significant relationship to the timing error scores.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marisi, D. Q.

In particular, the standardization and formalization of test suites has been achieved through the development of a formal specification language, Tree and Tabular Combined Notation (TTCN), and an associated data definition language, Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). This development of formal language for specifying test suites has provided a new challenge for compiler developers. That is, the development of a compiler that can translate from the abstract descriptions for test suites to executable testing programs that can be executed on a wide variety of communication architectures. In response to these challenges, a compiler (TACK) has been developed by the author which translates from TTCN/ASN.1 specifications to executable C++ test suites. Compared to other TTCN compilers, the TACK compiler makes two important contributions. The first contribution is that the TACK compiler supports both ASN.1 and TTCN within the same framework. Due to the complexity of merging ASN.1 with TTCN, the existing implementations of TTCN compilers have all simplified the ASN.1 implementation. This restriction means that the other TTCN compilers cannot be used for upper-layer testing, whereas the TACK compiler can be used for both lower-layer and upper-layer testing. Secondly, the TACK compiler has been designed so that it can support compilation to a wide variety of testing environments. TTCN is a general-purpose test definition language and TTCN test suites are designed in an abstract way to carry out real tests on various test architectures. Thus, one can expect to generate executable test cases for different test architectures from the same abstract test suites. However, all existing TTCN compilers target the object code in a designated test environment in which a specific test architecture is required. Through suites and typical test architectures, a modularizing code-generator and associated run-time systems have been developed by the author for use with a wide variety of test architectures.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w6001.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s602t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv9354258"><dcterms:title>The economic impact of international tourism in Iceland /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Óladóttir, Oddný</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis represents a systematic attempt to analyse the economic impact of international tourism in Iceland. While tourism has long been seen as an important source of foreign exchange and employment for the country very little detailed information is available on the role that the industry plays in the national economy. To fill this 'information gap' two questionnaires were used to gather data on tourist expenditure characteristics and the cost and revenue structures of various tourism businesses. This data was then analysed using a simplified multiplier model. A series of findings are presented, including: the economic impacts associated with various 'tourist types': the ability of different tourism businesses and sectors to generate local income and employment, and; the links that exist between the industry and the rest of the economy. Each of these data bases is then used to provide an overview of future policy options facing the Icelandic government. The research reveals that international tourism plays a major role in the Icelandic economy and is potentially an important tool for regional development. The data provides an important foundation upon which future tourism development strategics and research can be based.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milne, Simon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3656270.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9354258</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tourism -- Iceland.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88ch910"><dcterms:title>Determinants of infant mortality in India</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Iyer, Jayashree Srinivasan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"Infant Mortality Rate" (IMR), is an important socio-economic indicator which measures an important dimension of the well-being of any society. For the developing and less developed countries of the world, Infant Mortality Rates are much higher than those in the developed countries. This research aims to study IMR in India, a country which achieved considerable growth in industrial and agricultural sectors during the post-independence era, but which still has a relatively high level of IMR. Different formulations for measuring IMR are given and work done by different searchers in this area are reviewed in this study. Indicators of the variables affecting IMR are chosen, a time series regression model is estimated by ordinary least squares, and the results discussed. A cross-section analysis of the states in India is also attempted. The results of these analyses, concur quite well with other studies done for countries in similar stages of economic development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kurien, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c05z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch910</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Infants -- Mortality -- India.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn00b0013"><dcterms:title>The basis of leadership : Khumaynī's claims and the classical tradition</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mavani, Hamid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The central and pivotal doctrine of the Imamate in the Twelver Shii creed maintains that the Imams are endowed with the exclusive prerogative to assume the authority and functions of the Prophet in both the temporal and religious domains. This is so by virtue of explicit designation (nass) received by each Imam from his predecessor to act as custodian, protector and expositor of divine teachings. Unfavourable political circumstances during the 'Umayyad and 'Abbasid dynasties forced the Imams to adopt a quietist attitude and to opt for accommodation with the illegitimate authorites. The inaccessibility of the Imams and their inability to guide their followers in distant places resulted in delegation of certain functions of the the Imams to the 'ulama' to guide the community. The prolonged occultation of the twelfth Shii Imam led the jurists to arrogate to themselves the right to act as his indirect deputies (na'ib al-Imam). Establishment of Imami Shiism as the state religion by the Safavids in the early sixteenth century, the victory of the Usuli school over the Akhbaris and the formulation of the institutions of marja'iya and a'lamiya paved the way for Ayatullah Khumayni to lay the grounds for the jurist's assumption of all-comprehensive authority (al-wilaya al-mutlaqa) by extrapolating arguments from tradition reports. The combination of the marja'iya and leadership (rahbar) of the Islamic State in the person of Ayatullah Khumayni had the potential of marshalling the Shii 'ulama' and masses to support for a political cause. However, bifurcation of these two roles in the 1989 revised Constitution of Iran forebodes the separation of the secular and the religious spheres.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adams, Charles J.
