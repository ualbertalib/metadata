Further tests on Xe+, N2+ and SF6- ions serves to illustrate the effectiveness of this ion source. An electron impact study of nitric oxide was made using this ion source. The ionization potential of NO was found to be 9.25 ±. 02 eV., and the ionization efficiency curve for NO+ to be non-linear near the onset. This curvature is interpreted in terms of ionization to various vibrational states of the NO+ ions.

The data with which we have worked relate to forty-three well known companies and to the years 1932-1953 inclusive. Financial data of the kind we require are almost unobtainable for the 1920's and for this reason we have not been able to make a detailed study of income retention patterns before 1932.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weldon, J.C.

An analysis of parallel feedback applied to an active quadripole is advanced to show that the maximum computing accuracy for a given number of transistors is obtained by employing cascaded, common-emitter stages without local feedback. The factors which determine the bandwidth of a repetitive computer amplifier are discussed and the associated stability problems are solved by appropriate shaping of the loop transmission of the amplifier.

The first time I encountered his name was in Artur Rubinstein's autobiography, which recounts how they first met and narrates many anecdotes about their friendship. At the time, I was living in Brazil, and was unable to find any recordings of his music. Nonetheless, Rubinstein's ardent praise of him (“a master!”, “a great Polish composer!”, “a powerful, original personality”) made me very curious, and I did not abandon my desire to keep looking for his music. Then, when I moved to Montreal in order to start my undergraduate degree at McGill University, I was finally able to find many recordings of his works at the school's library.[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nj438.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059cc06h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Szymanowski, Karol, 1882-1937.
