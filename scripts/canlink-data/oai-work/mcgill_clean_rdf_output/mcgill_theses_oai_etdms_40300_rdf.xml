Air pollution management has become a major issue, and a number of policies and campaigns aimed at reducing the volume of harmful emissions released into the atmosphere by vehicles and large-scale industries, have been implemented. Lighting, office equipment, cooking, refrigeration, space heating, space cooling, ventilation, and water heating are the ultimate commercial uses of energy. The goal of this study is to determine if there is a potential market for solar water heaters that could provide hot water for a number of activities in the city, reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned for this purpose, thus contributing to decrease the amount of air pollutants to the atmosphere. The results of this research show how a number of industries, public services and commercial activities need to be provided with both water and energy in large quantities, and are therefore potential users of solar thermal technologies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b29h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm36r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Solar water heaters.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mexico City Metropolitan Area -- Environmental conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42n979q"><dcterms:title>Living with water : traditional settlements of Chinese water towns</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gan, Tong.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work is an attempt to analyze the traditional settlements of Chinese water towns with a particular emphasis on their urban structure and housing or the house form.

This thesis studies the scope of the standards for patent protection and their impact upon trade in medicines. The first part addresses the international dimension of the issue and explains how international trade in medicines can contribute to enhancing the level of global welfare. The first chapter argues that in order to fulfil this latter objective legislation relating to patents must be adapted to the economic and social situation of countries. The second chapter demonstrates that such adaptation is not only allowed, but is indeed encouraged by the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement. The second part of this thesis addresses the issue from a Canadian perspective, and discusses the way Canadian patent provisions applying to pharmaceuticals should be drafted so as to allow Canada to participate in---and to benefit from---international trade in medicines. Thus, I first analyse the factual, political, and legislative factors that influence the Canadian pharmaceutical industry. I then study the role of Canada as part of the integrated market for medicines, as well as the social, industrial and economic objectives underlying Canadian policies. I finally propose some modifications and adaptations to the Canadian Patent Act and suggest some orientations for future multilateral negotiations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lametti, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Gendreau, Ysolde (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k986.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx99s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Patent medicines -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patent laws and legislation -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drugs -- Law and legislation -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pharmaceutical industry -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patent medicines -- Law and legislation -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patent laws and legislation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j0797"><dcterms:title>Mohamad Roem's political activities and Islamic political vision (1908-1983)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Juhannis, Hamdan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the political activities and Islamic political vision of Mohamad Roem (1908--1983), a prominent Masyumi leader and Indonesian diplomat in the first half of the twentieth century. His life and early education as well as his works are discussed in order to trace the sources which inspired his vision. In his political activities, Roem expressed his Islamic nationalism by joining and founding Islamic movements from the late Dutch colonial period through the beginning of the New Order. He had much political success, especially in the Republican period. However, he was one of many Muslim leaders who also suffered for his political involvement in the Soekarno era, he was jailed for about four years, while in the Soeharto era, he was banned from participating in political activities. He was a moderate Muslim leader who aspired to cooperate with "secular" leaders in his time for the sake of a larger cause. His Islamic political vision had a significant impact and was a major contribution to both the Indonesian state and the Islamic community. His moderation is reflected in his political correspondence with Nurcholish Madjid in which he argued for the need of an Islamic political party without demanding the creation of an Islamic state. Finally, Roem's political activities and Islamic political vision point to a model of activism in a religiously pluralistic country and could possibly serve as an inspiration to Muslim politicians, especially after Soeharto's fall when Islamic political parties found fertile ground for growth.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Federspiel, Howard M.

Ironically, this became possible far away from Russia, the country where I first heard the name of Vygotsky. I owe my "meeting" Vygotsky in Montreal to my ESL Curriculum Development, Ethnography classes professor and my thesis supervisor Mary Maguire who has helped me to rediscover Vygotsky on Canadian soil. My thesis is one more attempt to contribute to the existing research on theoretical interpretations of Vygotsky's theory of psychological development. It is one more voice of a teacher and native speaker of Russian, captivated by Vygotsky's ideas and his lifelong search for the universal concepts essential for building the future.

As tariffs came down and quotas increased or totally disappeared, traders who wanted to use the new trade opportunities ran into the trade impeding effects of domestic rules and procedures that, even if do not formally discriminate between imported and domestically produced goods, may still create trade barriers. Recently, trade negotiators have therefore come to see differences between the national laws of trading partners as possible sources of non-tariff barriers, and started to focus on competition laws in particular. An harmonization of competition rules would avoid barriers resulting from divergences between these rules and would avoid their extra territorial applications. At the same time this idea emerged in the International community's mind, two of the main trade and economic partners decided to use the bilateral way to start a real cooperation on the competition field. The European Community and the United States of America entered into an Agreement in 1991, completed by second one in 1998. These two agreements have been applied for a few years now and have been effective in many ways, but have also shown their limits. Therefore, the focus is now standing on multilateral solutions and partners have started to consider the idea of "internationalizing" competition laws and policies but, to achieve that goal, many problems will have to be resolved first, such as deciding which international organisation is going to be in charge of competition matters and what set of rules is going to be applied by this organisation. This Thesis analyses this process and tries to bring a few answers to those difficult and delicate questions involving not only legal, but economical, political and diplomatic issues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n57f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft349</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956h80t"><dcterms:title>Principes de protection du patrimoine architectural mondial = Legal and theoretical aspects of architectural conservation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lebesgue, Sonia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses the international legal protection of the world built heritage. It points out the democratic and cultural values of the architectural patrimony as a source of knowledge, self-identification, social and historical continuity of peoples, and as a source of common enrichment of mankind. It examines the extent to which this cultural heritage relates to natural and human environments, and reasserts the need to prevent monuments or any of their original fabrics from removal for the illicit trade of artefacts worldwide. It argues in favour of the continued commitment of sovereign States and of international society as a whole in order to preserve the cultural rights of present and future generations as stated in the Conventions and Recommendations of the United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture. It emphasizes the interest to implement the international law of architectural conservation in peacetime and wartime and to improve means of cooperation and emergency assistance for the safeguard of the common heritage. For the integration of the legal instruments of conservation and their formal recognition by governments, with the help of professional experts in several international organisations, provide the actual basis for an increasing number of conservation programs in different regions of the world. A further significant territorial development of thee law of architectural conservation is the involvement of local communities in the preservation and management of cultural sites and buildings, as participatory and decentralized means of conservation strongly impact on the social development of people and their political organisation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb347.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h80t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hf04v"><dcterms:title>Le controle des clauses de fixation unilaterale du prix dans les contrats de vente commerciaux : étude comparée</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lesourd, Cyrille.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following study seeks to propose a new approach to the resolution of those legal problems that arise where discretionary clauses are contained within contracts. To this end, a specific legal scenario will be employed, namely where provisions which unilateraly state the price are inserted within commercial contracts of sale. The paper begins with a consideration of how these clauses have been treated by the French civil law system and then proceeds to compare this approach with that adopted by the common law systems of England and the United States. The initial question is that of the validity of the provisions themselves, and of the contracts that contain them. After resolving this first issue, the paper then considers whether a regime might be introduced which would seek to control the impact of the clauses through the introduction of legal responsibility for the party in whose favour the provision is created. Finally, the study addresses the precise nature of this potential responsibility, which is likely to be of a mixed character, combining both objective and subjective elements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jutras, D.

Unlike traditional networks where intermediate nodes are regarded as closed systems, programmable and active networks allow these nodes to be dynamically programmed by users. This enables network services to be tailored to current network conditions, thus improves the performance of services, as compared to traditional network solutions. Currently there are many challenges of the mobile Internet that applications of traditional networks could not well address. This thesis surveys these challenges and applications, and presents how programmable and active networks could well address problems of the mobile Internet such as handoff latency. This thesis proposes an active-router-aided handoff scheme. By using active routers at strategic places of the network, the scheme restricts handoff processing to the vicinity of the mobile host. The analysis shows that this scheme reduces handoff latency, packet losses and the load on the Internet. This helps demonstrate the benefit of programmable and active networks.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Friedman, Nathan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3657119.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cg31n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zd06j"><dcterms:title>Peroxovanadium complexes activate mitogen activated protein kinases : consequences for growth factor signaling and cellular survival</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morinville, Anne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Peroxovanadium complexes have been identified as potent insulin mimetic agents and thus have been proposed for the treatment of diabetes. However, due to their nonselective inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases, these complexes affect a number of intracellular signaling pathways, both related and unrelated to insulin mimesis, jeopardizing their potential use as therapeutic agents. Cytotoxic effects of three monoperoxovanadium complexes were studied with the hopes of establishing rules for determining cytotoxicity. MpV[pic] and mpV[dpc] displayed similar toxicity profiles and lead to the activation of members of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) superfamily in a dose- and time-dependent manner. On the other hand, mpV[NTA] appeared less toxic than the other two complexes studied, and accordingly, lead to a lower level, if at all, of MAPK phosphorylation. These results, although not conclusive, imply the participation of MAPKs in cell death. Cell death caused by these complexes presented features of both necrosis and apoptosis. The second objective of this research was to further characterize the modulation of the ERK signaling cascade by the most commonly used peroxovanadium complex, bpV[phen] in a variety of different cellular contexts. It was discovered that signaling through a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity (RTK) coupled with cellular differentiation, as exemplified by the use of NGF and FGF, leads to ERK phosphorylation by 10 muM bpV[phen] for 1 hour that can be almost completely abolished by use of PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK. In contrast, non-differentiated cells, cells differentiated with a cyclic AMP analogue and PC12 cells treated with EGF appear to signal mostly through a non-PD98059-inhibitable pathway, when stimulated with the same dose of bpV[phen] for one hour.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maysinger, D.

Patients suffering from this autosomal recessive disease have Multiple Carboxylase Deficiency (MCD) with symptoms of life-threatening metabolic acidosis which, in almost all cases, can be successfully treated with pharmacologic doses of oral biotin. Patients with HCS deficiency lack activity of all four carboxylases, indicating that a single HCS maybe targeted to the cytoplasm and mitochondria or that carboxylases are biotinylated in the cytoplasm prior to import into the mitochondria. In order to resolve the compartmentalization of HCS, 5' HCS cDNA sequences have been examined for a targeting signal and a candidate sequence was tested for its capacity to target mitochondria. Analysis of 5' cDNA reveals complex alternative splicing, none of which appear to contain mitochondrial targeting sequences. In addition, antibodies have been developed in order to perform immunochemical analysis of the subcellular distribution of HCS. Polyclonal antisera were raised against full length HCS as well as two peptides corresponding to a 20 amino acid region in the N-terminus and to the 20 amino acids preceding the stop codon. Immunohistochemical staining of human fibroblasts with the antibody to full length HCS gives cytosolic, mitochondrial and nuclear localization. Interestingly, analysis with the N-terminal antiserum reveals a large punctate staining pattern exclusively localized to the nucleus. The corresponding C-terminal antiserum reveals solid nuclear staining with some mitochondrial co-localization. Taken together, these results indicate the ubiquitous nature of HCS in human cells and also allude to a potential role for HCS in the nucleus of human cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gravel, Roy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q6094.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh51d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biotin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ligases.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amino acids -- Metabolism -- Disorders -- Genetic aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b7968"><dcterms:title>The relation between amniotic fluid constituents and human fetal growth /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Elian, Kelly Marie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To investigate the relation between amniotic fluid (amf) constituents and human fetal growth and birth weight (b.wt), amf was collected from 395 pregnant women undergoing routine amniocentesis at 14--16 weeks' gestation at the Royal Victoria (RVH), Jewish General (JGH), and St. Mary's (SMH) Hospitals. The fluid was analyzed for total protein, albumin, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHBA), and lactate. Maternal and neonatal data were collected from a questionnaire at the time of recruitment and from medical charts post-delivery. The mean b.wt in our population was 3409 +/- 552g. Birth weight differed significantly by infant gender, maternal height (ht), and prepregnancy weight (wt), as determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Of the amf constituents measured, glucose showed strong evidence of being a potential predictor of b.wt, such that for each mmol/L increase in amf glucose a 119.4g increase in b.wt was observed. Lactate showed a similar but weaker tendency toward predictive value. Ongoing research is currently being done to further examine the role of human amf constituents in predicting b.wt, the goal being to develop a predictive model that would aid in preparing for and preventing aberrations in fetal growth.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Koski, K.

In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested a role for plasma ASP in enhancing postprandial plasma triglyceride (TG) clearance. The primary objective of this study was to examine, for the first time, the postprandial response of plasma ASP and the fate of an exogenous fat source in 8 post-obese and 8 matched control women. This was done through following 13C-labeled high fat breakfast meal (1062 Cal, 67% fat) every 2 hours for 8 hours in 3 plasma pools and in expired breath CO2. The 3 plasma pools were: TG fraction in triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL) with sedimentation factor Sf &gt; 400 (referred to as chylomicron-TG), TG fraction in TRL with Sf = 20--400 (referred to as VLDL-TG), and plasma free fatty acid (FFA). The secondary objective was to examine fasting and postprandial resting energy expenditure (REE), thermic effect of food (TEF), carbohydrate to fat oxidation rate and insulin sensitivity, which are factors that have been implicated in the tendency of post-obese women to regain weight.

An authentication protocol based on path independence is proposed. The Approximation algorithms for solving the bounded independent path problem are introduced. The algorithm implementations are done on two mobile code environments. One is built with Java, and the environment implementation gives a clear picture of how a mobile code environment is built in Java and based its internal security on Java security. The other is a commercial mobile agent platform, Grasshopper . The algorithm implementation on Grasshopper gives a skeleton of using Grasshopper for distributed applications on a large network.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, Gerald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gq206.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d52w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mp20b"><dcterms:title>Effect of black liquor on the activated sludge process : an experimental investigation of the effect of black liquor on the activated sludge treatment of bleached kraft mill effluents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vadodaria, Sanjay N.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Activated Sludge Process is the most widely used wastewater treatment process in the pulp and paper industry. Black liquor from the Kraft Pulping Process is characterized by high inorganic and organic load; it also contains toxic compounds. Upsets in the plant operation lead to disturbances in the activated sludge process and the process fails to produce effluents that meet regulatory standards. In this project, the effect of black liquor on the activated sludge was studied. Experiments were carried out in batch reactors and growth kinetics for the activated sludge were studied for each condition. In addition, the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC) and soluble lignin was studied with respect to time. Results from initial rate were compared. Characterization of activated sludge was done using the 'Biolog' technique. An attempt was made to correlate the results of the kinetic study and the activated sludge population. Results from the specific rates indicate that for 0% black liquor, initial specific rates of COD (or TOC) removal (or the activity of microorganisms) were different for different initial biomass concentration. This trend however was not clear for the black liquor concentrations. For all conditions of biomass concentration, the specific rate was nearly the same. Due to the toxicity of black liquor, microorganisms that can survive the toxicity shock or those that can adapt to black liquor, may lead to a similar population in the system resulting in the same specific rate or the activity of the microorganisms. This was confirmed by the sludge characterization technique.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berk, Dimitrios (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd358.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mp20b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A736666447"><dcterms:title>The effect of flotation deinking process parameters on air bubble size and deinking efficiency /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sauvé, Christopher Patrick.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many traditional laboratory-scale flotation cells lack the attribute of being hydrodynamically similar to the actual industrial flotation process. A device was built that simulated solely the air-injection section of an industrial flotation cell, in which industrial Reynolds numbers can be achieved. It was found that fluid velocity has a moderate effect on the bubble size distribution and surfactant concentration has a large effect. In addition, the presence of 0.2% consistency TMP fibres or fines was found to have a small effect on the bubble size distribution. The air-injection unit was then expanded into a functioning lab-scale flotation cell. The objective of these experiments was to investigate the effect of furnish type, air volume fraction and slurry velocity on the deinking efficiency. The 100% aged newsprint runs had considerably lower initial brightness, considerably higher initial ERIC, as well as a much lower Speck Removal after 30 minutes of flotation, compared to the runs using 70% fresh newsprint and 30% fresh magazine. Increasing the air volume fraction while keeping the suspension velocity constant, did slightly improve the deinking efficiency for the 100% aged NP case, however, did not result in any significant improvement for the 70% NP/30% MG case. It is believed that the increased shear forces associated with increasing the suspension velocity broke-up ink agglomerates that were in suspension into a larger number of smaller ink particles. Increasing the suspension velocity increased the rate of flotation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Garnier, Gil (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>van de Ven, Theo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v485w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736666447</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451k550"><dcterms:title>Adsorption kinetics of dyes and yellowing inhibitors on pulp fibers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saint-Cyr, Karine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The yellowing of mechanical pulps is a major drawback that limits them mainly to the production of lower value products. To prevent the yellowing, one method consists in applying specific molecules, yellowing inhibitors, directly onto the pulp. Yellowing inhibitors can be added in the pulp stock, on the wet-web or even at the size press of the papermaking process. The affinity of yellowing inhibitors for pulp and their adsorption kinetics are important in the determination of the optimal process strategy. It is the objective of this study to quantify the adsorption of inhibitors on pulp and to elucidate their adsorption mechanism. First, a method for characterising the affinity of model yellowing inhibitors for pulp has been tested. Two inhibitors were used: a sulfonated inhibitor and a quaternary ammonium inhibitor. The sorption of two dyes was investigated to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. Brilliant yellow, an anionic direct dye, has a low affinity for pulp fibers while toluidine blue, a cationic basic dye, has a high affinity for pulp fibers.

A helium plasma was generated by a 20 kW DC plasma torch and channeled through a graphite tunnel to approximate the thermal plasma tailflame fullerene synthesis environment encountered in the tetrachlorethylene system. Two diagnostic techniques were studied to characterize the temperature and electron density of the plasma. The first method uses the radiation spectrum of the C2 molecule to estimate a heavy species temperature in the plasma. The second method uses the Stark broadening of atomic helium lines to calculate electron densities. It was found that the heavy species temperature in the plasma at the outlet of the tunnel was approximately 5000 K. Both these diagnostic methods are expected to be easily applicable to future thermal plasma fullerene synthesis systems and provide valuable information on the local conditions.

With the recent thrust in tourism literature suggesting that tourism research furthers the industry's development in communities, it is timely that more studies examine the tourism industry in the changing face of 'Nunavut'. This thesis is a case study presentation of a Nunavut community's experience with tourism. The research examines the changes and restructuring that have come about in the tourism industry since the signing of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, and whether community-controlled tourism is facilitated by these changes. The results of this research indicate that the basic needs of Kimmirut residents are not being met by current tourism policy. The community's entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to host tourists are not being fully recognized by industry and government, although the desire on behalf of the latter exists.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wenzel, G.

This thesis attempts to analyze the composition and transformation of the six protagonists in the relation that they maintain with other characters, and bring out their different interpretations of the key themes of the six short stories in the collection: the exile and the kingdom. For the six protagonists, the exile is materialized in the rejection, the invasion and the lack of understanding of other characters. They approach the kingdom when they succeed in building a network of relations according to their will and defending their identity against exterior interventions. With the different results they obtain, Camus presents various options and shows a certain progress and continuity in their struggle.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Andre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj64f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x774</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Camus, Albert, 1913-1960.
