There was a positive trend between body mass and latitude along the gradient, consistent with the prediction of Bergmann's rule. In addition, abundance increased with mean annual temperature along the gradient, and all else being equal, squirrels present in high abundance were larger than squirrels present at low abundance. Resting metabolic rate increased with latitude, but there was no relationship between maximum metabolic rate and latitude. Overall, this suggests that the metabolic geography of red squirrels is driven more by regional variation in the demands of maintaining homeothermy rather than the supply of resources. In addition, squirrels at high latitudes are operating much closer to their physiological limits than squirrels at lower latitudes.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cette thèse étudie la géographie métabolique de huit populations d'écureuils roux tout au long d'un gradient latitudinal de 3000 km dans l'ouest canadien.

Popular belief assigns this figure the most rare power to perform both evil and good tricks, depending on circumstances. 
This dissertation draws on extensive historical and linguistic finds from the farthest nooks of Celtic civilisation weil within the Piedmontese home turf, where it flourished from the beginning of the 4th century a.D. until the 1 st century of our era, a time at which this region feH under the sway of the Roman empire. 
Leveraging on historical and archaeological data, this dissertation factors in a long-lasting and deep-reaching underlayer of Celtic lore in present day' s Piedmontese culture and tradition. More specifically, attention is pinpointed on the likely origin of masca from a religious figure of the Druid religion, a deity the Celts worshipped with utmost reverence. They lent this goddess the typical, good-evil dualism we find in the character at the centre of our dissertation.
Afterwards a sharp distinction is drawn between the masca and the devilish witches whom she is often and mistakenly confused and associated with. Once this dissimilarity has been highlighted, one can trace back the links between the masca and the sacred pristine environment, where the underground balance between good and evil is enduring and in separable from the core attributes of the central Celtic deity, the Great Mother.
Etymological research aimed at ascertaining the origin of the word masca underpin the duality and the balance between good and evil deeply rooted in this word and in the character it evokes. 
In the same breath, a careful search has been carried out throughout oral and literary tradition from Piedmont (in both Piedmontese and Italian) to pigeon-hole the different meanings the word and the character masca may take up. This convincingly demonstrates the dichotomy of opposite and contrasting values pervading the culture and religion of the Druids is much the same as in the Piedmontese character of the masca. One may also encounter this dualism of opposite and contrasting values in other characters from Piedmontese folklore, narrowly akin with the masca, such as the mascon, the setmin or ev en in mythological characters like the faja, the faunet and the servan.
The bulk of literary, folklore, archaeological and philological evidence confers a unique, non devilish attribute to the masca, which in turn links the literature and oral tradition of Piedmont to the religion of the Druids and to the Celtic past, supplying by the same token much valued insights into one of the most unaccounted for chapters in the history of European ethnic groups. </dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Questa dissertazione è imperniata sulla parola masca, che denota un personaggio popolare e antichissimo di genere femminile, riscontrabile esclusivamente nel folclore e nella letterature della regione italiana del Piemonte. Si attribuisce a questo personaggio la facoltà rarissima di esercitare tanto il bene che il mate, a seconda de¡ casi.
La tesi si basa su ricerche storiche e linguistiche che traggono i loro dati dai recessi più remoti della civilta celtica in territorio piemontese, dove essa è prosperata dall'inizio del 4° secolo a.C. fino al 1° secolo della nostra era, epoca alta quale questa regione fu inglobata dall'impero romano. Basandosi su dati storici e archeologici, la ricerca prende atto di un substrato celtico persistente e profondo nella cultura e nella tradizione piu antiche del Piemonte. In modo particolare si concentra l'attenzione sulla derivazione dei personaggio della masca da una figura religiosa dei Druidi, venerata fervidamente dai Celti, i quali attribuivano a questa divinita il dualismo tipico (bene-male) che si riscontra nel personaggio oggetto di questo studio. In seguito si traccia il discrimine tra la masca e le streghe demoniache con cui la prima è spesso e del tutto erroneamente confusa ed associata. Una volta tracciata questa distinzione si possono riallacciare i legami tra la masca e il suo sacrale pristino ove l'equilibrio sotteso tra bene e mate è permanente e inestricabile dagli attributi fondamentali della dea celtica centrale, la Grande Madre.
Le ricerche etimologiche per appurare l'origine della parola masca non fanno che confermare la dualità e l'equilibrio tra il bene e il mate inevitabilmente compresente in questa parola e nel personaggio ch'essa denota. 
Si passa in rassegna la tradizione orale e la letteratura del Piemonte (tanto in lingua piemontese che in lingua italiana) per, inventariare i diversi significati che possono assumere questa parola e questo personaggio. Si perviene a dimostrare che la dicotomia di valori e di poteri contrastanti insiti nella religione dei druidi rimane ad un dipresso la stessa nel personaggio delta masca. Ci si puo imbattere in questo dualismo di valori opposti e antitetici anche in altri personaggi del folclore piemontese, strettamente connessi alta masca, quali il mascon, i1 setmin o anche in personaggi mitologici, come la faja, il faunet e il servan. 
La somma di queste prove letterarie, folcloriche, archeologiche e filologiche avalla l'attribuzione d'un carattere unico, non demoniaco, al personaggio della masca, che riannoda strettamente la letteratura e la tradizione orale del Piemonte alta religione dei druidi e al passato celtico, fornendo altresi scorci preziosi su uno dei capitoli piu oscuri del passato delle etnie europee.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cette dissertation est centrée autour du mot masca, qui désigne un personnage populaire et très ancien de genre féminin, qu'on retrouve exclusivement dans le folklore et la littérature de la région italienne du Piémont. On attribue à ce personnage la capacité fort rare d'exercer autant le bien que le mal, selon les circonstances.
Cette dissertation fait preuve d'une recherche historique et linguistique qui puise ses données des coins les plus reculés de la civilisation celtique, au sein du territoire piémontais où elle triompha depuis le début du 4e siècle avant J.C. jusqu'au 1 er siècle de notre ère, époque à laquelle cette région tomba sous l'emprise de l'empire romain.
À partir des données historiques et des repères des fouilles archéologiques, cette dissertation fait état d'un substrat celtique persistant et profond dans la culture et la tradition les plus anciennes du Piémont. Plus particulièrement, on polarise l'attention sur la dérivation du personnage de la masca d'une figure religieuse des Druides, vénérée avec la révérence la plus outrée par les celtes, qui attribuaient à cette divinité le dualisme typique (bien-mal) qu'on retrouve dans le personnage qui fait l'objet de notre étude.
Par la suite on trace une distinction entre la masca et les sorcières démoniaques avec qui elle est souvent et erronément confuse et associée. Cette distinction tracée, on peut rétablir les liens entre la masca et son ur-milieu sacré, où l'équilibre souterrain entre le bien et le mal est permanent et indébrouillable des attributs fondamentaux de la déesse celtique centrale, la Grande Mère.
Les recherches étymologiques pour établir l'origine du mot masca ne font d'ailleurs que confirmer la dualité et l'équilibre entre le bien et le mal toujours présent dans ce mot et dans le personnage qu'il désigne.
On fait par la suite le tri de la tradition orale et de la littérature du Piémont (en langue piémontaise et en langue italienne) pour caser les différentes significations qu'assument ce mot et ce personnage. On parvient à la démonstration. que la dichotomie de valeurs et de pouvoirs opposés dont la culture et la religion des druides est imbibée, demeure somme toute la même dans le personnage piémontais de la masca. On peut buter à ce dualisme de valeurs opposées et contrastantes aussi auprès d'autres personnages du folklore piémontais, étroitement reliés à la masca, tels que le mascon, le setmin ou, encore, auprès de personnages mythologiques, tels que la Jaja, le Jaunet et le servan.
Cette multitude de preuves littéraires, folkloriques, archéologiques et philologiques autorise l'attribution d'un caractère unique, non démoniaque, au personnage de la masca, qui relie étroitement la littérature et la tradition orale du Piémont à la religion des druides et au passé celte, en fournissant aussi par là des embrasures précieuses sur un des chapitres les plus obscurs du passé des peuplades européennes. </dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g068h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b174j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dialect literature, Italian -- Italy -- Piedmont -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Folklore -- Italy -- Piedmont</dc:subject><dc:subject>Piedmont (Italy) -- Civilization -- Celtic influences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Italian literature -- Italy -- Piedmont -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Witches -- Italy -- Folklore</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hs41q"><dcterms:title>Investigations into the NIpNerTMF family of DNA-binding proteins</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thiam, Madani Bocar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent studies have shown that several DNA-binding motifs are  conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which may indicate the importance of  their particular structure/function relationship. An emerging family of highly  conserved DNA-binding proteins consists of the following members: the Ner  (negative early repressor) proteins of  transposable coliphages Mu and D108, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage D3112 and of  Haemophilus influenzae; the Nlp (Ner-like  protein) proteins of Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitides,  Salmonella typhimurium, Photorhabdus luminescence and a number of other prokaryotes;  and finally the TMF (TATA-element modulatory factor) proteins of humans, mice, rats  and other eukaryotes. Our laboratory previously established that the E. coli Nlp  protein (also known as SfsB, Sugar fermentation  stimulation B) was a transcribed nonessential gene in E.  coli. I have further established by Northern blot analysis that nlp is expressed as  a monocistronic mRNA of approximately 320 nucleotides, and defined the precise  nlp/sfsB transcriptional initiation site by primer extension. I also expressed and  purified Nlp to homogeneity from a cell-free extract and showed, by electrophoretic  mobility assay, that Nlp binds DNA with specificity for the transcriptional  regulatory regions of two operons involved in sugar metabolism, mal and lac. E. coli  Nlp shares high sequence similarity with the Ner proteins of coliphages Mu and D108  (~62%) and with an 85 amino acid region of the human TMF protein  (~30%, named 'TMF'). The high sequence similarity of this human 'TMF' to  these regulatory bacteriophage and bacterial proteins suggests the existence of an  evolutionarily conserved functional motif. 'TMF' was cloned by PCR from a HeLa cDNA  library, over-expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest specific, although weak, binding of  this short 'TMF' protein to the binding site of the larger full length TMF. The Nlp  protein acts as a positive activator of several sugar-metabolizing operons (such as  mal) in E. coli, but only in strains with cya-crp *1 mutations. I have shown that Mu  Ner and 'TMF' are also capable of acting as positive activators of maltose  metabolism in the cya -crp*1 mutant, suggesting that the similarity is more than  just sequence based. A malPQ::lacZ fusion strain was constructed and  beta-galactosidase assays showed that Nlp has a positive effect on the expression of  the malP promoter. RNA dot blot analyses further showed that Nlp increases the  expression of the malT regulator gene as well as the malF and malK genes (involved  in maltose transport). These results give insight into the role of this family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins in the regulation of gene expression. </dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Des études récentes ont démontré que plusieurs motifs de liaison à l'ADN
sont conservés entre les procaryotes et les eucaryotes, suggérant un lien
important entre leurs structures et leurs fonctions. Une nouvelle famille de
protéines bien conservées, qui se lient à l'ADN, inclue les membres suivants: les
protéines Ner (negative garly repressor), retrouvées dans les coliphages
transposables Mu et 0108, et dans le phage 03112 de Pseudomonas

Il a déjà été établi, dans notre laboratoire, que la protéine Nlp de E. coli
(aussi connue sous le nom de SfsB pour Sugar fermentation §.timulation B) est
un gène transcrit non-essentiel. J'ai démontré par Northern blot que nlp est
exprimé en un ARNm monocistronique d'approximativement 320 nucléotides, et
j'ai défini le site d'inititation de la transcription de nlp, en utilisant la technique
d'extension par oligonucléotides. J'ai également exprimé et purifié Nlp jusqu'à
homogénéité à partir d'un extrait exempt de cellules. De plus j'ai montré, par
retardement sur gel, que Nlp est une protéine qui lie l'ADN avec une spécificité
pour les régions régulant la transcription des opérons mal et lac. Ces opérons
sont impliqués dans le métabolisme des sucres. La protéine Nlp de E. coli partage 62% de similarité avec les protéines Ner des coliphages Mu et D108, et
30% avec une région de 85 acides aminés de la protéine TMF humaine. la
considérable similitude entre TMF et ces protéines de bactériophages et de
bactéries suggère l'existence de motifs fonctionnels conservés au cours de
l'évolution. Cette région TMF de 85 acides aminés de TMF homologue à Ner,
nommée 'TMF', a été clonée par PCR à partir d'une librairie de cDNA provenant
de cellules Hela, puis surexprimée dans E. coli, et purifiée par chromatographie
d'affinité. Des expériences de retardement sur gel ont démontré que 'TMF' se lie
faiblement, mais de façon spécifique, aux sites de liaisons de la protéine entière.
la protéine Nlp est un activateur de plusieurs opérons régulant le métabolisme
des sucres (tel que mal) chez des souches de E. coli qui contiennent les
mutations cya-crp·1. J'ai démontré que la protéine Ner du coliphage Mu, ainsi
que 'TMF', activent également le métabolisme du maltose dans les mutants cyacrp·1, suggérant, non seulement une similitude de séquence, mais aussi de
fonction. Une souche exprimant lacZ sous le contrôle de l'opéron ma/P
(ma/PQ::LacZ) a été générée, et des essais de l3-galactosidase indiquent que
Nlp augmente l'activité du promoteur ma/P. Nlp stimule, en outre, l'expression
des gènes ma/T, le régulateur de l'opéron mal, ainsi que les gènes ma/F et
ma/K, impliqués dans le transport du maltose. Mes résultats proposent donc un
rôle de cette famille de protéines procaryotiques et eucaryotiques, qui se lient à
l'ADN, dans la régulation de la transcription. </dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt35c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs41q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tf90c"><dcterms:title>Aux fondements de l'état canadien : la liberté au Canada de 1776 à 1841</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ducharme, Michel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the concept of liberty provided the intellectual  foundation for the legitimacy of state power and social order in both Canadas from  as early as the Atlantic Revolution (1776--1815), it has never been used to study  the history of state formation in Canada. This dissertation examines the essential  role that the concept of liberty played in the process of state formation in Canada  between the American Revolution (1776) and the Act of Union (1841). It proposes a  large-scale re-reading of the intellectual and political history of that period  through the question of liberty within the framework of the British Empire and of  the Atlantic world (Great Britain, The United States and France). Beginning from a  theoretical framework inspired by the work of intellectual historians of the  Atlantic world, such as J. G. A. Pocock, Bernard Bailyn, Gordon S. Wood and Quentin  Skinner, by the philosophical considerations on liberty from Isaiah Berlin and by a  reading of the most important philosophical writings of eighteenth-century Britain,  France and United States, this dissertation argues that, from 1791 and onwards,  Upper and Lower Canada developed according to a concept of liberty that, while being  different from the notion of liberty at work during the Atlantic Revolution, still  proceeded directly from the Enlightenment. Less preoccupied by equality and  community than by individual autonomy, this ideal was based on a respect for certain  individual rights which are often reduced to the trio of "liberty, property and  security." Politically, this model of liberty recognized the existence of  different interests within a society and their right to exist, and economically, the  importance it gave to the protection of private property led to an ethic that  encouraged the accumulation of wealth. This conception of liberty (which might be called a modern  definition of liberty) provides the intellectual base for the Constitutional Act of  1791 and was generally accepted in Upper and Lower Canadian societies until 1828. At  that moment, some reformists, disappointed by the slowness of the British government  to bring reform to the colonies, adopted a republican discourse based on the idea of  popular sovereignty and the very different trio of "liberty, equality and  community". The political struggles of the 1830s in both Canadas can be  explained in part by examining the opposition between these two very different  concepts of liberty. The tension between these two models ended with the 1837  rebellions and the triumph of the modern concept of liberty at the expense of the  republican ideal defended by the patriots and the radicals in both Canadas. It is in  this context that Lord Durham's report was published. By his recommendation of  rendering the executive power accountable to the Legislative Assembly, Durham gave  back to the reformists still adhering to the modern concept of liberty the  leadership of the reform movement in the colony and re-focussed the movement's  attention towards the issue of responsible government. After 1839, the debate within  the colonies would concentrate on the practice of political power, rather than on  its legitimacy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf25q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tf90c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- History -- 1791-1841</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- History -- 1763-1791</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liberty -- Political aspects -- Canada -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq10j"><dcterms:title>Mechanics of poroelastic geologic media susceptible to damage</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shirazi, Ali, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The classical theory of poroelasticity developed by Biot (1941)  deals with the time-dependent response of the fluid-saturated porous media derived  from the coupling of the mechanical deformations and the deformations of pore fluid.  The classical theory of poroelasticity has been successfully applied to a range of  problems of interest to geomechanics and biomechanics. The brittle poroelastic media  can experience alterations in poroelasticity properties resulting from the  generation and/or growth of micro-defects. The effects can be modelled by appeal to  continuum damage mechanics. Damage-induced alterations can influence the  consolidation behaviour of a damage-susceptible poroelastic medium. Continuum damage  mechanics concepts can be incorporated within the theory of poroelasticity to model  the damage-induced alterations in poroelasticity properties. This thesis deals with  the development of a computational procedure for modelling the damage-induced  alterations in both elasticity and hydraulic conductivity characteristics of a  brittle poroelastic medium. Furthermore, the evolution of damage can also exhibit a  stress state-dependency. The computational procedure has also been extended to  include the stress state-dependent evolution of damage in brittle poroelastic media.  The alterations in the elastic stiffness and the hydraulic conductivity are  characterized through a damage evolution function with relationship to distortional  strain invariant. The stress state-dependency of the damage process is governed by  the state of the volumetric strains. It is assumed that an overall decrease in the  volumetric strains does not result in damage evolution. The computational procedure that accounts for damage-induced  evolution of stiffness and hydraulic properties and stress state dependency in  damage evolution are used to model practical problems of interest in geomechanics,  applied mechanics and civil engineering. The fluid pressure development within a  spheroidal fluid inclusion surrounded by a damage-susceptible poroelastic medium has  been examined through the computational procedure. The computational procedure has  also been used to study time-dependent translational displacements of a rock socket  embedded in a damage susceptible soft rock and the procedure has been also applied  to examine the time-dependent in-plane displacements of a flat elliptical rigid  anchorage. The computational results indicate that the consolidation behaviour of  the brittle poroelastic media can be significantly influenced through consideration  of the damage-induced alterations in both the elastic stiffness and the hydraulic  conductivity, the latter property exerting a greater influence. The dependency of  the evolution of damage to the state of stresses can also influence the  consolidation of a poroelastic medium.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz829.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq10j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn67p"><dcterms:title>Surfactantligand systems for the simultaneous remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shin, Mari</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ligand I- along with nonionic surfactant, Triton X-100 or  anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were applied as soil washing agents  to desorb Cd from both naturally and artificially contaminated soils. After seven  consecutive washings, up to 90% of Cd was desorbed from both soils. Triton X-100  with I- showed a higher capacity to desorbing Cd than did SDS with I-. The increase  of ligand concentration was a critical factor for increasing leaching capacity.  Without the ligand, surfactant alone could not desorb Cd effectively from either  soil. After seven consecutive washings, a sequential extraction experiment was  performed for soil residuals to define the soil fraction of Cd removed by the  washing agent. Among the washing agents, only Triton X-100/I- could remove Cd from  the exchangeable fraction of both soils. Various ligands including I-, SCN-, and I-/SCN- in combination  with Triton X-100 were tested for their efficacy in desorbing heavy metals such as  Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb from a field contaminated soil. Cadmium was preferentially  desorbed by Triton X-100/I- whereas Zn and Cu were preferentially desorbed by Triton  X-100/SCN-. The mixture of I- and SCN- with Triton X-100 desorbed the most Cd and  Cu, but not for Zn, as I- inhibited Zn desorption. Sequential extraction experiments  after seven washings showed that metals held in the exchangeable fraction can be  desorbed only by a combination of ligand and surfactant. Nonionic surfactants having different alkyl chain lengths in  combination with ligand I- were tested for the desorption of Cd and PCBs from soil.  Cadmium desorption was increased at the lower surfactant concentration and higher  ligand concentration. The increase in the hydrophilic alkyl chain length of the  surfactant adversely affected Cd desorption. Up to 100% of PCBs were successfully  removed by most of surfactant-ligand combinations and the desorption was less  dependent, compared to heavy metals, on the concentration of washing agents and  length of alkyl chain. The linear relationships between number of washings and Cd  desorption, and between alkyl chain length and Cd desorption was defined.

Copolymers of a  variety of block lengths but with narrow molecular weight distributions were  synthesized by sequential anionic synthesis. Mixing two or more copolymers of  differing block length (while the second block length was identical) artificially  increased the polydispersity index (PDI) of one block. Self-assembly was induced by  adding water slowly to a copolymer solution until a desired solvent composition was  attained. The resulting aggregates were compared using transmission electron  microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The first experiments, presented in chapter 2, studied the  effect of the corona (PAA) polydispersity on the size of vesicular aggregates. For a  constant solvent composition and copolymer concentration, the size of the vesicles  was generally found to decrease with increasing PAA polydispersity. In chapter 3, a  partial phase diagram of morphology as a function of water content and PAA  polydispersity is presented. The phase boundaries between spheres and rods, and rods  and vesicles were found to shift to lower water contents with increased PAA  polydispersity. While chapters 2 and 3 show that the PAA polydispersity affects  both the morphology and the size of vesicles, chapter 4 presents work that indicates  that the shape of the PAA molecular weight distribution plays an important part in  determining the degree to which the PAA polydispersity affects the morphology. A  subsequent study also shows that the molecular weight distribution effect only  occurs when the relative PAA/PS block length ratio is low. The polystyrene molecular weight distribution studies, presented  in chapter 5, show that the opposite effect to that of the PAA molecular weight  distribution occurs with an increase in the PS PDI. The morphological boundary from  spheres to rods was found to move to higher water contents with an increase in PS  PDI. Even at very high water contents, where vesicles are usually found for low  molecular weight distribution samples, only spherical micelles were found for the  samples with increased PS PDI.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww32z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547r82b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zb54s"><dcterms:title>Theoretical orientations to reading and instructional practices of eleven grade five teachers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Elliott-Johns, Susan E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explores the nature of teachers' understandings of  theoretical orientation to reading and the relationships between theoretical  orientations to reading and instructional practice.

A series of three in-depth, phenomenological interviews  were conducted with each teacher-participant. Utilizing the concept of theoretical  orientation to reading, understandings of and relationships between, theoretical  orientation to reading and instructional practice were identified and described by  the teachers in this study, from an 'emic' (insider) perspective. The themes of  teachers' knowledge and beliefs, personal experiences, and constructivist approaches  to teaching and learning emerged as highly influential in determining the kinds of  instructional decisions made by the teacher participants. The data illustrate how  teachers with a skills orientation to reading instruction supported a focus on  explicit skills instruction within balanced, eclectic approaches to reading  instruction. The results provide a multi-voice construction, showing how the teacher  participants' knowledge, beliefs, personal and professional experiences were  reflected not only in their efforts to articulate understandings of theoretical  orientations to reading, but also in the characteristics of relationships between  their theoretical orientation to reading and instructional practices.

The first essay proves, in a model-free framework,  that early exercise of futures-style options on futures, whether calls or puts, is  suboptimal. The result is robust to transaction costs, liquidity constraints and  collateral requirements. Assuming a frictionless market, three additional model-free  results are obtained: (i) put-call parity, (ii) equality of time values of puts and  calls with the same strike and expiration, and (iii) positivity of time value before  expiration. The second essay develops a new invoice price formula for Treasury bond  futures contracts as a more effective alternative to the current conversion factor  system. The equilibrium "cheapest to deliver" and futures price at  expiration are identified. The empirical part of the essay documents that the new  function dramatically improves the ability of the futures invoice price to  approximate the market prices of the corresponding deliverable bonds. The third  essay offers a regression-based empirical study of the determinants of credit  default swap premia. Leverage, volatility and interest rates are found to account  for a large percentage of the variation of premia. A principal components analysis  of the regression residuals finds no evidence of a missing factor. The results  achieved for credit default premia more closely corroborate structural models of  credit risk than those obtained by Collin-Dufresne et al.

Sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate was found  to be the most effective ligand. The metal-ligand complexes formed had the  advantages of being highly insoluble in water and allowing a good regeneration of  the ligand at the end of the cycle. The effect of time, pH, mole ratio of ligand to  metal, temperature and the presence of other ions, such as Na+, NO3-, Cl- and SO42-,  was also studied. At the end of the removal process, gallium was recovered from the  insoluble complexes using a solvent. The gallium was concentrated in an aqueous  phase. The ligand was extracted in the organic phase and regenerated. Other  organophosphorus ligands such as sodium di-(n-dodecyl) phosphinate, sodium  mono-octyl ester phosphinate and O,O-di-(octyl) dithiophosphoric acid were also  synthesised and studied. They were less efficient for the removal of gallium than  the sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate ligand. The possibility of using compounds with  a carboxylic group on the removal of gallium was also investigated using humic and  fumaric acids. The removal with sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate of other metals  such as aluminum, indium, iron, calcium and zinc, found in the mining and electronic  effluents with gallium, was considered. A good selectivity of the ligand for the  gallium over the other metals was obtained. A process was proposed for the  electronics industry to treat gallium arsenic effluent. Finally a mathematical model was established to describe the  removal behavior of the metals with the sodium di-(n-octyl) phosphinate  ligand.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z26k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf23d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gg92t"><dcterms:title>CD9 expression and its putative role in prostate cancer progression</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Jia-Chi, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mechanisms and associated genes implicated in prostate  tumorigenesis and cancer progression are still not fully known. Thus, we  characterized the expression profile and the role of an attractive candidate, the  motility-related protein-1/cluster-of-differentiation antigen 9 (MRP1/CD9) gene  (abbreviated as CD9). We first performed immunohistochemistry studies in a panel of  prostate cancer tissues including 107 localized, 60 advanced prostate cancers, 25  bone tissues and 65 lymph nodes with prostate cancer metastasis. CD9 protein, whose  expression is inversely correlated with many clinicopathological parameters such as  PSA level, differentiation, stage and metastasis status, is inactivated during  prostate cancer progression and metastasis. We then cloned and sequenced CD9 cDNA from prostate cancer cell  lines and tissues. This analysis revealed the presence of three major deletions and  four commonly occurring point mutations in prostate cancer. All of these genetic  aberrations affect the large extracellular and intracellular domains of CD9 protein.  We also showed that the overexpression of wild type CD9 protein gives rise to  phenotypic changes and loss of replicative potential in an advanced prostate cancer  cell line (PC-3). These dying cells demonstrated remarkably enlarged cell surface  and prominent cellular protrusions. By carefully defining the time course of these  dying cells, we found one third of CD9 overexpressed PC-3 clones died after one and  a half months on average after a limited number of cell divisions. In contrast, the  other two third of CD9-transfected clones did not die by virtue of loss of exogenous  CD9 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of mutated forms of the CD9 protein with  one of the major deletions or two of the point mutations did not result in cell  mortality and profound morphological changes. Finally, we compared the RNA expression profile of dying and  growing clones using cDNA microarray. Among the differentially expressed genes, the  most interesting candidate is MARK1, which is under-expressed by a factor of five in  dying clones as compared to growing clones. MAP/microtubule  Affinity-Regulating Kinase 1, abbreviated  as MARK1, is a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases and is able to  phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). The published phenotypic  changes reported from overexpression of MARK1 in CHO cells are very similar to what  we observed for CD9-overexpressed PC-3 dying cells. Further analysis to confirm the  linkage of CD9 protein to cytoskeleton proteins such as MARK1 is  compulsory. These data underline the significance of CD9 expression in  prostate cancer progression, uncover major mutations in prostate cancer, and for the  first time argue for the connection between CD9 and cytoskeleton-associated  proteins. Further studies to confirm the role of CD9 in vivo and to find out the  pathway(s) involved in loss of replicative potential caused by CD9 overexpression  will definitely improve our understanding of the cell biology of prostate cancer  progression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chevrette, Mario (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hv81h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gg92t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kg855"><dcterms:title>HIV-1 reverse transcription initiation : impact of A-rich loop deletion and M184V substitution and development of novel antiretroviral strategies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wei, Xin, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reverse transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type-1  (HIV-1) is primed by cellular tRNALys3, which is selectively packaged into viral  particles where it is bound at its 3' terminus to a complementary sequence of viral  RNA termed the primer binding site (PBS). In addition to the PBS, other regions  within the viral genome also interact with tRNALys3. Initiation of HIV-1 reverse  transcription requires specific recognition of the viral genome, tRNA primer, and  reverse transcriptase (RT). In this work, we study the important role played by the  initiation complex in the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription. An "A-rich  loop" located upstream of the PBS has been shown to interact with the anticodon  loop of tRNALys3 and deletion of this A-rich loop caused diminished viral  replication fitness. We have now studied the mechanisms involved in the altered  replication capacities of the deletion-containing viruses in the context of both  wild type HIV-1 and viruses also containing the M184V substitution in RT. We found  that the M184V mutation in RT compromises the ability of deletion-containing viruses  to restore wild-type replication. Further biochemical study indicates that both the  M184V mutation in RT and deletion of sequences upstream of PBS caused diminished  viral replication fitness by compromising the efficiency of reverse transcription  initiation. Since the initiation of DNA synthesis was shown to be a highly  specific process, it represents a potential target for the development of novel  antiviral agents. We developed strategies for inhibition of the HIV-1 replication  via interference with the tRNALys3/viral RNA complex. To target primer tRNALys3, we  employed oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) that are complementary to different parts  of the tRNA primer. To target viral RNA, we devised a tRNALys3-like molecule, termed  tRNA Lys*, that contained sequence alterations that direct initiation from a region  distant from the natural PBS, designated PBS*. PBS* is involved in the formation of  the natural tRNA/PBS complex and binding of tRNALys* was shown to interfere  specifically with the initiation of reverse transcription. Inhibition of the  synthesis of (-) strand strong-stop DNA was achieved successfully with both  strategies by interfering with the formation of the initiation  complex.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainberg, Mark A.

Considering the wide variety of compounds that have been synthesized,  it is curious that sulfur functionalized cubane has received virtually no  attention. Chapter two discusses the synthesis of cubanethiol, dicubyl  disulfide, and a range of derivatives. Dicubyl disulfide possesses the shortest C-S  bond length of any reported molecule where the carbon is sp3 hybridized.  Calculations have confirmed that this apparently results from the high s-character  that the external bonds of cubane possess. All four of the stable, oxidized versions  of dicubyl disulfide have been prepared, as well as two trityl cubyl  polysulfides. In Chapter three, new synthetic pathways for the synthesis of  cubylcarbinol have been established. One key step is the "two-in-one  reaction" that performs the reduction of the carboxylic acid, as well as  dehalogenation of 4-iodocubanecarboxylic acid using a single reagent to afford  cubylcarbinol. This pathway increases the overall yield for obtaining cubylcarbinol,  as well as being more economical. Chapter four describes the work carried out on cubane-containing  dialkoxy disulfides. The synthesis of two dialkoxy disulfides from cubylcarbinols  was accomplished. The S2 liberation ability of these species was also investigated,  and these represent the first non-benzylic dialkoxy disulfides that deliver  trappable S2. In addition, a study of the previously unknown rearrangement/oxidation  of these molecules to sulfites has been carried out. In Chapter five, a thorough study of the reactivity of a vinyl  cubane compound towards polymerization was performed. The subsequent cage opening  and rearrangement to a styrene derivative, to our knowledge, is the first example of  this kind known to occur without the assistance of a rhodium catalyst. In addition,  cubane-containing norbornene polymers have been successfully synthesized. These  represent the first examples of polymers that have a cubane tethered to the polymer  backbone. It appears that this type of functionality does not impair solubility,  which is the major problem associated with all other attempts to obtain cubane-based  polymers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harpp, D.

Two distinct failure mechanisms were identified  depending on the type of detonating mixture. Experiments in mixtures characterized  by piecewise laminar reaction zone structures with weak three-dimensional effects  revealed that the attenuation and failure is caused by the global mass divergence to  the porous, permeable walls. The limits observed in these mixtures agreed very well  with the theoretical limiting conditions for the existence of curved ZND detonations  subjected to lateral expansions. Experiments were also conducted in a second class of mixtures,  characterized by irregular cellular structures and turbulent reactions zones. When  detonations in this class of mixtures are attenuated, transverse waves re-amplify  from local instabilities in the reaction zone. This re-amplification permits the  detonation wave to continue to propagate and overcome the effects of global mass  divergence and transverse wave attenuation at the porous walls. Ultimately, when the  rate of transverse wave re-generation is surpassed by the rate of transverse wave  damping at the walls, the detonation can no longer be self-sustained and fails. The  limits obtained in these irregular structure mixtures were found significantly wider  than predicted by the ZND formulation, thus further confirming the important role of  the three-dimensional turbulent structure in these detonations in providing a more  efficient mechanism of gas ignition and propagation than detonations that exhibit a  regular structure. The implications of the present study are that the ZND model is  not valid in describing the reaction zone structure, the ignition mechanism and thus  the propagation mechanism in these turbulent detonations. In these mixtures, the  ignition mechanism is a combination of the classical mechanism of adiabatic shock  compression leading to ignition as well as the intense turbulent mechanism usually  attributed to deflagrations only.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf24p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37637360</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2676w102"><dcterms:title>Photochemical degradation of selected polycyclic aromatic compounds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Warner, Stephanie D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and many of their derivatives  are considered to be ubiquitous environmental pollutants, which often exhibit  mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity. In the atmosphere, photolysis is generally  considered to be the dominant degradation pathway for these pollutants. The  photochemical behaviours of benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene and  benzo(k)fluoranthene have been examined in the laboratory. This study was  complemented by an analysis of ambient air samples collected in the vicinity of a  Horizontal Stud Soderberg aluminum smelter in Beauharnois, Quebec. Benzo(a)pyrene is  much more reactive in the presence of light when compared to the fluoranthene  compounds. The products were identified as the 1,6-, 3,6- and  6,12-benzo(a)pyrenediones. An analysis of the ambient air samples revealed the  prevalence of benzo(b)fluoranthene in the emissions from the aluminum smelter. Its  relatively high abundance and resistance to degradation indicates that it will be a  suitable indicator to represent total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels at the  smelter. The photochemical behaviour of a series of nitropolycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons has also been investigated.

While there is evidence for only one progranulin gene in mammalian genomes, work  presented in this thesis demonstrates that granulins form an extended gene family in  teleost fish. Two zebrafish genes that constitute likely co-orthologues to mammalian  progranulin, progranulin-a and progranulin-b, encode precursors that encode 10 and 9  copies of the granulin motif, respectively. Two additional genes in zebrafish,  designated progranulin-1 and progranulin-2, each give rise to precursors consisting  of one and one-half granulin-like repeats only. The progranulin-1 and progranulin-2  genes are organized in tandem, and possess exonic complementarity to a single  non-coding RNA gene transcribed in the antisense orientation from the complementary  DNA strand. A cDNA encoding a chimeric precursor consisting of the amino-terminal  progranulin-1 followed by the carboxyl-terminal region of progranulin-2 was  characterized and is likely generated through the mechanism of splicing in trans  between the two primary transcripts for progranulin-1 and progranulin-2. Chromosomal  assignment of the zebrafish progranulin genes indicates that progranulin-a, but not  progranulin-b, is located on a chromosome that displays syntenic correspondence to  mammalian progranulin. Cumulatively, the data suggest that an ancestral progranulin  gene was duplicated at the base of the vertebrate radiation to generate precursors  with distinct architectures and that one was lost in the lineage leading to  tetrapods after the split between sarcopterygians and actinopterygians.

Analyses  focused on the predictors of gambling involvement with the covariate, drug-use,  removed. For the 962 college student (mean age 18.5) participants, global social  support, peer deviance and gambling frequency were the best predictors of gambling  involvement with drug-use removed. Although males and females both reported  diminished perceived supports globally and increased peer deviance as their reported  level of gambling involvement increased, females reported less perceived support  from all three networks. Males did not perceive less support from friends and family  as their gambling involvement increased. The social support construct provides a  social contextualization for future gambling involvement investigations. One  important implication of this research is that diminished global social support will  need to be recognized as a significant risk factor predicting problem gambling by  researchers, clinicians and politicians alike. Peer deviance will need to be  recognized as a significant risk-factor for males as well as females. Males reported  more gambling-related problems than females. Although peer deviance significantly  increased for both males and females with greater gambling involvement, peer  deviance was higher among males than females. Males perceived no diminished sense of  family and friend support. However, this shift for females appears to be evidence of  diminished perceived support from all sources: family and friends as well as  globally. Researchers, clinicians and politicians need to be aware that adolescents  and young adults are at increased risk for encountering gambling problems as  gambling frequency and peer deviance affiliation increases, and social support  perceived to be available globally diminishes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bracewell, Robert J.

Actually, truth and equity are virtually  absent from the court. In these conditions, why would one appeal to institutional  justice? Montpellier notables use the judicial system to exert pressure on a debtor,  to redress the internal familial order, to sidestep customary practices, to take  revenge, to cause harm. Indeed, the question of law is rarely something other than a  pretext, and it is precisely because it is vitiated that the judicial system can be  used in that way. The analysis of the procedural practices and of the judicial  system as they are---instead of as they should be---allows us to penetrate the  fascinating universe of social, familial and financial practices. Furthermore, the  emphasis on the civil procedures reveals an original perspective which goes beyond  the points of view of notarial and criminal archives usually preferred by  historiography. The petty Montpellier notables studied here are steering a delicate  course between customs, laws and procedures. Far from suffering the imperfections of  the judicial system, they are adopting them, appropriating and using them as means  of meeting their own objectives. The recourse to justice is similar to a game of  chess: the judicial system is the chessboard, its defects are the chess pieces and  the jousts, always fought inside the same frameworks and with the same weapons, are  opposing various opponents displaying different strategies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boulle, Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g56t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g31p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Courts -- France -- Montpellier -- History -- 17th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Montpellier (France) -- History -- 17th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct42v"><dcterms:title>Study of unsteady viscous flows generated by harmonically variable inflow velocities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mei, Chuan Bin, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The unsteady flows generated by the harmonically variable inflow  velocities are studied in this thesis by using a numerical method for the  time-accurate solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. This method, which has been  developed by Mateescu and Venditti, uses an implicit three-point-backward scheme for  the real time discretization, and a pseudo-time discretization based on a relaxation  procedure using artificial compressibility. A special decoupling procedure is used  to eliminate the pressure from the momentum equations with the aid of the continuity  equation in pseudo-time, in order to reduce the problem to the efficient solution of  scalar tridiagonal systems of equations. The method uses a finite difference  formulation on a stretched staggered grid, which was validated for the steady  incompressible flows in a duct with a downstream-facing step, by comparison with  previous computational and experimental results. This thesis first presents the solutions obtained for the  unsteady flows with multiple separation regions in a duct with fixed geometry, which  are generated by the variation in time of the inflow velocities. Then, the solutions  for the unsteady flows generated by both an oscillating wall and the variation in  time of the inflow velocity are also presented. The influence of the Reynolds  number, of the inflow velocity amplitudes, and of the phase difference is also  thoroughly studied.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t6880.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct42v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs12q"><dcterms:title>A Bénard-Marangoni instability and nucleation of nanotubes /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duquette, Jonathan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We present a novel model describing the nucleation and the  initial growth of bundles of carbon single-walled nanotubes (C-SWNTs). The formation  of the catalyst nanoparticle, on which bundles of C-SWNTs grow, is first  investigated. A qualitative analysis of the carbon-catalyst phase diagram shows that  the gas-phase synthesis process leads to the formation of a nanometric liquid layer,  supersaturated in carbon, surrounding the catalyst nanoparticle. It is then claimed  that a solutal Benard-Marangoni instability governs the flow of carbon in the liquid  layer. Using results from linear stability analyses, it is shown, for a planar and a  spherical geometry, that the onset of the solutal Benard-Marangoni instability in  the liquid layer is possible and favoured with respect to other fluid instabilities.  Subsequently, results from a weakly nonlinear stability analysis (in a planar  geometry) and from a bifurcation analysis (in a spherical geometry), are leveraged  in order to show that the instability leads to the formation of hexagonal convection  cells. It is argued that, once initiated, the solutal Benard-Marangoni instability  provides the kinetic mechanism necessary for the nucleation and the initial growth  of bundles of C-SWNTs. This model provides an explanation for aspects of the growth  still unclear, such as the nucleation mechanism, the nanometric diameter of C-SWNTs  and their collective organization into bundles, at the onset of the  growth.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g323j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs12q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nx48z"><dcterms:title>Plant-herbivore interactions between North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and trembling aspens (Populus tremuloides)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Diner, Brandee</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Plant-herbivore interactions play a significant role in the  structure and functioning of ecosystems. Co-evolutionary theory suggests that plant  defenses evolved due to herbivores and herbivore pressure can shape the genetic  composition of their food resources. We used interactions between North American  porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and trembling aspens ( Populus tremuloides) as a  system to investigate this theory's important assumption that herbivores select food  sources based on genetically controlled traits. We confirmed that porcupines exhibit  intra-specific food selection and that this is linked to the genetic composition of  the aspens. We also demonstrated that variation in phenolic glycosides and condensed  tannins are strong components of this selection, thereby creating an important link  between genetics, plant chemistry, and mammalian herbivory. We investigated  potential impacts of porcupine herbivory on aspen using fluctuating asymmetry,  however we did not detect any stress on heavily eaten trees, thereby questioning the  validity of this tool for this study system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67314470.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx48z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Populus tremuloides -- Effect of grazing on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Populus tremuloides -- Chemical defenses.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Animal-plant relationships.</dc:subject><dc:subject>North American porcupine -- Food.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp19f"><dcterms:title>Minueto, an undergraduate teaching development framework</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Denault, Alexandre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the last decade, the video game industry has shown  unparalleled growth, both in revenue and in development complexity. Modern video  games are built using powerful game development tools. However, given their  complexity and scope, these tools are ill-suited for the undergraduate academic  environment. Minueto is a platform independent game development framework  specifically designed for undergraduate students. Originally developed to help  students of the course COMP-361 for their game programming project, Minueto offers a  simple object-oriented API that is ideal for any 2D game development. Minueto's  simple design allows students to quickly learn the framework and avoid the overhead  typically associated with graphic programming. Extra effort was spent writing  multiple types of documentation, each of them corresponding to different learning  techniques. Minueto was first implemented in Java and used by the students of the  Winter 2005 term. There was an impressive increase in the overall quality of the  2005 projects if compared to the 2004 projects. A significant decrease in the number  of graphic programming complaints from the students was also noticed. This indicates  that Minueto successfully reduced the graphic programming burden from the students,  and allowed them to focus on the content of the game.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f73c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp19f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913q43b"><dcterms:title>Topological design and dimensioning of Agile All Photonic Networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhao, Ning, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we present the identification of methods and  tools for the design and analysis of an Agile All-Photonic Network  (AAPN).

Consequently, network  cost is minimized while taking into consideration performance criteria such as delay  and reliable traffic restoration upon network failure. A new mixed integer linear  programming formulation is presented for core node placement and link connectivity  to determine the near cost optimal designs. Both a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)  and a Canadian Wide Area Network (WAN) with two-layer or three-layer network  topological implementations have been tested.
