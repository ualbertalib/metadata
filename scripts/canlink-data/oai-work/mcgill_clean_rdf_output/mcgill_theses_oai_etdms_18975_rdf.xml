Appendix I, and the bulk of chapter 5, record unsuccessful attempts to fit certain precise theories of economic development to the facts of Canadian history. The theories demand types of information which cannot be had, or which it is not within my powers, or the scope of my intention, to discover.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Keirstead, B.

The cultivated strawberry is derived from two species. They are Fragaria virginiana, the wild meadow strawberry of eastern North America, and Fragaria chiloensis, the beach strawberry, which is found along the Pacific coast. The first improvement occurred among the Indians of Chile before Columbus landed at San Salvador. By selection from Fragaria chiloensis, they obtained plants which bore fruit of exceptional size and quality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taper, C.

The nature of the exchangeable cation is an example of an important chemical factor contributing to the properties of many clays. Experimental work has shown that in some soils swelling due to frost action can be dramatically reduced by changing the exchangeable cation./47 Other work indicates that the bearing capacity of piles may be increased by promoting cation exchange./47 At the Golden Gate Exposition the permeability of a lagoon was reduced 90% as the result of cation exchange./37</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De Stein, J.

Erasistratus, a Greek anatomist of Alexandria, discovered and named the gland in the human (Mettler, 1947). However, in spite of this early start, the physiology and the biochemistry of the prostate and other male accessory sex glands were for long neglected. But in the last few years, these structures have been the subject of comprehensive investigations (Huggins, 1945; 1946-47; Mann and Lutwak-Mann, 1951) stimulated by the growing interest in the problem of fertility in domestic animals and man.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scott, C.

The relapse rate of these patients is high and the carrier rate is not improved by the treatment with this antibiotic. However, if vaccine is given, normal antibodies develop to a high titer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, E.
