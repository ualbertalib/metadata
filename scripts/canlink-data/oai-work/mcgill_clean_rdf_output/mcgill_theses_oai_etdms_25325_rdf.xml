With their increased use, it is becoming critical to test and properly  characterize all such interfaces. Bit error rate (BER) characteristic is one of the  basic measures of the performance of any digital communication system.  Traditionally, BER is evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations, which are very  time-consuming. Though there are some BER test products, none of them includes  channel emulator. To overcome these problems, this thesis presents a scheme for BER  testing in FPGAs, with a few orders of magnitude speedup compared to Monte-Carlo  method. This scheme consists of two intellectual property (IP) cores: the BER tester  (BERT) core and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) generator core. Two  challenging testing cases are successfully conducted using the testing scheme. We  demonstrate through case studies that the proposed BER testing solution exhibits  advantages in speed and cost compared with the existing solutions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zilic, Zeljko (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh36k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b188w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sw483"><dcterms:title>A bilateral electro-hydraulic actuator system to measure dynamic ankle joint stiffness during human stance /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Forster, Shauna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of the stretch reflex during upright stance remains unclear despite research that has been conducted to date.

The apparatus consists of two foot pedals that are each connected to an electro-hydraulic rotary actuator. Transducers were incorporated to measure the position and torque of each actuator, the angle of the ankle with respect to the foot plate, and the positions of the knee and hip. The experimental apparatus allows independent perturbations to be applied to each ankle.

The present method uses velocity singularities in the Trefftz plane  (situated downstream at infinity) to derive the contributions in the solution of the  circulation distribution caused by the changes in the spanwise variation of the wing  chord and incidence. The new specific functions derived for these contributions  contain both natural and forced symmetry and antisymmetry terms, and thus represent  a correct mathematical modeling of the physical problem. The correct mathematical  representation of these contributions leads to a highly accurate theoretical  solution which is not the case in the previous methods. The method has been validated in comparison with the results  obtained by theoretical methods such as Rasmussen &amp; Smith, and Carafoli for  rectangular and tapered wings of uniform incidence, and with panel method (Katz  &amp; Plotkin) results. Accurate theoretical solutions have been derived for various  wing geometries of aeronautical interest, such as wings with curved leading and  trailing edges, and wings with asymmetric incidence variations caused by symmetric  and antisymmetric deflection of flaps and ailerons (which are more difficult to  model using the panel methods). Furthermore, the present method of solution has been extended to  solve the problem of swept wings. A procedure has been developed to specifically  treat this problem.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mateescu, D.

Through discussing their history, I explore how the overseas  Chinese came to imagine themselves as a community called 'Chinese Diaspora', which  is ostensibly held together by the imagination of a 'homeland' in a faraway place in  the distant past. By examining autobiographical texts, I discuss how the  'Chineseness' they maintained throughout the migration is founded upon such a  virtual reality, and how this in turn is experienced by the individuals. Taking the  narratives as something that both reflect and construct their identities, I explore  the conundrum women in diaspora face in representing their own experiences of the  community on the basis of Maxine Hong Kingston's memoir. Chinese women of diaspora  have particular difficulties in claiming their individuality through narrations,  especially because the community that sustains the 'traditional' Chineseness is  rapidly transforming.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galaty, J.

Intellectuals of all  political stripes sought to impose their own agendas by advancing both conservative  and reformist convictions as they used the figure of Calderon to their own advantage  in the creation of a 'Spanish national identity' for the time. The research conducted here focuses on the writings of various  thinkers of the rival ideologies over the two centuries mentioned above. What this  demonstrates most cogently is how, first, the appropriation of Calderon's image  always played an essential role in the political debate about 'national identity,'  and, secondly, how the dramatist's image was increasingly identified with the values  and parameters of conservative ideology. The first chapter deals with the origins of the debate about the  idea of a 'national identity' during the eighteenth century, and analyses in detail  the ideological duality and division which characterized this debate as well as its  strongly political background. The next two chapters examine respectively the  writings of Bohl de Faber and Menendez Pelayo, both of whom took on key roles in the  debate. The interpretation provided in these two chapters leads to the conclusion  that, by the nineteenth century, Calderon's image was strongly identified with  conservative ideology. The thesis ends with some final conclusions, followed by a  select bibliography.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Magallon, Jesus (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k7858.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x461x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>National characteristics, Spanish -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spain -- Intellectual life -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calderón de la Barca, Pedro, 1600-1681 -- Appreciation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m001g"><dcterms:title>Self-identification processes and their reflection in the language of fourth-wave emigrants in Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>rus</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Migdissova, Svetlana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis analyzes the speech behavior of Russian emigrants of  the fourth wave during the period of their adaptation to the life in the  "new" country.

It proposes bridging the vocabulary gap  by first determining which word families account for 95% of the target domain's  running words, and then having students learn these word families by reading texts  in an order that allows for the incremental introduction of target vocabulary. This  is made possible by a recently developed computer program that sorts through a  collection of texts and (a) finds texts with a suitably high proportion of target  words, (b) ensures that over the course of these texts, most or all target words are  encountered five or more times, and (c) creates an order for reading these texts,  such that each new text contains a reasonably small number of new target words and a  maximum number of familiar words. A computer-based study, involving the sorting of  293 news texts, resulted in the finding that all three of these conditions could be  met for the majority of texts tested, provided two key changes were first made to  the sorting algorithm. A potential problem with the computerized approach is also  addressed. The approach takes for granted that a reader must be familiar with 95% of  a text's tokens in order to adequately comprehend the text, but a recently published  study challenges this assumption by claiming that 98% is a more accurate figure. A  close analysis of the study, however, points out a serious methodological flaw which  undermines this result.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lyster, Roy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r6230.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jv237</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education -- Data processing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Languages, Modern -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn875"><dcterms:title>Écluses, suivi de, La narration multiple dans le roman Des feuilles dans la bourrasque de Gabriel Garcia Marquez</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gibbs, Mélisandre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There are several ways of utilizing the plurality of narrative  instances in a novel; the "stereoscopic view", which presents an object  through the lens of several perceptions, is one of these ways.

The narrative of each of these short stories is  supported by a distinct character.

This memoir suggests a reading of this rhetoric,  concentrating on various specific Hugolian arguments and suggesting a global vision  of his reasoning. The first chapter demonstrates that the opposition between law and  his application lies at the root of the judicial criticism according to Hugo, from  which also stems the question of death penalty to begin with. We then study the  genesis and the functioning of multiple arguments depicting the consistency and  persistency of Hugo's reasoning, these arguments being interpreted from novel to  novel. Finally, in the third chapter, we analyze history's role as a meta-argument  of the abolishment; the historical development often structuring the opposition of  Hugo's theory regarding the excessive use of capital punishment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duquette, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v8381180.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv697</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hugo, Victor, 1802-1885 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Capital punishment in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d0338"><dcterms:title>A critical review of characterization in the fourth Gospel's structure of anonymous disciple allusions /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Casimir, Stephen P., 1936-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This investigation is about characterization in the Fourth  Gospel as it relates to the "disciple"---the mysterious, anonymous figure  that pervades the structure of allusions in this narrative.

The "loved ones" that constitute  our nuclear and extended familial worlds are the primary beneficiaries of our  affections and of the fruits of our labors. In return for the primacy we accord our  family members, we expect their behavior to demonstrate their loyalty to the clan.  However, at a certain point obligations to the family can conflict with the needs of  the individual. In this thesis I examine how filial duties influence the plights of  the tragic heroines in Sophocles's Antigone and Shakespeare's King Lear. Both  Antigone and Cordelia organize their lives around the virtue of family honor, and  yet the strength of these commitments is not sufficient to spare them from their  respective, calamitous ends. Their unwavering dedication to the sanctity of family  bonds leaves them susceptible, as individuals, to great harm.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.

Being human, we form through perception, build  through forming, dwell in building, and perceive through dwelling. Through close  reading and analysis, this thesis examines questions of: If we are how we dwell,  then what happens when the structures and the spaces of our dwellings become  haunted? What happens when "home" becomes a facade that suspends necessary  elements of dwelling? This study projects that if we are how we dwell, the very  nature of our being entails a constant questioning of what it is we allow a presence  to in our how we form, build, dwell, and perceive within both tangible and  intangible realms and the influential perspicacity literature bears within this  process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c106z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w95s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dwellings in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>MacDonald, Ann-Marie, 1958- .

The call by Islamists for the  establishment of such a state governed by the Shari'ah has given rise to criticism  that Islamization would entail the revival of the discriminatory rulings of  traditional Islamic law with respect to non-Muslim citizens and the negation of the  modern principle of the right to equality for all citizens irrespective of religious  belief. To provide a background to the problem, this study presents a brief review  of the stance of traditional Islamic law on the status and rights of non-Muslims  living within the domain of Islam. This tradition has informed the discourses of  contemporary Islamists on the question. Two currents of thought are examined:  radical and moderate Islamism. Radical Islamists assert that granting non-Muslim  citizens equal status and rights with Muslims is inconsistent with the teachings of  Islam, although in stating this they confirm the apprehensions that Islamization  would result in institutionalizing discrimination against religious minorities.  Moderate Islamists on the other hand maintain that the concept of equal rights for  all citizens is compatible with the tenets of Islam. Nonetheless, their arguments  are not without problems as there are limits to how far they are willing to go in  offering equal status and rights to non-Muslims.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pg86p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676w209</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human rights -- Middle East</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam and politics -- Middle East</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human rights -- Religious aspects -- Islam</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vr56d"><dcterms:title>The effects of confidentiality on the working alliance /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gonzalez, Laura</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study investigated how the issues of perceived and  desired confidentiality are related to the working alliance between adolescent  clients and their counselors.

Results indicated that  adolescents preferred greater levels of confidentiality than they thought they would  actually get in hypothetical situations, but preferred significantly less in actual  situations. In addition, the level of confidentiality adolescents preferred in both  hypothetical and actual situations did not impact the working alliance. The level of  confidentiality adolescents thought they would get in hypothetical situations was a  significant predictor of the working alliance.

Two measures of  pragmatic ability were developed: a multiple-choice questionnaire designed to probe  pragmatic awareness of various speech acts and a set of oral role-plays designed to  elicit two requests, two apologies and one refusal. These measures were also  administered to eight native speakers in order to establish a scoring system for the  pragmatic awareness test and target norms for the role-plays. A background  questionnaire was given to all participants while a proficiency test, Combined  English Language Skills Assessment in a Reading Context, or CELSA was administered  only to the Japanese participants. The findings in this study demonstrated that there was not a  strong relationship between proficiency and pragmatic ability, nor was there one  between pragmatic awareness and production. The measures were moderately correlated  but they also exhibited a great deal of variation from learner to  learner. Certain linguistic abilities were observed to be valuable  regarding pragmatic ability, such as being able to make conventionally indirect  requests. Learners were more direct in their speech acts than native speakers. They  also used fewer and less varied strategies and lexical modification, with the  exception of the politeness marker, please, which they over-used. There was evidence both in terms of the pragmatic awareness  measure and in the analysis of the production that over-directness decreased with  increasing proficiency. The two assessment instruments produced different kinds of  errors at different levels of proficiency, pointing to the possibility that they  were tapping the abilities associated with pragmatic awareness and production at  different stages of development. This research has implications for both testing and teaching  pragmatic ability.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turner, C. E. (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Lyster, R.

The literature suggests that school-based management can be found in  various degrees, but that it is not always successfully implemented. Obstacles  related to school-based management include how school governing boards are composed,  how their powers are defined, and the nature of their relationship with their school  boards. Evidence from the three participants suggests that these obstacles may  threaten the credibility of school governing boards. The study concludes with  recommendations for improving the effectiveness of school governing boards in  Quebec.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Claudia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j602.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xx89m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>School management and organization -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>School boards -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505115q"><dcterms:title>"Nous faisons chaque jour quelques pas vers le beau simple" : transformations de la mode française, 1770-1790</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Allard, Julie, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses the simplification of fashion in the French  "beau monde" at the end of the eighteenth century. It reveals that the  simplified fashion of the 1770s and 1780s was the result of a new feeling for  nature. New perceptions of the body led physicians to plead for a new fashion, more  respectful of the natural characters of the body. On the aesthetic level, natural  simplicity was meant to be the only way to recover original truth and energy.  Moreover, anglomania, by way of sustained exchanges with England, contributed to the  development of a simpler and more egalitarian fashion. This new feeling for nature  reflects profound changes in the French society at the end of the century. The idea  of nature, defined according to the values and ideals of a rising bourgeoisie,  conveyed a bourgeois spirit no longer restricted to a narrow social  group.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boulle, Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n863m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505115q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fashion -- France -- History -- 18th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
