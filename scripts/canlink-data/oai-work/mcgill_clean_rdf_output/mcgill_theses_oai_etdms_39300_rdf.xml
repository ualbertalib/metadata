As masticatory efficiency diminishes drastically in edentulous patients, many researchers in the past two decades have been studying how dietary intake varies when different types of oral rehabilitation are provided. Since the use of implants to support prostheses in edentulous mandibles has been shown to significantly improve masticatory performance, the question remains as to whether this improvement will influence nutritional status. In the present study, we used several nutritional markers to compare the nutritional status of edentulous patients who randomly received either mandibular conventional dentures or implant-supported overdentures one year previously. Although the conventional denture wearers reported having more difficulty chewing hard foods, no significant differences were detected in any of the nutritional markers. Therefore, even though chewing is more difficult for the patients wearing conventional dentures, it appears that the nutritional status of these two groups is similar.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watson, A.

Release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids by PLA2 is the rate-limiting step in eicosanoid synthesis. Activation of cPLA2 involves phosphorylation and calcium-dependent translocation from the cytosol to the membrane. cPLA 2 is reported to translocate to nuclear membranes after cell activation, however, other potentially relevant subcellular membranes have not been clearly defined. In the present study, we examined the association of cPLA2 with membranes of organelles, using a glomerular epithelial cell line that overexpresses cPLA2. Unstimulated cells, or cells stimulated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, plus phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 30min) were disrupted by homogenization in Ca2+-free buffer, and were subjected to low-speed centrifugation to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The post-nuclear supernatants were then subjected to sucrose or iodixanol gradient centrifugation. After collecting fractions from gradients, the distribution of cPLA2 and organelles was analyzed by immunoblotting and quantification by densitometry, using antibodies to cPLA2, calnexin (marker of endoplasmic reticulum), Hsp60 (mitochondria), and neu (plasma membrane), or by beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase enzyme assay (golgi). In cells stimulated with ionomycin + PMA, analytical fractionation showed that cPLA2 colocalized with plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. There was no association with mitochondria or golgi. Significantly more cPLA 2 was associated with plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum in stimulated cells, as compared with unstimulated, however, a readily detectable amount of cPLA2 was also membrane-associated under resting conditions. The pattern of cPLA2-membrane-association in cells treated with antibody and complement was similar to that in cells stimulated with ionomycin + PMA.

Two isoforms of eIF4A, eIF4AI and eIF4AII, are functionally indistinguishable. A third member of the eIF4A family, eIF4AIII, whose human homolog exhibits 65% amino acid identity to human eIF4AI, has also been cloned from Xenopus and tobacco, but its function in translation has not been characterized. In this report, human eIF4AIII is characterized biochemically. While eIF4AIII, like eIF4AI, exhibits RNA-dependent ATPase activity and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity, it fails to substitute for eIF4AI in an in vitro reconstituted 40S ribosome binding assay. Instead, eIF4AIII inhibits translation in a reticulocyte lysate system. In addition, whereas eIF4AI binds independently to the middle and carboxy-terminal fragments of eIF4G, eIF4AIII binds to the middle fragment only. These functional differences between eIF4AI and eIF4AIII suggest that eIF4AIII plays an inhibitory role in translation under physiological conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sonenberg, Nahum (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526f16p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569631x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kc529"><dcterms:title>Network traffic control and bandwidth management in internet : a differentiated services case study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Suqiao, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This Master's thesis deals with network traffic control and bandwidth management in Internet, and includes four parts. In part 1, we introduce network traffic, the basic principles of traffic control, control methods and components, which are used to support the Quality of Service (QoS) in different network environments. In part 2, we present network bandwidth management concepts and its methods. Bandwidth is finite and valuable, so we need to manage it efficiently. Bandwidth management can support traffic control to lighten the traffic load. Bandwidth management and traffic control are complementary, and together can assure a high QoS. In part 3, we address the QoS issues in Internet, since the Internet is increasingly important and popular. We focus on the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) in Internet, and implement the two-bit (Premium/Assured) based DiffServ by coordinated control. Coordinated control is the combination of traffic control, bandwidth control and queue control. Since the two-bit based DiffServ has two major drawbacks, in part 4, we propose some new methods and algorithms to improve them. These methods and algorithms include Multilevel Assured Service, Token-based Assured Service, Constraint Based Routing and load balancing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Newborn, M.

I (3,4-dimethoxy-alpha-(4-methyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)-beta-hydroxypropriophenone) and II (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenol)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)propan-1,3-diol) were studied in the presence of three UV absorbers 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB), an aminated DHB (MDHB), a benzotriazole derivative (Tinuvin P) and an antioxidant; the additives being incorporated into thin films of I and II were applied on filter paper. Several products were identified and quantified using a combination of GC-MS and GC-FID techniques. The photodegradation mechanisms of I and II were found to be consistent with the phenacyl and ketyl pathways from which products were generated via oxidation, heterocoupling, H-abstraction and homocoupling reactions. In the presence of the inhibitors, some of these reaction pathways were minimized and others eliminated. In decreasing order, the Tinuvin P/Tempo pair were the most effective in protecting the models against photodegradation followed by MDHB and DHB. A synergistic photostabilization effect was also observed between Tinuvin P and the antioxidant, but was not retained during irradiation, probably due to the low regeneration rate of Tempo on the matrix. The photostabilization effectiveness of MDHB can be related to the cooperative action of its UV absorbing, hydrogen donating and oxygen scavenging functionalities. However, the separation of product 12 from MDHB was not possible by GC and the photo-chemical fate of MDHB remains undetermined. No synergism was found between MDHB and Tempo. DHB displayed good UV absorbing characteristics but no other photostabilization properties were found to cooperate with it.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Argyropoulos, D. S.

This study used the more sensitive method, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess variability between and within subjects, for both pain and tactile-related activation. Four subjects participated in two fMRI sessions each. Thermal and tactile stimuli were applied to the skin on separate runs. Activation maps were generated comparing painful to neutral heat and tactile to rest. Group analysis revealed pain- and tactile-related activation consistent with the majority of PET studies. Comparison of activation sites across subjects revealed differences in the location of peaks corresponding to anatomical variability in sulcal position. Comparing across sessions for each subject revealed differences in the intensity but not the location of peaks. These results indicate that pain and touch evoke reliable patterns of cortical activation. Intensity-related differences and intersubject variability could explain the variable results of PET studies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bushnell, M.

The retrieval can be improved with measurements taken by a vertically pointing Doppler radar. In this work, we study the impact on the reconstruction of the wind field when UHF wind profiler information is used as an additional constraint along with bistatic measurements. Experiments were done with a synthetic wind field to study how the information from the profiler can be integrated and how it is propagated. These experiments show significant improvement of the retrieved vertical motion. Consequently, the algorithm for the retrieval of the 3-D wind has been modified to combine the UHF information with the bistatic network and its impact is studied for the case of a shallow supercell.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zawadzki, Isztar (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xn54z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj139</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hm07w"><dcterms:title>Recovery, separation and characterization of phenolic compounds and flavonoids from maple products</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Deslauriers, Isabelle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Comparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas-liquid chromatography (GC) analyses of selected phenolic and flavonoid standards were developed using a wide range of detectors, including ultraviolet diode-array (UV-DAD) and electrochemical (EC) detectors for HPLC and flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS) for GC. The results demonstrated that the limits of detection obtained with HPLC-EC analysis were 10 to 500-times higher for phenolic acid standards and 2 to 50-times higher for flavonoid standards than those obtained with the HPLC-UV analysis.

The results indicated that GC/FID/MS analysis of phenolic and flavonoid standards was more efficient than that of HPLC, providing a fast analysis with better resolution and baseline separation of all standards with minimum co-elution. The only co-elution encountered in GC/FID was with coniferol and p-coumaric acids.

The AZRL and simple terpenoids (ST) content in the neem seed kernel, the seed shell, the leaf and the leaf stem was determined with conventional extraction method and the newly developed quantification technique. The results showed that the AZRL content in these parts of neem decreases in the order of seed kernel &gt; leaf &gt; seed shell &gt; leaf stem. With the HPLC quantification technique, the content of azadirachtin in the neem seed kernel was determined, and the comparison of the azadirachtin content and the AZRL content suggested that azadirachtin accounts for around 58% of the total AZRL. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of AZRL and ST from various parts of neem was also investigated. Various parameters affecting the extraction such as the power and the microwave irradiation time were studied. The comparison of the MAE with two conventional extraction methods, viz., room temperature extraction (RTE) and reflux temperature extraction (RFX) revealed that the property of sample matrix affected the special accelerating effect of the MAE. The study on the influence of solvents on the MAE showed that the solubility of the solvent to the target components and the ability of the solvent to absorb microwave energy played an important role in MAE.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raghavan, G.

Four different types of cellulose, namely a fully bleached softwood pulp (Q-90), hemicellulose reduced pulp derived from Q-90, cotton cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel), were subjected to pressurised oxygen and nitrogen treatments in a kettle reactor. The changes in relative degree of crystallinity, viscosity and carboxylic acid content as a function of time were used to evaluate cellulose degradation. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy determined the relative degree of crystallinity. Viscosity and conductometric titration measurements followed the changes in the degree of polymerisation and carboxylic acid content respectively. A plot of relative degree of crystallinity as a function of oxidation time showed reproducible and consistent results for all celluloses with all applied techniques. The relationship showed a common trend wherein three phases were apparent: an initial increase in relative degree of crystallinity was followed by a decrease and then another gradual increase. The change from a decrease in relative degree of crystallinity to an increase occurred at fifteen minutes for Q-90 and hemicellulose reduced pulp, and at minutes for cotton cellulose. No change in the relative degree of crystallinity with time was evident for Avicel. These trends were rationalised using the concept of the fringed micelle model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Argyropoulos, Dimitris S.

Forty-eight weaned stags were divided into 8 groups and randomly allocated to four dietary treatments. Two levels of energy (E) and protein (P), low (L) or high (H) were obtained by the addition of various amounts of oats and soybean meal (SBM). This trial was divided into 2 phases: For the first 32 weeks (Phase I), diets LE/LP and HE/LP contained 0.5 and 1.0 kg/deer respectively of oats; diet LE/HP consisted of 0.15 kg of oats and 0.30 kg of SBM, and diet HE/HP, of 0.5 kg of oats and 0.35 kg of SBM. In Phase II, the level of supplementation was increased while keeping a constant relationship with the body weight of the deer. The animals were group fed, and offered mixed hay ad libitum. The animals were weighed every two weeks, over 48 weeks and slaughtered at 90.5 to 100.6 kg body weight. Increasing the energy level in the supplement resulted in a substitution effect of grain for forage. As a result, there was no difference in total energy consumption. For this reason, no difference was observed (P &gt; 0.05) between treatments for values of ADG or final weight. Feeding supplemental protein over 368 g/deer/d didn't improve ADG or liveweight (P &gt; 0.05). There were no treatment differences (P &gt; 0.05) in estimates of carcass yield, kidney fat, or tissue depth (GR). Results indicate that concentrate feeding does not stimulate overall growth rate.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Phillip, Leroy E.

However, little is known about the interactions between crutch use and gait in the incomplete spinal cord injured population. This thesis presents a quantitative description of five incomplete spinal cord injured subjects who use Canadian crutches, representing a wide spectrum of gait speeds, with respect to several kinetic and kinematic factors, and focuses on describing observed interactions. Results indicate that Canadian crutches are used primarily for support, balance and braking. Peak loading on the crutches in the axial direction was observed to be between 10 and 38 percent of subjects' body weight, and seemed to be related to the magnitude of lower limb loading during the gait cycle. Peak braking forces ranged from 0.13 to 0.58 percent of body weight, where the highest braking forces were seen in the subjects with the lowest gait speeds. The use of crutches for balance was observed consistently throughout the single limb support phase in the contralateral crutch in all subjects. The relationship between vertical ground reaction forces and axial forces on the crutches is supported by kinematic data and moment analysis. It is suggested that due to common factors among all subjects in the spectrum, that there may be prerequisites such as balance or lower limb strength for assisted gait with Canadian crutches. Strategies aimed at improving these requirements may aid in efficient and successful crutch walking.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Torres-Moreno, Ricardo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Barbeau, Hugues (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139393k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074x15g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t8211"><dcterms:title>Historical inventory of sedimentary carbon and metals in a Bay of Fundy salt marsh</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Clegg, Yolanda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 1996, four cores (~30 cm depth) were extracted from the high marsh zone of Dipper Harbour salt marsh in the Bay of Fundy. Soil bulk densities are shown to be controlled by mineral density and are higher than those reported for salt marshes in the northeastern United States. Examination of variations in mineral content suggests that regular tidal action and ice rafting deposits the majority of the mineral sediment to the high marsh zone. Dating techniques (based upon pollen, 137Cs, 210Pb and total Pb) were applied to selected cores, suggesting accretion rates from 0.25 to 0.31 cm yr-1 which are higher than the rates of local relative sea level rise. Correlation of trace metal densities (Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) to Al densities were used to justify Al normalization. After consideration of natural sources and adsorption factors, the normalized Pb profiles are shown to reflect historical pollution levels of leaded gasoline consumption. Carbon storage values in the upper 25 cm of sediment range from 7.3--10.5 kg C m-2 and carbon accumulation rates vary from 95 to 124 g C m-2 yr-1, representing 15--29% of the salt marsh macrophyte productivity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chmura, G.

PMP22 is an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed primarily in the compact myelin of the mammalian peripheral nervous system. The naturally-occurring Trembler, and Trembler-J mouse models of hereditary neuropathies carry non-conservative point mutations in the PMP22 gene and have been essential in developing the understanding of the cell biology of PMP22 mutants. However, the greatest limitation to the study of PMP22 mutant trafficking has been the lack of a good model of myelination. To address this, we have developed replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses to study the intracellular trafficking of epitope-tagged wild-type, Trembler, and Trembler-J PMP22 in vivo. We have determined that in myelinating Schwann cells in vivo, newly synthesized epitope-tagged wild-type PMP22 is incorporated into myelin whereas the PMP22 mutants, Trembler and Trembler-J, are intracellularly retained in the ER.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Snipes, George Jackson (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jq61n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s6610</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6m311r23x"><dcterms:title>Averting a clash between culture, law and science : an examination of the effects of new reproductive technologies in Kenya</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wasunna, Angela.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the legal and ethical consequences of new reproductive technologies in the context of Kenya's two systems of law, namely, English-based statutory law and native customary law. The paper starts by examining how infertility was dealt with by traditional Kenyan societies before the advent of reproductive technologies and proceeds to look at some of these customs that have survived in contemporary Kenya. Currently reproductive technologies are being carried out in a legal vacuum in Kenya and in the event of any dispute involving the procedures, courts have to refer to existing laws, both customary and statutory. The thesis therefore examines what these technologies are and how Kenya's dual system of law would respond to some of the family law dilemmas raised by the use of these reproductive procedures. The thesis then discusses whether there is enough justification to enact a new, uniform, hybrid Act that takes into consideration both systems of laws in relation to the challenges brought on the technologies. It is the position of the author that an integrated hybrid Act ought to be passed. This Act would act as a broad framework for regulation, however the Act would not be the exclusive form of regulation. The last part of the thesis therefore makes recommendations on other forms of control that ought to be considered by legislators and policy makers in Kenya, to deal with the myriad of legal and ethical issues precipitated by reproductive technologies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harvison-Young, Alison (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps303.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r23x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human reproductive technology -- Moral and ethical aspects -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human reproductive technology -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human reproductive technology -- Religious aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conflict of laws -- Kenya.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jw471"><dcterms:title>Evolution of aircraft finance law : considerations of the UNIDROIT reform project relating to aircraft equipment.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Yan, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After more than ten years from its initiation by the Canadian delegation in 1988, the UNIDROIT's legal reform in the area of international security and leasing interests in mobile equipment reached its final stage of discussion at the international level.

In order to demonstrate that the influence still exists, at least in respect of conflicts of jurisdiction, a comparative analysis of the responsibility of the carriers of goods will be carried out in the light of international conventions. The thesis will consider the new evolution of maritime law, which today, in many aspects, follows air law. It will become clear that both systems face the same difficulties. In particular, the multiplication of international conventions has weakened the aim of uniformity by admitting different regimes of the carriers' liability. Once the causes of conflicts of jurisdiction have been identified, the thesis will analyze how the conventions attempt to solve those conflicts. The use of forum shopping by the parties and the use of forum non conveniens by the courts, reveals that present international solutions are not satisfactory. The practice in maritime law is to consider a conflict prior to its existence and to permit jurisdiction as well as arbitration clauses. While the former clauses are forbidden in air law, arbitration clauses, although accepted in various international air conventions, have never been used until recently in air law, and only in respect of the financing of major projects. It is therefore possible to believe today, that the maritime approach can and will be followed in respect of conflicts of carriage of goods by air, thus proving that maritime law does still influence the evolution of air law.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, William (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v740m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jd161</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Maritime law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conflict of laws -- Jurisdiction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j0754"><dcterms:title>The standard of review under the North American free trade agreement chapter 19 : a comparative study with particular emphasis on the law of Mexico</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laporta, José Luis.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>On January 1, 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) entered into by and between Mexico, Canada and the United States, came into force. Chapter 19 of NAFTA addresses the Review and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Matters. Furthermore, article 1904 of NAFTA, addresses issues related to the Review of Final Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Determinations. The said article stipulates that an involved Party may request that a panel review, based on the administrative record, a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination of a competent investigating authority of an importing Party. The object of such review is to determine whether the determination was in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing Party. In order to review such determination, the panel shall apply the standard of review set out in Annex 1911 of NAFTA, and the general legal principles that a court of the importing Party otherwise would apply to review a determination of the competent investigating authority. Since these kinds of regulations are quite new in the Mexican legal system, the interpretation of the standard of review, has raised a lot of discussion among several panelists, governmental authorities and authors. Therefore, this paper will focus on the application and interpretation of the standard of review under NAFTA chapter 19, mainly by Mexican authorities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, A. L.

Traditionally, the participation of NGOs in international negotiations has been examined from the functioning of their relations between them and international organizations. Their increasing participation in international negotiation forums however, raises the question of their influence on the preparation of legal texts adopted by States. This study tries to review those two aspects of their influence by noting the evolutions of their participation, identifying their successes and their failures and trying to explain them. Based on the study of four negotiating processes on scientific and technical instruments, this study has the double purpose of contributing to international law by increasing knowledge about this poorly understood question of the normative influence of international actors, and to give to NGOs some leads for a better action from a legal point a view.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Provost, Rene (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c2421.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd57f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Non-governmental organizations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land mines (International law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>International law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental law, International.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tt49t"><dcterms:title>Prix de transfert &amp; accords de repartition des couts (ARC)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lenik, Jean-Sébastien.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the transfer pricing issue within the perspective of setting up a cost contribution arrangement for the international management of intangible property.
