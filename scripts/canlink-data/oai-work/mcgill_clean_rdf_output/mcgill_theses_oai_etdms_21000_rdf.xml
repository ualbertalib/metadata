Feed consumption varied greatly both between and within litters. Within litters, consumption was positively correlated with birth weight, and with early weight gains. This suggests that greater feed intake was typical of larger and more mature pigs rather than reflecting compensation for poor milk intake by smaller litter-mates. Within-litter differences in weight gain during the two weeks after weaning were positively correlated with birth weight but not correlated with pre-weaning creep feed intake. Creep feed intake appeared to contribute to pre-weaning gains and these were correlated with post-weaning gains; however a more direct affect on post-weaning gain could not be detected.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g42k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f710f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Swine -- Feeding and feeds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Animal behavior</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h15s"><dcterms:title>A multiprocessor interface for a colour graphics animation system /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pancholy, Rajiv</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes the design and hardware implementation of a high speed multi-processor interface used in a colour graphics animation system.

An important qualitative aspect of a recording, besides the musicality of the performance, is its timbral content. Proper level and spectral balance between the mixed elements of the recording and the absence of extraneous noises and distortion are key elements. Therefore, timbre perception acuity is an essential skill for sound engineers. This thesis proposes a computer-assisted system as a training tool for developing and maintaining aural skills related to timbre perception. A set of criteria for the design of such a system based on current knowledge in timbre perception is presented and an exploratory implementation is described.

Here, using systems theory in a description of geological processes, we study the chaotic development of sedimentary sequences. The geosystem is treated as a partially specified system in order to apply qualitative stability analysis in the investigation of sedimentation behaviour and interactions among geological processes. The analysis suggests that the sedimentary system is unstable. This instability in conjunction with the system's sensitive dependence to internal fluctuations (i.e., those generated within the system) provide supporting evidence to suggest a chaotic behaviour for the sedimentation system. We suggest that chaos could act as the common underlying mechanism which is manifest as the fractal-flicker noise character observed in reflectivity well logs. Acoustic impedance variations--the geophysical measures of lithologic variability--represent the internal organization of the interacting geological processes. This organization under a chaotic regime is responsible for the common statistical character found in various sedimentary basins.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mr001.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z968</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vv393"><dcterms:title>Identity and difference in Aristotle's theory of perfect friendship</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kahane, David J (David Joshua), 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines how Aristotle's theory of friendship deals with differences between persons, given that his paradigm case is that of friendship between men who are excellent without qualification.

I establish my interpretation against a rival view, which sees Aristotle as sensitive to the need for attentiveness to and valuation of differences between friends: while I show this latter view to be exegetically untenable, I suggest that it is informed by modern understandings of individual uniqueness which provide the basis for a critique of Aristotle.

Bores moved upstream and evolved into packets of internal solitary waves with 3-6 minute period when the tide turned to ebb. Using results from different models of the solitary wave based on the KdV equation, it is shown that the second-order nonlinear term must be included in the two-layer model. The results from a first-order continuously stratified model gave similar good results. This implies that two-layer models may ignore some properties of the real fluid and that the internal solitons are also sensitive to the stratification characteristics of the water column.

The Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) was the most frequent foraging associate of Zenaida doves. The laboratory study consisted of two experiments where conflicting information about a novel food type and novel food-finding problem was provided simultaneously by a conspecific and a heterospecific (grackle) demonstrator. Both experiments showed that not only could Zenaida doves learn from another species, but that they preferred the heterospecific demonstrator over the conspecific. The results suggest that social information may be obtained more readily from foraging associations rather than interference competition and that the role of conspecifics may be overemphasized in cultural learning.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w790.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw32s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zenaida -- Behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social learning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nj25r"><dcterms:title>Loop integrals containing large masses</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dhirani, Al-Amin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate a method for estimating loop integrals containing large masses.

The main results from the study of 17 couples in marital therapy suggest that significant sex differences exist in dyadic adjustment. Sex differences were also noted in the correlations between dyadic adjustment and depressive symptoms.

Elimination of these inclusions has long been a major target in steelmaking. In this investigation, attempts have been made to remove these non-metallic inclusions by passing the liquid steel through a ceramic filter. It was found that this approach is very effective for removing solid non-wetting inclusions such as alumina. It appeared that liquid silicates could also be removed to some degree.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s358n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666565s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj6731511t"><dcterms:title>Kinetics of coil overlap in ionomer blends by 1H NMR in DMSOd6</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boss√©, Francis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>$ sp1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies were carried out on blends of lightly sulfonated polystyrenes (PS-SSA) (5 to 15 mole % sulfonation) of molecular weight (MW's) ranging from 5000 to 100,000, with poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-vinyl pyridine) (PMMA-4VP) copolymers (5 to 11 mole %) of MW = 100,000. The process of coil overlap was monitored as a function of time by the acquisition of a proton spectra, which showed the gradual disappearance of the original methoxy signal and the appearance of a new signal originating from the shielded methoxy protons. The contributions of the two species were separated using a deconvolution program. In order to propose a complete model for the coil overlap phenomenon, parameters that can influence the kinetics of the process were studied. The parameters included the water content of the solution, the ion content of copolymers, the temperature, the MW of PS-SSA and the total polymer concentration. It was found that the water content had no influence on the shielding process. The study of all the other parameters showed that the overlap was occurring through a complex mechanism. It was determined that the true order (n$ sb{c}$) for the shielding process was second-order, reflecting the early stages of the mixing process. In the stage in which the "ladder" like complex is produced, the experimental data can be best represented by a kinetic expression containing two opposing first order reactions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kk815.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731511t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246t16k"><dcterms:title>Biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soilwater systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Bashir, Bilal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is concerned with the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly the utilization of biological processes in the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils. In this regard, the effects of the contaminant bioavailability and the redox environment on the biodegradation process have been investigated. First, the mineralization of naphthalene in soil/water systems under denitrifying conditions has been studied. Results showed that naphthalene mineralization is influenced by its availability to the microbial population, which in turn is a function of the compound initial concentration, the sorption/desorption characteristics of the soil/contaminant complex and the organic content of the soil. Second, the biodegradation of four PAH compounds, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, fluorene and anthracene, in a soil/water system under four redox environments has been studied. Both aerobic and denitrifying environments supported appreciable PAH biodegradation rates. The denitrifying environment was chosen for a further experiment to investigate the performance of a bioreactor system in treating PAH-contaminated soils. Results showed that by enlarging the scale of the reactor by approximately eight times and simultaneously reducing the mixing intensity of the soil slurry, the biodegradation rates of the PAH compounds remained virtually unchanged.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k6256.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t16k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zx74k"><dcterms:title>Gender differences in fearfulness among elderly urban dwellers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Charlton, Wendy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Field research was carried out in the community of Notre Dame de Grace, an urban environment typical of the kind in which more and more older women will reside as Canada's population ages.

Recommendations are made for changes to the planning process which would result in urban communities better suited to the needs of elderly women. Anthony Gidden's structuration theory is applied as a framework for explaining why older women are more fearful than elderly men, and why older women alone are the most fearful group. Deficiencies in feminist and gerontological approaches are identified, and an argument is made for greater integration of these perspectives.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fq162.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx74k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Older women -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Community development, Urban</dc:subject><dc:subject>Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce (Montr√©al, Qu√©bec).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Urban ecology -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k626g"><dcterms:title>Pseudosimulation in distributed simulations : a deadlock prevention algorithm with fixed memory requirements</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>C√¥t√©, Claire</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Distributing discrete event simulations among several processors appears to be a promising approach to speed up simulations and reduce the complexity of the tasks to be accomplished by each processor. Processing the events in parallel requires a synchronization technique which would insure the simulation correctness while keeping the overhead relatively low. In a distributed simulation, the simulation progresses at a different speed in every processor. The main problem consists in enabling a processor to know if it holds all the information needed to correctly make a further step in the simulation. We describe an algorithm having fixed memory requirements and allowing a processor to know if it holds a complete set of information in order to correctly continue the simulation. The algorithm also forces missing information to arrive at a processor that requested it.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v091.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k626g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bg177"><dcterms:title>Immunochemical studies of aggregating cartilage proteoglycans in pseudoachondroplasia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hirata, Soichiro</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the present investigation was to study the aggregating proteoglycans in rib cartilages from patients with pseudoachondroplasia in comparison with those from age-matched normals. Biochemical and immunochemical analyses using antibodies against different substructures of these molecules permitted an investigation of their contents, structures, sizes, and aggregatability with hyaluronic acid. The structural changes in proteoglycans were characterized by longer chondroitin sulfate chains, with reduced 4-sulfation, unchanged 6-sulfation and increased non-sulfation, which resulted in larger molecules. These chains were attached to proteolgycan core protein by fewer chondroitin 4-sulfate linkage regions and more unsulfated chondroitin linkage regions. There were three populations of proteolgycans of different sizes in normals at all ages (4, 11 and 30 years old) and an adult patient (31 years old). These three populations were characterized by an abundance of chondroitin 6-sulfate epitope and fetal-specific epitope 846, of chondroitin 4-sulfate epitope, and of keratan sulfate in order of decreasing sizes. There was an absence of the population of proteoglycans of intermediate size recognized in young patients (4 and 12 years old). There were also decreased contents of the hyaluronic acid-binding region and keratan sulfate in the adult patient. Hyaluronic acid content was considerably increased in these patients. The latter changes may reflect differences in turnover of proteoglycans in the cartilage matrix in pseudoachondroplasia.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px214.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg177</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xw15w"><dcterms:title>The constitutions of Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America in relation to Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hirt, Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention, 1929 limits the liability of the air carrier in the event of death or wounding of a passenger to 125,000 Francs-Poincare based on a defined gold value. In 1955, the limitation has been raised to 250,000 Francs-Poincare. As gold has lost its special position in the monetary system the value of the limitation of liability has decreased and some plaintiffs have argued that the limitation of liability is unconstitutional. The Warsaw System is presented, the grounds for a limitation of liability, and Article 22 are analyzed. The relationship between municipal law and international law is described. The constitutionality of Article 22 is examined for the jurisdictions of Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America.

This master's thesis considers whether the guarantee of equality in the U.S. Constitution and in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms can change this situation. The first part argues that in theory the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause provides a promising basis for challenges to policies and statutes that discriminate against gays. Nevertheless, these challenges are unlikely to be successful because most U.S. courts fail to see beyond the stereotypes that prevent homosexuals from gaining access to their civil rights. The second part contends that the approach to constitutional equality taken by the Supreme Court of Canada might be more helpful in eradicating discrimination against gays. Challenges of, e.g., policies excluding homosexuals from the Canadian Forces or the exclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits that heterosexual couples enjoy should be successful.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs097.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vc637</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
