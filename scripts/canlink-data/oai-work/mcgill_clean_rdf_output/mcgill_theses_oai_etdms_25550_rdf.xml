A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the early 1920s, discontent about freight rates led to a number of major political battles. Statistical analysis and a review of contemporary reports suggest that the economic importance of these issues was greatly exaggerated. They were blamed for problems which were mainly attributable to such factors as the world-wide recession, the movement of the terms of trade against agricultural producers or the trend towards industrial concentration. Examination of official documents and private papers indicates that government policy-making on freight rates was influenced by political priorities (especially winning back the West), lobbying by affected interests and the opinions of strong-minded individuals. The King Government intervened in the question of railway rates, but its procrastination, obfuscation and reversals of policy reduced the political credit it received for the concessions it decided to make. Its abortive initiatives on lake and ocean rates were empty political gestures, made out of ignorance of the economics of these complex issues.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx208.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j17c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Railroads -- Freight -- Rates -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation -- Canada -- Economic aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freight and freightage -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh42q"><dcterms:title>The old tories and British foreign policy 1930-1939 /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Krishtalka, Aaron, 1940-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The old tories were the most enduring group within the British Conservative parliamentary party between the two world wars: by taste, habit and convictions, independents in parliamentary traditions, yet loyal Conservatives in politics. They led the successful Conservative revolt against the coalition with Lloyd-George. In 1930 they tried to overthrow Stanley Baldwin, and opposed his disarmament policy and Imperial policy, especially in India, together with Winston Churchill. They pressed for Imperial consolidation through tariffs and Imperial Preference, wished to rearm Britain early, support France and the 'Stresa Front' to contain Germany, and exclude Russia from Europe. Events led these 'die-hard' perennial rebels to become the chief defenders of Neville Chamberlain's foreign policy as being closest to their own, though unfortunately late. Always independent, they forbade colonial cessions to Hitler, opposed alliance with Russia in 1939, supported total war against nazi Germany, and had an important and ironic part in Chamberlain's fall.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv10n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh42q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Great Britain -- Politics and government -- 1936-1945.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Great Britain -- Politics and government -- 1910-1936.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Conservative Party (Great Britain) -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kk25t"><dcterms:title>Relationship between ferromagnetic particles and airborne chrysotile fibres in the asbestos mines and mills of Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Djamgouz, O. T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Examination of Chrysotile Asbestos from the Eastern Townships of Quebec using optical and electron microscopic methods has shown that Chrysotile fibres are intimately associated with minute particles of magnetite. Measurements were made using a fluxgate magnetometer of the remnant magnetic fields of bulk commercial fibres and of airborne total dust and of the respirable fraction of airborne dust collected in Quebec asbestos mines and mills using a Hexhlet horizontal eleutriator. The validity of the Hexhlet horizontal eleutriator for respirable fibre collection in the mill environment was determined. It was observed that the remnant magnetic field intensities of airborne dust in laboratory generated dust clouds, and in the work places were related in a meaningful way to the magnetite content of the dust and to the total mass and respirable mass fractions of airborne dust, and also, to the concentrations of fibre greater than 5 micrometre length (aspect ratio &gt; 3:1) measured using phase contrast microscopy. Calibration curves were developed for each of 9 Quebec mills. Repeat calibrations showed the lines to be reproducible within (+OR-) 10 percent. The accuracy of the method for mass dust determination was dependent on sample size with errors as low as (+OR-) 7.5 percent for samples larger than 3 milligrams, and as large as (+OR-) 40 percent for samples of mass smaller than 0.5 milligrams. The relationships between fibre concentrations and remnant magnetic fields were less reproducible and the lower detection limit was limited by the sensitivity of the fluxgate magnetometer. Although the measured remnant magnetic field varied as the magnetite content varied between different mills and commercial fibre products, magnetite to chrysotile ratio remained constant for a given mill and commercial product. Measurements of the remnant magnetic fields of airborne dusts collected in mill environments can thus provide the possibility of the rapid determination of airborne chrysotile fibre concentrations both in terms of mass and number of fibres per litre of air sampled as well as their iron content. Measurement of the magnetic content of specimens of autopsied lung tissue from asbestos exposed workers indicated that the residual estimated fibre content measured by electron microscopy was less than estimated using magnetic field measurements. As the distribution of magnetic particles has been measured in living persones using magnetic chest scans, our result suggests thatsuch measurement subject to consideration of particle removal rates may provide an estimate of magnitude of original asbstos dust exposure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt32c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk25t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chrysotile.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asbestos industry -- Québec (Province) -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asbestos dust.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859g35j"><dcterms:title>Stress physiology and biological weed control : a case study with Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.)

This case study with the perennial weed, Cirsium arvense, (L.) Scop. evaluated the stress of five natural enemies. Attack by a seed head predator, Orellia ruficauda (F.) caused about 21.5% predation and may reduce seed dispersal. The stress of stem gall formation (Urophora cardui (L.)) is greatest when the gall occurs on young plants and on the mainshoot and defoliation simulation (Cassida rubiginosa Muller) is most effective at high levels on young plants. In nature, however, the latter two natural enemies are not synchronized with these susceptible stages, thereby reducing their effectiveness. Although Cleonus piger Scop., a root crown inhabitant, can result in plant death, regeneration of damaged vascular tissue can occur. Plants which emerge systemically infected with Puccinia punctiformis (Str.) Rohl. (rust) rarely survive the season. A matrix model simulating the effects on Canada thistle population dynamics by the natural enemies was applied.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h016b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g35j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada thistle -- Biological control.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weeds -- Biological control.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806041p"><dcterms:title>Ottawa and Quebec : the politics of confrontation, 1967</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Butler, Pamela</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work deals with the relationship between the Canadian Federal Government and the Government of Quebec from January 1967 - February 1968. It treats both governments as members of a dyad but differs from other studies of dyadic conflict in a number of important ways. Whereas other investigations have examined the dyadic behavior of sovereign states, this work explores the relationship between a federal and a provincial government within an ethnically-divided federation. In so doing, concepts and methods normally reserved to the field of international relations are applied to this particular type of domestic conflict. Second, rather than examining only the behavior of the dyadic opponents, the publicly-stated goals of key members of the participating governments are also analyzed to determine whether or not they are related to subsequent patterns of conflictual and cooperative behavior. Finally, the role of a third party to the conflict (France) is introduced and its impact on the conflictual behavior of Ottawa and Quebec is evaluated. This study also offers a detailed analysis of the issues that surfaced in the period under study.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m481p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806041p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>France -- Relations -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Relations -- France.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Politics and government -- 1960-1976</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- English-French relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A00000068n"><dcterms:title>Habitants, spéculateurs et exportateurs : le commerce du café en Haiti</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Girault, Christian A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study, based on almost a year's fieldwork, is the first comprehensive investigation of coffee marketing in Haiti. This commerce is shown to illustrate two levels of dependence relationships: one, that of international trade where agricultural products have always been, and continue to be, exchanged on an unequal basis and, two, at the level of the internal marketing system where the habitants (peasants) are tied to a monopoly, support the burden of taxation and experience strong social and political control. The main marketing agents, the speculateurs (middlemen) and the exportateurs (exporters) are identified and described, marketing mechanisms analysed, and the peasant strategies of resistance evaluated. Finally, the thesis illustrates how the articulation of marketing arrangements around coffee, the principal export staple of the country, furnishes an explanation of both the historic formation of Haiti and its present social and spatial organization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hills, Theo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pg89h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000068n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coffee -- Haiti -- Marketing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coffee industry -- Haiti.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892b50k"><dcterms:title>The critical reception of Oskar Maria Graf's prose fiction, 1921-1974 /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Johnson, Sheila Kay, Ph.
