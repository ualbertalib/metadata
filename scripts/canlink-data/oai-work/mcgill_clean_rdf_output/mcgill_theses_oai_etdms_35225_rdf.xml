Results show no significant differences in overall Heath-Carter somatotype  characteristics, percent body fat, fat free mass and girth measurements between COPD  and control subjects although when stratified by gender, female COPD patients  exhibited a greater body fat component. Measured VO2 (L/min) at rest or during  steady-state exercise was not significantly different between COPD and control  subjects despite a higher exercise ventilation in patients. Neither resting or  exercise energy expenditure was related to body composition, however it was related  to DLCO/VA (ml·min-1·mmHg -1·L-1).

The main objective of this  study was to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic of surface cast production of two  earthworm species, Aporrectodea turgida and Lumbricus terrestris, on the  row-interrow scale in a temperate soybean agroecosystem. Our observations  demonstrated that casting activity was synchronous with plant growth. More casts  were also found in the row intercepts compared to the interrow ones. Both the  spatial and temporal variations are thought to be caused by the microclimate found  under the plant canopy, verifying results from controlled laboratory studies that  show casting activity to be controlled by soil temperature and moisture.

Exposure to smoking cues induced a  subjective craving response and elicited activation of a distributed neural system  involved in the cognitive and emotional processing of salient stimuli.

This analysis can provide information  useful in a compiler for performing aggressive optimizations. The impact of the use  of side-effect analysis in compiler optimizations has been studied for programming  languages such as Modula-3 and C, but no thorough investigation for Java has been  done. We present a study of whether side-effect information improves performance in  Java just-in-time (JIT) compilers, and if so, what level of analysis precision is  needed. We also analyze the optimizations and benchmarks that benefit most from  side-effect analysis. We used SPARK, the inter-procedural analysis component of the  SOOT Java analysis and optimization framework, to compute side-effect information  and encode it in class files. We modified Jikes RVM, a research JIT, to make use of  side-effect analysis in various local and global analyses and optimizations such as  local common sub-expression elimination, heap SSA, redundant load elimination and  loop-invariant code motion. On the SpecJVM98 benchmarks, we measured the static  number of memory operations removed, the dynamic counts of memory reads eliminated,  and the execution time. Our results show that the use of side-effect analysis increases  the number of static opportunities for load elimination by up to 98%, and reduces  dynamic field read instructions by up to 27%. Side-effect information enabled  speedups of up to 20% for some benchmarks. The main cause of the speedups is the use  of side-effect information in load elimination. Finally, among the different levels  of precision of side-effect information, a simple side-effect analysis is usually  sufficient to obtain most of these speedups.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405s9892.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r3709</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p65s"><dcterms:title>Linking the neuropeptide annetocin with reproductive success of the earthworm Eisenia fetida in two natural soils amended with the wood preservatives chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leduc, Frédéric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chromated copper arsenate (CCA), type C, was largely used as a  wood preservative due to its exceptional fungicidal and insecticidal properties.

In this  framework, the agent must explore the environment to gather more information about  the model and the utility of each of its actions, while striving to act as well as  possible using limited knowledge. One of the major obstacles that prevent  reinforcement learning from being extended to real-life settings is the fact that  the agent is blind to the risk of actions during learning, potentially ending up in  catastrophic states. This thesis presents a model-based directed exploration method  for selecting actions based on a measure of risk, characterized by entropy and  expected immediate reward. The weighted combination of this risk measure and the  long term utility of the action, or risk-adjusted utility, is used to determine the  probability of different actions. Using this approach, agents can manifest  risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior. Experimental results show that risk-directed  exploration can result in better performance during learning than the standard  Boltzmann action selection method, or other directed exploration methods such as  counter-based and recency-based methods.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967422b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z833w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397886g"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of RA-target genes from keratinocytes potentially involved in epithelial tumorigenesis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laforest, Brigitte</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Retinoic acid (RA), the principal biologically active retinoid,  is essential for normal differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.

Keratinocytes with a null  mutation in the RARgamma and RARalphagamma genes are predisposed to tumorigenesis in  vivo. This outcome is reversed by the re-introduction of a functional RAR,  suggesting that some retinoid-target gene(s) are implicated in tumour formation in  this model.

Another approach,  closer to how people build a mental map, is the topological map. A topological map  contains only places that are easy to recognize (landmarks) and links them  together. In this thesis, we explore the issue of creating a topological  map from range data. A robot in a simulated environment uses the distance from  objects around it (range data) and a compass as inputs. From this information, the  robot finds intersections, classifies them as landmarks using a neural network and  creates a topological map of its environment. The neural network detecting landmarks  is trained online on sample intersections.

The primordium of the anterior pituitary gland, Rathke's pouch, is formed by the  invagination of somatic ectoderm that lines the roof of the oral cavity. It has been  shown that SHH is important in pouch formation, but there is a controversy over  where the source of the signal is originating from the neural or oral  ectoderm. The objective of my project was to describe the expression  pattern and the role of Shh in the specification of Rathke's pouch in the chick  embryo. I analyzed the expression pattern of Pitx2 and Lim3 which are two  transcription factors required for pituitary development. Pitx2 was expressed  throughout Rathke's pouch and the oral ectoderm during pituitary formation. Lim3 was  expressed in Rathke's pouch, with stronger expression on the rostral side of the  pouch. Interfering with the SHH signalling pathway at the time of  development of cells that will form the hypophyseal placode altered the expression  patterns of Pitx2 and Lim3. This suggests that the SHH signal from the neural  ectoderm plays a role in pituitary patterning.

It occurs mostly in females, 80% of whom harbor mutations in  the DCX (Xg22.3-q23) gene. To determine whether males and females with SBH have a similar  clinical spectrum and genetic basis, we analyzed and compared the clinical, imaging,  and molecular features in 30 males and 60 previously reported females with  SBH. The range of clinical phenotypes in males with SBH overlapped  that in females. However, MRI studies revealed that some SBH subtypes such as  incomplete posterior SBH, diffuse SBH with posterior predominance and pachygyria-SBH  were more frequently or exclusively observed in males. Conversely, diffuse SBH and  diffuse SBH with anterior predominance were more frequent in females. The  preponderance in males of either the mildest or the most severe SBH subtypes  correlated with the overrepresentation of normal/borderline intelligence and severe  mental retardation respectively. Conversely, females who had SBH of intermediate  severity exhibited mostly mild or moderate mental retardation. Mutations in DCX were  detected in 33% of males; 8% had mutations of the LIS1 (17p13.3) gene and 4% a  partial trisomy of chromosome 9p. These studies demonstrate that SBH in males is a clinically and  genetically heterogeneous, mostly sporadic syndrome, and suggest other genetic  mechanisms such as mutations in the non-coding regions of the DCX or LIS1 genes;  functional, somatic or germline mosaicism; and mutations of other  genes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903048v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w284t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nm045"><dcterms:title>Factors influencing gene flow in guppies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Crispo, Erika</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two processes may lead to genetic divergence among populations.  One is mediated by geography, whereby physical barriers and geographic distance  limit gene flow among populations, resulting in divergence due to drift or mutation.  Another is ecological speciation, whereby populations adapt to their local  environments via natural selection, and gene flow is impeded by selection against  dispersers in favor of adapted residents. I used natural populations of guppies  (Poecilia reticulata) to determine the relative influence of these two processes in  the structuring of populations. If geography is playing a strong role, I predicted  that gene flow would be greatly impeded by physical barriers and geographic  distance. If ecology is playing a strong role, I predicted that gene flow would  decrease with increasing strength of divergent selection among populations.  Specifically, I examined the relative roles of physical barriers, geographic  distance, predation, and various other habitat features (e.g. canopy cover, water  velocity) on the amount of gene flow among populations. I was thus able to determine  whether natural selection or decreased dispersal plays a greater role in the  reduction of gene flow. I found that physical barriers and geographic distance  played a large role in the regulation of gene flow among populations. Predation and  physical habitat features did not play a role in the reduction of gene flow. My  research clarifies the mechanisms involved in speciation and the production and  maintenance of biodiversity, important issues in conservation and evolutionary  biology.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x4537.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm045</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Natural selection -- Trinidad and Tobago</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guppies -- Adaptation -- Trinidad and Tobago</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guppies -- Trinidad and Tobago -- Geographical distribution</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s302s"><dcterms:title>Characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying the neurogenic effect of the bHLH protein Hes6</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bélanger Jasmin, Stéphanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hes1 is a mammalian basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)  transcriptional repressor that inhibits neuronal differentiation and acts together  with the corepressor Gro/TLE. Hes1 interacts with Gro/TLE through its WRPW motif and  recruits Gro/TLE to specific DNA sites. In contrast, a related Hes family member,  Hes6, promotes neuronal differentiation. Little is known about the molecular  mechanisms underlying the neurogenic effect of Hes6. To address this question, a  structure/function analysis was performed to identify domains of Hes6 important for  its biological activity during the differentiation of cortical neurons. It is shown  here that the nuclear translocation of Hes6 is required to promote cortical  neurogenesis. However, Hes6 neurogenic activity does not appear to be DNA-binding  dependent, suggesting that it is mediated by protein-protein interaction mechanisms.  Moreover, a conserved potential PEST sequence present at the C-terminus of Hes6,  which may regulate protein turnover, is also important for the neurogenic activity  of Hes6. It is also shown that the nuclear translocation-incompetent form of Hes6  and, to a lesser extent, the PEST sequence-defective form have a reduced ability to  promote a proteolytic degradation of Hes1. This correlation suggests that Hes6 may  regulate cortical neurogenesis by a protein-protein interaction mechanism in which  Hes6 interacts with Hes1 and promotes a proteolytic degradation of the  latter.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296wz62t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s302s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967424w"><dcterms:title>Sablejit : a retargetable just-in-time compiler</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bélanger, David, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we introduce SableJIT, a retargetable  just-in-time compiler for the SableVM Java virtual machine. Our design attempts to  minimize the amount of work required to port (or to retarget) our compiler to a new  platform. We accomplish this in three ways. First, we introduce a retargetable  backend where the amount of work required to port it is reduced to the  implementation of simple well-defined primitive functions. Second, we keep all code  related to the internals of the virtual machine in the frontend, making knowledge of  the target architecture sufficient for a port. Finally, we provide a good  development environment that favours incremental development and testing, in part  through a robust runtime system that can recover from compilation  failures. We demonstrate the portability of SableJIT by supporting three  processor architectures and various operating systems. In particular, we describe  the experience acquired in porting our compiler to the Solaris/SPARC  platform.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn46p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967424w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139250k"><dcterms:title>OFDMA schemes with diversity in frequency-selective fading channels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Xu, Ying Lin, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>By using sufficiently long prefix and orthogonal narrow-band  sub-carriers with adaptive bit loading, orthogonal frequency-division  multiple-access (OFDMA) can offer high bandwidth efficiency required for broadband  wireless access communications in frequency-selective fading channels. However, when  deep fading occurs in a frequency slot, it can create data loss in one or more  sub-carriers. Diversity techniques could be used to enhance the performance of OFDMA  in the presence of deep fades. The research presented in this thesis aims to provide diversity  in OFDMA for broadband wireless access communications in frequency-selective fading  channels. First, the diversity characteristics in OFDMA are examined to establish  the diversity equivalence in the time and frequency domains. Based on these  characteristics, suitable techniques to achieve the full diversity gain in OFDMA are  developed. When channel information is available to transmitters, a group-optimal  adaptive-tone-diversity OFDMA (GO-ATD-OFDMA) scheme that combines adaptive diversity  gain and bit loading, is proposed. It is shown that the GO-ATD-OFDMA can offer a  better performance than the conventional time-domain Rake receiver. In the case of  unavailable channel information, spreading is combined with diversity in the  proposed group-spreading OFDMA (GS-OFDMA) scheme to provide both diversity  protection and interference suppression. The GS-OFDMA has a comparable performance  to the group-orthogonal multi-carrier code-division multiple-access (GO-MC-CDMA)  scheme but with a reduced transmitted peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). Performance  of the proposed schemes in terms of error rates, spectral efficiency, achievable  system throughput, and computational complexity is investigated by analysis and  simulations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wq750.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139250k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zr26f"><dcterms:title>Value estimation for software development processes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Zhihua, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The management of software development processes is a continual  challenge facing software development organizations.

The transmission system of this unit features a planetary  gear train and a ball-screw mechanism. Due to this special transmission design, two  driving motors can be placed on the fixed base, thereby enhancing the load-carrying  capacity of the robotic drive unit. Parallel robots constructed and actuated with  the proposed units should exhibit higher load-carrying capacity and faster motion  capability, as compared to existing drives. The conceptual design of the unit is  first proposed, and a design alternative is then discussed. The application of this  novel drive unit is illustrated by the example of integrating three such drive units  into a six-dof parallel manipulator with three Universal-Prismatic-Spherical (UPS)  legs. With six actuators installed on the fixed base, such a manipulator can be  endowed with high stiffness, high speed, high accuracy and high load-carrying  capacity. Furthermore, a testbed is designed in order to verify the kinematic and  dynamic performance of the drive unit. The kinematic analysis of the drive unit, the  testbed and the six-dof parallel manipulator is conducted. The CAD modelling and  animation results are included to validate the design and the kinematics of the  drive unit.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts226.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs47c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515n97f"><dcterms:title>Electrochemical studies of the adsorption of bovine serum albumin on a platinum surface</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pyshnov, Elizabeth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reports results on the investigation of the  thermodynamics and kinetics of adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on a  platinum electrode at pH 7.4 in a wide temperature range using the electrochemical  techniques of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  and differential capacitance (DC). The adsorption of BSA at anodic potentials has been found to be  a competitive process occurring in parallel with platinum oxide formation. It has  been found that the adsorption charge is directly proportional to the amount of  protein adsorbed. With the increase in temperature, the maximum amount of adsorbed  BSA (saturated surface concentration) also increases. This dependence has been found  to be linear.

The charges  consisted of a packed bed of reactive particles saturated with a liquid explosive.  Once the charge was detonated, the particles accelerated to high velocities and  impacted a rigid plate or cantilever gauges. The positive phase pressure impulse at  the rigid plate surface and the cantilever bend angles were measured at various  distances. Comparison of the results for large diameter Zirconium (millimetre-sized)  and small diameter Aluminum particles (sub-micron) suggested that the impact and  fragmentation of the former contributed to the overall loading of the blast wave  within the near field. Single particle acceleration experiments concluded that the  impacting of burning particles with a rigid structure resulted in fragmentation at  all impact velocities. This suggested that the fragmentation mechanism was an  efficient means by which to increase the overall energy release rate from the  particle combustion process. Non-burning impact experiments were also conducted.  Results implied the importance of shear banding and thermal stressing within the  blunt impact and fragmentation mechanisms. Critical impact velocities for  fragmentation with Zirconium, Titanium and Aluminum particles were obtained above  which fragmentation of the metallic spheres occurred.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t695d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096764n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
