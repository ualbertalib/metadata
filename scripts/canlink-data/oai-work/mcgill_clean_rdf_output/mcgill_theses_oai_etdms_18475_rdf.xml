These advances have induced changes in the role concept of women, as perceived by society and by women themselves. Whereas women were formerly expected to limit their outlook to immediate family affairs, they are now encouraged to develop talents, express opinions and enter into planning and activities outside the home, often in occupations and fields conventionally dominated by men.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Younge, Eva.

According to this theory, many of the symptom expressions of parasitic diseases especially those occurring in the non-invaded parts of the host are due partly or entirely to those secretions of the pathogen formed while it is growing within the host.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coulson, J.
