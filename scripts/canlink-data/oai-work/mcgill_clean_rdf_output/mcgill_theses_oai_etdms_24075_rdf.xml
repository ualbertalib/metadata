D. antillarum densities were substantially lower in 1992 than in 1982, reflecting the 1983 mass mortality event. Reductions in urchin density were greater on less eutrophic reefs than eutrophic reefs. Cover by macrophytic algae increased, cover by crustose coralline algae decreased, and the number of coral species decreased between 1982 and 1992. With the notable exception of the most eutrophic reef, coral cover decreased over the 10 year period. Changes in algal cover across reefs between 1982 and 1992 were strongly correlated with decreases in D. antillarum densities, and were therefore typically greater on less eutrophic reefs, indicating that reduced grazing pressure has more strongly influenced algal cover changes than prevailing eutrophication levels. Coral species composition changed at all sites between 1982 and 1992, and except at the most eutrophic site, the direction of change was directly related to reduced D. antillarum densities and associated algal cover changes. Temporal change at the most eutrophic site was best explained by the prevailing high level of eutrophication, and resulted primarily from a substantial increase in the cover of one species, Porites porites. The decrease in coral cover that occurred on most of the study reefs in the face of the increasing cover by macrophytic algae was typically accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of Type 1 (high recruitment, high natural juvenile mortality) to Type 2 (low recruitment, low natural juvenile mortality) corals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hunte, Wayne (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w321r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx44v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eutrophication -- Barbados.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diadematidae -- Barbados.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coral reef ecology -- Barbados.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m745x"><dcterms:title>Effect of mulch on the soil microenvironment, yield of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), and aphid population</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Aziz, Fahrurrozi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two independent experiments were conducted during 1992 and 1993 using a Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications.

The second was conducted to study the effect of polyethylene mulch on aphid population and on growth and yield of bell pepper. Initially, rye-grass germination under polyethylene mulches was significantly higher than that on bare soil, whereas mustard seed germination under mulches did not differ significantly from that on bare soil. However, at the end of 30 days, none of these weeds were observed in the mulched plots. Transmittance, reflectance, and absorbance were recorded in the Near Ultraviolet (390-399 nanometre), Photosynthetically Active Radiation (400-700 nanometre), and Near Infrared (701-1100 nanometre) bands for black, black microperforated, wavelength selective and silver mulches. Aging had little effect on the optical properties of the mulches. The wavelength selective (Infra red transmitting = IRT-76) green mulch had the warmest mean soil temperatures, followed by silver, black, microperforated black mulch, and bare soil. The soil moisture content was higher under plastic mulches than in bare soil. The use of mulches significantly increased both the early and total marketable yields of pepper. Plants grown with polyethylene mulch had significantly lower number of aphids on them than did their bare soil counterparts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, K. A.

It considers Clarissa's triumph in relation to the implicit doctrine of freedom of the will and the constitution of the self. Clarissa and Lovelace represent the uncontrollable freedom of the human will and exemplify its potentiality either to choose the good or to subject itself to the desire for power and self-gratification. Chapter one of this thesis discusses Clarissa in relation to the theories of several current literary theoreticians whose work constitutes a response to Kant's ideas on freedom and ethical decisions. The remaining chapters seek through close reading and interpretation of key scenes in the novel to understand what Richardson meant to represent through Clarissa's triumphant death. The argument reassesses Richardson's use of exemplary figures to embody his spiritual and moral ideas. It addresses the problem of ambiguity in Clarissa's forgiveness of her persecutors. Richardson's representation of Clarissa's triumph has both worldly and spiritual aspects. Acting always in accordance with principled choice (second-order evaluations), Clarissa resists all attempts to subjugate her; she reconstitutes her identity to become a Christian heroine. She achieves spiritual transcendence through penitence for her errors, forgiveness of those who have injured her and complete resignation to the will of God. Lovelace's misuse of free will and his refusal to relinquish his libertine identity and reform lead to his final worldly and spiritual defeat. Through their lives and deaths Clarissa and Lovelace demonstrate that individuals are responsible for the choices they make, for the identities they establish, and that they must accept the consequences of their choices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hensley, David C.

Universal constraints have been proposed to account for these structural restrictions (Poplack (1980), Woolford (1983), Di Sciullo, Muysken and Singh (1986)) but have had limited success in accounting for code-mixing between typologically diverse languages. This thesis examines the structural principles that apply universally to the interaction of languages in code-mixed sentences. We argue that systematic cross-linguistic restrictions on code-mixing can be accounted for by a syntactic constraint that is sensitive to the distinction between functional and lexical categories. We propose the constraint of Language Indexation, according to which (structurally) adjacent categories of like functional/lexical category status must be realised in the same language. We show how this proposal accounts for code-mixed data from a range of language pairs, including Tagalog/English, Moroccan Arabic/French, Swahili/English, Irish/English, Hindi/English, Spanish/English and French/English. A difference in the application of Language Indexation in nominal versus verbal projections is discussed with reference to Tagalog/English and Moroccan Arabic/French code-mixing. Finally, we briefly examine the implications of Language Indexation with respect to the code-mixing of aphasic bilinguals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Travis, Lisa de Mena (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Paradis, Michel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd30h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bq17k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Syntax</dc:subject><dc:subject>Code switching (Linguistics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bilingualism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb4949409"><dcterms:title>De raza a cultura : un acercamiento crítico al concepto de mestizaje y mexicanidad en Vasconcelos, Ramos, Paz y Fuentes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>spa</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Hispanic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Montano Rodríguez, Rafael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present thesis studies the concepts of mestizaje and Mexican identity in five essays and two short stories: La raza cosmica and Indologia, by Jose Vasconcelos; El perfil del hombre y la cultura en Mexico, by Samuel Ramos; El laberinto de la soledad and Posdata, by Octavio Paz; and finally the short stories "Chac Mool" and "Por boca de los dioses", by Carlos Fuentes.

Relational work, a component of many women's jobs, is the work involved in dealing with, and managing, feelings and emotions. It is said to be invisible because it is unnoticed, undervalued, or taken for granted. Patients expect relational care but few classify it as work. They value it personally but do not see how it contributes to medical or technical work in the hospital. Patients attribute the skill involved in doing this work to personality, link the motivation for doing it to altruism, and overlook the constraints which determine how nurses provide emotional care.

Recent advances in the field of translatology participate in this shift in paradigm, insofar as they dismantle the discourse of transparency and restore to translators their primary role in the reception/re-enunciation of the source text. A study of the production and reception of Anne Cameron's Daughters of Copper Woman (1981) demonstrates the extent to which the translator, in choosing to take on the stakes arising from the source text, becomes responsible for her/his performed act of mediating. Furthermore, the translator must be prepared to accept the subjectivity of her/his own reading and ideological convictions, and to contest the value of invisibility traditionally attached to the translator' s role. Analysis of the translations of the first ten short stories of Daughters of Copper Woman illustrates how the translator's ideological stance orients her translation choices.

It will be apparent that a female political author, considered less of a risk to society, faced fewer dangers of censorship than her male counterparts. At the same time, 19th century definitions of Bourgeois women's behavior also served to marginalize her work. She was called a "child" not to be taken seriously, placed in the shadow of men (Goethe, Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim), and her life was generally considered before her work.

The first package deals with fundamental properties of acoustic waves. The bulk acoustic wave program calculates bulk acoustic wave (BAW) propagation properties in materials of arbitrary anisotropy and piezoelectricity. The surface acoustic wave program calculates surface acoustic wave (SAW) and plate-mode propagation properties in multilayers of arbitrary anisotropy and piezoelectricity. These two programs provide the basis for the study of specific bulk-wave and surface-wave devices and structures. The second package deals with SAW grating geometries consisting of gratings, transducers, delays, acoustic and electrical coupling elements, and matching networks. The software simulates any arbitrary structure that can be derived from built-in acoustic and electrical building blocks. Software design is flexible and other building blocks can easily be added. Synthesis of very narrow, lossy, multipole, bandpass filters is included. The acoustic wave models are based on matrix formulations. The BAW model expresses bulk-wave propagation as a third-order eigenvalue problem. The SAW model represents each layer with a transfer matrix describing the mechanical and electrical field variables. Boundary conditions between layers are automatically satisfied when these transfer matrices are chain-multiplied, yielding in the general case, a first-order, eight-dimensional differential equation. Similarly, the grating device model uses the cascaded transmission matrix description (distributed model), where overall transfer characteristics are computed by chain-multiplying building block matrices. This distributed model provides accurate in-band and out-of-band responses. The filter synthesis uses a lumped element model approximation of one-pole two-port resonator building blocks as a first approximation. The synthesis design is then verified with the accurate distributed model.

Vector Quantization (VQ) is an efficient approach to encode speech at low bit rates. However its exponentially growing complexity poses a formidable barrier. Thus a structured vector quantizer is normally used instead. Summation Product Codes (SPCs) are a family of structured vector quantizers that circumvent the complexity obstacle. The performance of SPC vector quantizers can be traded off against their storage and encoding complexity. Besides the complexity factors, the design algorithm can also affect the performance of the quantizer. The conventional generalized Lloyd's algorithm (GLA) generates sub-optimal codebooks. For particular SPC such as multistage VQ, the GLA is applied to design the stage codebooks stage-by-stage. Joint design algorithms on the other hand update all the stage codebooks simultaneously. In this thesis, a general formulation and an algorithm solution to the joint codebook design problem is provided for the SPCs. The key to this algorithm is that every PC has a reference product codebook which minimizes the overall distortion. This joint design algorithm is tested with a novel SPC, namely "Predictive Split VQ (PSVQ)". VQ of speech Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF's) using PSVQ is also presented. A result in this work is that PSVQ, designed using the joint codebook design algorithm requires only 20 bits/frame(20 ms) for transparent coding of a 10$ sp{ rm th}$ order LSF's parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Chan, Wai-Yip (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg83b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483k18r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m030x"><dcterms:title>Swelling of polymer gels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Singh, Jaspreet, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The swelling equilibrium and kinetics of weakly crosslinked, non-ionic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) gels were studied in water at a constant temperature of 298 K. The gel structure was varied by changing the monomer concentration, the proportion of crosslinker, and the temperature at gel formation. The relationship between the fractional approach to equilibrium (F) and the square root of time ($ surd t$) was sigmoidal. A model was developed to describe the kinetics of gel volume change for swelling or collapse. The model was based on Fick's first law and accounted for the movement of the boundary of the gel. Numerical computations for one-dimensional cases involving planar, cylindrical and spherical geometries were performed with a constant diffusion coefficient. Experimental data for disk-shaped and spherical poly(NIPA) gels in water and for spheres of rubber in toluene were well fitted by the model using a constant mutual diffusion coefficient. Composition dependent mutual diffusion coefficients including those suggested by the scaling theory, also gave good agreement with experiments. A new categorization of diffusion in polymers based on the F versus $ surd t$ plot is proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weber, M. E.
