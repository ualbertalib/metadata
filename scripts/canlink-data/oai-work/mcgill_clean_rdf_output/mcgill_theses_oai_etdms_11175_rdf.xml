Indeed, the whole subject of theory of functions is so preeminently based upon a proper understanding of the infinite that it is not surprising that early writers in analysis, having no clear concept of the infinite, were led to erroneous results. It was Dedekind, who perceiving mathematics as a free creation of the human mind and consequently independent of spatio-temporal relations, set about rendering analysis rigorous. He was immediately followed by George Cantor whose notion of power of sets led to extremely significant results. Indeed, this notion may be placed alongside differentiation in originality and breadth of scope. He created as one of the nineteenth-century mathematicians said “a heaven from which there was no escape”. Dedekind and Cantor were not concerned with the nebulous philosophy which the notion of infinite had previously inspired, and were what we now term Formalists. It is this point of view which will be adopted in the development of the theory of transfinite numbers. Mindful, however, of the fact that no dogmatic attitude exists but that there exists at least a compelling if not convincing counter-dogma, there will be found a short essay on Intuitionism, the counter point of view further on in this work.

This oxidation reduction mechanism involves electron transfers within the molecule and consequently is best explained on the basis of an electronic mechanism. This concept was first advanced by Jones and later expressed by Stieglitz , Robinson and Ingold.” Molecular transformations are relatively rare because simple adjustments that can occur within a single molecule have usually been accomplished in the process of synthesis. However, molecules may, under the influence of some reagent, enter a chemical reaction in which the electron density of the carbon atom containing the reactive group is greatly increased or decreased. To compensate for this electronic displacement electrons or groups migrate to the low electron density carbon atom and reestablish equilibrium. Often these shifts are the result of degradation reactions such as the elimination of water or hydrogen halide. Yet addition reactions to olefins, replacement reactions - as in the transformation of amines to alcohols - as well as reactions involving no change of total molecular formula, can also be accompanied by intramolecular rearrangements.

The name was originally Despenser or le Despenser, but in his case the contracted form of Spencer or le Spenser was often used. The origin of the name goes back to the Latin word dispensator, which is defined as a man who spends, accepts, compensates and impends or weighs out. It means one who administrates money or handles loans and debts for another man, for example the despenser of the public money of the state of Carthage. A despenser was a servant who corresponded to the maitre du palais, but who worked in the king’s palace or in the houses of prominent people. Hence in Aragon he lived in the palace, and was the official who bought supplies for the palace and who spent the money. Joseph held this post in Egypt, and it existed under the Roman emperors and Frankish kings. It also existed under Anglo-Saxon kings like Harold and under the Angevins. The Roman of Jourdain says that the despensers bought the food. The office existed also in Flanders, and there were despensers of the church or priests who bought supplies for a church. In France the despensier or depensier was a maitre du palais. Thus we see that it originated as a trade name. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bayley, C.

In Tamburlaine, a delicate balance is maintained between Love and War in the person or the hero, while the king in Edward II creates the conditions for war through his pre-occupation with an unnatural love affair.

Certes, on lit les romans de Diderot et Voltaire, mais seulement dans la mesure où ils figurent dans le courant philosophique.

L'étude du rôle des membres du clergé dans le roman, érotique révèle l'omniprésence des soucis de l'époque dans l'esprit des écrivains. En créant des romans badins, ils font ressortir non seulement une certaine exubérance de la vie mais aussi les préoccupations courantes de liberté, égalité et fraternité. Quand les religieux deviennent les porte-parole des auteurs, ils détournent le roman érotique de sa position marginale pour le replacer au centré de la pensée du "siècle des lumières".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leduc, J.

The fact that thyroxin is capable of producing kidney enlargement has been known for some time. In 1934, during the course of some experiments to determine the effect of androgenic extracts upon the accessory sex organs of castrate rats, it was incidently noted that the weight of the castrate kidney returned to normal after the injection of these extracts. No systematic study of the effect of steroid hormones on the kidney was made, however, until 1939. At that time testosterone propionate was found to cause marked enlargement of the kidneys in the mouse. Further experimentation revealed that other steroids had some kidney enlarging activity, but of these steroids the testoids proved to be the most active. This action which stimulated the growth of the kidney and was characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the cells of the distal and proximal convoluted tubules was referred to as a “renotropic” action. Subsequent observations established that steroid hormones exert a certain renotropic effect even in hypophysectomized animals. Their activity in the absence of the pituitary shows that the kidney stimulating effect of these hormones is not mediated by the hypophysis but is probably direct. Doses in excess of the amount normally produced in the organism, however, failed to restore the kidney in the hypophysectomized animal to its normal size[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selye, H.

The livers were fixed by perfusion of a mixture of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde, and tissue was obtained for electron microscopic study. Ultrastructural hepatic cell changes were observed in rats after infusion of fructose, consisting of proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, disarray of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, rarefaction of the hyaloplasm and the formation of concentric membranous arrays and occasional cytolysomes. No lesion was seen in rats infused with glucose and galactose and mannitol was found to produce vacuolation of the hepatocytes. These changes are more extensive and severe than those previously described, and are almost identical to the electron microscopic findings observed in hereditary fructose intolerance.

To the former, they are of import, not only because fatty infiltration of the liver is found as a frequent pathological finding associated with various diseases, but also because this change has been shown to result in an impairment of hepatic function (129,380) and, if severe, to terminate in cirrhosis (79,83, 84,110,112). They are of interest to the latter as aids in the elucidation of fat metabolism, and therefore, indirectly, of other phases of metabolism. There is no doubt that the liver plays a highly important role in the assimilation and catabolism of lipid substances. Thus, the study of factors influencing liver fat have yielded particularly useful information as to the reactions involved. It is well known that several of the endocrine glands exercise pronounced, though not yet fully understood, effects upon carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Their influence on fat metabolism has not received such wide recognition. The first purpose of this thesis is to attempt to amass and correlate what is known of the endocrine factors influencing the deposition of hepatic fat. A complete understanding of factors affecting liver fat necessarily involves a knowledge, not only of the effect of these factors on fat metabolism itself, but also of their effect on carbohydrate and protein metabolism. To cover the whole of this field would not be feasible within the limits of a single thesis.

There was an increase in the total exchangeable sodium. The present study was undertaken to study the effects of a lethal dose of Eshcerechia coli endotoxin, on changes in body fluid distribution in the controllable laboratory animal, and to demonstrate any change in the total exchangeable sodium. The multiple isotope dilution technique was employed for measuring the pre and two hour post lethal dose of endotoxin, changes of the red cell, plasma and extracellular volumes. Changes for the total exchangeable sodium were performed as an acute experiment with a lethal dose of endotoxin and with a sublethal dose. There was a significant decrease in the plasma volume and the extracellular fluid volume as measured with radiosodium and inulin. The red cell volume was unchanged. There was no evidence of mobilization of the fixed sodium by endotoxin. Endotoxin induced shock in dogs failed to show any change in the total exchangeable sodium. These results indicate a major difference in the body fluid distribution response of humans and dogs in septic shock.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gutelius, J.

IgA molecules contained fewer lysine and serine and more leucine than IgG molecules. That the dimer and trimer of A.P. are disulfide linked and the tetramer an aggregate was revealed by solvent solute interaction studies with urea and guanidine. The higher the polymeric status of IgA (A.P.) the greater is the susceptibility to depolymerization under mild conditions of disulfide bond reduction. The polymer-predominant IgA proteins contained a higher galactosamine content than the monomer-predominant IgA proteins. The monomer-predominant IgA (R.G.) appeared to be more labile to papain and pepsin cleavage than the polymer-predominant one (A.P.). IgA was more resistant to pepsin than to papain. The higher polymers (tetramer and trimer) of A.P. were more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage than the lower ones (dimer and monomer).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saha, A.

These were grown separately in different mucin to broth concentrations in the following range (Mucin, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, Broth). The studies were carried out on mucin obtained by aspiration of gastric juice from fasting human subjects.

Surface tension in the lung was thereby abolished, and a vertical transpulmonary pressure gradient was created. The elastic properties of the lung were therefore altered and the pressure-volume curve was no longer exponential as it is during ventilation with air. Above functional residual capacity ventilation was distributed preferentially to the alveoli of the upper zones. The pattern of filling was sequential: namely, the proportion of a tidal breath reaching a given alveolus was not constant but varied with preinspiratory volume. It was shown that this altered pattern of ventilation could be explained by the changes in the elastic properties of the liquid-filled lung.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milic-Emili, J.

One micron thick Epon sections of thyroid, liver and kidney were analyzed in the light microscope with occasional reference to the electron microscope for clarification. Criteria included staining, cell separation, distension of cell organelles and vacuoles. The optimum composition of the fixative varied with the brand used. Differing tissue requirements restricted the effective composition to relatively narrow limits. Thyroid, liver, and also parathyroid and duodenum seemed to have similar requirements, while kidney needed more concentrated solutions. The best overall results were achieved with 2.5% Ladd glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M Sorensen's buffer and 0.1% sucrose, 3. 5% Taab glutaraldehyde in 0.045 M modified Sorensen 's buffer and 0.1% sucrose, and with 6% Taab formaldehyde in 0.09 M Sorensen 's buffer and 0.005% calcium chloride.

The pattern of change was similar in mice exposed twice, though the deviations from the control levels were less. Urinary corticosteroids were depressed the first day following each exposure, and more so following the second one, with the values tending to return to normal by the seventh day.

At the same time it has been suggested that the small lymphocyte is capable of transformation into macrophages and fibroblasts. This investigation seeks to follow the behaviour of the lymphocyte in a surgical wound. In vivo labelled thoracic duct lymphocytes are transfused into isologous rats and sections of surgical wounds at varying stages of healing are studied by autoradiography. In over four hundred and eighty-five slides examined, labelled cells were found in the wound on only two occasions, while it was possible to demonstrate labelled lymphocytes both in the circulation at 72 hours and in the alveolar septa at 5 days after infusion. Transfused lymphocytes do not appear to have any significant structural role in the healing of fresh wounds, at least as can be demonstrated by the method employed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, H.

A possible correlation was found with akinesia. Harmaline induced a short-lasting elevation of decarboxylation of DL-DOPA-14COOH in rats, while L-tryptophan-14COOH showed lower decarboxylation; harmalol reduced the decarboxylation with bath amino acids.
