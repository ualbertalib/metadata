No such measurements have ever been reported below 200 mc/s and on the basis of these results it was possible to examine critically several theoretical methods of calculating beam-noise propagation. The magnitude of the beam current-noise varied approximately as the square root of frequency down to about 400 mc/s.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.

To obtain evidence of such loss, the investigator must demonstrate that an individual with schizophrenia has a lower intelligence than he had at a time when the disorder was presumably absent. The task appears straightforward. A survey of the literature on this subject, however, indicates that it is not. The problem of determining whether intellectual loss occurs in schizophrenia presents certain difficulties, which relate, in general, to an insufficient knowledge concerning the nature of the disorder, and, in particular, to the following factors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Douglas, V.

Many such studies have centered on the accuracy of the guesses by one person of the way others responded to personality questionnaires.

Since then many authors have concerned themselves with the nature of the disease while the treatment concerned Duchenne (55) and the rest as early as 1855. At the present time the terms atherosclerosis and occlusive vascular disease of the coronary arteries are synonymously used in the consideration of ischaemic heart disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vineberg, A.

Verhoff suggested that this effect might be due to “unconscious mental comparison” of the second line with the after-image of the first. Gibson (1933) found that Ss who had worn lenses which made verticals appear curved remarked, on removing the glasses, that verticals now appeared curved in the opposite direction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Poser, E.

Practically all the early workers on this group considered macro-morphology only: such characters as size, coloration, wing venation, body proportions, number and relative length of tibial spines, and the length of tegmina, wings, ovipositor and the hind femora.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kevan, D.

There are indeed few subjects in physiology which have been studied and given rise to more controversies. Part of the confusion which arose was probably due to different nomenclature of authors and compounds studied; part of it was undoubtedly due to the multiplicity of actions and variability of effects under different experimental conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Skoryna, S.
