Less research has characterized behavioural phenotypes resulting from birth hypoxia. Experiment 1 examined maternal behaviour (licking/grooming, retrieval) directed toward pups born vaginally (Vag), by caesarean section (CS) or by caesarean section with anoxia (CS+anox). Similar levels of maternal care were observed across all birth groups indicating that the sequelae of birth hypoxia in the rat are not mediated by differential postnatal maternal care. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of birth hypoxia on prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI), behaviours with clinical correlates in neurodevelopmental disorders. No differences were found in PPI or LI between Vag, CS or CS+anox groups at adulthood. Intriguingly, however, decreased freezing to the context was observed in CS and CS+anox rats suggesting that caesarean section birth may produce deficits in contextual learning.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35td391.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692tb52f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42nd162"><dcterms:title>Characterization of pulsed light treatment on the shelf-life and safety of vacuum packaged cold smoked salmon</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pollock, Allison Maureen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Listeria monocytogenes is a common post-processing contaminant in ready-to-eat vacuum packaged (VP) cold smoked salmon. Since this psychrotrophic pathogen can grow at refrigerated temperatures (~4°C), other safety barriers in addition to temperature are needed to ensure the continued safety of VP cold smoked salmon. One such novel barrier could be the pulsed light (PL) treatment of the product prior to packaging or treating the product through a transparent package. Pulsed light destruction kinetics of L. monocytogenes were evaluated while dispensed into a liquid media, on the surface of a general purpose agar and on the surface of cold smoked salmon. Results showed that PL technology was an effective surface sanitation method (a decimal reduction time or D-value of 0.91, 1.37 and 2.25 s exposure of PL at 800, 700 and 600 V, respectively, and a resulting z value of 500 V) on the agar plate. However, it had only a limited success when applied to liquid samples as well as directly on the surface of cold smoked salmon (D-value ranged from 93 s to 24 min). Sensory quality of VP cold smoked salmon subjected to selected PL treatments was monitored during storage for 14 days at 4°C. Both color and odor scores remained within acceptable limits over the 14 day storage period. Subsequent challenge studies were carried out with L. monocytogenes applied on VP cold smoked salmon. An overall reduction in counts was observed in samples stored at 4°C over 28 days; however, after PL treatment (day 0), there was no significant reduction in counts. Color and odor scores maintained acceptable values over 14 days. Additional experiments were carried out to determine the effects of (1) 1.5% salt, (2) 6% oil, (3) a representative salmon media and (4) background microflora (lactic acid bacteria) on the PL inactivation of L. monocytogenes. All of these factors significantly affected the destruction of L. monocytogenes by increasing the D-value (adding resistance to pulsed light destruction). Overall, these studies have shown that PL treatment in combination with low temperature storage (4°C) has the potential to extend the shelf-life of VP cold smoked salmon products without compromising sensory quality. However further investigation into higher treatment voltages is necessary in order to achieve a higher target kill of L. monocytogenes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602508c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nd162</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fishery products -- Spoilage.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radiation preservation of food.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protective atmospheres.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Salmon.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Smoked fish.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sp632"><dcterms:title>The importance of adult movement and aggregation for Mytilus spp. population dynamics in the St. Lawrence Estuary /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Petrović, Filip.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mussel colonization is assumed to result from factors affecting recruitment and post-recruitment survival. Despite evidence of passive migration and habitat engineering by adult mussels, the contribution to population dynamics of these processes remains unknown. This research attempts to elucidate the relative importance and scale of (1) adult movement vs. recruitment and (2) of local habitat engineering vs. habitat heterogeneity, for colonization by the blue mussel, Mytilus spp., in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec. Transplants of marked mussels were used to test these ideas. Our results support the hypothesis that colonization mostly occurs through disturbance-mediated adult movement. The scale of this displacement was quantified. Colonization was accelerated by topographic heterogeneity and engineered habitat propagation. These results counter the notion that mussel population dynamics are solely regulated by recruitment and growth, and suggest that distribution patterns are also upheld by adult aggregation and movement from the local scale to landscape level.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68km362.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sp632</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mytilus edulis -- Saint Lawrence, Gulf of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shellfish populations -- Saint Lawrence, Gulf of.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526h41f"><dcterms:title>The ecological and evolutionary assembly of competitive communities in dynamic landscapes /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pillay, Pradeep.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We use metapopulation models based on a classic competition-colonization trade-off in order to (1) study community responses to spatially structured habitat loss on dynamic landscapes when species are assembled by ecological (biogeographic) processes; and (2) to study how species are assembled into communities by evolutionary mechanisms. In the first part of our study we show how the response of species richness to habitat destruction in dynamic landscapes can be driven by the existence of either the spatial structure of habitat dynamics or by life-history trade-offs among species. In the second part of our study we confirm that competitive trade-off models predict runaway evolution towards stochastic extinction, making it impossible for stable multispecies assemblages to evolve. We demonstrate that by relaxing the strict deterministic nature of competitive exclusion in such models species can avoid selection towards extinction, allowing for the possibility of species co-evolution resulting in stable multispecies assemblages.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000429s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526h41f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Competition (Biology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Population biology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Habitat (Ecology) -- Modification.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dh66h"><dcterms:title>Photographic transformations and greyscale pictures</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Phillips, Carlos.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have introduced a geometry which is invariant to certain forms of burning and dodging photographic prints.

The surgical population is unique, as it comprises people diverse in age and functioning. The data for this study were obtained from a randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a presurgical period of physical conditioning on surgical recovery following scheduled colonic resection, termed rehabilitation. Patients were randomized into two groups, Exercise and Control. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted at entry into the study, at one-day pre-surgery, and at one- and two-months post-surgery. A sample of 62 subjects participated in this study. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Functioning Scale (PF) and Physical Component Summary Score (PCS), VO2max and 6MWT were low to moderately correlated with the CHAMPS questionnaire at the same time points. For the Exercise group, energy expenditure as estimated using the CHAMPS questionnaire, increased significantly from 2653 to 3957 kcal.wk-1 (p&lt;0.05). Physical activity levels dropped significantly (p&lt;0.001) from pre-surgery (4103 kcal.wk-1) to one month post-surgery (1547 kcal.wk-1); and they were still lower (2396 kcal.wk-1) at two months post-surgery (p&lt;0.01). Older age (&gt;65), cancer diagnosis and female gender were associated with higher drop in physical activity levels at one-month post surgery. Evidence has been provided towards construct known groups, longitudinal (sensitivity to change and responsiveness) and convergent validity of physical activity questionnaire (CHAMPS) as an indicator of the process of surgical recovery. The information obtained from the questionnaire will allow health professionals to better plan care and develop programs to best manage the patients.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rq551.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72pc44m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r9565"><dcterms:title>Perioperative protein sparing in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients : an integrated analysis of perioperative protein and glucose metabolism using stable isotope kinetics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kopp Lugli, Andrea.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The potential effects of nutritional support with amino acids or dextrose and epidural blockade on the catabolic response to surgery were investigated in diabetic patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

The first intervention of a postoperative infusion of amino acids avoided pronounced hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients after colorectal surgery and achieved a positive protein balance compared to dextrose. 2.

It was revealed that SCs contain medium (mIK(Ca)) and slow (sIAHP) Ca2+-dependent K+ currents. Furthermore, it was determined that mIK(Ca) is not mediated by apamin-sensitive SK channels in SCs, whereas it was found to be is apamin-sensitive in MEC layer II non-SCs. In addition, the results indicated that mIK(Ca) and sIAHP may underlie SFA in SCs and that mIK(Ca), sIAHP and SFA are subject to inhibitory modulation by PKA-activation. Therefore, PKA modulation may be important for SCs to exhibit post-burst after-discharges.

However, the centralized server architecture of most modern day MMOGs is unable to cope with this increase in the number of participating players. Hence, there is a need for a scalable network architecture which can support these large number of players without affecting the overall gaming experience for each player. In this thesis we propose a scalable distributed server architecture which divides the virtual game space in smaller sub spaces and assigns them across a cluster of server nodes thereby reducing the overall load per server. It is based on a distributed publish/subscribe architecture which takes care of client-server as well as server-server communication. We discuss the implementation of this architecture in a real MMOG and experimentally prove that it shows better scalability than the centralized server architecture.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53x122q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d570174h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x805d"><dcterms:title>Development of an avidin and C-reactive protein electrochemical immunosensor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hennessey, Hooman.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has recently been shown that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with a blunted systemic endothelial vasodilator function, indicative of a systemic inflammatory response. It has also been recognized that inflammation may contribute to all stages of the atherosclerotic process. Several prospective studies have shown that the level of CRP is a strong predictor of future myocardial dysfunction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and vascular death among individuals without known cardiovascular disease. CRP is also found in association with the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease. Hence, determination of the blood serum levels of CRP is of a great clinical importance. This thesis discusses the results on the development of two electrochemical immunosensors: (i) the avidin (model) immunosensor, and (ii) the CRP immunosensor. The suitability of using a range of electrochemical techniques in probing antibody-antigen interactions was also investigated. It was shown that a gold working electrode surface could be successfully modified by covalent binding of NHS-biotin to a self-assembled-monolayer of cystamine dihydrochloride, resulting in the construction of the avidin immunosensor. Avidin could then bind to this immunosensor (biotinated electrode) and detected using the electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and chronoamperometry (CA). It was also shown that polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize avidin bound to the immunosensor. The results demonstrated that all experimental techniques used were suitable in characterizing with high sensitivity the avidin-biotin interaction, and the amount of avidin in solution. The avidin calibration curves showed high linearity in concentrations ranging from 10-10 to 5 x 10-7 M. AFM imaging confirmed that avidin forms clusters upon binding to the immunosensor, with the cluster size ranging between 28 and 33 nm. The avidin-biotin binding constant was determined to be 3.09 x 1012 M-1 . It was also determined that the avidin-biotin equilibrium is reached in ca. 20 minutes. The CRP immunosensor was then designed on the basis of the avidin immunosensor architecture. Using a range of electrochemical techniques and PM-IRRAS, it was demonstrated that a gold electrode surface could be functionalized by CRP antibodies, covalently attached to the surface through a duplex cystamine/glutaraldehyde layer. This architecture represents the CRP immunosensor. It was then shown that CRP antigen specifically binds to the CRP immunosensor (i.e. the immobilized CRP antibody). This interaction could be characterized with high sensitivity using the electrochemical techniques of CV, EIS, DPV and CA. The CRP concentration range investigated was 10-14 to 10-8 M. A linear calibration plot was obtained. The CRP antibody-antigen binding constant was determined to be 3+/-1 x 108 M-1. The corresponding binding equilibrium is reached in ca. 10 minutes. The results show that the developed CRP immunosensor is a good candidate for further research towards developing a commercial CRP immunosensor.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397d52g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x805d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Avidin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biosensors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>C-reactive protein.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301565d"><dcterms:title>The role of Site-1 protease in cartilage development /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ho, Yuen Yee, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During development cartilage originates as condensations of primordial mesenchymal cells which go through a strict program whereby these cells differentiate into chondrocytes, undergo hypertrophy, and are subsequently replaced by osteoblasts. A zebrafish mutant termed gonzo has been isolated which displays a phenotype similar to human chondrodysplasias. Recently it was shown that this phenotype is due to a mutation in the zebrafish equivalent of a mammalian serine protease termed SKI-1 or Site-1 protease (S-1P). This enzyme is a member of the prohormone convertase family of subtilisin-like proteases which are known to play a critical role in controlling the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins and in the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The goal of this research project is to explore the expression and the function of S-1P in chondrocyte differentiation in vitro. In this study, the chondrogenic mouse cell line ATDC5 which recapitulates the steps of cartilage development when cultured in the presence of insulin was used. Result showed that 10 mug/mL of insulin is the optimum concentration to be used to induce chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells. This was shown by Alcian Blue staining and glycosaminoglycan quantification, where cells induced by 10 mug/mL of insulin produced highest amount of glycosaminoglycan. Using RT-PCR, it was shown that S-1P is constitutively expressed in ATDC5 cells both induced and non-induced with insulin. S-1P was also shown to be expressed in ATDC5 cells induced by ascorbic acid and a combination of ascorbic acid and insulin. Using Real Time-PCR, the expression levels of S-1P in the presence of insulin, ascorbic acid and the combination of both differentiation inducers was determined. The expression levels of type I collagen (early-phase chondrocyte differentiation expressing gene), type II collagen and aggrecan (mature chondrocyte matrix genes) and type X collagen (hypertrophic chondrocyte matrix gene) were also analyzed. The effect of the inhibition of S-1P on the expression levels of cartilage related components was studied by inhibiting S-1P using an R134E prosegment mutant (pro-SKI-1), which has been shown a potent cellular inhibitor of S-1P. The DNA of the pro SKI-1 variant was subcloned into pIRES-EGFP (provided by Dr. Nabil Seidah) and transfected into ATDC 5 cells. Stably transfected cells were selected and the expression of S-1P and other cartilage components were quantitatively evaluated by studying the transfected cells using Real Time-PCR. Functional inhibition of S-1P was confirmed using an artificial substrate reporter construct adapted for specific cleavage by this protease. Overall the results showed that inhibition of S-1P activity had drastic effects in chondrogenesis---the expression of cartilage components (Aggrecan, Collagen I, Collagen II and Collagen X) were significantly lowered. Inhibition of S-1P seemed to prevent the chondrogenesis process in ATDC 5 cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848v58f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301565d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569842v"><dcterms:title>Mapping vegetation phenology in the Sahel and Soudan, Africa, 1982 to 2005</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Heumann, Benjamin W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Sahel and Soudan regions of Africa are hot-spots for vegetation change due to climatic and anthropogenic causes.

This thesis examines how vegetation phenology has changed from 1982--2005 in the Sahel and Soudan regions and how phenology relates to observed bio-productivity and regional precipitation patterns. This is the first research to assess multi-decadal phenology change for a tropical ecosystem. Results show that while bio-productivity has significantly increased in the Sahel, significant phenology change has primarily been detected in the Soudan region. Furthermore, the relationship between phenology and bio-productivity and precipitation differs between the Sahel and Soudan.

The nine human isoforms identified to date share the same topology of twelve membrane-spanning domains and a cytoplasmic regulatory tail, and diverge in their tissue expressions and subcellular localizations. This thesis focused on the identification and characterization of proteins interacting with the ubiquitous NHE6 isoform, which resides predominantly in recycling endosomes. Recent yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of a human brain cDNA library using the regulatory tail of NHE6 as a probe resulted in the tentative identification of about 250 partial or full-length NHE6-interacting proteins. Thirty other potential NHE6-interacting partners were identified by isolating NHE6 complexes from embryonic kidney 293 cells by tandem affinity purification (TAP) and subjecting them to mass spectrometry analysis. The interaction between NHE6 and eight of these proteins (four from each Y2H and TAP analyses) was tested by co-immunoprecipitation, co-localization by immunofluorescence microscopy and in vitro GST-fusion protein pull-down assays. We show that apolipoprotein D interacts weakly with NHE6, while myosin light chain kinase and the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit-alpha are true NHE6-binding partners. The remaining five proteins exhibited poor and/or non-reproducible association with NHE6.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nd17b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945w196</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n2759"><dcterms:title>Making sense of illness in the absence of diagnosis : patients' and physicians' narratives of medically unexplained symptoms</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dominicé Dao, Melissa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this study was to improve medical understanding of patients' illness experience and everyday thinking about physical distress, by focusing on patients' and physicians' narratives of medically unexplained symptoms. Semi-structured interviews were held with 16 Canadian and immigrant patients from two primary care clinics in Montreal, and separately with their physician. Detailed content analysis reveals that, despite the absence of diagnosis, both patient and physicians hold complex and dynamic models of illness. Physicians' explanations rely almost exclusively on biomedical constructs, whereas patients' models of illness draw from a much wider range of sources of experience and authority. Despite regular follow-up, physicians have very limited access to the intricate networks of meaning revealed in their patients' interviews. In fact, although there is some common ground of understanding, patients and physicians show low congruence of their models, and much discrepancy in the expected outcome and management. Eliciting patients' illness narratives rather than focusing on narrow biomedical issues offers promising possibilities for physicians to negotiate meaning with their patients. The richness of patients' models provides potential avenues leading out of the clinical impasse of medically unexplained symptoms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f69g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n2759</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hp62c"><dcterms:title>Predicting factors of contralateral hip fractures among patients above 55 years of age</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Orthopaedic Research Laboratory</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Delisle, Josée.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. The incidence of osteoporotic fractures increases by 1-3% per year of age. Nine to twelve percent of patients that have suffered a primary hip fracture will have a fracture of the contralateral hip within 5 years. Our objective is to identify predictive factors of contralateral hip fractures among men and women over 55 years of age. Methods. A case control study with matched pairs was conducted, through a retrospective chart review of patients admitted for hip fractures at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and the Montreal General Hospital (MGH) between 1992 and 2004. Results. Contralateral hip fractures were most strongly associated with the use of mobility aid (OR= 5.69, CI 95% (3.20-10.14)). No other risk factors could be identified as predictors, probably due to missing data. Conclusion. This study confirms the use of mobility aid as a predictor of contralateral hip fractures. Future prospective risk studies may further optimize the diagnostic accuracy for predicting contralateral hip fractures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xh27b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp62c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73q124r"><dcterms:title>Langmuir films and nanoparticle applications of a spider silk protein analog</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Davidson, Patricia Marie L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A synthetic analog of a spider silk protein (M4) was studied.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans clk-1 mutants display slow and deregulated physiological rates, including slow embryonic and post-embryonic development, retarded germline development, slow behaviours, and an increased lifespan. clk-1 slow germline development phenotype was previously linked to clk-1 altered ROS metabolism and its effect on lipid oxidization and the let-60/ras pathway. I have taken a genetic suppressor approach to further investigate the causes of the slow germline development phenotype of the clk-1 mutants. Through this approach one mutant that suppresses the germline phenotype of clk-1 was identified. This suppressor, gsc-1(qm216), restored clk-1 germline development to slightly faster rates than wild type worms. This effect was specific to clk-1 and gsc-1 did not speed germline development rates in wild type worms. Furthermore, this effect appeared to be additive to lowering cholesterol levels but not to increasing cytoplasmic ROS levels. gsc-1 by itself appeared to have a deleterious effect on brood size and to increase lifespan. Neither of these effects were additive to the clk-1 phenotype and were therefore believed to affect similar mechanisms. The genetic mapping of gsc-1 precisely located the mutation to the center of chromosome II and linked it tightly to the lin-5 mutation. However, none of the transgenic lines managed to complement the gsc-1 mutation and its identity was not discovered. In addition, to determine the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Clk phenotype, I have been analyzing all clk mutants (clk-1 to -10), by increasing ROS levels through the disruption of sod-1 and sod-2 genes, and scoring Clk phenotypes. I found that, although several clk mutants appear to have altered ROS levels, the phenomenon does not apply to all clk worms and does not correlate with lifespan. The disruption of either sod-1 or -2 affects growth and embryonic viability: sod-2 tends to exacerbate the mutant phenotypes, while sod-1 shows both weakly enhancing or weakly suppressing effects. Interestingly, only one mutant, clk-4, and only one phenotype of this mutant, slow post-embryonic development, is suppressed by sod-2 (but not sod-1). Furthermore, disrupting the expression of the sod-1 gene has only moderate or no effect on the lifespan of wild type worms, while sod-2 was shown to extend lifespan. On the whole, our results suggest that low superoxide levels do not participate in extending lifespan and are not the common process inducing the Clk phenotype in these mutants. Yet, several of the mutants analyzed have a dramatically increased lifespan and specifically behave like mutants which affect mitochondrial electron transport such as isp-1. Thus, our findings suggest that electron transport has a crucial role in longevity and developmental rates that is independent of superoxide generation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk85n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rn45m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Longevity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ubiquinones.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d410s"><dcterms:title>The role of substrate characteristics in Populus tremuloides (MICHX.) seed germination in post-disturbance black spruce-feathermoss forest in northwestern Quebec /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Causse, Vincent.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides (Michx.)) has become established along a mining road in the lower northern Quebec region (49°39' to 49°45'N and 79°01' to 79°02' W) in areas that have not supported aspen in the past. The primary means of regeneration of aspen is through vegetative root suckers, but it is doubtful that it could progress through this region at such a fast rate solely by asexual reproduction. Aspen are known to produce large amounts of seeds that could account for aspen's rapid progression, but sexual reproduction of aspen is rare; very little is known about Populus tremuloides seed germination and seed survival in natural conditions. The aim of this study was to determine seedbed conditions that facilitate the emergence and survival of Populus tremuloides seedlings, and to identify the key factors involved in these processes. Observations of established saplings and a sowing experiment were conducted on both post harvest and post fire sites. Our data on established saplings showed that there were seed-origin trembling aspen located in both post-harvest and burned areas indicating that Populus tremuloides can and has established from seed in areas where aspen was previously absent. Both our sowing experiment and our greenhouse experiment showed that the emergence of seedlings was relatively low, but that Polytrichum strictum moss and exposed mineral soil depressions were the best seedbeds for seed germination. Extreme temperatures and availability of moisture appeared to be controlling factors on seed germination, but ultimately the physical and biological characteristics of each substrate influenced the substrate's response to these factors in a different way. We conclude that sexual reproduction of trembling aspen may and has occurred in this region, and is promoted by the presence of exposed mineral soil and Polytrichum strictum moss.

In particular, the hydroxylation of non-activated C-H bonds remains a significant challenge that few chemical catalysts have succeeded to overcome. The P450 enzymes, a family of heme-containing monooxygenases including more than 5000 known isoforms, are gaining considerable attention due to their ability to catalyze the very difficult regio- and stereo-selective oxidation of inactivated C-H bonds. The use of such enzyme is however limited by their functional complexity, low activity, need for cofactors, and poor stability. In this thesis, we elected to study the human P450 CYP3A4, because of its high substrate promiscuity. The first part of the project involved the replacement of the required cofactors (NADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase) by some cheap hydrogen peroxide donors or organic peroxides. Several surrogates, such as sodium percarbonate and cumene hydroperoxide, were found to be efficient at replacing the natural cofactor, without a significant loss of stability and activity. The second part of this thesis deals with optimization of the lyophilization conditions. Among the numerous additives tested, some sugars led to significant lyoprotection during the freeze-drying process. Finally, in the third part, the effect of the presence of organic solvents and ionic liquids on CYP3A4 activity was evaluated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2677085x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644w89b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abc386p79v"><dcterms:title>Antioxidant activities of hydrolysates and peptides generated from high hydrostatic pressure-treated soy protein isolates</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chang, Chia-Chien (Carole), 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Native and pressure-treated (600 MPa) soy protein isolates (SPI) were subjected to in vitro digestion to study the effect of pressure processing on the digestibility of SPI and the antioxidant activity of the hydrolysates and isolated low molecular weight (&lt;1 kDa) peptides.

This thesis describes a cross-sectional study examining serum concentrations of free radical generated oxysterols as markers of oxidative stress in a cohort of teenage daughters from pregnancies with and without GDM. Daughters of GDM-pregnancies had a tendency of higher levels of serum oxysterols (7beta-hydroxycholesterol); however, this difference was not statistically significant after adjustment for total cholesterol. Serum oxysterols were significantly correlated with obesity measures such as waist circumference and BMI, which likely accounted for the tendency for higher measures of oxysterol concentrations in the GDM daughters.

In the first experiment, six different diet treatments were used for six weeks, with 24 hens per treatment (three birds per cage, eight cage replicates). Control diet was a corn-soybean meal diet, and diets containing 0, 2, 4, 8 or 12% ground flaxseed in which all the corn was replaced by pearl millet. In the second experiment, the diet treatments consisted of pearl millet and three inclusion levels of ground flaxseed (4%, 6% and 8%) and two levels (0.1% and 0.2%) of natural pigment in a factorial arrangement. The experiment lasted for twelve weeks, with 18 hens per treatment (three birds per cage, six cage replicates). In each of the experiments, all the diets were formulated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous and to meet or exceed NRC requirements. Body weight of the birds and feed consumption were recorded at weekly (first experiment) and biweekly (second experiment) intervals. Number of eggs and egg mass produced were measured and recorded on a daily basis. At the end of each of the experiments, all the hens were euthanized to determine liver integrity. In both of the experiments, flock performance parameters were not different among treatments. In regard to egg traits, in the second experiment after 8 week of the start of the experiment, birds fed with diets containing 8% flaxseed produced significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) smaller eggs compared to hens fed 4% flaxseed. Yolk pigmentation was lower (P &lt; 0.05) for the eggs produced by hens fed diets containing pearl millet compared with those produced by feeding corn-based diet. However, 0.1% or 0.2% inclusion of the pigment both proved to be suitable to restore yolk pigmentation to marketable levels. No difference was observed among diets in regard to liver haemorrhage. Evaluation of FA profiles indicated that birds fed a diet containing PM as the sole grain source, and low levels of flaxseed (6%) can produce eggs with more than 350 mg/egg of n-3 FA, which is the lower standard to market eggs as "n-3 FA enriched".

How FGFR3 signaling controls Ihh transcription is unknown. We used specific small molecule inhibitors of some of the signal transduction pathways known to act downstream of FGF receptors to test the involvement of these pathways in the observed transcriptional downregulation. We used chondrogenic ATDCS cells as an in vitro model of growth plate chondrocyte to address this question. Stimulation of FGF signaling by addition of rhFGF9 to the cultures resulted in a significant downregulation of Ihh expression as determined by real-time RT-PCR. Inhibition of phosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2 and p38 prevented downregulation of Ihh expression. Inhibition of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) phosphorylation further decreased Ihh expression. Inhibition of Phospholipase-Cgamma (PLCgamma) phosphorylation did not significantly affect Ihh transcription. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to loss of Ihh activity in human chondrodysplasia may help in the development of novel therapeutic approaches.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526h42q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f7861</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580r84m"><dcterms:title>Male age effects, cytoplasmic incompatibility and the localization of Wolbachia in Chelymorpha alternans Boh (Chrysomelidae, Cassidinae)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bailey-Jourdain, Catherine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Wolbachia are bacteria that infect and induce reproductive alterations in a large number of arthropods.
