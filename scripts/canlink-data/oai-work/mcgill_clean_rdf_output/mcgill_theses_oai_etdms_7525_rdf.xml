The immediate object of these experiments was to determine the electomot1ve force induced in magnetic conductors and insulators when rotated in a magnetic field. Two main theories of the results to be expected are possible, according as one supposes the part of the magnetic field due to the substance itself to be carried round with the substance or to remain at rest. It is evident that the settlement of the claims of these two theories should afford a possible solution or the ever-recurr1ng problem as to whether the lines of force or a rotating symmetrica1 magnet are stationary or rotate with the magnet. All previous attempts to settle this question have proved fruitless as the calculated effect is the same on either view.
