C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During the steps employed in the conversion of the standing tree to wood pulp about two-thirds of the original plant material is discarded, and of the many hundreds of compounds present in the tree only cellulose is utilized to an important extent. Because of the immense volume of timber cut even minor tree constituents are potentially available in large quantities. Thus the volatile oil content of the waste coniferous foliage cut annually in Canada is in excess of ten million pounds. No detailed knowledge of the composition of these oils has hitherto been available.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.

J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although lithium occurs more commonly in the earth's crust than lead or tin, it is one of the least known of the lesser used metals. Demand for it prior to World War l was almost nil, but with the great technological advances that always accompany warfare it fast became important in numerous applications. Lithium was first discovered (1) by Arfvedsen in Sweden in 1817 while analyzing a sample of petalite – a lithium aluminum silicate. It was named after the Greek "litheos", meaning "stony", because it was thought to occur only in minerals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacEwan, J.

This field is generally considered in relationship with the notion of a conflict. Any armed conflict, be it a regular or civil war, a revolution, an armed intervention of security forces, or a simple boundary incident, is primarily a geographic problem. Geography applied in armed conflicts has developed into a special science, military geography.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, F.

More serious, however, is the shifting and almost astronomical space which separates Eliot and his associates from the usual study of political theory in the universities.
