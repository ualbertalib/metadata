The cardinal feature of this reaction is the formation of tumorous mass of proliferating donor mononuclear cells that invade and destroy the host renal cortex. This xenogeneic graft-versus-host reaction (XGVHR) is specifically inhibited by antilymphocyte sera (ALS) raised against the donor lymphoid cells. The degree of inhibition of ALS is proportional to the number of donor lymphocytes injected as well as the amount of antilymphocyte serum given to each recipient. In addition, it was found that the capacity of antilymphocyte sera to inhibit this XGVHR correlated with their ability to inhibit the rejection of skin allografts. In other words, the capacity of ALS to inhibit this XGVHR does correlate with their immunosuppressive potency. Xenogeneic graft-versus-host reactions produced by human lymphocytes in rats are used as a basis for assaying the immunosuppressive potency of anti-human lymphocyte sera prior to their clinical use.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacLean, L.

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and consequently blocks one carbon fragment metabolism. In Ehrlich ascites cells methotrexate depresses the rate of formate-14C labelling of purine nucleotides, RNA and serine. Deoxyuridine and deoxycytidine, both of which can give rise to thymidylate and therefore lead to dihydrofolate formation, cause an increased inhibition of formate-14C metabolism by methotrexate. Addition of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which is phosphorylated to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase, or addition of thymidine, reverse the inhibitory action of deoxyuridine plus methotrexate on one carbon fragment metabolism. Additional evidence suggests that the thymidylate synthetase reaction can regulate the intracellular level of dihydrofolate and hence regulate the effects of methotrexate on the one carbon fragment metabolism of ascites tumor cells in vitro.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scholefield, P.

The effect of prior administration of two classes of 7S mouse anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) immunoglobulins on the primary immune response to SRBC was studied. Mouse gammaGl and gammaG2 immunoglobulins were isolated from serum by a combination of Pevikon-Geon zone electrophoresis followed by density gradient isoelectric focusing. The immunoglobulins were defined by qualitative and quantitative studies, and their effects on the primary response were determined by administering doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 0.001 mg of immunoglobulin two hours before injection of antigen. Specific gammaGI (gammaF) anti-SRBC antibody suppressed the primary response to SRBC at all concentrations. Specific gammaG2 (gammaG) anti-SRBC antibody suppressed at high concentrations, but with less efficiency than gammaGl antibody, and enhanced the response to SRSC at low concentrations. The suppressing and enhancing effects of the passively administered immunoglobulins were shown to be specific. The effect of mixtures of gammaGl and gammaG2 antibodies was intermediate between values obtained when each was given alone. The results suggest that the suppressive effect of anti-SRBC antibody is associated predominantly, if not entirely, with gammaGl antibody, and the enhancing activity is associated with gammaG2 antibody. The significance of these findings relative to the postulated mechanisms of action of antibody mediated suppression of the immune response is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vas, S.

RNA and DNA synthesis was affected shortly after as shown by incorporation of 3H-uridine and 3H-thymidine, respectively. Incorporation of glycerol-2-3H into membrane lipid ceased after 25 minutes probably due to formation of lesions as indicated by decrease in optical density. Respiratory function (measured by manometric techniques) and protein synthesis (measured by incorporation of 14C-leucine) were subsequently affected. The bactericidal effect was influenced by the medium used. A complex nutrient medium decreased susceptibility as compared to a simple medium.

The latter protein(s) did not affect the release of labelled lipid as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). It was found that heparin did not precipitate ail of the labelled phospholipids from the d&lt;1.006 fraction of the incubation medium. Using electrophoretic and immunological techniques it was shown that heparin dissociated the VLDL into heparin precipitable and heparin soluble lipoprotein components containing the beta- and alpha-lipoproteins respectively. The latter is known to carry most of the circulating phospholipids. The dissolved and dialyzed heparin precipitate of human VLDL recombined with the heparin supernatant to form a lipoprotein having the density, electrophoretic and immunological properties of native VLDL. The synthesis and release of the labelled lipid and protein moieties of VLDL by rat liver perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution were studied using the heparin precipitation technique. The results c1early indicated that the VLDL polypeptide complex is assembled and released from the liver cell intact, and that the beta- and alpha-lipoproteins containing components of VLDL show a completely different metabolic pattern from each other and from those of the low and high density lipoproteins respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rubinstein, D.

The heterogeneity and diversity of the allergen-reagin system was demonstrated with respect to (i) the antigenic and allergenic composition of ragweed pollen extracts, (ii) the specificities of reagins, and (iii) the skin-fixation property of reagins. A relationship of the reactivity of allergens with reagins was established on the basis of their electrical charges.

Sequential histological study revealed progressive lifting of the mucosal epithelium, and the pace of the damage was found to be flow-dependent. Correlation with the results of metabolic study indicated that such epithelial lifting might constitute a transport barrier at the epithelial-capillary interface.

Temporal relations between the noise and syllable ranging between 600 msec before to 150 msec within the syllable, and six different noise spectra, comprising one wide-band and five octave-bands, were used. Two noise sound pressure levels, 88 dB and 96 dB, and six syllable levels, comprising seven S/N ratios between -22 dB and -50 dB were investigated. Listening tests were conducted on two groups of ten subjects with normal hearing. Results demonstrated masking from noise-bursts 150 msec before to 150 msec after the beginning of the syllable. Consistent relations were found between the noise spectra and both masking and substitution errors for different consonants. Differences as a function of talkers and vowels were also observed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Doehring, D.

Semi-thin Epon sections were stained with PA-Schiff-iron-hematoxylin and radioautographed. The existence of three cell lines was established: vacuolated columnar, mucous and enterochromaffin. In the vacuolated-columnar cell line, only vacuolated cells divide. A vacuolated cell at the cryptal base and its progeny would go through three mitotic cycles in the lower two-thirds of the crypt before becoming columnar cells. In the mucous cell line, cells originate from vacuolated cells in the lower one-third of the crypt and undergo one or two mitotic cycles before ceasing to divide. Enterochromaffin cells do not divide, but renew by differentiation of vacuolated cells. The proliferative rate of epithelial cells undergoes diurnal variation, which affects mucous cells more seriously than vacuolated cells. All epithelial cells migrate upward along the cryptal wall, and eventually are lost from the surface.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.

Vitamin K analogues having vitamin K-like or antagonist activity in intact animals, showed the same activity in vitro. In slices from vitamin K-deficient rats, low concentrations of warfarin (&lt; 10^-4M) completely inhibited the response to low concentrations of vitamin K1 (&lt; 10^-6M) without inhibiting total protein synthesis. Concentrations of warfarin which were found to inhibit total protein synthesis (&gt;10^-4M), were required in order to inhibit the response to larger concentrations of vitamin KI (&gt;10^-5M) in slices from vitamin K-deficient or from warfarin-pretreated rats. The inhibition by warfarin of both factor VII release and protein synthesis is considered to be non-specific. These studies also support the hypothesis that vitamin K acts via two mechanisms only one (transport) of which is susceptible to inhibition by coumarin anticoagulants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lowenthal, J.

These changes were reversible, they were observed after fixation with osmium or acrolein solutions of varied osmotic strength, and they were unaffected by ouabain. Caffeine opposed both the reticular and fibre volume changes. The calculated volume of the reticulum was linearly related with a negative slope to the reciprocal of the osmotic pressure, closely approximating the volume behavior of an intra-fibre sucrose compartment postulated on the basis of earlier studies on the osmotic properties of frog muscle. It was proposed on the basis of these findings that the sarcoplasmic reticulum forms an extracellular compartment, and that passive water movements are responsible for its volume changes. The relevance of these findings to the nature of excitation-contraction coupling was discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Birks, R.

On the basis of l4C02 production from glucose-1-14C as well as l4C incorporation from glucose-l-, -2-, and -6-14C into nucleotide ribose it was concluded that net pentose phosphate production from glucose proceeds by the simultaneous operation of the oxidative and non-oxidative pathways. The latter pathway also contributes extensively to l4C incorporation from glucose-l4c into pentose phosphate as a result of ex change reactions. Time course studies of adenine-8- l4C incorporation into nucleotides in the presence of glucose, different concentrations of R5P and/or PRPP, as well as preincubation studies with glucose suggest that R5P or a metabolite thereof initially inhibits nucleotide synthesis for 5-10 minutes, but as the concentration of PRPP in the medium is increased, this inhibition is reversed. The ratio of 14C incorporation from glucose-l-, and -6-l4C into nucleotide ribose by the sonicate in the presence of 1 mM glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is similar to the ratio cited for the intact cell. It is suggested that the G3p concentration in the intact cell in part regulates the relative labelling pattern of nucleotide ribose from glucose-14C.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scholefield, P.

Both catalase in free solution and microencapsulated catalase were efficient in replacing the deficient enzyme in a single trial injection. However, repeated injection of the catalase solution resulted in the production of antibodies to the foreign prote in (enzyme). These immunized acatalasemic mice suffered hypersensitivity reactions when challenged with the foreign enzyme. On the other hand, repeated injection of catalase-loaded microcapsules did not induce antibody formation in the mice and did not produce any hypersensitivity reactions.

The electron microscopic findings were subjected to quantitative morphometric analysis. To obtain further quantitative data, biochemical estimations of hepatic glycogen, glucose-6-phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and blood glucose were made. Inhibition of glycogen breakdown was associated with inhibition of the normal increase in vesicular elements of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a failure bf the normal rise in glucose-6-phosphatase and an inhibition of lysosome formation. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum played no role in glycogen breakdown in these cells. The glycogen content of the autophagic vacuoles correlated positively with the glycogen of the hyaloplasm. The hypothesis is formulated that those factors which regulate hyaloplasmic glycogen breakdown similarly influence lysosomal glycogen breakdown.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Phillips, M.

This proposal was confirmed by a study of FDNB inactivation of the transport and by studies on the specificity of a cryptic mutant. Expression of permease levels in this organism is coupled to the growth rate. A mutant lacking the common system was isolated. This mutant can catalyze facilitated diffusion and exchange, but cannot concentrate substrates of the transport system.
