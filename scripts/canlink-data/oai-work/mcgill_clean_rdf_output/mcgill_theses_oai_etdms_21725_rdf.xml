Part 1 defines the technical terms of noise and sonic boom and discusses their harmful effects on airport neighbours and their environment. Part 2 reviews international legal regulations, commencing with the conference convened by the British Government in 1966, and ending with the ICAO Council proposals to be addressed at the 28th (Extraordinary) Session of the Assembly, in October 1990. Further, ICAO efforts in balancing the conflicting interests between developed and developing countries is highlighted, and the legal status of Annex 16 on Environmental Protection is discussed in some detail. Part 3 examines national legislation relating to aircraft noise with an emphasis on the approach of the United States. Part 4 canvasses liability issues through an analysis of the jurisprudence in various countries with a concentration on litigation in the United States. Of particular relevance is the applicability of the 1952 Rome Convention with respect to damages caused by noise and sonic boom. Part 5 examines and evaluates proposed and already implemented solutions to the airport noise problem.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472x558.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r290</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr171z280"><dcterms:title>Techniques for isolating human chromosomal DNA surrounding an integrated HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pascali, Marina Vasiliki</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The KT cell line was developed to study the nature of spontaneous mutations in eukaryotic cells.

A $tk sp+$, G418$ sp{ rm R}$ clone, containing a single integrated copy of the plasmid, was isolated and expanded to form the KT cell line. Plasmid rescue was designed to recover a 15kb autonomously replicating plasmid containing the integrated pSV2neoKT sequences and the cellular DNA surrounding the integration site. Concurrently, a second method was pursued to clone each junction site separately as two smaller fragments using the cloning vectors pUC119 or pBR322. Three variations of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were also used to amplify the cellular DNA flanking the integration site: anchored PCR, single-specific-primer PCR and inverse PCR.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mr02k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171z280</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb3979445"><dcterms:title>A biopsychosocial model of Alzheimer's disease /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tepper, Sherri</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Research on the etiological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease has yielded inconsistent results. It is suggested that this may be due to the unidirectional focus on biomedical attributes, and the failure to consider psychosocial factors in combination with the biomedical characteristics. A biopsychosocial model of Alzheimer's disease, which integrates the biomedical dimension with psychosocial stressors and social support is proposed and tested in a sample of 172 geriatric patients using polychotomous logistic regression. Results find support for the implication of stress in the disease process, but fail to find a relationship between social support and Alzheimer's disease. It is concluded that the ultimate value of a biopsychosocial model of Alzheimer's disease rests in its identification of psychosocial factors, that could result in the prevention of the development of the disease.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr403.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb3979445</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alzheimer's disease</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc426"><dcterms:title>Theory of microbending loss in curved graded-index monomode fibres</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vartanian, Arthur H.

For the first time in the literature, a general formulation of microbending loss in local toroidal co-ordinates is presented. The formulation does not, in any way, depend on the existence of a large number of statistically identical and independent monomode fibres of which the given specimen is an ensemble averaged sample. This general formalism is used to derive an expression for the microbending coupling spectrum which encapsulates the essential analytical characteristics of both non-zero polarisation and curvature effects. Theoretical results of the wavelength dependence of excess microbending loss for two power spectral density functions along with their respective optimised statistical fibre parameters are investigated and show considerable improvement over previous studies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x03b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc426</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c394r"><dcterms:title>A single-phase fully-regenerative converter for chopper controlled DC drives /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Balasingham, Karunananthan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>High performance dc servo-drives are often supplied from four-quadrant choppers to ensure low armature current ripple and large control loop bandwidths. In order to allow for continued regenerative braking, the dc link voltage is regulated within limits and the energy produced during braking is dissipated in resistances. In the proposed scheme the energy produced during regeneration is re-injected into the ac mains supply. The scheme consists of adding to each diode of the front end rectifier a transistor capable of conducting the reverse current, and suppressing the dc link capacitor. The performance of the complete converter with a single phase ac mains is analysed in terms of operation in both motoring and braking modes. The advantages of the scheme are presented and its characteristics are compared to the standard chopper configuration and to the conventional phase-controlled converter systems. It is shown that the system exhibits high power factor and efficiency and is very compact.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt28m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c394r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b447z"><dcterms:title>Theatre in the evolution of moral values among adolescents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Basourakos, John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Theatre has a special place in religious education for it is an ideal medium to experience transcendent moral truths.

In this experiment, the local anesthetic lidocaine was microinjected into the dentate region of the hippocampus, an important limbic structure presumed to subserve the affective-motivational aspects of pain. The dentate gyrus is strategically situated at a point of convergence of widespread polysensory cortical input to the hippocampus, to allow modulation of cortical signals before they diverge into numerous limbic circuits. The results indicate that anesthetic block of the anterior region of the dentate gyrus produces analgesia in the rat during the formalin test. The analgesia produced by this procedure became apparent 30 minutes after regional block contralateral to the site of injury and persisted for the duration of the test period. These data provide further evidence that limbic forebrain structures are involved in pain and analgesia.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt30b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn14r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pain -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lidocaine -- Physiological effect.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analgesia.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j677c"><dcterms:title>Identification of time-varying human joint dynamics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacNeil, Jon Bart</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to develop a comprehensive model of the motor control system the time-varying nature of joint dynamics must be addressed. However, it has not previously been possible to quantitatively observe changes in joint dynamics during a transition of state. In this work, a recently developed method for identification of linear time-varying dynamic systems from ensemble data has been used to obtain models of neuromuscular dynamics during a rapid contraction. The method, based on singular value decomposition, provides a series of nonparametric (impulse response function) models of a system's dynamics without a priori knowledge of its dynamic structure or time-variation, thus enabling study of the neuromuscular system during natural activity. Application of this method to simulated and experimental data has shown it to be robust and accurate. Ankle dynamics have been tracked during voluntary isometric contraction of triceps surae, revealing behaviour more complex than second-order, characterized by a decrease in the joint's resistance to low frequency perturbations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts79b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j677c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb4949655"><dcterms:title>Air distribution from ventilation ducts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacKinnon, Ian R.

The optimum aperture ratio for the 8.54 m long duct was 1.0 with a uniformity coefficient of 90.28%. The fan speed had little effect on the uniformity of discharge. The friction factor was experimentally determined to be 0.048 for a non-perforated duct and this value was assumed to be the same for a perforated duct of similar construction. A kinetic energy correction factor was used to analyze the flow in the duct. Values for this correction factor were determined from experimental data. Values of the coefficient of discharge and the total duct energy were calculated. A mathematical model was proposed based on the conservation of momentum and the Bernoulli's equation. The model responded favourably and predicted the duct velocity nearly perfectly and slightly underestimated the total duct energy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881n17q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb4949655</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Farm buildings -- Heating and ventilation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air ducts -- Design and construction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Air flow -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apr76f4676"><dcterms:title>Toward more meaningful sexuality education : the role of values</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McKay, Alexander, M.A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an examination of the role of values in the development of more meaningful school based sexuality education programs. There is a growing consensus among researchers and educators that presenting only physiological information is inadequate and that sexuality education should include a values component. The integration of values into sexuality education is highly problematic. Because of the potential for controversy regarding questions of sexual values, many sexuality educators have attempted to teach programs that are value free. An ethical framework for the integration of values into sexuality education needs to be established. The act-centred and person-centred approaches to sexual ethics are compared and contrasted in terms of their suitability for sexuality education. It is proposed that a person-centred approach may provide a starting point of an ethical framework for the integration of values into sexuality education.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt99x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f4676</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex instruction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sexual ethics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88ch308"><dcterms:title>Synthetic studies towards cepham derivatives.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rosebery, Gerald David.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr76x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch308</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cephalosporins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organic compounds -- Synthesis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870w67p"><dcterms:title>Local-level responses to induced economic change in the Waidina Valley, Fiji; a case study of anthropological economics.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1973</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rutz, Henry J.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x34f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w67p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Waidina Valley (Fiji Islands) -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Waidina Valley (Fiji Islands) -- Economic conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arv042t787"><dcterms:title>Studies on a member of the pleuston, Anomalocera opalus n.s.
