The bacteriophages can follow the lytic cycle, in which the bacteriophage genome is replicated and progeny phages are produced, or the lysogenic cycle, in which the bacteriophage remains dormant in the E. coli genome. In this case, the bacteriophage's DNA is replicated along with the host chromosome. Central to the lytic/lysogenic switch, is the Ner protein. Ner is a small, basic, DNA-binding protein. To better understand the mechanism by which bacteriophage D108 regulates its lytic/lysogenic switch, a plasmid containing the D108 left end was mutagenized by hydroxylamine treatment or by transformation into a mutator strain of E. coli, in order to isolate Ner proteins which would be deficient in repressor activity. The 3-dimensional structure of the Ner protein from bacteriophage Mu has been resolved by NMR spectroscopy. Homologs of the Ner proteins have been identified in the Enterobacteriaceae and in humans.

FhuD is a component of the ferric hydroxamate uptake (Fhu) system which also includes a high affinity outer membrane receptor (FhuA) and two cytoplasmic membrane-bound proteins (FhuB/FhuC) [Coulton et al., 1987]. FhuD is detected in very low concentrations in the E. coli K-12 periplasm. To generate large amounts of FhuD, the fhuD gene of E. coli was cloned into a plasmid vector (pKTH288) and expressed in Bacillus subtilis . This construct was designed so that the recombinant FhuD would accumulate intracellularly. Alternatively, the fhuD gene of E. coli was also cloned into a secretion plasmid (pKTH132) and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. In this construct it was expected that the recombinant FhuD be secreted into the exterior of the cell. In order to obtain protein in a conformation it was necessary to remove the denaturant (urea or guanidine-HCl).

The resulting system was analytically solved, yielding an almost equivalent system of differential delay equations (DDEs). A final transformation of the DDE system into a system of two integro-differential delay equations (IDDEs) yielded a model equivalent to the original ODEs/PDEs, but much more amenable to analysis. Numerical solutions of the IDDE system were compared with experimental data, and it was concluded that the data was reasonably well modeled.

In situations where NO3-concentrations in the soil-water system pose an environmental hazard, water table management may be a desirable practice to reduce such pollution. Careful management of N applications is also believed to reduce NO3- levels. A field experiment was conducted in 1996 and 1997 at St. Emmanuel, Quebec, about 30 km South-West of Macdonald Campus of McGill University, to investigate the effect of water table management (WTM) and N fertilizer combinations on potentially leachable NO3- and denitrification rates in the top soil layer (0--0.15 m). The field was planted with monocrop corn (Zea mays. L) in both years. Treatments consisted of a factorial combination of two water table managements, free drainage (FD) and subirrigation (SI) (about 1.0 m and 0.6 m, respectively, below the soil surface) and two N fertilizer rates, 200 kg ha-1 (N200) and 120 kg ha-1 (N120). Water table management had a significant effect on reducing NO3 - concentrations in the soil profile. Subirrigation treatment reduced NO3- in the top soil layer by 41% and 15% in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Similarly, NO3 - levels were 50% and 20% lower in N120 compared to N200 treatment. Climatic conditions (rainfall and temperature) played a large role in regulating denitrification rates. Due to drier and cooler conditions in 1997, denitrification rates were lower compared to 1996, leaving more NO3 - in the soil profile. Following harvest, this high NO 3- concentration may be subject to leaching.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096932s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h48x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sandy loam soils -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water table -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Denitrification -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrogen fertilizers -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z7550"><dcterms:title>Radiosensitization of a mouse tumor model (RIF-1) by Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) using biodegradable polymer implants as a controlled drug delivery system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Doiron, Annie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To increase the effectiveness of conventional radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer, different drugs can be administered. The aim of this project is to investigate biodegradable polyanhydride carrier matrices (PCPP-SA; 20:80) as a localized slow release delivery system for halogenated pyrimidines, in our case Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Our in vitro experiments show that RIF-1 cells which have incorporated BrdU into their DNA over 4 doublings show significant increase in the initial slope (alpha-value) of their radiation cell survival curves, indicating an increase in radiosensitivity. To investigate the radiosensitization potential of BrdU in vivo, biodegradable BrdU/polymer combinations (20% w/w) were prepared and implanted directly into RIF-1 tumors, grown subcutaneously on the backs of C3H/Km mice. Clonogenic/excision assays were done with these tumors exposed to BrdU/polymer implants for several cell cycles before irradiation in situ to determine the extent of radiosensitization on the basis of cell survival. Tumor growth delay (TGD) measurements were also used as an index of tumor control following different treatments (single dose or fractionated doses) with and without the drug/polymer implants. All results indicate that BrdU, combined with radiation, increases TGD, while having no effect on non-irradiated tumors. The extent of substitution of thymidine by BrdU in DNA were also determined.

Corn (Zea mays L.) was planted on the expel site and them were four treatments: water table controlled at 600 mm and 120 kg/ha of N fertilizer (WT120), water table controlled at 600 mm and 200 kg/ha of N fertilizer (WT200), free drainage and 120 kg/ha of N fertilizer (FD120), and free drainage and 200 kg/ha of N fertilizer (FD200). Drain flow was monitored and water samples were taken and analyzed for NO3- -N. Soil NO3- levels were measured along with led chlorophyll and denitrification throughout the two growing seasons. Drain flow was dependent on both rainfall and the soil moisture content. In 1996, water table control decreased drain flow. However, in 1997 (a drier year), the drain flows for all treatments were similar. NO3 --N was reduced significantly in the controlled water table plots. In 1996, there was 59.2% less NO3--N in the controlled water table plots than in the free drainage plots and in 1997 this increased to 75.9% less NO3--N in the controlled water table compared to the fire drainage plots. In 1996, denitrification was enhanced by the controlled water table plots, with 72.2% more denitrification occurring in the controlled water table plots than in the free drainage plots. In 1997, there was a 93.2% increase in denitrification occurring in the water table plots than in the free drainage plots. The controlled water table plots had no effect on plant chlorophyll levels. Chlorophyll contents of the corn plants were higher where fertilizer was applied at 200 kg/ha. Overall, it was shown that water table management can significantly decrease NO3--N pollution in drainage water.

The models maximize the sum of field net margins subject to singleness of field use, animal nutrient requirements, and erosion. Scenario results show that increasing the erosion constraint: (1) reduces soil loss from agricultural production; (2) forces cropping patterns and farming practices to change; (3) reduces profits; and (4) induces marginal and average costs to increase at an increasing rate.

Marguerite River. By dividing reaches into smaller, morphologic unit's, in order to make the conditions more uniform, it was noticed that the wetted width and the amplitude of the vertical oscillation of riffles and pools (riffle-pool amplitude) provided the strongest hydraulic and morphologic relationships with the amount of usable habitat at the morphologic unit scale. Two regression models were produced to estimate the AUW of morphologic as a function of hydraulics and morphology, respectively. The historic flood in July 1996 also provided an opportunity to examine some of the impacts of a large magnitude flood on channel morphology: localized bed and bank erosion, the destruction of riparian vegetation, the enhancement and destruction of individual bars, and localized changes in the hydraulic and morphologic character (induced by large sediment inputs).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j332n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75df73h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Floods -- Québec (Province) -- Saguenay River Valley.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sainte-Marguerite River (Québec) -- Channels.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Habitat -- Québec (Province) -- Sainte-Marguerite River.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sc487"><dcterms:title>Xyloglucan (XG) in periplasmic spaces and primary cell walls of developing nasturtium fruits</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Desveaux, Darrell.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Young developing fruits of nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) accumulate large deposits of non-fucosylated "storage" XG in periplasmic spaces of cotyledon cells.

Storage XG can be fucosylated by a nasturtium transferase in vitro, but this does not happen in vivo, even as a transitory signal required for secretion which would subsequently be cleaved to produce mature non-fucosylated storage XG in the periplasmic space.

The adhesion experiments were also conducted on agar-covered slides to evaluate the effect of the nature of the substratum on adhesion. The non-adherent organisms found on either surface tested (meat or agar) were removed by flushing liquid over the slide. The slides were then incubated in a moist atmosphere at 30°C. Once the presence of microcolonies had been established microscopically, the slides were mounted into flow chambers and the surface flushed with distilled water to ascertain the effects of bacterial proliferation on adhesion. In other experiments, the influence of acetic, citric, and lactic acid rinses on cell adhesion and subsequent cell proliferation was evaluated. Microcolony formation was shown to reduce the adhesion strength of Enterobacter agglomerans and, to a lesser extent, that of Moraxella osloensis while increasing that of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The probable determinant of adhesion strengths of microcolonies is exopolymer synthesis. A minimal decrease in bacterial adhesion and microcolony formation was observed with the use of organic acid rinses. The bactericidal activity and effect on bacterial proliferation increased with increasing concentration and rinse times of the organic acids. The extent of the adhesion reductions suggests that the preservation action of organic acids is due to cell death and not adhesion inhibition.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h80k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jr004</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organic acids.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacteria -- Adhesion.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meat -- Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62fb520"><dcterms:title>The impact of team software organizations on software quality and productivity /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cavalcante, Marcia Beatriz.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this paper we describe an experimental study conducted at McGill University in which we assessed the performance of different types of team organizations in terms of their effect on key process variables such as rework, defect density, review quality, cost of quality, productivity, etc. We also analyzed the ability to rank product quality from process data, prior to the completion of the projects.

Data corresponding to stratiform, continental rain is analyzed, and a function (delta) is defined in order to provide a quantification of the relative differences between pairs of instruments. Significant differences in drop concentrations simultaneously measured by the instruments are found, being these about 100% at the extremes of the diameter spectra.

For fine-coarse difference a QTL x E interaction peak was detected when only BCD 1796B was added or when both UBC508(C) and BCD 1796B were added.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fortin, M. G.

The objective of the study was to evaluate trends in water quality. The data sets that were used to determine the changes in water quality were taken from the project "Gestion de leau dans le bassin versant de la partie superieure du ruisseau St. Esprit". For the period from 1994 to 1996, the analysed water quality parameter were nitrate, phosphate, ammonium, potassium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus and suspended sediment. The data sets were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical techniques and non-parametric methods to detect trends in the measured water quality parameters. The statistical analyses were undertaken to determine the effects of soil conservation practices and fertiliser management and to compare different sampling strategies. The analyses showed that there were no detectable changes in water quality over the 3-year period related to the conservation practices. The lack of improvement in water quality might be due to the slow rate of adoption of conservation practices and to climatic variations. For the non-parametric methods applied, it was possible to show that climatic variations on small watershed affect the results over a short time period (&lt;5 years). The phosphate concentration on the control showed a significant upward trend. The nitrate concentration on St. Esprit showed an upward trend over the 3-year period and then downward trend after a 4-year period of water quality data. This was likely due to the implementation of best management practices. The statistical analyses showed that weekly sampling on fixed schedule produce the same results as automated sampling based upon flow rate related to a defined discharge. This shows that the more complex and expensive flow weighted sampling scheme is not required to detect trends in water quality.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C. A.

An emerging nature-based tourism industry in Black River, Jamaica was studied to determine the factors involved in creating a symbiotic tourism-environment relationship. The tourism-environment relationship brings into play many stakeholders and at the local level these include the tour developers, conservation authorities, the natural environment, the host population and the visiting public. In this study, surveys of tour developers, conservation authorities and the host population indicate that Black River nature-based tourism is degrading the natural and host environment. To modify this outcome of resource degradation adequate administrative arrangements must be established to disengage the elite growth process in favor of a more equitable distribution among a majority of stakeholders. Surveys of the visiting public indicate satisfaction of this consumer group and provide detailed information to guide marketing and management strategies for further improvement of the tour product. Recommendations are presented to strengthen the link between nature-based tourism and conservation of the environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bider, Roger (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p63c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s2300</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ecotourism -- Jamaica -- Black River Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nature conservation -- Jamaica -- Black River Region.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n545m"><dcterms:title>The conjugacy problem in the Lyndon's group /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bridson, Jessica.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Lyndon's Group FZx is of great interest to algebraists due to its unique properties.

Our approach is based on the selection of informative viewpoints within the environment. These viewpoints are locations in the environment which correspond to views containing maximal visual interest. This approach to environment representation is analogous to image compression. Our goal is to obtain a set of selections resembling those made by a human observer given the same task. Our computational procedure is inspired by models of human visual attention outlined in the literature on human psychophysics. We make use of the underlying edge structure of a scene, as it is largely unaffected by variations in illumination. Our implementation uses a mobile robot to traverse the environment, and then builds an image-based virtual representation of the environment, only keeping the views whose responses were highest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attention operator on both single images, and in viewpoint selection within an unknown environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dudek, Gregory (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fk21x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569655h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544br63w"><dcterms:title>Cellular-automata based nonlinear adaptive controllers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bolduc, Jean-Sébastien.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An analytical approach is obviously practical only when we want to study nonlinear systems of low complexity. An alternative for more complex processes that has raised a lot of interest in recent years relies on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this work we will explore an alternative avenue to the problems of control and identification, where Cellular Automata (CAs) will be considered in place of ANNs. CAs not only share ANNs' most valuable characteristics but they also have interesting characteristics of their own, for a structurally simpler architecture. CAs applications so far have been mainly restrained to simulating natural phenomena occuring in a finite homogeneous space. Concepts relevant to the problems of control and identification will be introduced in the first part of our work. CAs will then be introduced, with a discussion of the issues raised by their application in the context, A working prototype of a CA-based controller is introduced in the last part of the work, that confirms the interest of using CAs to address the problem of nonlinear adaptive control.

The Royal Victoria Hospital nursery was recently reequipped with steam humidity source incubators and converted to incubator humidification. An observational (before-after) study investigated the association between incubator humidification and hypernatremia and (secondarily) other hydration associated outcomes in very premature infants. Thirty-one incubator humidification and 60 non-humidification period infants were compared. Mean gestational age was 25.83 weeks for both groups. Mean highest serum sodium values were 143.5 (SD 9.4) and 152.9 (SD 4.9) mEq/l respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Differences persisted after adjustment for confounding by age of placement in incubators, and in spite of fluid reduction in the D humidification period. Of infants with umbilical lines 2/16 and 33155 respectively attained serum potassium measurements over 6.9 mEq/l (p = .04). Overhydration outcomes did not differ, but power was limited and confounding was problematic for these analyses. In summary, incubator humidification is associated with decreased hypernatremia and hyperkalemia in very premature infants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dougherty, G.

Of undiseased plants that developed foliar infections during the growing season, 55% possessed active resistance to the rust disease, and were able to prevent the foliar infection from becoming a systemic one. Flowering increased the susceptibility of plants to both Mar and systemic infections. A phenotypic selection study was carried out to estimate selection on five plant traits and to determine the role of foliar infections of U. ari-triphylli in mediating selection. Multivariate path analysis suggests that both leaf diameter and a general size factor are under positive directional selection.

Conceived as a special form of relation, computations fit neatly into the relational model. A computation is defined over a set of domains, which also act as parameters. Invocation is accomplished by means of the operators of the relational algebra. A computation is intended to embody a constraint amongst its parameters. These are grouped into inputs and outputs at call time. Given a set of input values, the computation returns output values that satisfy the constraint. Computations may be recursive, and may also be nested within other computations. This latter property leads to a notion of scopes and environments. With computations, a mechanism is also provided for the instantiation of stateful objects. It is designed to handle large numbers of such objects efficiently. Behaviour may be encapsulated within the object. The implementation is part of the jRelix project at McGill University. jRelix is the successor of the Relix relational database programming language. A significant feature of the new implementation is the support for nested relations of arbitrary depth. The programming language Java was used exclusively for the implementation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T. H.

Recent evidence from the long terminal repeat of the Mouse Mammary Tumour Virus (MMTV) suggests that glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) may consist of directly-repeated half-sites separated by nine base pairs (GRE-D9). Evidence is provided that GRE-D9 can bind to GR homodimers in vitro, and that, when present in multiple copies, can mediate transactivation of a reporter gene in vivo. Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) has been implicated in modulating the ligand-inducibility of the estrogen receptor (ER) in vivo. In order to better characterize the functional significance of the interaction between these two proteins, chimeric ERs consisting of the GAL-4 DNA binding domain fused to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ER were constructed. Although these chimeras are ligand-dependent transactivators, they bind DNA in the absence of estradiol and do not interact with hsp90 in vitro. Furthermore, data are presented which are consistent with a model in which transcriptional interact with the ER LBD in a ligand-dependent manner. Introduction of the destabilizing Gly400Val substitution in the ER L33D results in a chimera which is ligand-dependent for both DNA binding and transactivation. These partially destabilized chimeras are shown to interact with hsp90 in vitro in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas chimeras derived from wild-type ER show only a transient association with hsp90, suggesting that hsp90 serves as a molecular chaperone for the ER. A functional model for ER/hsp90 interaction is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>White, John H.

For the passive aspect of the device, to minimize the propagation loss, the coherent coupling effect of radiation modes has been studied as well as the effectiveness of a cosine-generated Y-branch and a notched Y-branch in comparison with the conventional sharp-bend Y-branch. By making use of the coherent coupling effect on a notched Y-branch structure, a propagation loss figure of 0.145 dB/cm has been achieved. For the active aspect including the electro-optical effect, the minimum seperation of the two waveguide arms in order to achieve an extinction ratio above 20 dB has been decided and the corresponding modulation curve obtained. The best achieved extinction ratio is 21.8 dB with a 15 mum seperation between the inner edges of two branching arms for a 80 GHz electrode design.
