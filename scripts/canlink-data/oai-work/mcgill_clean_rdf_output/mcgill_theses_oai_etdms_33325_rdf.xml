Employing recent critical and theoretical developments in philosophy, psychoanalysis, linguistics and feminist theory, this study probes into issues surrounding gender/alterity and subject formation, as well as the aesthetics of violence within fin-de-siecle culture. The main goals of the dissertation are (1) to analyze from a philosophical and psychoanalytical point of view the notion of the feminine and its persistent conjunction with death, eroticism and music; (2) to explore various theoretical interpretations of violence within aesthetic production and the potential such violence holds for a negativity that is not only destructive but may also be considered affirmative; and (3) to offer a new interpretive approach to reading violence in opera, one that is modeled after the poststructuralist theories of the "semiotic" as developed by Julia Kristeva. The first section of the dissertation establishes the theoretical groundwork, exploring the writings of Nietzsche, Derrida, Lacan, Bronfen and Kristeva (chapters 1 and 2). An examination of expressionist poetics of negation (chapter 3) leads into the second section which comprises three case studies. Each of the operas under consideration engage issues concerning violence, representation and the feminine, and reveal three very different paths toward semiotic destabilization and negativity. "Morder, Hoffnung der Frauen, or, Overcoming the m/Other" (chapter 4) explores semiotic pulsions as "structural disjunction" both within Kokoschka's radical text and Hindemith's score, and critiques the appropriation of woman in the name of creative innovation. "The Voice of Lulu" (chapter 5) analyzes semiotic eruptions through the materiality and excessive sonority of voice, and explores its subversive effects both on subjectivity and characterization.

This study was carried out to develop encapsulated cell microbeads of appropriate size suitable for in situ bioaugmentation, and to evaluate the feasibility of such a remediation strategy based on the performance of entrapped cells in the biodegradation of a common groundwater contaminant and the transport of cell carriers through porous soil media. A two-phase dispersion technique, termed emulsification-internal gelation, was developed to encapsulate a gasoline-degrading bacterial consortium in gellan gum microbeads. The influence of emulsion parameters including stirring rate, disperse phase volume fraction, emulsifier concentration, emulsification time, and cell mass loading on size distribution of microbeads was studied. A suspension of microbeads in artificial groundwater (AGW) was pulsed into a column for 6 h, followed by injection of bead-free AGW for 42 h. In general, the total amount of microbeads traveling across a given section of the column decreased with the decrease of mean grain size. The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of transport of gellan gum microbeads through a wide range of soil grains, i.e. medium sand to medium gravel (0.25--16 mm), across distances up to 110 cm. An enriched bacterial consortium, isolated from a gasoline-polluted site was encapsulated in gellan gum microbeads. The capacity of encapsulated cells to degrade gasoline under aerobic conditions was evaluated in comparison with free (non-encapsulated) cells. Encapsulated cells (2.6 mgcells g-1 bead) degraded over 90% gasoline hydrocarbons (initial gasoline concentration 50--600 mg L-1) within 5--10 days at 10Â°C. Equivalent levels of free cells removed comparable amounts of gasoline (initial concentration 50--400 mg L-1) within the same period, but required up to 30 days to degrade the highest level of gasoline tested (600 mg L-1).

Rules, theories, algorithms, and retrieval methods designed and developed for English and other morphologically similar languages may or may not apply in the linguistic environments of other languages. The problem is particularly acute in languages that differ radically from English on account of morphological rules. This thesis compares the effects of two indexing and retrieval techniques (stemming and root retrieval) on information retrieval in Arabic through an exploratory study of the handling of Arabic words by an English search engine. It also investigates how best to adapt existing English-language information retrieval systems for use with Arabic-language texts, and specifically to process words and their morphological variations. Search experiments, using 2000 Arabic documents and 40 Arabic search terms (nouns), were conducted with a Web search engine developed for English, AltaVista, to compare the performances of stemming and root retrieval and to investigate the possibility of adapting this engine for use with Arabic text. The results of the experiments show that more effective retrieval can be accomplished through stemming, and that it is possible to adapt the engine for use with Arabic without the need to develop root-retrieval features.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Large, Andrew (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811km32f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z831</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arabic language -- Morphology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Information storage and retrieval systems.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375z03g"><dcterms:title>Dielectric properties and their application in microwave-assisted organic chemical reactions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liao, Xiangjun, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study was designed to develop some predictive models for the dielectric properties of the chemicals and chemical reactions and make use of dielectric properties and microwave irradiation in the chemical reactions.

The dielectric properties of the model systems showed that they depended on the frequency applied, concentration of the material, and temperature. Most of the predictive models showed that there exists a linear or quadratic relationship between dielectric constant and concentration or temperature. However, the quadratic equation is better than the linear one to describe the variation of the loss factor with temperature or concentration. Esterification showed great advantages for the use of microwave irradiation in chemical reaction. It included reduction in reaction time, and provided distinct temperature profiles due to microwave environment during chemical reactions. The reason for rate enhancement of this type of reaction was also demonstrated from the temperature profile. Microwave-assisted solvent free Maillard reaction model system, consisting of glucose and lysine, demonstrated that the heating method applied was not one of the crucial factors, but the temperature level was important during the chemical reaction. The relationship of loss factor with yield of reaction showed that it is possible to use dielectric data to analyze, and monitor the chemical reaction. It provided a new methodology to analyze the reaction. The relationship between the loss factor, loss tangent and the reaction time, and concentration of the material showed that it is also possible to use dielectric data at microwave frequencies of 2450 and 915 MHz to study chemical reactions, especially the kinetics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raghavan, Vijaya G.

Qualitative interviews of women who have undergone excision of the clitoris and women who have not form the core of my data. My analysis indicates that female orgasm in diverse societies is problematized and controlled, causing me to postulate numerous similarities between women despite cultural and physical differences. One of the most significant findings is that similar attitudes toward the clitoris might be invoked to explain both its removal, in excising societies, and clitoral-vaginal theoretical bifurcations in non-excising ones. The originality of my theoretical approach is to examine various types of social constructionism. I demonstrate its pertinence to an understanding of the literal construction of the body through social practices or social imperatives which determine physical reality. My use of the term constructionism as anti-essentialism also enables me to identify common components of drive theory in diverse cultures, and to demonstrate their lack of correlation with sexual behavior. Finally, constructionism is a crucial element to my analysis of subjective beliefs concerning female orgasm. Interpretation of physiological response supports a belief in clitoral-vaginal opposition in defiance of the interdependence of these two organs, thereby reflecting the constructionist insistence upon reality as socially defined. The originality of this research lies in its comparative perspective and resulting emphasis on similarities in culturally diverse groups. Female sexuality and orgasm are filtered through social existence. A physiological response can thus be denied or substantiated by social means.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Staggenborg, Suzanne (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk81z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj1393644</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Sexual behavior -- Cross-cultural studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Female orgasm -- Cross-cultural studies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g9050"><dcterms:title>Sulfur allotrope chemistry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leste-Lasserre, Pierre.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The synthesis of the sulfur homocycles S6, S9, S10, S12 and S20, which belong to the group of sulfur allotropes, has been achieved based on existing procedures. Polymeric sulfur Smu was also prepared. The parameters of a small scale model reaction between 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene and S10 were optimized. Products were identified and 1H-NMR yields were calculated by comparison with an internal standard. The experimental parameters of this model served as a base for further reactions of S 10 with a variety of simple or conjugated olefins. The products of these reactions were fully isolated and characterized using standard spectroscopic techniques. The structures of a new bis-sulfurated compound having a norbornane framework and of the product obtained from the dimerization of norborn-5-ene-2,3-dithiol were also confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The sulfur homocycles S9, S12 and S20 were also found to react with norbornene and two different 1,3-dienes. Products were identified and 1H-NMR yields for these small scale reactions were calculated by internal standard comparison. Differences and similarities with the products obtained with S10 are discussed. Sulfuration efficiencies of the different allotropes towards selected substrates are also compared. A mechanistic study was carried out. The implication of sulfur radicals in the thermal decomposition of S10 has been suggested. Reaction mechanisms accounting for the formation of the different products observed are proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harpp, D. N.

They are nevertheless conjecturally modular and Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectures have been stated for them as well. For elliptic curves over Q , Mazur and Tate have formulated some refined conjectures of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer type. They define an element theta belonging to a group ring Z[G] where G is the Galois group of a finite abelian extension of Q , and conjecture that it belongs to a power of the augmentation ideal I â Z[G] that is at least the rank of E( Q ). The behavior of theta is similar to the order of vanishing at 1 of p-adic L-functions: for example, primes of split multiplicative reduction for the curve appear in the conjectures. In this thesis, we use modular symbols computed on some hyperbolic upper-half space to construct theta elements associated to elliptic curves defined over quadratic imaginary fields of class number 1. We state conjectures similar to those of Mazur and Tate for such curves and experimentally test many cases of the conjectures. The tests include situations in which we use prime ideals of OK where the elliptic curves have split multiplicative reduction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Darmon, Henri R.

There are two fabrication processes developed in this work for TFTs dependent on the substrates used. A procedure for the fabrication of TFTs on Si substrates and a procedure for devices on glass substrates will be presented. Both procedures are designed for the fabrication of TFTs with an inverted gate-staggered electrode configuration. The chemical bath deposition process developed has yielded CdSe-TFTs and CdS-TFTs on thermally grown oxide/Si substrate with very good performance. Typical values of mobility for those TFTs are about 10 cm2/V-s for CdSe-TFTs and 1 Cm 2/V-s for CdS-TFTs with W = 200 mum and L = 20 mum. The ON-current values of the CdSe-TFTs and CdS-TFTs at a gate bias of 10 V and a source-drain voltage of 10 V are about 100 muA and 5 muA, respectively. The OFF-current values of the CdSe-TFTs and CdS-TFTs at the source-drain voltage of 10 V are less than 10 pA. The incorporation of the thermal oxidation process for the fabrication of TFTs described in the first procedure is useful for studying the properties and deposition of active semiconductor layers. However, it may not be suitable for large-scale production due to the high temperatures involved and the thermal requirements of the substrate. To reduce the process temperatures and the requirements for substrates, it is necessary to employ methods other than thermal oxidation for gate oxides. In this work, in addition to thermal oxidation, the anodization method will be used to form gate oxides for the second fabrication procedure on glass substrate. In addition, some samples were prepared with thin gate dielectric films by magnetron-sputtering method. The effects of anodization conditions on the quality of the anodic dielectric were investigated by measuring the breakdown electric field and leakage current density of the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors fabricated. Results of electrical measurements carried out on the CdSe-TFTs with A12O3 and Ta2O5 gate dielectrics showed field effect mobilities of 3.4 and 0.67 cm2/V-s and threshold voltages of 3.2 V and 8.2 V, respectively. Field effect mobilities of 0.2 and 2 cm2/V-s and threshold voltages of 4.3 and 5.2 V were observed for CdS-TFTs, again with Al2O3 and Ta 2O5 gate dielectrics.

In Guatemala, cross-border movement was spawned by the brutal civil war that devastated many indigenous communities in the early 1980s. Over time, this flow resulted in the formation of complex transnational networks and identities that span home and host locations. This thesis examines the manners in which a community of K'iche' Indians straddled between the highlands of El Quiche, Guatemala and an industrial New England city have responded to the deterritorialization caused by the confluence of violence and displacement. It describes, on the one hand, the context of post-war reconstruction in El Quiche, which is shaped by a fragile institutional peace process and an emerging ethnopolitical movement that emphasizes a pan-Maya identity. On the other hand, it depicts an inner-city space in the US where K'iche' labor migrants lead hidden, marginal lives, seeking to obscure any overt form of collective organization or identity. By examining the flows of people, money, commodities and symbols between these contrasting environments, the thesis shows how K'iche's in both communities maintain concrete and imaginary connections with each other despite the many ruptures caused by violence and dislocation. The thesis also teases out the manners in which today's cross-border movements, which involve ever larger distances, absences, and cash inflows, are both inscribed in, and differ from, previous local strategies of, and discourses on, internal movement and migration within Guatemala, which have long formed part of K'iche' culture. Specifically, it shows how K'iche's draw on their "mobile" past in order to maintain a sense of continuity in the present and elaborate viable identities and strategies for the future.

Beyond the typical description or classification of urban forms, this study deals with the essential problem of how changes in form occurred as the city underwent a rapid growth and industrialization. Drawing insights from three different bodies of research---neoclassical theories of land rent, Marxian theories of capital accumulation, and space syntax theories of urban form---a theoretical and methodological approach is formulated which considers the city as a dynamic system, and acknowledges circulation as the driving force behind urban morphological change. It is argued that the built form of Montreal was continuously shaped and reshaped by the evolving strategies of a local "growth machine" which sought to reduce the turnover time of capital by "redimensioning" the urban "vascular system": that is, the streets, sidewalks, tracks, bridges, elevators, and canals, within which circulation takes place. This claim is interrogated and developed in each chapter through a series of empirical analyses utilizing evidence from several high-quality sources (e.g. atlases, municipal tax rolls, city surveyor reports, building inspector reports, photographs, and newspapers) to investigate the critical processes of building and rebuilding associated with phenomena such as destructive fires, the modernization of the port, street widenings, and the reconfiguration of the street grid. Each investigation explores the relationship between circulation and urban morphology. The series of investigations revealed certain regularities with respect to the spatial and temporal properties of morphological change. Consistent with expectations based on existing theories and research, the findings confirm the importance of centrality and accessibility to urban form, for the distribution of rents, and for patterns of land</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Olson, Sherry H.

I suggest that the essays and articles of well-known writers Fanny Fern, Marie Corelli, and Sarah Grand, and others who are less well-known, such as Ignota and Mary Livermore, together form a significant body of prose non-fiction that highlights women's active involvement in political debate. I focus primarily upon women's contributions to general-interest periodicals---where women were competing for space against a wider variety of male writers---rather than on ladies' magazines or the suffrage press, whose more narrow goals diminish the potency of women's appearance in the press. Much of my study focuses on the British Nineteenth Century and the American North American Review , both of which turned to series of articles and carefully organized groups of essays to showcase women's inclusion in the debate, often summarized as the Woman Question, over women's position in nineteenth-century society. Throughout, I posit that women's publication on topics concerning women's rights constitutes culturally and generically sanctioned political activity. The five chapters represent increasingly specific aspects of this activity. The first positions women's involvement within the press's penchant for diversity. The second argues for a connection between the influential function of the periodical press and the role of women as positive influences on others. While this influence is generally interpreted as purely domestic, I suggest an alternative reading that endorses women's publication in periodicals. The third chapter examines how women play on notions of gender and identity to create viable public voices in the press. In chapter four, I turn my attention to the ways in which women occupy the forum of the periodical to comment on and prescribe male behavior.

Crystallization of ferrous sulphate was found to play a crucial role in the overall process due to its relatively low solubility and fast crystallization kinetics at elevated temperatures. In fact, the overall kinetics of the oxydrolysis process were found to be limited by the re-dissolution of ferrous sulphate. Pre-crystallization of ferrous sulphate prior to oxidation was found to result in enhanced overall kinetics, cutting down the required retention time from 3 to 2 hours. Enhanced kinetics were also achieved by performing oxydrolysis in two-temperature stages: a low temperature (T = 180Â°C) first stage with retention time &gt;20 min and an elevated temperature (T = 200Â°C) second stage with retention time &gt;100 min. The typical composition of the hematite material produced in this work was 64.3% Fe, 1.3% S (as SO4), 0.6% Zn, and 4.6% H2O. The sulphur content was found to be predominantly (0.6--0.8%) due to formation of sodium jarosite with the remaining (0.3--0.5%) attributed to SO4 chemisorption, and (to less extent) basic ferric sulphate formation. In the absence of zinc sulphate, the majority of sulphate contamination was due to basic ferric sulphate formation. Hematite was found to form via a predominantly homogeneous nucleation mechanism with sub-micron crystallites clustered together as aggregates of 5--10 mum size and around 7 m 2/g specific surface area. In contrast, hematite produced by direct hydrolysis of ferric sulphate possessed one order of magnitude higher specific surface area. As for the industrial hematite product, its composition was found to be 52.6% Fe, 4.6% S, 1.0% Zn, and 8.8% H2O. The sulphur contamination in the industrial product was mainly due to co-precipitation of jarosite and basic ferric sulphate compounds. Hydrothermal trans-formation of the industrial hematite product at elevated temperatures (&gt;200Â°C) and retention time of &gt;60 min with solids loading as high as 16 wt.% proved to be effective in reducing the sulphur content to less than 1%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Demopoulos, G.

This study therefore helps redress a significant imbalance in the scholarship on Buddhist ethics, which has up to now focused primarily on the morality of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. The dissertation incorporates both descriptive and metaethical analyses to answer three questions: What is Santideva's moral theory, and how does it compare with other characterizations of Buddhist ethics? Can one moral theory adequately describe Buddhist moral traditions? Through textual analysis and translations, this thesis offers a exegetical account of the moral thought in the Siká¹£asamuccaya , beginning with a description of Santideva's understanding of how to become a bodhisattva, the Mahayana spiritual ideal. I provide an analysis of Santideva's understanding of key moral concepts, with a particular focus on virtuous conduct (sila), skillfulness (kusalatva), and merit (puá¹ya). I then test the assumption that Buddhist moral theory is homogeneous by comparing the results of this study with those of existing secondary literature on Buddhist ethics, and in particular, I respond to Damien Keown's position that Buddhist ethics can be considered a form of Aristotelian virtue ethics. I highlight those features of Santideva's thought that fit the framework of a virtue ethic, and then discuss the implications of those aspects of the tradition that are not well captured by it. In particular, I consider the utilitarian elements in Santideva's morality. In my conclusion, I attempt to resolve these apparently conflicting styles of moral reasoning with the idea that there is a shift over the course of a bodhisattva's career from a straightforward virtue ethic to a kind of utilitarian hybrid of virtue ethics. I conclude the thesis with some reflections on the value of comparative ethics and the effort to develop a comprehensive moral theory to describe Buddhist traditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Young, Katherine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x0669.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000173q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religion, Philosophy of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion, History of.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bw14g"><dcterms:title>Sites of Aboriginal difference : a perspective on installation art in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Collins, Curtis J., 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation traces the presence of installation-based practices among artists of Aboriginal ancestry via selected exhibitions across Canada. It begins with a methodological perspective on Canadian art history, federal law, and human science, as a means of establishing a contextual backdrop for the art under consideration. The rise of an Indian empowerment movement during the twentieth century is then shown to take on an international voice which had cultural ramifications at the 1967 Canadian International and Universal Exhibition. Nascent signs of a multi-mediatic aesthetic are distinguished in selected works in Canadian Indian Art '74, as well as through Native-run visual arts programs. First Nations art history is charted via new Canadian art narratives starting in the early 1970s, followed by the development of spatial productions and hybrid discourses in New Work By a New Generation in 1982, and Stardusters in 1986. The final chapter opens with a history of installation art since the Second World War, as related to the pronounced presence of multi-mediactic works in Beyond History in 1989. Post-colonial and postmodern theories are deployed to conclusively situate both the artistic and political concerns featured throughout this study, and lead into the analysis of selected installations at Indigena: Contemporary Native Perspectives and Land, Spirit, Power: First Nations at the National Gallery of Canada. These 1992 shows in the national capital region ultimately confirm the maturation of a particular socio-political aesthetic that tested issues of Canadian identity, while signifying Aboriginal sites of difference.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, Christine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj37j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bw14g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Exhibitions -- Canada -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Installations (Art) -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indian art -- Canada -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w1391"><dcterms:title>"Coloured with an historicall fiction" : the topical and moral import of characterization in Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chishty-Mujahid, Nadya Qamar.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation focuses on how a series of major characters in Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene (Prince Arthur, Britomart, Duessa, Artegall, and those characters that figure forth the poet's sovereign, Elizabeth I) enhance a reader's appreciation of the epic's complex topical allegory and its moral implications. By closely interpreting the respective functions and narratives of these characters, and additionally examining some of Spenser's main techniques of character development, I propose that the above figures both articulate and underscore central aspects of the poet's politically encomiastic and critical agendas. These specific techniques of character development include composition, fragmentation, and metamorphosis (both positive, as in the case of Britomart, as well as pejorative, such as in the case of the wicked enchantress Duessa). By thus investigating the topical import of The Faerie Queene 's allegory, I further demonstrate both how the epic's major characters illustrate contemporary Elizabethan moral and political ideals and, in certain cases, exemplify serious perceived threats to those ideals. The dissertation also indicates that the poet consistently and cautiously treads a fine line between allegorically depicting controversial historical issues and events (towards which at least some Elizabethans were ambivalent), and praising Elizabeth and her successful governing abilities. This crucial tension, reflected in the epic's diverse plots, invests the topical aspects of the poem with much of their complexity. Yet, given that Spenser's main aims included portraying his queen as a model monarch, while simultaneously enhancing concepts of English nationhood, his criticisms of her government and policies remain tentative. Loyalty to the Tudor sovereign and to the predominant Protestant faith in England are fundamental to the epic, for the poet assumes they provide his audience with an essential foundation for personal moral "self-fashioning."

Merr.) and Bradyrhizobium japonicum can form a nitrogen fixing symbiosis. This symbiosis is important for most sustainable agriculture systems. This thesis examines two ways to enhance nodulation and nitrogen fixation by this symbiosis: coinoculation of plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) with B. japonicum, and addition of RNA to a bradyrhizobial culture medium. The optimal coinoculation dose of Serratia proteamaculans 1--102 and S. liquefaciens 2--68 was determined as 108 cells per plant under both optimal and suboptimal root zone temperatures (RZTs). Nodulation dynamics studies indicated that coinoculation of these two PGPB caused earlier nodule initiation and a higher nodulation rate, contributing to the higher nodule number and nodule weight. The coinoculation also increased nitrogen fixation efficiency under both optimal and suboptimal RZTs. A novel inducible activator only produced by the bacteria after addition of flavonoids to the culture system was prepared and evaluated in greenhouse and field experiments. Fourteen non-bradyrhizobial endophytic bacteria (NEB) were isolated from the surface sterilized root nodules, and three of these, designated NEB4, NEW and NEB17, showed soybean plant growth promotion under both greenhouse (with controlled RZTs) and field conditions. Alone, they were neither nodule inducers nor nitrogen fixers. Biolog tests and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses placed the three strains in genus Bacillus: NEB4 and NEB5 are B. subtilis and NEB17 B. thuringiensis. Bradyrhizobium species grow slowly, making the culture process long and the cost of inoculant production higher. Addition of commercial yeast RNA to the bacterial culture medium accelerated the bacterial growth rate, shortened the culture time and increased the lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) yield in flask cultures.

Selective agonists have been developed based on the rodent beta3-AR and successfully used to treat obesity and Type 2 diabetes in these animals. In humans, however, these particular compounds appear to be less effective and not as specific for the beta3-AR as they are in rodents. An additional problem is the low level of expression of these receptors in human adipose, which may ultimately limit the clinical use of stronger more specific agonists. The objective of this research was to examine the regulation of the beta3-AR gene expression. In order to characterize functionally the cis-acting elements necessary for 3-AR proximal promoter activity, a series of luciferase reporter constructs containing various portions of the mouse 5'-flanking region of the gene, spanning from -1.4 kb to -0.126 kb relative to the translation start site (since there is no unique transcription start site), were generated and their transcriptional activity was evaluated by transient transfection experiments. We identified a 13 by element located between -0.208 kb to -0.196 kb that is essential for basal and constitutive proximal promoter activity. The beta3-AR mRNA has a rapid turnover and is readily expressed in the absence of apparent stimuli, in cells cultured in medium with charcoal-stripped serum. Out of several possible regulators we focused on glucocorticoids and thiazolidinediones, the former because it was a potentially important negative regulator, the latter because it could possibly stimulate the expression. In HIB-1B brown adipocytes, glucocorticoids appear to have two opposing effects on beta3-AR gene expression: they rapidly and directly inhibit transcription but also induce a rapidly turned-over protein that stimulates transcription of the gene. The level of beta3-AR expression in response to glucocorticoids may ultimately depend on the relative magnitu</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Silva, J.

While art historians have been exploring the role of primitivism in modern art for decades, this area of research has received little attention in musicology. In this dissertation I examine how primitivism is constructed in modern French culture as manifest in three of the most important avant-garde stage works of the first part of the century: the Ballets Russes's Le Sacre du printemps (1913) and Les Noces (1923), and the Ballets Suedois's La Creation du monde (1923). Relying on primary sources such as reviews, other historically relevant documents, as well as the art historical literature, I trace the evolution of the cultural role of primitivism in pre- and post-World War 1 French culture. French critics of Le Sacre viewed the work as a portrayal of Russian "Otherness" against which they could assert or question their own identity. Whereas the primitivism of Le Sacre was understood to be radical, excessive, even prophetic and apocalyptic, the primitivism of Les Noces was perceived as a manifestation of the classicist "call to order" and as an emblem of American-style mechanization. That it was also understood in terms of the post-war avant-garde's emphasis on classical ideals of austerity, dryness, and sobriety reflects the Purists' belief that machines heralded the new classicism. Jazz was the ultimate symbol of both primitivism and modernity, and was initially hailed by the avant-garde as a revivifying source for the French tradition. In their attempt to neutralize the racial and political threats perceived to be inherent in jazz, the avant-garde emphasized its rationality, precision, and economy. La Creation du monde represents the avant-garde's complete assimilation of jazz and l'art negre into the French classical tradition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Huebner, Steven (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b10s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dt70m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- France -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Avant-garde (Music)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stravinsky, Igor, 1882-1971.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Primitivism -- France.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g667z"><dcterms:title>An adaptable recognition system for biological and other irregular objects /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bernier, Thomas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Automated visual recognition and detection processes are becoming increasingly prevalent in almost all scientific fields and being currently implemented in many fields of industry. In most cases, systems are painstakingly designed and developed in order to detect only a single and specific object or property of an object. The objective of this project was to create a framework of development in which any object distinguishable in a two-dimensional digital image could be analyzed and subsequently detected in other images. Furthermore, as new methods are developed, they could be easily incorporated into this framework to ultimately improve the performance of the system. This thesis describes a highly adaptable, general-application visual detection system as well as several innovative methods for the description of objects without which such adaptivity would be impossible. Two-dimensional, still images are analyzed and objects of interest can be introduced to the system. Objects are then described by a variety of properties through derived attributes and stored in a database. Occurrences of these objects can then be detected in future images through comparisons to selected models. The system is fully expandable in that new properties and comparison techniques or criteria can be added as they are developed and as their need becomes apparent. The system is presented with a basic set of attribute representations and methods of comparison, and their development and origin are described in detail. The database structure is outlined and the process by which new properties and comparative methods can be added is described. Seventeen different images containing nearly two thousand separate objects were searched for various model objects and the average classification accuracy was 98.3%. In most images, more than 100 object classifications could be performed per second at an accuracy higher than 95% when no higher order analyses were required.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Landry, J.

To pursue the first goal, we developed an in vitro reverse transcription reaction system, in which synthetic NCp7 was employed to place natural tRNALys3 onto an HIV-1 RNA template containing the primer binding site (PBS) and its flanking sequences. After placement, NCp7 was removed by Proteinase K digestion and phenol: chloroform extraction, so that the function of NCp7 in annealing could be separated from that in subsequent reverse transcription. Low concentrations of dNTPs were used in these reactions in order to detect very early pausing events during the initiation stage of reverse transcription. The results showed that initiation of HIV-1 (-) strand DNA synthesis was characterized by early pausing events at the +1 and +3 nt positions in the cell-free reverse transcription system. The +1 pausing was associated with the use of an RNA primer, while the +3 pausing event was attributable to the existence of a stem-loop structure upstream of the PBS. A mutant NCp7 molecule, devoid of Zn fingers, was able to place tRNALys3 onto vRNA as efficiently as wt NCp7; however, the tRNALys.3:vRNA complex formed with the assistance of wt NCp7 was far more efficient than that formed by the mutant NCp7 in both initiation and the subsequent transition from initiation to elongation during the synthesis of (-) strand DNA. To study the role of NCp7 in viral RNA incorporation, we deleted the cis-acting packaging signals SL1 and SL3, which are located up- and down-stream of the 5' major splice donor (SD) site, respectively. These deletions led to defected viral replication kinetics. Long-term culture of these mutated viruses gave rise to second-site mutations in the p2 and NC domains of the Gag protein, that were able to rescue the aforementioned deletions. We further deliberately replaced the corresponding residues within p2 or NC by each of 19 other amino acids in the context of the SL1 deletion, and found that only hydrophobic amino acids with long side chains (including V, L, I, and M) were able to rescue this deletion. In addition, it was observed that compensation of the SL1 and SL3 deletions involved changes at different residue positions in the p2 and NC proteins, indicating that RNA packaging signals up- or down-stream of the 5' SD site bind to Gag protein in different ways during viral RNA packaging.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainberg, Mark A.

The RAS has been described as an endocrine system in which all of the constituents are present in the circulation. Renin catalyses the cleavage of liver-derived angiotensinogen thereby initiating the first and rate-limiting step in the generation of the potent vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) in circulation. Renin is secreted primarily from the kidneys along with it biosynthetic precursor, prorenin. Observation of presence of these constituents in tissues has led the proposal of the existence of local or tissue RAS. In cardiovascular tissues, the origin of renin is still a controversial issue. Previous studies have provided evidence in vitro for the uptake and local activity of circulating renin in such tissues. However, direct evidence from in vivo studies is still lacking. We have created an in vivo model to directly test whether circulating renin and prorenin are taken up by tissue to contribute to local generation of angiotensin peptides. In this model, transgenic mice which release human active renin and/or prorenin into the circulation exclusively from the liver were mated to mice expressing human angiotensinogen exclusively in the heart. The measurement of the products of the reaction, Ang I and II, in the hearts of double-transgenic mice serves as a direct measure of the ability of circulating renin and prorenin to promote the activity of a local cardiac RAS. Our results provide the first direct evidence that circulating renin contributes by a pressure-independent mechanism to the production of angiotensin peptides in the heart of intact animals. Moreover, we provide the first direct evidence that circulating prorenin contributes to the production of angiotensin peptides in the tissues of intact animals supporting a role for circulating prorenin. To directly test whether circulating prorenin plays a physiological role in mice by competing for the uptake and tissue action of circulating renin, we have created a second in vivo model. In this model, transgenic mice harbor a chronic elevation of circulating mouse prorenin. Our results fail to support a model in which circulating prorenin could act as a natural antagonist of renin binding in the vasculature and be responsible for the circulatory modifications and pathologies associated with its chronic elevations. In conclusion, our studies permitted us to confirm that uptake and local activity of both circulating renin and prorenin take place in vivo . However, no significant blood pressure-lowering role can be attributed to circulating prorenin in mice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reudelhuber, Timothy L.

Amphiphysin-I and endophilin-I are two nerve terminal-enriched proteins thought to function in CCV formation. In the first study of this thesis, we identified a novel amphiphysin-I isoform (termed amphiphysin-II), through a homology search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) database. We demonstrated that like amphiphysin-I, amphiphysin-II is highly enriched in nerve terminals, where it interacts with dynamin-I and synaptojanin-I through its SH3 domain. Further, both amphiphysins were found to bind directly to the vesicle coat protein, clathrin, in an SH3 domain-independent manner. In the next two studies, we cloned a number of amphiphysin-II splice variants that were found to display differential clathrin binding. The use of these splice variants, together with amphiphysin-II truncation and deletion mutants, allowed us to identify two distinct clathrin-binding domains that are also conserved in amphiphysin-I. Using these amphiphysin constructs we also determined that the amphiphysins are targeted to the plasma membrane through their N-termini, which also appears to be important in facilitating amphiphysin oligomerization. In the final study of this thesis, we turned our attention to a related endocytic SH3 domain-containing protein, endophilin-I. In an attempt to further understand its complete role within the cell, we screened a brain expression library with its SH3 domain, and identified the rat germinal center kinase-like kinase (rGLK), a member of the germinal center kinase (GCK) family of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activating enzymes, as a novel endophilin-I-binding partner. We characterized the interaction both in vitro and in vivo and determined the sequence on rGLK that mediates the interaction. Importantly, overexpression of full-length endophilin-I was found to enhance rGLK-mediated JNK activation, whereas fragments of endophilin-I blocked JNK activation, suggesting a novel role for endophilin-I in JNK intracellular signaling. Taken together, the data in this thesis not only adds to the growing list of endocytic accessory proteins, but also contributes to our understanding of their individual molecular interactions and functions within the cell.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McPherson, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/000001758.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg145</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483k91r"><dcterms:title>Sensory and autonomic innervation of the skin of the rat lower lip</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ruocco, Isabella.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, the innervation patterns by substance P- (SP), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase- (DbetaH) and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter- (VAChT) immunoreactive (IR) fibres were investigated in the skin of the rat lower lip, in order to provide a morphological basis for the possible interactions between sensory and autonomic fibres in the periphery. Our immunocytochemical approach revealed that SP-IR sensory fibres were widely distributed throughout the epidermis and dermis. In the dermis, they were associated with blood vessels, hair follicles, sebaceous glands and mast cells. Electron microscopical quantification revealed that SP-IR fibres equally innervated arterioles, capillaries and venules, all of which were shown to possess SP receptor (NK-1r) immunoreactivity within their walls. DbetaH- and VAChT-IR fibres were present around blood vessels in the lower dermis, but not in the upper dermis, indicating that these fibres are not as widely distributed as the SP-IR fibres. SP-DbetaH, SP-VAChT and DbetaH-VAChT fibre combinations were observed around lower dermal blood vessels. The absence of single labeled blood vessels suggested that blood vessels in the lower dermis are innervated by all three fibre-types. Quantification at the ultrastructural level revealed that DbetaH- and VAChT-IR terminals lie closer to their targets than SP-IR terminals. Bilateral lesions of the mental nerve, a purely sensory nerve, led to the total loss of SP-IR fibres from the lower lip skin, and to the migration of DbetaH-IR fibres into the upper dermis, a territory from which they are normally absent. These sprouted fibres remained in their new territory despite the reinnervation of the lower lip by SP-IR fibres. The bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) caused the complete degeneration of DbetaH-IR fibres and a transient SP-IR fibre sprouting and NK-1r up-regulation. The number of SP-IR fibres and the content of SP within these fibres was increased both in th Therefore we can conclude that SP-, DbetaH- and VAChT-IR fibres all innervate the same blood vessels in the lower dermis of the rat lower lip skin. Furthermore, the plastic changes observed in the association between SP- and DbetaH-IR fibres following trauma to peripheral nerve injuries, may lead to painful sensations and, possibly, abnormal blood flow in the affected region.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ribeiro-da-Silva, Alfredo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x563p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483k91r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x068v"><dcterms:title>Ruptured nations, collective memory &amp; religious violence : mapping a secularist ethics in post-partition South Asian literature and film</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kumar, Priya Haryant.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation maps the emergence of a 'secularist ethics' in post-independence South Asian literature and film, an ethics which is a deeply felt poetic response to particular historical conjunctures marked by religio-nationalist conflict in the Indian subcontinent. It is my argument that literary and cultural productions, in striving to dream and envision a world free of violence, terror and religious intolerance, have some central contributions to make to contemporary intellectual and political debates on secularism. Through close readings of fictions by Salman Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh, Mukul Kesavan, Bapsi Sidhwa, Saadat Hasan Manto, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Jamila Hashmi, Jyotirmoyee Devi, and Lalithambika Antherjanam, as well as films by M. S. Sathyu, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Khalid Mohamed and Shyam Benegal, which are concerned to address the issue of peaceful co-existence between different religious communities and nations in the Indian subcontinent, I argue that literary and imaginative endeavors by way of their alternative secularist imaginaries enable us to begin to imagine the possibilities of more habitable futures. Significantly, the 'secularist' fictions and films I invite attention to in my project enable a revisioning of the secular in terms quite different from normative understandings of liberal secularism. Such a renewed secularism seeks to make visible the normalization and neutralization of majoritarian religious beliefs and practices as constitutive of the representative secular-nationalist self in post-Partition India; it also emerges, significantly, from a gendered critique of the deep-seated patriarchal norms underlying most religious communities. Responding to different moments of crisis, predominantly the Partition of India in 1947, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, and the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the radical secularist poetics of these works call attention to the fundamentalist agenda of Hindu nationalism, the limit</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cope, Karin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f760n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x068v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Secularism in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- South Asia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>English literature -- South Asian authors.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n204079g"><dcterms:title>Education reform in the Eastern Caribbean : implications of a policy and decision-making program by an external donor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Isaac, Annette.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study analyzes the participation of foreign donors in long-term education reform in the small countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Central to this reform is the development of suitable and sustainable policy and decision-making structures, a relatively new activity for the sub-region's planners and educators. This research seeks to investigate how Canada's input into strengthening and supporting these key policy and decision-making structures of the education reform project may affect the sub-region's expectations for a more indigenous and relevant education system. The background for these issues arose out of my familiarity with the challenges facing OECS Ministries of Education in reconciling their own needs in education with the interests of the donor community. In addition, in colonial times, Britain had considerable influence on every aspect of education in the Caribbean, and, in the post-colonial period, Canada had long-term involvement in human-resource development in the sub-region. This raises questions of the viability of reform of the OECS education system to reflect its own development priority needs, culture and values, when a foreign force is significantly involved in funding the development of the key policy and decision-making structures. How dependent are the OECS countries on Canadian assistance to implement their education reform agenda? The dynamics between aid and sovereignty are also of critical importance, given the Eastern Caribbean's history of colonialism and dependency. These issues have frequently been debated in the context of international assistance in the OECS but, to date, there has not been much in-depth qualitative research on such topics, from the academic community. Drawing on dependency theory, and on qualitative research techniques, this thesis critically examines the historical, social, and international development factors of significance in such an inquiry. The study also makes recommendations for future relationships between the donor community and the OECS in the education sector.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ghosh, Ratna (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558f850.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204079g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Educational assistance -- Caribbean Area.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caribbean Area -- Foreign economic relations -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic assistance, Canadian -- Caribbean Area.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Educational change -- Caribbean Area.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Foreign economic relations -- Caribbean Area.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
