Its stratigraphy consists of a Mesoarchean complex constituted of alluvial conglomerate derived from ca. 3000 Ma tonalite, overlain by a crustal contaminated mafic-ultramafic volcanic sequence. Both units were deformed and then intruded by a 2.92 Ga tonalite body and related dyke swarm. Thrust sheets of a tholeftic volcanic sequence of unknown age, of oceanic plateau affinity tectonically overlie this Mesoarchean complex. The tectonic assembly was associated with regional SW directed compression, resulting in NW-trending folding and faulting. No metamorphic break is observed within this tectonic package despite major faulting related to this event. Neoarchean (&lt;2709 Ma) greywacke and polymictic conglomerate unconformably overlie these units, and were deformed by dextral transcurrent deformation. Finally, fault bounded low-strain alluvial greywackes mark the last recorded stratigraphic and structural event affecting this area.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hynes, Andrew (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns90z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f318c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870x79p"><dcterms:title>Knowledge transfer in neural networks : knowledge-based cascade-correlation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rivest, François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most neural network learning algorithms cannot use knowledge other than what is provided in the training data.

A probit model was used to determine household likelihood to borrow, using survey data collected in the region. This likelihood is found to depend on access to alternative activities to generate income, household resilience to income volatility, and demographics: age, education and mobility. High implicit interest rates (112%) are not explained by the average costs (67%) incurred by local lenders. Market access and household demand elasticity seem to be the main factors determining the degree to which forest peasants are exploited. Local lenders are found to receive credit at rates below the cost to non-resident lenders who use the credit relationship to secure a supply of fish.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henning, John C.

Several epidemiological studies have established an association between chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that seropositivity to CP, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with decreased endothelial function in healthy young men. Methodology. A convenience sample of 65 male volunteers, ages 20 to 45, with no known coronary atherosclerosis or risk factors for coronary artery disease were enrolled in a seroepidemiological cross-sectional study. Conclusion. A lack of association between chronic infection to CP, CMV, and EBV with endothelial function was observed. This finding suggests that these infectious agents are not implicated as etiological triggers in the genesis of coronary artery disease but does not preclude active involvement at later stages of the pathophysiological process, such as acceleration of atherosclerosis and acute plaque rupture.

We studied the role of cPLA2 in the pathogenesis of EAE, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. MOG-induced EAE was generated in C57BL/6 mice, which have a naturally occurring mutation for sPLA2. The expression of cPLA2 in the inflammatory EAE lesions was assessed by immunohistochemistry in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord of mice at various clinical grades of EAE. Clinical grading ranged from 0 to 5 (0, normal; 1, flaccid tail; 2, mild hindlimb weakness; 3, severe hindlimb weakness; 4, hindlimb paralysis; 5, hindlimb paralysis and forelimb weakness or moribund).

Ceruloplasmin exists as secreted and glycosylphosphatidylinositiol (GPI)-anchored forms. GPI-Cp is the major form in rat brain. Humans with mutations in the Cp gene (aceruloplasminemia) show marked accumulations of iron in the liver as well as the CNS. The iron accumulation in the CNS is accompanied by neurodegeneration. Mice with null mutations of the Cp gene (Cp-/- ) also show iron deposition and neurodegeneration in the CNS. I have studied the role of ceruloplasmin in cellular iron flux in vitro using astrocytes purified from neonatal Cp-/- and Cp+/+ mice. Iron influx was assessed by incubating astrocyte cultures with [59Fe]ferrous ascorbate in serum-free medium for 12, 24 and 48h.

We show that average toner transfer forces increase as a function of paper filler particle density, through direct coupling of filler to local paper dielectric. Specifically, fluctuations in surface fillers produce "hot spots" in the field near the surface, while those in the bulk have longer reaches. We also show that rapid fluctuations of the dielectric constant produce smaller transfer force variations than longer dielectric constant wavelength variations. We simulate the electrostatic fields in a real cross-section of filled paper and we show that the factors that, affects the toner transfer of the system at a fixed voltage are the thickness variations, surface fillers, bulk filler content and the surface profile variations.

DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (Dnmt1) is the major enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 5-methyl cytosine. Dnmt1 is the predominant de novo and maintenance methyltransferase in mammals. Recently, Dnmt1 has been shown to interact with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), a marker for DNA replication and repair. Here, PCNA is proposed to localize to sites of Dnmt1, suggesting a role in the maintenance and establishment of DNA methylation patterns. Adult male testis was examined and Dnmt1 staining was found in spermatogenesis from the type A spermatogonia to the meiotic pachytene cells at stages II--III where it was down regulated. PCNA staining was also found in the same cell types and was down regulated at stage VIII of spermatogenesis. Dnmt1 and PCNA co-localize in spermatogenesis starting in the mitotic type A, intermediate (In) and type B spermatogonia, and continuing in preleptotene spermatocytes, meiotic leptotene/zygotene and early pachytene spermatocytes. The co-localization rate of PCNA to Dnmt1 positive cells was high. Subcellular examination of isolated cells from day 14 male testis revealed nuclear foci of both Dnmt1 and PCNA in the meiotic cells, and a co-localization of foci in other mitotic cells. Furthermore, PCNA was also found to be present within the nucleus of the primary, secondary and germinal vesicle stage oocytes of the adult female mouse. These results provide evidence supporting a role for the collaboration of PCNA with Dnmt1 at sites of DNA methylation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trasler, J.

Two cases, representing two contrasting kinds of circulation practices, are presented. In the first, DNA samples from families diagnosed with hereditary disorders, which allow researchers a shot at the all-or-nothing game of finding genes, are a protected resource. In the second, the DNA reference panel of the CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain), made up of samples from large multi-generation families, is a widely distributed public resource. The CEPH panel was originally intended for use in genome mapping, but more recently has acted as a technology that aids in the innovation of new techniques and theories. It is argued that the difference in utility (limited or flexible) between these two types of DNA (privately or publicly held) is not found in any inherent property of the samples themselves but rather derives from the extent of the molecule's network of circulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cambrosio, Alberto (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tx07n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fn67c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human gene mapping -- Social aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708z74m"><dcterms:title>Small hearts - grand matters.

I argue that as long as long-term survival rates are variable, and the survivors' quality of life remains uncertain, palliative surgery for HLHS should not be obligatory.

Some of these post-translational modifications, namely phosphorylation, appear to influence the activity of OPN as an inhibitor of nucleation, growth and aggregation of crystals. Therefore in addition to characterizing OPN, an attempt will be made to look at some of the hormones which could potentially play a role in regulating the post-translational processes occurring to this protein.

The research also aimed to develop explanatory models of patient and spouse adjustment. A convenience sample of 130 couples was drawn from the cardiac units of four hospitals in a large metropolitan area. Data were collected during home visits using structured interviews and self-report questionnaires. Patients and wives were interviewed separately. Marital and psychosocial adjustment, psychological distress, sex role attitudes, and selected sociodemographic and control variables were assessed in both members of the couple. Husbands were questioned about their cardiac symptoms whereas wives were asked about their role behaviour, caregiving involvement, and caregiver satisfaction. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlations and hierarchical regression procedures. Correlations indicated that wives' traditionality (attitudes, role behaviour) was directly related to adjustment outcomes in only two instances: worse domestic and marital adjustment in husbands. However, traditionality was found to be associated with the sociodemographic factors (age, education, illness, social support) that were central to adjustment. The results of the regression analyses revealed that the husbands' and the wives' models of adjustment differ. The husband's adjustment is associated primarily with clinical factors while the wife's adjustment is related to both clinical and psychosocial factors. Caregiving enters in the adjustment model of both husbands and wives, but from somewhat different perspectives. Finally, having a previous MI figured prominently in both models and may be a crucial clinical factor for the couple's adjustment. These results suggest important factors to be considered in identifying couples at risk of poor adjustment outcomes and demonstrates the importance of both patient and spouse assessments during the early post-MI recovery period.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Frasure-Smith, Nancy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623f51h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vw046</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Social.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wm19v"><dcterms:title>Trichinella nativa and Trichinella pseudospiralis in the deer mouse,Peromyscus maniculatus : biological characterization of the infections and parasite-associated behavioral pathology of the host</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Poirier, Sylvain Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Effects of infections with sylvatic species Trichinella, T. nativa or T. pseudospiralis, on the diel locomotory activity and locomotory activity pattern of an indigenous rodent host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), were assessed in a familiar environment and during the process of familiarization in a novel environment. Infection with muscle-encapsulating T. nativa severely reduced overall locomotory activity and changed locomotory activity patterns in a dose dependent fashion. In contrast, T. pseudospiralis infection had no such effects on diel locomotory activity. Infection with these nonencapsulating nematodes also changed locomotory activity patterns, but effects were independent of inoculation dose. Trichinella pseudospiralis infection almost completely reversed the locomotory exploration patterns of mice. Both T. nativa- and T. pseudospiralis-infected mice spent more time in shelter than did sham-inoculated conspecifics. Biological characterization of these infections in deer mice revealed striking departures from the conventional course of infection as typified by synanthropic trichinellosis in laboratory mice, and provided further insight into the relationship between the major phases of infection and the observed behavioral changes. Altered behaviors of infected deer mice are discussed in terms of their consequences on host fitness and survival, as well as parasite transmission. The study establishes links between behavioral observations derived from synanthropic and laboratory rodent-T. spiralis host-parasite associations and their sylvatic counterparts. It provides the behavioral underpinnings for future assessments of the role of wild rodents in the transmission of sylvatic trichinelloses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rau, Manfred E.

Reproduction is studied historically, considering its significance as a cultural industry and its characteristics as a mode of communication. The dissertation first engages the theoretical discourse surrounding the novelty of technologies of reproduction of art works at the turn of the century and further pursues an exploration of reproduction within the framework of postmodernity. The phenomenon is studied with special attention to the movement of art works into private spaces. In considering the history of reproduction with regard to works of art in Quebec, four distinct periods have been established: 1936-1950, the novelty of techniques of reproduction; 1950-1970, the era of education; 1970-1980, the discovery of national identity through reproductions of Quebec artists; and 1980-1989: the consolidation of a new market; 1989-1990: the economical boom of the market and the structures get organized. The portrayal of this new cultural industry is traced and its different characteristics considered. Selection of works, styles, marketability and motives for purchase are presented problematically. Thus, in the last chapter, a theory for art reproductions as a silent mode of communication in the private space is explored.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robinson, Gertrude J.

A series of three studies focus on two groups of women: women who perceive a high amount of gender-based discrimination and women who perceive relatively little gender-based discrimination. Unexpectedly, despite significant differences between the two groups in terms of their social indentities as women and their gender ideologies, there were no differences between them with respect to the nature and extent of their work, platonic, and intimate relationships with men. Two psychological mechanisms that may enable a woman to prevent perceptions of intergroup discrimination from impacting upon her intimate relationships are examined: the exceptional case and dissociative mechanisms. Although no support was found for the dissociative mechanism, strong support was found for the exceptional case mechanism. Women who perceive a high amount of discrimination, compared to those who perceived relatively little, are more likely to view their partners as exceptional in terms of their support of women's issues. Moreover, it was demonstrated in Study 3 that the male partners of these women are actually exceptional in terms of their support, as well as their negotiation, of women's issues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taylor, D.

For example, the corrosion resistance of materials is affected by texture. If appropriate textures are introduced in electrodeposited coatings, their corrosion resistance would be enhanced and the coatings will therefore have a longer service time. Texture development during electrodeposition is still poorly understood, and this makes it difficult to control the texture formation during the electrodeposition processes. In order to better understand the texture formation during electrodeposition, extensive theoretical and experimental investigation are undertaken in this thesis. A computer model was proposed to describe texture development. In this model, the microstructure of deposit was represented using a two dimensional triangle lattice. The deposit growth was modelled as previously empty lattice sites are being occupied based on fundamental physical rules. The author proposed that the main driving force for the development of microstructure and texture is the minimization of the system's free energy. This results in texture development, and the minimization of the free energy includes deposit's surface energy and occasionally the magnetic energy. Based on this hypothesis, the texture formation during iron electrodeposition and its variation with the deposition condition were simulated. It was demonstrated that the crystallographic anisotropy of deposit's surface energy plays an important role in the formation of the deposit's fibre texture. The study also indicated that the surface-energy anisotropy could be modified by hydrogen co-deposition and the deposit's texture can be modified by varying the current density, temperature, or pH value of the bath. In addition, the study illustrated that the magnetization energy also plays an important role in texture development during electrodeposition of magnetic materials. When external magnetic fields of sufficient strength are applied during the deposition of magnetic materials, the magnetic fields align grains in such a way that the deposits' fibre textures may transform to non-fibre textures. In order to further justify the minimum-energy texturing mechanism proposed in the model, and to obtain a clear physical picture of the texture formation during electrodeposition, the process of texture development was analyzed using classical thermodynamics. Various experiments were conducted to verify the computer simulation. A positive correlation between the results of the simulation and the experiments were found.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430662x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x81q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hh53z"><dcterms:title>Molecular genetics of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Léon Del Rio, Alfonso</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to determine the molecular basis of neonatal multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) produced by an impairment in holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) activity and the origin of the biotin-responsiveness that characterizes this disease. To determine HCS activity, I developed a peptide substrate and used the biotinylation system of E: coli to determine its properties. C-terminal fragments of the $ alpha$ subunit of human propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC-$ alpha$) were expressed in E. coli and site-directed mutagenesis was used to define the residues required for biotinylation by the bacterial biotin ligase, BirA. These experiments showed that the biotin region of PCC-$ alpha$ can act as an autonomous domain for biotinylation and suggested its use as substrate for human HCS. For the molecular characterization of MCD, I isolated several cDNA clones encoding human HCS by functional complementation of an E. coli mutant with a temperature-sensitive BirA. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of HCS with bacterial biotin ligases allowed the identification of the putative biotin-binding domain of this protein. Mutation analysis of DNA from HCS deficient patients showed that most of the changes in the HCS sequence are clustered in the biotin-binding domain. All the patients tested in this study showed deficiency of HCS activity as determined using the PCC-$ alpha$ peptide as substrate for biotinylation. The biotin-responsiveness was demonstrated by obtaining a stimulation of HCS activity of MCD cells at high biotin concentrations while remaining unstimulated in extracts of normal cells. Together with the mutation studies, these results showed that neonatal MCD is caused by mutations in the biotin binding domain of HCS which reduce the affinity of the enzyme towards biotin. This change in the kinetic properties of HCS results in the inefficient biotinylation of carboxylases at physiological concentrations of biotin.

These efforts have focussed on identifying the homolog of mammalian of mammalian eIF-4F, a complex of three subunits; eIF-4E which binds the mRNA cap, eIF-4A which has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity, and eIF-4$ gamma$, of unknown function. Attempts to clone the genes encoding subunits of eIF-4F have led to the isolation of two novel genes. A molecular screen for members of the DEAD family of RNA helicases that includes eIF-4A led to the isolation of a gene which encodes the putative homolog of a yeast protein involved in ribosome assembly. From a complementation screen for suppressors of mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cap binding subunit, was isolated a Drosophila cDNA encoding a putative ribosomal protein, RpS15a, of the 40S subunit. Further characterization of the mechanism of suppression has shown that overexpression of RpS15a stabilizes the yeast eIF-4E protein suggesting a direct interaction between eIF-4E and the ribosome. Our work has shown that unlike the mammalian system, two cap binding proteins exist in Drosophila. The molecular analysis of cDNA clones encoding Drosophila eIF-4E suggests that the proteins result from alternatively spliced mRNAs expressed from a single gene. The biochemical characterization of Drosophila eIF-4A has shown that eIF-4A is part of a complex similar in size to mammalian eIF-4F but that unlike mammals, one eIF-4A protein is produced from a single gene and is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated eIF-4A is present in oocytes and early embryos but not in later embryos. Phosphorylated eIF-4A accumulates on the 48S initiation complex suggesting that a mechanism involving the post-translational regulation of eIF-4A affects the translation of maternal mRNAs in the oocyte and early embryo.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lasko, Paul F.

Despite an underlying perception of 'separate spheres' reflected in such local notions of work as pangabuhi and pangita, the women pragmatically pursue 'public' and market-related roles and activities for the immediate 'private' requirements for their households' sustenance and reproduction. Nevertheless, they are less discerning, and thus, less active in negotiating their strategic interests as women. The recommendations underscore the socially constructed character of gender divisions so demystifying the myths that sustain them.

Metz et al (1990) adapted the binormal model, used previously for rating data only, for ROC analysis of quantitative diagnostic tests. Their investigation of its performance was limited to data generated from the bi-normal model itself. Part (i) of this thesis describes a broader numerical investigation to assess how it performs in various configurations of non-binormal pairs of distributions, where one or both pair members were mixtures of Gaussian (MG) distributions. We also investigated the effects of sample size and the number of data categories used. Three criteria, bias in estimates of the area under the curve (AUC), bias in estimated true positive fraction (TPF's) at specific false positive fraction (FPF) points, and discrepancies between the estimated and true TPF over the wider portion of the ROC curve, were used to assess the impact of departures from binormality. The bias in the estimates of AUC was small for all configurations studied, no matter what amount of discretization and what sample sizes were used. By the other criteria, the binormal model was robust to departures involving $ {$G, MG--skewed or bimodal$ }$ pairs. The fits were less appropriate at FPF = 0.05 and 0.10 when both pair-members were skewed to the right, but even then the bias in estimates of TPF was less than 0.06. The "semi-parametric" and nonparametric approaches yielded very similar estimates of AUC and of the corresponding sampling variability. Part (ii) develops nonparametric ROC analysis for the situation when pathology and test interpretation data for each patient are K-dimensional. The approach computes K "pseudo-accuracies" for each patient; from these, K U-statistics are derived. One can form a summary index from these K components, as well as the standard error (SE) of this index based on the observed correlations among the pseudo-accuracies. The applicability of a simplified formula for the SE was assessed. The method was also extended to comparisons of two diagnostic systems. The procedures are illustrated using data sets from two clinical studies. The approach can handle the complex structure of multi-signal ROC data; it takes the various inter-correlations into account, and makes efficient use of the data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hanley, J.

(Philip Walter)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis encompasses studies that examine autonomic reactivity and neuropsychological function in preadolescent boys who are at-risk for developing alcoholism and conduct disorder. The literature suggests an association between cognitive impairments and behavioural undercontrol, and that autonomic hyperreactivity may facilitate the use of alcohol to dampen stress. Thus, either factor may contribute to early alcohol use. In the first study, preadolescent sons of male multigenerational alcoholics were found to be cardiovascularly reactive during cognitive stress, and impaired on tests of executive function. Furthermore, reactivity was correlated with anxiety, and executive function deficits with conduct problems. In the second study, reactivity during a laboratory aggression task was monitored and cognitive functions (attentional or memory processes and executive functions) were assessed among aggressive boys rated as disruptive, or anxious-disruptive. During the aggression task, anxious-disruptive boys, unlike disruptive boys or controls, moderated their aggression when their opponent engaged in retaliatory behaviour. Anxious-disruptive boys were more highly aroused throughout the task, and the neuropsychological assessment found they were impaired on tests of executive function, independent of attention and memory. In the third study, anxious-disruptive boys exhibited greater cardiovascular, electrodermal, and muscle tension reactivity than disruptive or control boys during cognitive stress, while disruptive boys were electrodermally underaroused. These studies suggest it is possible to delineate specific neuropsychological profiles among at-risk youth, using either a behavioural genetics model, or selecting for personality traits. There were consistent autonomic reactivity patterns across tasks among groups defined by similar behavioural profiles.
