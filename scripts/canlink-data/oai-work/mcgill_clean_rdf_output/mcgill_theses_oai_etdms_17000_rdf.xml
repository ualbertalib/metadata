These are surreptitious interrogations whereby the police inject an undercover state agent into the detention environment with the object of eliciting inculpatory statements from an accused. This thesis examines and compares the strengths and weaknesses of Canadian and United States judicial approaches to cell-plant interrogations, and their respective applications of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights. In both countries, an accused can seek to have their incriminating statements excluded from evidence where they persuade the court that such statements were elicited by a state agent. Despite the seemingly similar language of their legal tests, Canadian and U.S. jurists define state agency and elicitation in very different ways leading potentially to very dissimilar outcomes based on the same factual circumstances.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p3983.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rj02s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Confession (Law) -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Police questioning -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Confession (Law) -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Police questioning -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n700p"><dcterms:title>Le port de signes religieux dans les établissements publics d'enseignement québécois et français : une liberté, deux modèles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hardy-Dussault, Marianne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study intends to contribute to the work undertaken in Quebec and in France on religious pluralism in the public sphere. The first section examines the common approach adopted by both States which allowed students to wear religious symbols in public schools. We then highlight the divergent approaches that emerged in 2004 when the French legislature prohibited almost entirely this practice. The second section assesses the capacity of Quebec's and France's legal and political approaches to ensure social cohesion, to protect freedom of religion, the right to equality as well as the rights of the internal minorities who are pressured and constrained by their surroundings. Some considerations related to French universalism might be used to counterbalance the negative effects of the differentialist approach. Nevertheless, this comparative study leads us to conclude that, in Quebec, differentialism remains the path to be followed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172182c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n700p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religion in the public schools -- France.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and state -- France.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religious pluralism -- France.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion in the public schools -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religious pluralism -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and state -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246w59s"><dcterms:title>The extraterritorial dimension of patent law systems /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Handa, Rish.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses the extraterritorial dimension of patent systems in light of recent judicial trends, ending with the United States Supreme Court's landmark 2007 ruling in AT&amp;T v.

The general conclusions are that, in the modern age, patent rights need to be extended beyond the domestic jurisdiction, and that the appropriate manner for nations to achieve this extension is not unilaterally but through bilateral and multilateral treaties.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3658727.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246w59s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Patent suits -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patent laws and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exterritoriality.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patent laws and legislation -- United States.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atb09j8978"><dcterms:title>L'extension contractuelle du droit d'auteur par le biais de licences d'utilisation : analyse de la situation canadienne</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ferron, Christian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Our study pertains to the contractual overridability of copyright by the use of end user licence agreements.

Considerable improvements in aircraft emissions efficiencies are expected through technological improvements, air traffic management, and managerial strategies. But global demand for air travel is increasing at an even faster rate. Mostly for political reasons, aviation has been left behind in international efforts to tackle climate change. However, increasing pressure is on the industry for immediate action, thus making further delays impossible. This thesis is an attempt to determine the best possible course of action for the industry. To this end, it begins by assessing contemporary understanding of aviation's impact on the environment, and provides an overview of efforts being made toward reducing aircraft emissions. It then examines various policymaking tools available to best address the issue, concluding with an emissions trading system. Finally, design characteristics of such a system are suggested, and used to provide an analysis of the European attempt to include aviation into its own emissions trading system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v216b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860b463</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Emissions trading.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental policy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A765374645"><dcterms:title>The US and EC antitrust control of transatlantic airline alliances /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Baronnat, Emilie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The international civil aviation system is currently going through a transitional phase. Deregulation and liberalization of air transport services and privatisation of certain airlines have contributed to the modification of the aviation landscape. In this context, airline alliances play a crucial role. Both the US and EC authorities have been supportive of airline alliances because they believe that alliances have the potential to increase competition and to provide the consumers with benefits. The first part of this thesis intends to provide economic and historical background to highlight the reasons for the multiplication of alliances, as well as the political and economic circumstances under which competition authorities assess alliances. The second part of this thesis is meant to determine which legal regime is applied to transatlantic alliances, and whether alliances are assessed like agreements among companies in any other business sector. The third part focuses more specifically on the antitrust control of the Sky Team alliance which occurs in the context of the EU/US Open skies agreement.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g380d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765374645</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Restraint of trade -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Restraint of trade -- European Union countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antitrust law -- European Union countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- European Union countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antitrust law -- United States.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apn89db08d"><dcterms:title>Passengers' protection and rights in international civil aviation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Balasubramaniam, Usha.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Air transport is of critical importance to move passengers and cargo from one place to another on a global scale. Subsistence, sustenance, growth and profitability of the air transport industry are dependent on the demand for transport from passengers and cargo as the main sources of revenue of the airline industry. The forces of globalization and liberalization, coupled with the very rapid development of low-cost operators, have tempered the growth and profitability of the aviation industry whilst, at the same time, greatly increasing the consumer (passenger and air freight user) advantages in terms of expanding the gamut of their choices, better quality and lower prices. The ever-expanding markets in the Asia and Pacific region hold great promise for a rapid growth of the aviation industry in years to come. Currently, the international civil aviation community is faced with many challenges evolving from globalization, liberalization of economic regulations, privatization of airlines and airports, commercialization of government services providers, increasing environmental controls, and the emerge of new technologies. To deal effectively with these challenges and issues will require a high level of cooperation among civil aviation authorities, airlines, airports, and providers of air services and products. Airlines under the new free trade regimes have been exposed to many changes and although GATS has an important role to play in this important field, the convergence of economic, safety, security and environmental issues makes a strong case for keeping regulation in these critical issues under the ICAO aviation umbrella. As air transport experiences structural, policy and regulatory environment changes, in the era of free trade it would be interesting to critically examine the impact of the aforementioned changes on the rights and protection of passengers. In this relation, it becomes very important to review the international, regional, and national efforts which have been made to enhance consumer protection and also have an important bearing on the rights of airline passengers. The thesis also addresses some emerging, non-traditional consumer protection issues, such as health, racial discrimination and the rights of disabled passengers. In view of the above, the well-developed consumer protection regimes in the United States and the European Union (EU) would be examined in depth and the results of its analysis would be used to develop a suitable model airline passenger protection in the rapidly expending economies of the Asia and Pacific Region.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr09r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89db08d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Security measures.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consumer protection.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Passenger traffic.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airline passenger security screening.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airlines -- Customer services.</dc:subject><dc:subject>People with disabilities -- Transportation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>People with disabilities -- Travel.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cf50x"><dcterms:title>A novel input device for thumb control /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zaborowski, Philippe S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis project consists of developing a hand-held, one-thumb input device small enough to be placed on gestural controllers and providing performers with a simple way to select between multiple options with few movements of a thumb. Most commercial input devices for the thumb make the assumption that buttons are the de facto standard. However, buttons are not always the best solution especially where space is very limited. This project explores a new approach to input design by analyzing the thumb's movements and designing a suitable input device that can track them. The design progression from the first to the last prototype is presented in great detail. The final prototype is compared to other existing one-thumb input devices used in gestural controllers and mobile computing. The shortcomings of each one-thumb input method is described with the final prototype presented as a possible solution in each case.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q7919.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cf50x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music and technology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer input-output equipment.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d3566"><dcterms:title>Sources of knowledge acquisition : perspectives of the high school teachercoach</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Laurie M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate sources of knowledge acquisition of high school team sport coaches. Six teacher/coaches were interviewed using a semi-structured open-ended interview format. Cote, Salmela, and Russell's (1995) guidelines were used to inductively analyze and interpret the data. Results revealed three higher-order categories: (a) sources of knowledge acquisition, which highlighted the different ways coaches acquired their knowledge, including their physical education teacher training, observations and interactions with other coaches, as well as clinics and books; (b) personal and contextual factors, which included the internal and external factors influencing coaches' motivation and commitment to coach, including the challenges faced when teaching and/or coaching; (c) coaching tasks and duties which highlighted coaches' interactions with athletes, as well as their approach to training and competition. Interestingly, many of the findings in the current study were similar to those highlighted in previous studies pertaining to elite coach development, regardless of their undergraduate physical education teacher education (PETE) program or the fact that this sample was coaching high school athletes. However, results provided evidence to support the relative importance of practical coaching experience and interactions with other coaches as central in the development of these coaches. From a practical perspective, these findings could potentially enhance the quality and standard of formal coach education and PETE programs by incorporating more practical elements into the training of coaches and teacher/coaches.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dz92w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d3566</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical education teachers -- Training of.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax059cc02d"><dcterms:title>Pure mind, pure land : a brief study of modern Chinese pure land thought and movements</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wei, Tao, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study aims to examine the modern Chinese Pure Land thought and movements, which are part of the general context of reforms that involved the whole Chinese Buddhist community starting from the beginning of the 20th century. In this study, I examine (1) the socio-political context of modern China when Chinese Buddhist communities began to re-think their traditions and reform monastic education, under the influence of socio-political chaos and Western culture; (2) Ven. Yinguang's (1861--1940) syncretism of Pure Land thought with Confucian ethical teachings, which promoted a more secular and lay movement in response to Western influence; (3) Ven. Yinshun's (1906--2005) critical Pure Land thought which went back to early Indian Buddhism to clarify some teachings which had been corrupted during the transmission of Buddhism to China; (4) modern movements influenced by their thought. According to Robert Bellah, there are two kinds of response of Asian traditional elites to modernization: neotraditionalism and reformism. Based upon my analysis of modern Chinese Pure Land thought and movements, I argue that this dichotomy is not mutually exclusive; the two categories can overlap. Yinguang and Yinshun were both neotraditionalist and reformist.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tq619.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059cc02d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pure Land Buddhism -- China.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az603r219q"><dcterms:title>In the eye of the storm : Saudi Aramco and the corporate gated suburban community phenomenon</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Waheed, Hajra.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Dhahran, Saudi Arabia is home to the largest transnational oil corporation and gated suburban residential compound in the world.

Although Christian symbols were common, fascist symbols among the mass-produced images support the idea that the Vichy regime was not merely authoritarian, but parafascist.

On the one hand, a complete environment is proposed to prepare Windows to incorporate transparently any checkpoint-recovery implementation whose architecture respects a simple contract of reusability. The environment allows any application to use some checkpoint-recovery services with only the default process creation mechanisms offered by Windows. Moreover, it handles automatically the recovery of the processes in case of a crash and requires no human intervention in most scenarios. On the other hand, an optimization module is proposed to minimize the checkpointing time and to slow its degradation in situations of high checkpoint-recovery demands. The results show an excellent control of the checkpoint cost degradation and sometimes the complete absence of the penalty associated with concurrent checkpoint requests.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89db09p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m758h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Data recovery (Computer science)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fault-tolerant computing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hp09v"><dcterms:title>Macromodeling and simulation of linear components characterized by measured parameters</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Mingyang, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recently, microelectronics designs have reached extremely high operating frequencies as well as very small die and package sizes. This has made signal integrity an important bottleneck in the design process, and resulted in the inclusion of signal integrity simulation in the computer aided design flow. However, such simulations are often difficult because in many cases it is impossible to derive analytical models for certain passive elements, and the only available data are frequency-domain measurements or full-wave simulations. Furthermore, at such high frequencies these components are distributed in nature and require a large number of poles to be properly characterized. Simple lumped equivalent circuits are therefore difficult to obtain, and more systematic approaches are required. In this thesis we study the Vector Fitting techniques for obtaining such equivalent model and propose a more streamlined approach for preserving passivity while maintaining accuracy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128f64h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp09v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Signal processing -- Digital techniques -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Application-specific integrated circuits -- Design and construction -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interconnects (Integrated circuit technology) -- Design and construction -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Integrated circuits -- Very large scale integration -- Design and construction -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kp29j"><dcterms:title>Fast simulation of cascading outages with islanding</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zaag, Nader.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis proposes an efficient power system simulator to estimate the automatic sequence of events that follow a fault contingency leading to islanding and cascading outages. The simulator is based on a quasi-steady state model that includes island identification, under-frequency load shedding, over-frequency generator tripping, and island load flow. Contingencies can include the outage of generators, loads, or transmission lines. Often times, a fault of one or two of these power system elements can lead to many cascaded outages and system islanding. The simulator utilizes an innovative method that analyzes the null space of the DC load flow susceptance matrix to identify system islands after each disturbance. Once system islands have been determined, each island power imbalance is calculated and the simulator determines based on the power imbalance in each island whether any load shedding, generator tripping, or primary frequency regulation is required. Once these corrective actions are completed each island will either have been found to balance power or will experience blackout. In the islands that have balanced power, a load flow is computed to see if all line flow constraints are satisfied. Any lines with flow constraint violations are faulted, and the iterative process is repeated under all line flow constraints are satisfied. The results demonstrate the ability of the simulator to quickly and efficiently predict a system's response to contingencies leading to cascading outages and islanding. Simulations were conducted on a 10-bus 13-line network, a 24-bus 38-line network, and a 72-bus 119-line network. This thesis also examined the highly complex mixed-integer linear problem of identifying the optimum initial outage in the sense that it would cause the maximum amount of load shedding through islanding. The results on a three-line, three-bus test properly identified the line whose initial outage caused overflows leading to system separation and maximum loss of load.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dt11q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kp29j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electric power failures -- Computer simulation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3197xq291"><dcterms:title>Semi-analytical and numerical modeling of microsegregation for solidifying metallic alloys</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Uddin, Salah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study, two semi-analytical models of microsegregation were developed to predict the concentration fields of solute in the liquid and solid regions for dendritic solidification of binary metallic alloys. Both models assume that the growing dendrites are cylindrical in shape. This assumption is more realistic compared to the common assumptions of plate-like dendrites that most of the earlier researchers employed in their microsegregation modeling study. The solute redistribution profile, in the developing solid layer, necessary to determine the back diffusion parameter was derived from Fick's second law for the model without coarsening. The application of this parameter in a wide range of conditions and the use of its basic form in the model with coarsening was verified. The concept of coordinate transformation and enhancement of back-diffusion Fourier number were used in deriving the model which took into account the coarsening of dendrites. The models are then extended to deal with rapid solidification, peritectic transformations and multi-component systems and the results were compared with relevant experimental data. A good agreement between the model predictions and experimental results was found. The second part of this study was focused on developing a fully numerical microsegregation model. The numerical model built upon a previously proposed phase change model which relied upon a coordinate transformation technique. The model was extended to deal with moving boundaries with solute diffusion. A suitable computational procedure was developed to solve the model equations which are strongly coupled to each other. To verify the accuracy of the present algorithm with regard to the capability of tracking the moving interfaces, analytical solution of the Stefan problem was used for verification purposes. A good agreement between the model predictions and the analytical solution was found. Evolution of concentration fields during solidification was calculated in the growing solid as well as in the shrinking liquid regions for rectangular, cylindrical and spherical dendrite geometries. The effects of various cooling conditions and relevant parametric values on microsegregation were analyzed and discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p248.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xq291</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alloys -- Defects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metal castings -- Defects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dendritic crystals.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dz935"><dcterms:title>Aerodynamic shape optimization via control theory of helicopter rotor blades using a non-linear frequency domain approach</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tatossian, Charles A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study presents a discrete adjoint-based aerodynamic optimization algorithm for helicopter rotor blades in hover and forward flight using a Non-Linear Frequency Domain approach.

The research presents the complete formulation of the time dependent optimal design problem. The approach is firstly demonstrated for the redesign of a NACA 0007 and a NACA 23012 helicopter rotor blade section in forward flight.

A thin-walled tube filled with helium surrounded by explosives acts as a driver for the launcher. Implosion of the tube drives a strong shock that reflects back and forth between the projectile and the implosion pinch, generating very high temperatures and pressures. Simple analytic models were used to approximate the performance of the pump tube and its use as a driver for a launcher. Experiments to evaluate the implosion dynamics and performance of the pump tube were carried out, and implosion-driven launcher experiments demonstrated muzzle velocities above 4 km/s with 5-mm-diameter aluminum projectiles. Projectile integrity was verified by high-speed photography. Disagreement of experimental data with the analytical models of performance is mostly due to failure to seal the chamber of the launcher, resulting in loss of driver gas, and pump tube expansion, which weakens the precursor shock.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82kc055.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77st63m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hypervelocity guns -- Design and construction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shock tubes -- Design and construction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xn25s"><dcterms:title>Conductive polymer coating for corrosion protection of steel</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Soh, Tedric.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is an increasing interest in exploring the use of conductive polymers for protecting metals from corrosion.

The PPV coating is deposited by a homemade spinning coater. The effect of substrate microstructure and surface treatment on PPV coating morphology is investigated. The morphology and surface roughness of the coating are measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The PPV coating thickness and substrate surface roughness are measured by profilometer. Open Circuit Potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear potentiodynamic voltammetry (Tafel) and optical microscopy were used to characterize the structure and properties of the coatings. The correlation between the coating thickness, the surface treatment of the steel substrate prior to coating, and the corrosion behaviour of PPV coated steel was investigated.

Zinc Oxide (ZnO) films were also deposited onto soda lime glass for electrical measurements. Sheet resistance measurements were performed with a four-point-probe on the glass samples. Values for samples evacuated for 14 hours prior to deposition increased from 7.9 to 10.17 and 11.5 O/&amp;squ; for 40 W, 120 and 160 W in RF power respectively. In contrast, those evacuated for 2 hours started with a higher value of 22.5 O/&amp;squ;, and decreased down to 7.6 and 5.8 O/&amp;squ;. Vacuum annealing was performed for both the glass and the Si samples. Current-voltage measurements were performed on the ZnO/Si junctions in the dark and under illumination. Parameters such as open-circuit voltage, Voc; short-circuit current, Isc; fill factor, FF; and efficiency, eta were determined. A maximum efficiency of 0.25% among all samples was produced, with an I sc of 2.16 mA, Voc of 0.31V and a FF of 0.37. This was a sample fabricated at an RF power of 80 W. Efficiency was found to decline with vacuum annealing. Furthermore, interfacial state density calculated based on capacitance-voltage measurements showed an increase in the value with vacuum annealing. The results found suggest that the interface states may be due to an interdiffusion of atoms, possibly those of Zn into the Si surface. The Electron Beam Induced Current (EBIC) method was used to determine diffusion length to be at a value ~40--80 mum and therefore a minority carrier lifetime calculated of 3 musec. It was also used to determine the surface recombination velocity (SRV) of the fractured surface of the Si bulk from the fabricated solar cells. An SRV of ~500 cm/sec was determined from the fractured Si surface, at a point located at 30 and 20 mum away from the junction interface.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b472m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b235b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Silicon solar cells -- Design and construction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc oxide thin films.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heterojunctions -- Design and construction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sputtering (Physics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Solar cells -- Design and construction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js50j"><dcterms:title>Studies on bisphosphonate elution from orthopaedic implants</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roberts, Jacintha.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a 6-week rat model it was demonstrated that a small dose of peri-implant zoledronic acid (ZA) increased local bone formation 3-fold compared with controls.

It has been an important issue to come up with environment friendly electric power sources to reduce pollution caused by combustion engines of automotive systems. Even though conventional battery systems and fuel cells supply high energy, they lack the high specific power that would be required for hybrid power sources. The ECs can fill the gap between conventional capacitors and batteries. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, attracted great attention in recent years for their unique properties, such as mesoporous character, excellent conductivity, moderate to high specific surface area as well as chemical and mechanical stability. These properties of CNTs make them useful in a wide of range applications including electrode materials for EC applications. The preparation of CNT electrodes is accomplished by either pasting them onto metallic current collectors with the use of binder materials such as PVDF or growing them from deposited metal nanoparticles on substrates such as graphite paper. The deposition of metal nanoparticles is achieved via sputtering techniques or lengthy electrochemical deposition methods. The aim of this research was to simplify the preparation step by growing CNTs directly on metallic substrates and to study the relationship between surface area and electrochemical capacitance of CNTs. CNTs were produced on metal-alloy grids via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of acetylene (C2H2). The physical characterization of the samples was achieved by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman spectroscopy and Single point BET surface area. The electrochemical performance of the samples was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three electrode electrochemical cell with 1M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution as the electrolyte.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z1727.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q990x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electrochemical apparatus.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanotubes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electrolytic capacitors.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
