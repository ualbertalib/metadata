Nramp1 (Slc11a1) is expressed in phagocytic cells and restricts replication of intracellular pathogens by removing divalent metals from the phagolysosome. Nramp2 (DMT1, Slc11a2) mediates uptake of dietary iron in the duodenum and aids in the acquisition of transferrin-associated iron in many cell types. The first half of this thesis explores structure-function relationships. In Chapter 2, the role of charged amino acids within the membrane-spanning segments of Nramp2 was examined by site-specific mutagenesis. These studies identified several invariant charged residues essential for metal transport and pH regulation of activity. In Chapters 3 and 4, the effects of two NRAMP2 mutations found in human patients suffering from severe congenital hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload were characterized in vitro. The first mutation was an E399D substitution in a region known as the "conserved transport motif" of the protein. The second mutation was an R416C substitution at an invariant residue in TM9. The effects of both mutations on expression, activity, and subcellular targeting were characterized. In both cases, a quantitative reduction in Nramp2 expression was found to be the cause of microcytic anemia and iron overload in the patients. The second half of this thesis focuses on the subcellular targeting of Nramp1 and 2. In Chapter 5, cytoplasmic signal(s) in Nramp2 responsible for its subcellular targeting/internalization from the plasma membrane were studied. This work led to the identification of a tyrosine-based motif in the carboxyl terminus of Nramp2 (YLLNT555-559) critical for the transporter's internalization from the cell surface and its recycling back to the plasma membrane. Chapter 6 explored differences in trafficking between two splicing isoforms of Nramp2 and found that one isoform (isoform 1) possessed differences in internalization/recycling which enabeled it to become enriched at the plasma membrane. In Chapter 7, the subcellular trafficking properties of Nramp1, including cytoplasmic sequences responsible for targeting to lysosomes, were investigated by using chimeric Nramp1/Nramp2 proteins. This work led to the identification of a tyrosine-based motif (YGSI15-18) in the amino terminus of Nramp1 that functions as a lysosomal targeting signal.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44ps03g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827h16n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752m98k"><dcterms:title>Cognitive avoidance of health threats</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Klein, Rupert G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous researchers have suggested that cognitive avoidance occurs for stimuli describing social threats but not for stimuli describing physical threats. The present research examined whether individuals can cognitively avoid physically threatening stimuli, such as the words 'HIV' or 'cancer'. Three studies investigated (a) personality characteristics that predict cognitive avoidance of physically threatening stimuli, (b) whether the stimuli have to be relevant to the avoider and (c) circumstances that may disrupt the avoidance mechanism. Study 1 was an exploratory study examining the personality characteristics that predict avoidance of thoughts concerning physical threats, specifically, sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The study found that lower sexual self-efficacy and less assertiveness predicted greater self-reported avoidance of thoughts concerning STIs. The more participants tended to avoid thoughts concerning STIs the less likely they were to discuss safer sex practices with their partner and the less consistent they were in their condom use. The findings suggest that individuals can avoid thoughts of physical threats (i.e., STIs) and that this avoidance can have consequences such as engaging in riskier sexual behaviours (i.e., not consistently using condoms). In study 2, participants were presented threatening words on a computerized task (the emotional Stroop task) to assess if they would automatically attend to or avoid physically threatening words. Dispositionally avoidant participants (participants low in anxiety and high in repressive defensiveness) avoided physically threatening words but only if they were perceived to be self-relevant, otherwise the avoidance mechanism was not elicited. Study 3 examined if the avoidance of physical threats may be disrupted when there is a temporary reduction in dopamine, such as when cigarette smokers abstain from smoking. Results showed that non-abstaining smokers with an avoidant disposition superficially processed (avoided) threatening words related to smoking on an emotional Stroop task. Abstainers however did not demonstrate this superficial processing suggesting that the avoidance mechanism was disrupted. The three studies demonstrate that individuals avoid physical threats if they perceive them to be self-relevant and that this avoidance mechanism can be disrupted by a temporary reduction in dopamine.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s6634.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752m98k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Risk-taking (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tt40x"><dcterms:title>Orienting of visual attention among persons with autism spectrum disorders : reading versus responding to symbolic cues</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Landry, Oriane.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) appear to be slower to interpret the meaning of symbolic cues. This could be because they are slower to read the symbolic cue, or because they are slower to select a response to the symbolic cue. Groups of participants with autism (n=11), participants with Asperger syndrome (n=9), and typically developing children (n=16) completed four forced-choice reaction time tasks to examine whether persons with ASD are slower to process the symbolic cue or slower to prepare a response to the cue. The participants completed two control conditions and two orienting conditions using non-predictive central arrow cues. In the Target and Cue conditions, participants gave a speeded response to the appearance of either a target (x) or a central arrow. In the Variable Cue Exposure (VCE) condition, the exposure time to the cue varied (100, 300, 600, or 1000 ms) and was followed by a 100 ms blank screen before the presentation of the target. In the Constant Cue Exposure (CCE) condition, all cues were presented for 100 ms and were followed by blank screens that varied in presentation length (100, 300, 600, or 1000 ms) before the presentation of the target. The results indicated that each group showed a unique pattern of responding. In both the Target and Cue conditions, participants with autism were slower than both Asperger syndrome and typically developing children. In both the VCE and CCE conditions, behavioural effects of the cue were found for participants with autism at longer SOAs than for Asperger syndrome, and at longer SOAs for Asperger syndrome than for typically developing children. These findings support the notion that persons with ASDs are impaired in their preparation of responses as opposed to impaired in reading the meaning of the cue. Further, both the ASD groups showed stronger facilitation effects at longer SOAs than typically developing children, indicating that they were less able to use cue predictability to mediate responding. The differences found between autism and Asperger syndrome are discussed in terms of developmental and clinical distinctions between the groups, and implications for theory and research design.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qp040.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tt40x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Attention.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual perception.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cf92f"><dcterms:title>Satisfied-user based capacity analysis in wideband and multi-carrier CDMA cellular networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Elshabrawy, Tallal Osama.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Future generations of cellular networks envision unprecedented growth in capacity requirements essential to handle the tremendous evolution of multimedia services. Code division multiple access (CDMA) has been one of the premium candidates to lead the charge in supporting packetized multimedia traffic within mobile cellular networks. This dissertation presents an analytical framework to derive system capacity of CDMA-based cellular networks on the basis of the satisfied-user criteria recommended by universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS). The proposed criteria stretch beyond system-level outage probability that has been commonly adopted in the CDMA literature and proceed to focus on evaluating the percentage of outage during the lifetime of each individual session. Special emphasis is devoted for the downlink as it is considered to be the limiting direction in future cellular systems. The foundation of the proposed analysis is established by recognizing one of the main features of wireless communication channels. Large-scale path-loss depicts measurable/controllable parameters that exhibit high correlations over the scale of consecutive frames. On the other hand, small-scale fading represents fast fluctuations that cannot be reliably predicted. Accordingly, the devised analysis relates the satisfied-user probability to the correlated outage behavior of small-scale fading channels with respect to an effective protection margin set over the large scale. The analytical platform is expanded for capacity evaluation of multi-carrier CDMA (MCCDMA). Multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) has recently emerged as an extremely promising technology to support higher system capacities for its combined advantages of multi-carrier modulation techniques and CDMA in a frequency-selective fading environment. The analytical approach leads to the proposal of power allocation and channel assignment strategies that share the objective of diminishing the effects of multiple access interference (MAI) and increasing system capacity. In particular, an effective margin-based power control operating over the large-scale is introduced for speech services. The base stations target an effective protection margin and avoid allocating un-necessary power to compensate for intra-cell interference that shares the same small-scale fading paths as the target signal. Moreover, a channel assignment strategy based on large-scale interference measurements is used to investigate the migration from MC-CDMA to Grouped MC-CDMA systems. Capacity analysis of Grouped MC-CDMA systems triggers the development of an iterative simulation platform to incorporate the effects of coupling and dependencies of channel assignments and power allocations across base stations of the cellular network.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bq70c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cf92f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf2689505"><dcterms:title>Proteomic characterization of stress responses activated upon ischemia and reperfusion during human liver transplantation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Emadali, Anouk.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During liver transplantation, donor organs experience some degree of cold ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). The magnitude of this preservation injury is critical for transplantation outcome since it influences the allograft early function. However, the multifactorial and complex cellular response initiated upon IRI remains unclear. Herein, we used liver biopsies collected during the early phases of organ procurement and transplantation to characterize the global patterns of protein expression and phosphorylation in order to identify new regulatory mechanisms involved in ischemia-induced graft damage. First, a targeted functional proteomic approach, which combined protein expression profiling and mass spectrometry phosphoproteins analysis, allowed us to identify IQGAP1, a Cdc42/Rac1 effector, as a potential regulator of IRI-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling and the related bile canaliculi (BC) loss of integrity. We demonstrated that IQGAP1 expression and localization are affected upon IRI and related to actin reorganization. Furthermore, using an IRI model in hepatoma cells, we showed that IQGAP1 silencing decreases the basal level of actin polymerisation at BC periphery, reflecting a defect in BC structure, coincident with a reduced cellular resistance to IRI. Our proteomic data also led us to postulate that IRI-induced cellular damages may cause alterations of the secretory pathway, suggesting the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) specific stress responses. Using semi quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot with phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that the IRE-1 pathway, leading to both adaptive and pro-apoptotic responses, is first activated upon early ischemia and, in a second phase, upon early reperfusion. In contrast, the PERK pathway, leading to inhibition of capdependent translation, is mainly activated upon reperfusion, restrictively in sinusoidal endothelial cells, and could contribute to the exagerated sensitivity of this liver cell type to IRI. In summary, our work allowed to gain new mechanistic insights in the global regulation of the cellular response to IRI, and also led to the identification of new molecular mechanisms specifically involved in mediating liver resistance to IRI. First, IQGAP1, as a regulator of BC structure could be participate in maintaining a proper bile secretion, essential for graft post-transplant recovery. Then, the balance between pro-adaptive and pro-apoptotic responses triggered in the ER might, as well, influence liver secretory functions and, as a consequence, condition liver transplantation outcomes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860c07m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf2689505</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xk00s"><dcterms:title>Burst-mode clock and data recovery circuits for optical multiaccess networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Faucher, Julien.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optical multiaccess networks, and more specifically passive optical networks (PONS), can provide high bandwidth to the end user by extending the fiber into the local access network (fiber-to-the-home, -building, -curb). In a PON, multiple users share the fiber infrastructure in a point-to-multipoint (P2MP) network topology. This creates new challenges for the design of receiver front-ends and clock and data recovery circuits (CDRs). Moreover, the challenges depend on the multiple access method that is used to share the bandwidth among users. This thesis presents novel burst-mode CDR circuits for PONs and multiaccess networks. The two access methods considered are optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA). We designed the first standalone OCDMA receiver with multiple access interference rejection, CDR, and forward error correction (FEC). The receiver supports a bit rate and a chip rate of 155.52 and 1244.16 Mb/s, respectively. We performed BER measurements in a 2D lambda-t OCDMA network using the recovered clock. By not using a global clock, we demonstrated an OCDMA network with the receiver completely isolated from the transmitters. We measured a negligible power penalty when using the recovered clock as opposed to the global clock. With FEC, we measured a coding gain of approximately 3 dB at a BER of 10 -9. We used the coding gain to more than double the number of supported users (5 compared to 2). These experiments, together with the demonstration of a standalone OCDMA receiver, give weight to the argument that OCDMA could provide an alternative to TDMA in PONs. We also designed two burst-mode CDRs for TDMA PONS. The common goal for both CDRs was to achieve fast phase acquisition to minimize the physical layer overhead for phase recovery. The first design is a 1244.16 Mb/s broadband CDR. We reduced the settling time of the CDR by increasing its bandwidth. We confirmed experimentally the trade off between settling time and jitter. We solved this tradeoff by designing a 622/1244 Mb/s burst-mode clock phase aligner (BM-CPA) based on 2x over sampling. The BM-CPA provides instantaneous phase acquisition (0 bit), much improved jitter characteristics, and meets the specifications of GPON Recommendation G.984.2. Finally, we designed a burst-mode test solution that allowed us to measure the phase acquisition time of CDRs down to an accuracy of one bit.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd95m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xk00s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053m543"><dcterms:title>Regulation of the endocytic adaptor proteins [beta] arrestin and AP-2 during clathrin-mediated internalization of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fessart, Delphine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell-surface receptors. They transduce the signals mediated by a diverse range of signalling molecules, including ions, amines, and peptides, as well as photons, to mediate intracellular functions. These receptors play a fundamental role in many physiological responses such as cardiovascular functions. To remain responsive to their environment, cells must find a way to rapidly desensitize and resensitize their activated GPCRs. Desensitization of receptors, for instance, involves the phosphorylation of receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRKs) followed by the recruitment of betaarrestin. This interferes with the binding of the G protein (the signalling effector). betaarrestin then targets the receptors to the clathrin endocytosis pathway, and serves as an adaptor linking receptors to other signalling pathways. Internalization of receptors serves not only to remove desensitized receptors from the plasma membrane, but also to engage receptors in the resensitization pathway. The internalization of Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is controversial and poorly described. Therefore, our laboratory studies the mechanisms behind AT1R internalization. The agonist-induced internalization of AT1R begins with the formation of a complex including betaarrestin, the clathrin adaptor AP-2, and the tyrosine protein kinase, c-Src. In turn, this c-Src recruitment regulates the clathrin-mediated internalization of AT1R by controlling the formation of endocytic complexes during endocytosis. Indeed, the recruitment of c-Src is involved in the dissociation of AP-2 during receptor internalization. Based on our evidence that AP-2 and c-Src can be found in the same complex, we suggested that AP-2 could be phosphorylated by c-Src. Indeed, we found that Ang II induced the c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of AP-2 (beta2-adaptin). We were able to map one of the tyrosines in beta2-adaptin and assess its role in regulating the binding of its principal partner: betaarrestin. The phosphorylation state of beta2-adaptin dictates its association profile with betaarrestin: when phosphorylated it reduces its binding to betaarrestin. Finally, we proposed a model for AT1R internalization. Overall, these studies are significant because they allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanism that regulates the initial steps of clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis of AT1R.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t836.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053m543</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257j90w"><dcterms:title>Navigating two worlds : culture and cultural adaptation of immigrant and refugee youth in a Quebec (Canadian) educational context</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Baffoe, Michael.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The last ten years has witnessed the inflow of a large number of new immigrant and refugee children, many from Africa, into Canada. These new immigrants and displaced persons (refugees) undergo a cycle of adaptation in a new society; a process that takes much longer time than the host society allows them. Most children of refugees and new immigrants enter the school system few months after their arrival in Canada when they have barely had the time to adapt to their new socio-cultural environment. However, little research has been done on the cultural adaptation of African immigrant and refugee youth in the Canadian educational system. This study examined the social integration and educational experiences of teenage immigrant and refugee youth mainly from minority backgrounds in their first few years of contacts with the Quebec educational system. Using a qualitative methodology, interviews were conducted with ten youth, eight parents, four community leaders, two social service reception center workers and a school administrator together with information from focus group discussions with a number of youth and parents from the same backgrounds. The cultural and acculturating patterns that emerged in the context of school, family, peers, and community as well as the way in which the respondents negotiate, create, and maintain their identities were examined. The findings showed that culture and cultural adaptation play very significant roles in the social and educational integration of immigrant and refugee children in Canadian society. They further pointed to how acculturation difficulties have led to many of these children feeling less motivated to study, losing interest in education, or dropping out of the school system altogether. Implications of this research for curriculum development in education and social work practice with this population group are offered. These include the need for social service professionals and educators working with refugee youth to have an understanding of the different needs and history or cultural context of the country of origin of the refugees. Others are the need for teachers to be culturally responsive and competent as they deal with increasingly diverse student populations. Also of equal importance for policy formulators in the educational field is the need for curriculum that is designed to address the distinctive challenges of acculturation that these new arrivals face especially at the High School levels in Quebec. Recommendations are made for directions for future research in the social work and education fields including structuring a longitudinal study to follow these youth participants over a period of time to examine the evolution of their ethnic identity, bicultural development, cultural values, their educational attainment and the challenges they face as adults. Furthermore, a nationwide or an inter-provincial study with similar population groups (with language as a significant variable) would provide a broader understanding of the integration issues associated with this population group.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b766s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257j90w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Immigrants -- Education -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Refugees -- Education -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acculturation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1v53k227f"><dcterms:title>Isoprostanes and lysophosphatidic acid : major lipid peroxidation products potentially involved in periventricular leukomalacia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brault, Sonia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the principal form of brain injury in preterm neonates. In addition to the vasculopathy associated with hypoxicischemic injury, PVL is characterized by the loss of progenitor oligodendrocytes (OLs). Oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation increase in hypoxic-ischemic injuries, particularly in the immature brain. We hypothesized that the major lipid peroxidation products isoprostanes 15-F2t-IsoP and 15-E2t-IsoP, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) could be implicated in the pathogenesis of PVL by affecting the survival of brain OLs and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). Cytotoxicity of the lipid peroxidation products was assessed on cultured rat progenitor and mature OLs and piglet cerebromicrovascular ECs using the MTT assay. The two isoprostanes displayed different cytotoxic profiles. 15-E 2t-IsoP induced progenitor OL death but did not affect mature OL or microvascular EC survival. In contrast, 15-F2t-IsoP induced death of ECs but not of progenitor and mature OLs. As well, LPA triggered brain microvascular EC death. In all cases, cells did not exhibit classical features of apoptosis (nuclear condensation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL), caspases activation) but displayed signs of oncotic necrosis (propidium iodide incorporation, cell swelling, lactate dehydrogenase release). Cytotoxicity conveyed by both isoprostanes involved TxA2 synthesis, as determined by radioimmunoassay and by the protective effect of TxA2 synthase inhibitors. In addition, progenitor OLs were susceptible to 15-E2t-IsoP due to their low antioxidant defenses. On the other hand, LPA caused EC death through the LPA1 receptor which activated the stress activated protein kinases p38 MAPK and JNK; these kinases were responsible for the decreased intracellular glutathione content observed and the induction of iNOS which caused protein nitrosylation. EC death and neuromicrovascular degeneration caused by 15-F2t-IsoP and LPA were observed ex vivo on isolated microvessels and brain explants and in vivo, with intracerebroventricular infusion and intraocular injections. These novel data implicate 15-E2t-IsoP, 15-F2t-IsoP and LPA as major lipid peroxidation products that may contribute to the genesis of PVL by affecting the survival of progenitor OLs and microvascular ECs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860c08w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k227f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mp047"><dcterms:title>Anxious and depressive symptoms in children : an examination of the common aetiology hypothesis of comorbid anxiety and depression</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brozina, Karen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the fact that the moods, symptoms, and disorders associated with anxiety and depression frequently co-occur in youth, very little is known about the developmental pathways leading to comorbid anxiety and depression. The common aetiology hypothesis proposes that anxiety and depression share common risk, vulnerability, and causal factors which increase the likelihood that they will co-occur. Such common aetiological factors are expected to temporally precede the onset of symptoms and to be uniquely associated with symptoms of each disorder, independent of the strong association between anxiety and depression. Previous research has identified vulnerability factors in the development of both anxious symptoms (e.g., behavioural inhibition) and depressive symptoms (e.g., pessimistic inferential styles) in children. However very little research has examined whether these vulnerability factors are specific to either anxious or depressive symptoms, or whether they are common to both. The purpose of the research presented in this dissertation was to examine the common aetiology hypothesis of anxiety and depression in children by evaluating the specificity of two well-established theories. In addition, the applicability of a diathesis-stress model to the development of anxious and depressive symptoms in children was examined. The research described in Chapter 2 examined behavioural inhibition and found that behaviourally inhibited children who experienced high levels of stress demonstrated increases in anxious, but not depressive symptoms across a six-week period. The research described in Chapter 3 examined the hopelessness theory and found that in the presence of high levels of stress, pessimistic inferential styles about causes, consequences, and the self predicted increases in hopelessness depression symptoms in children with low levels of initial hopelessness depression symptoms. Moreover, children with pessimistic inferential styles about either consequences or the self demonstrated increases in anxious symptoms across the six-week period, even after controlling for changes in hopelessness depression symptoms. These findings have several implications. In line with the common aetiology hypothesis, pessimistic inferential styles about consequences and the self appear to be common vulnerability factors. In contrast, behavioural inhibition and pessimistic inferential style about causes appear to be specific vulnerability factors for anxious symptoms and hopelessness depression symptoms respectively. Finally, vulnerability factors for both anxious and depressive symptoms appear to be amenable to a diathesis-stress framework.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558j319.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mp047</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Depression in children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anxiety in children.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A794082312"><dcterms:title>The universal scale and the semantics of comparison /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bale, Alan Clinton.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Comparative constructions allow individuals to be compared according to different properties. Such comparisons form two classes, those that permit direct, comparisons (comparisons of measurements as in Seymour is taller than he is wide) and those that only allow indirect comparisons (comparisons of relative positions on separate scales as in Esme is more beautiful than Einstein is intelligent). Traditionally, these two types of comparisons have been associated with an ambiguity in the interpretations of the comparative and equative morphemes (see, Bartsch &amp; Vennemann, 1972; Kennedy, 1999). In this thesis, I propose that there is no such ambiguity. The interpretations of the comparative and equative morphemes remain the same whether they appear in sentences that compare individuals directly or relative to two separate scales. To develop a unified account, I suggest that all comparisons involve a scale of universal degrees that are isomorphic to the rational (fractional) numbers between 0 and 1. All comparative and equative constructions are assigned an interpretation based on a comparison of such degrees. These degrees are associated with the two individuals being compared. Crucial to a unified treatment, the connection between individuals and universal degrees involves two steps. First individuals are mapped to a value on a primary scale that respects the ordering of such individuals according to the quality under consideration (whether it be height, beauty or intelligence). Second, this value on the primary scale is mapped to a universal degree that encodes the value's relative position with respect to other values. It is the ability of iv the universal degrees to encode positions on a primary scale that enables comparative and equative morphemes to either compare individuals directly or indirectly. A direct comparison results if measurements such as seven feet participate in the gradable property (as in Seven feet is tall). Such participation can sometimes result in an isomorphism between two primary scales and the ordering of measurements in a measurement system. When this occurs, comparing positions in the primary scales is equivalent to comparing measurements. If this type of isomorphism cannot be established then the sentence yields an indirect comparison.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v985c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/794082312</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Linguistics -- Philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Semantics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Comparison (Philosophy)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sf81p"><dcterms:title>Civil justice in early twentieth-century Northeast China : Fengtian Province, 1900-1928</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Qin, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Drawing upon court files in the Liaoning Provincial Archives, this dissertation addresses the question of the transformation of the civil justice system in Fengtian Province in the early twentieth century. Fengtian Province was among the few provinces where judicial-legal reforms were first launched during the late Qing's New Policies period. In the early Republic, judicial-legal reforms were continuously pursued under the governance of the warlord Zhang Zuolin. The accommodation of judicial-legal modernity within warlord politics was a result of the simultaneous presence of local elite activism, nationalism and the dominance of republican ideology. To demonstrate judicial-legal modernity in this frontier province, this dissertation covers four main areas: the bureaucratization of the court system and mediation mechanism; the formalization of civil procedures; the "discovery" and modernization of custom in judicial process; and the narrowing of the power disparity in gender in divorce law and practice. The bureaucratization of the court system reveals not only the tendency of separating judicial power from executive power, but also the professionalization of judicial officials, including lower-level judicial personnel. The bureaucratization of mediation locates the point at wards under the ward-village system implemented in the 1920s by the Fengtian provincial authority. The ward head, as a salaried sub-village government official was able to exercise his power to mediate civil disputes. This point epitomizes the early effort made by the modern state to interfere in the arena of popular justice. The formalization of civil procedures reflects the transformation of court practice from a simple, customary way of finding facts and applying laws to a practice guided by a complex, codified procedural law based on a Germanic-Japanese model. In speaking of the "discovery" and modernization of custom, I address not only the phenomena of "discovering" local customs and recognizing them as a source of authority for adjudicating cases by judges who had modern legal training, but also of the elaborate, selective screening policy towards custom, ushered in by the Supreme Court due to their concern with public policy and social morals. Narrowing the power disparity in gender is examined in the light of changes to divorce law and practice. By following the precedents laid down by the Supreme Court, the lower courts attempted to readdress the unbalanced power relationship between men and women inherited from Qing law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301563v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sf81p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law reform -- China -- Liaoning Sheng.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Justice, Administration of -- China -- Liaoning Sheng.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amw22v986n"><dcterms:title>Effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) on osmosensory transduction in rat supraoptic nucleus neurons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Zizhen, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Action potential firing rate from magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs), and the resulting vasopressin (VP, antidiuretic hormone) secretion from the neurohypophysis, correlate linearly with extracellular fluid (ECF) osmolality. Previous studies suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) released centrally may enhance the sensitivity (gain) of this osmoregulatory reflex by increasing the slope of the relation between the firing rate of MNCs and ECF osmolality. The intrinsic osmosensitivity of MNCs is mediated by a cell volume-dependent regulation of stretch inactivated cation (SIC) channels. Therefore Ang II might increase gain by modulating the effects of ECF osmolality on cell volume, or the coupling between volume changes and SIC channel activation. Using digital imaging and morphometry, we found that rat MNCs change their volume osmometrically without volume regulation, and that Ang II does not change the relation between cell volume and ECF osmolality. However whole cell patch clamp analysis revealed that Ang II increases the apparent mechanosensitivity of SIC channels as quantified by the mechanosensitivity index (MI = conductance change/volume change) in isolated MNCs. The effect of Ang II on MI was inhibited by chelerythrine and by chelation of intracellular calcium ions with BAPTA. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) mimicked the effects of Ang II, indicating that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in mediating the effects of the peptide on MI. The effects of Ang II and PMA on MI were accompanied by an increase in the density of actin filaments (F-actin) in the submembrane cortical cytoskeleton, as revealed by confocal microscopic analysis of fluorescent phalloidin staining. The effect of Ang II on F-actin density could also be blocked by chelerythrine. Moreover, disruption of F-actin with cytochalasin D prevented the increase in MI caused by Ang II, whereas stabilization of F-actin with jasplakinolide enhanced MI and occluded the effect of Ang II. We conclude that Ang II increases the osmosensitivity of MNCs by enhancing the mechanosensitivity of SIC channels through a PKC-dependent accumulation of F-actin in the submembrane cytoskeleton.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q5738.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v986n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vs807"><dcterms:title>Manipulating fatty acids in sheep milk</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Runhou, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Four studies were conducted to investigate some factors affecting milk fatty acid composition of dairy ewes.

The other three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of dietary added fats with different profiles of fatty acids from canola, sunflower and flaxseeds on animal performance, nutrient utilization, milk yield and cheese making. The main emphasis was on fatty acid composition, particularly CLA and Omega-3 fatty acids, in milk and cheese. Results showed that: (1) feeding up to 8% of canola, sunflower and flaxseed had no adverse effects on dry matter intake and total tract digestibilities of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and crude protein, while the digestibilities of fatty acids and gross energy were increased with oilseed supplementation; (2) feeding flaxseed to lactating ewes up to 260g/ewe/d increased milk yield by up to 8.4%, and fat content by up to 14.3% without adversely affecting other milk components or cheese yield and composition; (3) Oilseed supplementation increased milk concentrations of long-chain and unsaturated fatty acids in the expenses of short-chain, medium-chain and saturated fatty acids. The concentrations of CLA and Omega-3 fatty acids were also increased by oilseed supplementation; (4) the manipulated fatty acids profiles can be reflected in cheese; (5) good quality cheese can be produced from ovine milk frozen at -15°C and -25°C for up to 6 months without influencing cheese content of fat and protein and fatty acid composition. In conclusion, ovine milk with nutritionally healthy characteristics can be produced by feeding ewes diets with oilseeds, and freezing storage of milk for up to 6 months at -15°C or -25°C does not significantly affects milk composition including fatty acid composition.

As a "Western-like" garden designed and cobuilt by the European Jesuits in China, the Western Multistoried-Buildings garden was unique in garden history. It provides a significant and unique case study of the cultural encounter between Chinese and European civilizations in the eighteenth century. The research reported in this thesis focuses on the communication between the visions of the Chinese emperor and the Western Jesuits during the construction of this European garden. The research demonstrates how Jesuit metaphysics fused with Chinese cosmology through the creation of the multiple jing, the bright views of the garden scenes, using the technique of the "line-method," which embodied the Chinese transformation of Western linear perspective. This research differs from the usual approach in history and cross-cultural studies that treats buildings and gardens as secondary objects re-presenting a priori or a posteriori ideas. It goes directly to the material context to analyze how the creation of a garden framed the minds of individuals who came from different cultures and religions. Such a "materialist" approach not only acts as a reflection of the Western metaphysical approach, but also attempts to initiate a new interpretative perspective that is closer to the poetic essence of the Chinese culture. As the Western Multistoried-Buildings garden demonstrates, there does exist a way by which cultural and religious conflicts are dissolved into the "round brightness" of cultural fusion, which in turn makes cultural differences shine.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999b91w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n536x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gardens -- China.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd473147c"><dcterms:title>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in postpartum mothers : the role of infant feeding type, parity, salience of stressor and sociodemographic factors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tu, Mai Thanh, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responsiveness to stress is generally blunted in lactating rats, except during situations of pup endangerment, suggesting an important role of salience of stressor in stress response during lactation. Conversely, in women, breastfeeding is associated with reduced HPA responses to physical stress and perceived stress. Yet, HPA responses to a standardized speech and arithmetic task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) are not blunted in breastfeeding mothers. Interestingly, greater number of children (parity) increases maternal experience which can enhance responsiveness to child-related stressors. To our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the impact of infant feeding type and parity on basal and reactive HPA secretion in human mothers using an emotional stressor evoking threat to a child. Furthermore, no study has investigated the effect of return of ovarian activity, sleep disturbances, education and income even though these variables are function of infant feeding type. Therefore, in STUDY (1) we assessed the impact of infant feeding type (breast vs. bottle) and parity (primiparous, first-time mother vs. multiparous, second-time mother) on diurnal cortisol secretion. Then, in STUDY (2) we verified whether infant feeding upon waking up would affect awakening cortisol response (ACR), an endogenous stimulation of HPA axis. Finally, in STUDY (3) we investigated the impact of infant feeding type, parity and salience of stressor on salivary cortisol and (sympathetic) alpha-amylase responses to laboratory-induced (exogenous) stressors that were either related or unrelated to child well-being (a home-made emotional film evoking lost and hurt children or the TSST). Breastfeeding mothers presented lower estradiol concentrations, more frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions and higher education and income. We found that greater basal cortisol secretion in multiparous bottlefeeding compared to multiparous breastfeeding mothers at awakening and 4PM, when simultaneous child and infant cares are the most prominent. No impact of breastfeeding was found on ACR. Finally, among multiparous mothers, following both the TSST and the emotional film, cortisol responsiveness in bottlefeeding was greater than in breastfeeding mothers. Alpha-amylase responses were similar across groups. Interestingly, income played a role in the stability of diurnal cycle, and possibly of ACR across days, but not on laboratory-induced stress responses. No effect of other secondary variables was detected. In conclusion, in this dissertation, we show for the first time that during child-related stress, multiparity accentuates the reduction in basal and reactive HPA activity associated with breastfeeding. Furthermore, the evidence of potential association between high socioeconomic indices and healthier HPA function represent a new avenue for implementing support programs for mothers during the highly emotional and stressful period following childbirth.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r075036t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd473147c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602505j"><dcterms:title>Race, hegemony, mobilisation : what roles for the state and for civil society? : the transformation of racial politics in Brazil</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Treviño González, Mónica.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An enduring puzzle of race relations in Brazil is that for most of the 20th century this topic was conspicuously absent from politics, in spite of deep-rooted inequalities between whites and non-whites. The ideology of "racial democracy" effectively depoliticised the issue until the late 1990s, when a wide-ranging programme of affirmative action policies for Afro-Brazilians was implemented. Beginning with the idea that the myth of racial democracy functioned as an ideological hegemony in the Gramscian sense, this dissertation seeks to explain the process through which public policies ceased to reflect this hegemonic ideology, and instead began to represent a counterhegemonic project. Contrary to traditional Gramscian analysis, I argue that a counterhegemonic project can be defended not only by civil society actors, but also by the state, and that the relative strength of counterhegemonic actors is often influenced by transnational factors. Indeed, I argue that when civil society actors lack the necessary strength to reach a leadership position in civil society that can counter the hegemonic order, a counterhegemonic confluence of civil society, state and transnational actors can produce this change. An analysis of the evolution of racial politics in Brazil since the return of democratic rule in the 1980s demonstrates that such a confluence did indeed take place in Brazil, culminating at the United Nations World Conference Against Racism in Durban in 2001. A study of the implementation of admissions quotas for Afro-Brazilians in the state universities of Rio de Janeiro serves to confirm the importance of the contribution of the state and transnational actors, as well as to examine the limits of the confluence.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53x1184.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602505j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brazil -- Politics and government -- 1985-2002.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brazil -- Politics and government -- 2003-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brazil -- Race relations -- Political aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj098zg26f"><dcterms:title>Public school teachers' concerns about their professional lives</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tzavellas, Georgia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A historic turnover in the teaching profession has begun. There is no doubt that worldwide demand for teachers is on the rise and will continue to increase over the next decade. Yet many new teachers leave the profession, stating reasons such as low salaries, lack of professional opportunities and career advancement, and heavy workloads. The present study examined the concerns (in-school, external and personal) of elementary and secondary school teachers. The purpose of this research was to determine if teachers in Quebec, Canada, have concerns similar to teachers in other countries where studies are more common. This study also examined if there were any differences related to teachers' stages of teaching, level of education, and gender. Four hundred and fifty-seven teachers (335 females and 120 males) from five school boards in Quebec participated in this study. The five school boards represented urban, suburban, rural, large and small English-language boards. The instrument designed for this study was a questionnaire based on the teacher concerns identified in the literature. The questionnaire, named the Public School Teacher Concerns Questionnaire, has seven sub-scales and 64 items. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of respondent thinking reveal similar concerns regarding eight factors (37 items) derived by factor analysis: student characteristics and behaviour, teacher/administration relationship, student behaviour (non-academic), material and temporal resources, teachers control of day-to-day activities, professional development and opportunities, status of profession, and degree of non-teaching duties.

Since they constitute one of the major ways to probe the presence of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), their evaluation through theoretical models is very important. The photon production at low-to intermediate transverse momentum (pT) is first studied. The photon production rate in a mesonic gas is evaluated within a massive Yang-Mills (MYM) approach. Earlier calculations are reexamined with additional constraints, including new production channels and with the inclusion of form-factors. Adding primordial N-N contribution and existing baryonic and QGP production rates, we can reproduce the photon spectra observed at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The intermediate to high-p T region is dominated by the physics of jets. A treatment, complete to leading-order in the strong coupling, is used to calculate energy loss in the strongly interacting medium. This approach is convolved with a physical description of the initial spatial distribution of jets and with an expansion of the emission zone. The role played by jet-plasma interactions is highlighted, showing that they dominate in the range 2 &lt; p T &lt; 4 GeV, at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). This mechanism has an important impact on both the total photon yield and the photon azimuthal asymmetry, turning the coefficient v 2 negative. Finally, the dilepton production at high p T is calculated with hard-thermal loops (HTL) effects, showing, that in perfect analogy with real photons, jet-plasma interactions also dominate the dilepton yield around pT = 4 GeV.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44ps04r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hw92t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Nuclear.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60d183x"><dcterms:title>Characterization of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorinterleukin-2 fusion cDNA and the use of marrow stromal cells for cancer immunotherapy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stagg, John.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Immunotherapy of cancer aims at achieving systemic anticancer responses capable of eradicating disseminated malignant cells. The disappointing outcomes associated with several immune-based clinical trials have highlighted the need to improve upon existing therapeutic strategies. The main objective of my thesis was to develop novel means in order to improve current cytokine-based anticancer strategies. The delivery of cytokines, or their encoding cDNA sequences, can induce antitumor immune responses. Interleukin (IL)-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are among the most potent cytokines able to induce tumor-specific systemic immunity, both in experimental models and clinical trials. Paradoxically, the combination of GM-CSF and IL-2 has been reported to downregulate certain immune functions, highlighting the unpredictability of dual cytokine use. In the first section of my thesis, I hypothesized that a GM-CSF and IL-2 fusion transgene (GIFT) could circumvent the limitations associated with dual cytokine expression yet preserve synergistic features. B16 mouse melanoma cells were gene modified to express GIFT (B16GIFT) and GIFT gene product was characterized in vitro. When injected into syngeneic mice, B16GIFT cells were unable to form tumors. When used as a whole cell tumor vaccine, irradiated B16GIFT could induce absolute protective immunity against wild type B16 tumors. In mice with established melanoma, B16GIFT therapeutic cellular vaccine significantly improved tumor-free survival when compared to B16 expressing both IL-2 and GM-CSF. Mechanistically, GIFT induced a significantly greater tumor site recruitment of macrophages and NK cells than combined GM-CSF and IL-2. I thus demonstrated that a fusion between GM-CSF and IL-2 can invoke greater antitumor effect than both cytokines in combination and that novel immunobiological properties can arise from such chimeric constructs. Another means to improve current cytokine-based strategies is to limit the severe side-effects associated with their systemic administration. In view of that, I tested the hypothesis that primary marrow stromal cells (MSCs) can be used as a cellular vehicle for the tumor-localized delivery of immunostimulatory cytokines. Specifically, I investigated whether IL-2 gene-modified MSCs can be used to mount an effective immune response against the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma model. My research demonstrated that primary mouse MSCs can be efficiently gene-modified to secrete IL-2. Remarkably, IL-2 secreting MSCs embedded in a collagen-like matrix and injected in the vicinity of pre-established B16 tumors led to absence of tumor growth in 90% of treated mice. Injection of IL-2 secreting MSCs induced CD8 mediated tumor specific immunity and was dependent upon CD8 and NK cells, but not CD4 cells. Therefore, despite their previously reported immunosuppressive effects on allogeneic immune responses, I provided evidence that primary MSCs can be used as transgenic delivery vehicles to enhance immune responses in syngeneic hosts. In order to further characterize the effect of MSCs on autologous immunity, I investigated the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs during syngeneic antigen-specific immune responses. I provide experimental evidence that syngeneic MSCs behave as conditional antigen-presenting cells. My research demonstrated that IFNgamma can induce mouse MSCs to process and present antigenic peptides derived from a soluble xenoprotein (i.e. ovalbumin) and activate in vitro antigen-specific T cells. When injected in vivo into syngeneic mice, ovalbumin-pulsed IFNgamma-treated MSCs induced potent ovalbumin-specific cellular immune responses and protected mice against ovalbumin-expressing tumors. My studies further showed that human MSCs can also acquire antigen-presenting functions upon IFNgamma stimulation, thereby activating antigen-specific T cell hybridomas. Taken together, my results strongly suggest that in syngeneic conditions, IFNgamma-stimulated MSCs behave as conditional antigen presenting cells able to activate antigen-specific immune responses. Overall, my research opens the door for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies based on (i) the improvement of cytokine potency by molecular fusion and (ii) the improvement of cytokine delivery by the use of gene modified somatic MSCs, and may reveal MSCs as previously unrecognized cellular regulators of physiological immune responses.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f811.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d183x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322j94b"><dcterms:title>On the problem of Exupérian heroism in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Smyth, Bryan Alan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this dissertation I seek to ascertain why Merleau-Ponty concludes his Phenomenology of Perception with lines drawn from Saint-Exupery's Pilote de guerre. This ending has received no critical scrutiny in the literature on Merleau-Ponty. Yet it is quite puzzling; for the content of the cited passage is antithetical to the philosophical thrust of Merleau-Ponty's work. And yet, it is linked to the idea of 'the realization of philosophy'. Given that this idea constitutes the guiding impetus of Merleau-Ponty's existential phenomenology, a comprehensive understanding of Merleau-Ponty's project requires coming to terms with the role of Saint-Exupery within it. To this end, I examine the major themes of Saint-Exupery's work, in particular the 'cosmic humanism' of Pilote de guerre, showing that this is based on a spiritual account of self-sacrificial action. I then reconstruct the core of Merleau-Ponty's existential phenomenology as a 'militant' philosophy, focusing my analysis around the notion of 'human productivity'. On this basis, I provide a detailed reading of Merleau-Ponty's essay "Man, the Hero" in terms of post-Hegelian philosophy of history, and I provide a detailed comparison of Saint-Exupery and Merleau-Ponty with regard to truth and freedom. This analysis reveals that heroism for Merleau-Ponty is the manifestation of pure human productivity and, as such, is a phenomenally objective purposiveness. Drawing on Kant's third Critique, I conclude that the rationale for Merleau-Pontian heroism is to furnish sensory evidence attesting to the possibility of a solution to the human problem. Through the concept of the hero, or of heroic purposiveness, we are able to cognize the potential suitability of the natural world for the realization of human reconciliation. The hero is thus the linchpin of Merleau-Ponty's teleology of consciousness, and of the transcendental project that hinges on this teleology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945w153.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322j94b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Merleau-Ponty, Maurice, 1908-1961.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de, 1900-1944.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phenomenology and literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Courage.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70n052t"><dcterms:title>Parenting styles and family environment : influences on youth problem gambling</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ste-Marie, Chantal.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the relationship between parenting styles, family environment, and gambling behavior among 1,203 CEGEP students in the greater Montreal area. Participants reported on their past year gambling behavior and their perceptions of their family environment. Their perceptions of their parents' pattern of parenting were also reported, and are identified based upon Buri's (1991) and Baumrind's (1971) authoritarian, authoritative/flexible, and permissive parenting styles. Results showed that parenting styles indirectly influence problem gambling behavior via family environment. Poor family environments, characterized by high levels of conflict and low levels of cohesion, were found to significantly increase the likelihood of gambling problems among youth. Results of this study serve as a basis for future studies to investigate the complex dynamics at play between familial influences and youth gambling behavior.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z709191v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70n052t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teenage gamblers -- Family relationships.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Teenage gamblers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qr311"><dcterms:title>Neuronal processing of second-order stimuli in area 18 of the cat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Song, Yuning, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neurons in early visual cortex respond to luminance variations occurring at objects' boundaries. However, visual stimuli that are defined by non-luminance cues, such as texture or contrast, have been demonstrated to evoke neuronal responses in recent years. These stimuli have been termed as second-order stimuli, since they require more complex processing which involves essential nonlinear operations. In this thesis, I tested neuronal responses to various second-order stimuli in order to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. In particular, we addressed the following issues: (1) whether abutting gratings can be processed nonlinearly, as illusory contours formed by abutting lines; (2) Whether a single mechanism can mediate responses to two distinct second-order stimuli: abutting gratings and contrast envelopes; (3) whether cat A18 is a cortical locus for form-cue invariant boundary perception. Altogether, these results provide insight into higher order neuronal processing at early visual cortex and have some important indications for future studies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x3366.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qr311</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g666z"><dcterms:title>Lipase-catalyzed synthesis of selected phenolic lipids in organic solvent media</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sabally, Kebba.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lipase-catalyzed esterification and transesterification reactions of selected phenolic acids with lipids were investigated in organic solvent media. The esterification of linoleyl alcohol with dihydrocaffeic acid (DHA) in neat hexane medium resulted in highest esterification yield (EY) of 17% when a Candida antarctica lipase (Novozym 435) was used to catalyze the reaction. The use of co-solvents t-butanol and 2-butanone with hexane resulted in a dramatic increase in EY. The highest EY of 83% was obtained in hexane:2-butanone mixture of 85:15 (v/v) using Novozym 435; however lower EY (40%) was obtained when a lipase from Rhizomucor meihei (Lipozyme IM 20) was used. Increasing the amount of the co-solvent 2-butanone in the hexane:2-butanone mixture to 75:25 (v/v) resulted in a lower EY of 75% with Novozym 435; using the same enzyme, the esterification of a more unsaturated alcohol, linolenyl alcohol, with DHCA in the hexane:2-butanone mixture of 75:25 (v/v) resulted in EY of 76% which was similar to that obtained with linoleyl alcohol as lipid substrate. The esterification of DHCA and ferulic acid with linolenyl alcohol in the hexane:2-butanone mixture of 65:35 (v/v) resulted in an EY of 58 and 16%, respectively. Both linoleyl and linolenyl alcohols demonstrated mass action effects with EY of 99% in DHCA: fatty alcohol ratio of 1:8. Using a molar ratio of 1:2, the transesterification reactions of DHCA with trilinolein (TLA) and trilinolenin (TLNA) in hexane:2-butanone mixture of 75:25 (v/v) resulted in total transesterification yields (TYs) of phenolic lipids of 66 and 62%, respectively. The TYs of phenolic monoacylglycerols was higher than that of phenolic diacylglycerols for both TLA and TLNA transesterification reactions. A lower molar ratio of DHCA to TLA of 1:4 resulted in a lower TY of 53%. Using a molar ratio of 1:2, the TY of TLA and TLNA with ferulic acid in hexane:2-butanone mixture of 65:35 (v/v) was 16 and 14%, respectively. An equal molar transesterification reaction of DHCA with flaxseed oil, in a hexane:2-butanone mixture of 75:25 (v/v), resulted in the production of only phenolic monoacylglycerols (19%); however, decreasing the molar ratio resulted in the production of both phenolic mono and diacylglycerols. A molar ratio of DHCA to flaxseed oil (1:8) resulted in a TY of 76%, with 43 and 33% phenolic mono and diacylglycerols, respectively. Changing the solvent mixture of hexane:2-butanone from 65:35 to 85:15 (v/v) resulted in an increased in the TY of phenolic diacylglycerols from 24 to 55% with no significant effect on the TY of phenolic monoacylglycerols. The transesterification reaction resulted in a change in the composition of the C18:3 FA from 53% in the unmodified oil to 60 and 65% in the phenolic mono and diacylglycerols. Transesterification reaction of DHCA with fish liver oil in the solvent mixtures of hexane:2-butanone of 75:25 and 85:15 (v/v) resulted in TY of 56 and 65%, respectively. Transesterification in solvent: mixture of 75:25 resulted in a 40 and 16% TY of phenolic mono and diacylglycerols, respectively, whereas that in the solvent mixture of 85:15 (v/v) resulted in a 38 and 37% TY of phenolic mono and diacylglycerols, respectively. The structures of phenolic lipids of linoleyl and linolenyl alcohols with DHCA were confirmed by LC/MS analysis likewise for the phenolic mono and diacylglycerols from transesterification of DHCA with TLA and TLNA as well as flaxseed and fish liver oils. The phenolic esters of the fatty alcohols demonstrated radical scavenging properties similar to that of alpha-tocopherol but less than for DHCA; however, the phenolic lipids obtained with the use of TLA and TLNA as substrate as well as flaxseed and fish liver oil, demonstrated significant radical scavenging effects but less than that of alpha-tocopherol and DHCA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fs911.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g666z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lipase.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Linseed oil.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish oils.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phenols -- Synthesis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687n46p"><dcterms:title>Dynamics of trains and train-like articulated systems travelling in confined fluid</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sakuma, Yutaka.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dynamical stability, wave propagation, response, and mode localization in a train of flexibly interconnected rigid cylinders travelling in a confined cylindrical "tunnel" subjected to fluid dynamic forces are studied theoretically. Each cylinder, which is coupled and supported by springs and dampers, has two degrees of freedom of translational and rotational motions. The kinetic, dissipation, and potential energies of the system and the generalized forces associated with the fluid dynamic forces acting on the system, such as inviscid fluid dynamic forces, viscous frictional forces, and form drag, are obtained first. Then the equations of motion are derived by application of the Lagrange equation. The principal aim of this study is to investigate the effect of aerodynamic forces on the dynamics of a high-speed train running in a tunnel, or more generally of a train-like system travelling in a coaxial cylindrical tube. The results of this study show that (a) the system loses stability by flutter; (b) viscous frictional drag has a considerable effect on stability; (c) when the aerodynamic forces act on the train, the frequency bands of the dispersion relation of wave propagation shift, and thus no classical normal modes (standing wave solutions) exist in the system; (d) the wavelength of the travelling sinusoidal force controls phase differences among cylinders in the train: and (e) the imperfections in the supporting springs have a great influence on mode localization and considerably alter the stability of the system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60d185g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687n46p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
