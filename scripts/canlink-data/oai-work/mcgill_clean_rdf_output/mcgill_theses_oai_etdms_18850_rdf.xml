In recent years, certain thinkers have appeared, from among both the religious leaders and the Western educated intellectuals, who have endeavoured to satisfy that need.

The whole broad and varied expanse of eighteenth-century English life composed the society Henry Fielding depicted.

In the study of respiratory mechanisms in the plant, three main experimental approaches have been employed. Two of these methods have this in common, that they both study the overall gas exchange in plant tissues. The first technique introduces a variable into the respiring system by altering the oxygen tension to which the living tissue is exposed. Different partial pressures of oxygen cause alterations in the respiratory rate of the tissue under investigation, and the interpretation of the results has led to the formulation of schemes of intermediary metabolism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Waygood, E.

The purpose of the present work is to initiate an investigation of the problems associated with the synthesis of peptide bonds. Two aspects are under consideration here; first, to study the methods by which amine acids can be rendered monofunctional so that their reactions may be strictly controlled; second, to examine amidation reactions from the standpoint of the controlled synthesis of peptide bonds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.
