In chapter 1, I review the trends in innovation and social learning in the avian literature, and contrast them with trends in mammals, especially primates. In chapter 2, I use anecdotal reports of feeding innovation and social learning in the literature to assess taxonomic trends and to study the relationship between the two traits at the interspecific level. In chapter 3, I investigate the relationship between innovation and social learning at the intraspecific level in captive feral pigeons (Columba livia). Innovation is estimated from the ability to solve an innovative foraging problem, and social learning is measured as the number of trials required to learn a foraging task from a proficient demonstrator.

The cellular distribution of apolipoprotein E and other abundant hepatic secretory and endosomal proteins was quantitatively examined in ultrathin cryosections of liver hepatocytes. Under steady-state conditions, apoE was concentrated within the Golgi apparatus, along sinusoidal plasma membrane microvilli and within all components of the endosomal apparatus, as evaluated immunocytochemically and confirmed by quantitative immunoblotting of organelles isolated from liver homogenates. Within the secretory pathway, the hepatic Golgi apparatus was a site of protein concentration as evaluated by the gold labeling density of another major secretory protein of liver hepatocytes, albumin, which was concentrated $ sim$10-fold in the Golgi apparatus relative to the ER. Sorting of this secretory protein within pre-Golgi compartments was not observed. Within the Golgi apparatus, apoE was concentrated within Golgi saccular distensions while being predominantly absent from flattened saccular components; apoB was similarly segregated within peripheral distensions. In contrast albumin, as well as two other monomeric proteins, transferrin (Tf) and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIg-R) were distributed homogeneously throughout Golgi stacks. In an attempt to assess a key prediction of the vesicular transport hypothesis, small 60-90 nm vesicles in the immediate vicinity of Golgi apparatus, postulated to mediate intersaccular transport were examined for their content of cargo secretory or plasma membrane proteins. Lack of immunoreactive apoE, apoB, albumin, Tf, or pIgR, within small vasicular profiles suggests limits to current models of vesicle-mediated intra-Golgi transport. Along the endocytic pathway, at the cell surface, apoE and pIgR were dispersely distributed along the sinusoidal microvilli. Quantitative analysis of the immunolabeling distribution of these proteins did not reveal concentration within plasma membrane pits. These findings which were confirmed by observations of cell surface labeling of two other ligands, Tf and apoB, are consistent with receptors and ligands gaining access to the endocytic machinery likely without receptor/ligand preclustering or prolonged clustering events within plasma membrane pits. Intracellularly, apoE was concentrated within endocytic structures which were double-labeled for apoE and internalized HRP. Large endocytic vesicles closely juxtaposed to Golgi stacks also revealed a high content of apoE. Together the endosomal labeling distribution of apoE as well as morphological features of endosomal components are consistent with the maturation model for endosomes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bergeron, John J.

Hot pressing and liquid-phase sintering are the most common processing techniques used to fabricate AlN ceramics. Liquid-phase sintering involves the use of additives to enhance the sinterability, and in the case of AlN, the thermal conductivity. The function of the additives is to react with an oxide layer on the powder surface and form a liquid phase. The presence of this liquid phase aids densification and the removal of oxygen from the AlN lattice, the latter results in significant thermal conductivity enhancement. Liquid-phase sintering of AlN with $ rm Y sb2O sb3$ as an additive has been studied to control the formation of the secondary phases. Using the $ rm Y sb2O sb3$-$ rm Al sb2O sb3$ phase equilibria, three liquid-phase sintering compositions occurring at the eutectic points and one composition close to that of $ rm3Y sb2O sb3 5Al sb2O sb3$ (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet, YAG) were chosen. Sintering was performed in the temperature range of 1750-1950$ sp circ$C for 1 hour under a N$ sb2$ atmosphere to optimize the sintering temperature for each composition. Full densification of the AlN was achieved for all four compositions sintered at 1900$ sp circ$C. Investigation of the sintering kinetics was performed in a AlN/BN powder bed and on a BN setter at 1900$ sp circ$C for up to 4 hours. The kinetic study results did not agree with the classical and recently proposed liquid-phase sintering models due to the different mechanisms of liquid phase formation, and a difference in the chemical composition and viscosity of the various secondary phases. The microstructural evolution of sintered AlN was studied by SEM and TEM. The thermal conductivity of the fully sintered materials was measured, and the highest value achieved was 148.5 W/mK from the YAG composition due to the absence of the secondary phase film at grain junctions and the superior lattice oxygen absorption of the secondary phase compound to the other compositions. A study of the post-sintering heat-treatment of AlN in various reducing atmospheres was performed to determine the influence on thermal conductivity. Two different schematic models of the reducing reactions were proposed. The results indicate that such a heat-treatment can improve the thermal conductivity of AlN up to nearly 200 W/mK. This is due to further oxygen removal from both the AlN lattice and secondary phase, simultaneously.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Drew, Robin A. L.

(Erik Richter)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is concerned with software pipelining in the presence of resource constraints--both register and function unit. Software pipelining attempts to combine or schedule operations from different iterations of a loop into a new loop body which can execute as fast as possible or rate-optimally on a given architecture. Approaches for software pipelining can be categorized as exact--meaning the approach guarantees it will find a rate-optimal schedule--or inexact meaning the approach makes no such guarantee. This thesis proposes two novel and exact approaches. One approach represents the software pipelining problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. A unified framework is developed that includes both function unit and register constraints. This framework can represent both fully pipelined function units as well as function units with structural hazards. In the latter case, difficulties in mapping instructions to function units are identified and a solution developed. Our other software pipelining approach is to enumerate a sufficiently large set of schedules so as to guarantee inclusion of a rate-optimal, minimum register schedule fitting the target architecture. As the set of legal schedules is often large or infinite, drastic pruning is required to make this approach feasible. Requirements for this pruning are developed which insure that the enumerated set still contains all schedules of interest. Both the enumeration and ILP approaches are easily adapted to handle resource minimization, making them suitable for use in synthesis and architectural definition as well as in compilers. A powerful tested containing over 35,000 lines of C code was constructed to evaluate the proposed approaches against each other, as well as to compare them to a set of leading inexact methods. Performance was compared on over 1000 benchmark loops. For a significant number of the loops, use of the proposed ILP and enumeration techniques resulted in schedules that were faster and/or used fewer registers than the inexact methods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>R.Gao, Guang (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Agarwal, Vinod K.

This thesis describes that relation as "entrapment": the self has become mired in the life orders of modernity and is unable to reign over them. The primary hazard of these orders is their imposition of subjectivities that are highly circumscribed, subjectivities more responsive to external functions and imperatives than to the expression of individuality. Underlying this outlook is a new consciousness of time; in lieu of evolutionary and progressive theories of history, a tragic view emerges. History is seen as devoid of any deterministic necessity, yet its collective products have become too weighty and entrenched to allow for radical, over-arching political transformations. The thesis examines how, beginning with these shared presuppositions, Weber, Freud, and Foucault develop very different understandings of entrapment, understandings that pose fundamental challenges to one another.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taylor, Charles (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375z31n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r292d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Foucault, Michel, 1926-1984.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Weber, Max, 1864-1920</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A00000204h"><dcterms:title>The crystallization of poly(ethylene oxide) in blends with neat and plasticized poly(vinyl chloride)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marentette, Joanne M. (Joanne Marie)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The crystallization of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in blends with amorphous poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), in a mixture with the PVC-selective plasticizer tricresyl phosphate (TCP), and in ternary mixtures with both PVC and TCP has been investigated at several structural levels using the techniques of: (i) theoretical surface interfacial tension calculations, (ii) thermal analysis, (iii) polarized light microscopy, and (iv) polarized infrared microspectroscopy. The invariance of the glass transition temperature of the interlamellar, amorphous PEO suggests a relatively low degree of dispersion in PEO/PVC blends. A slight depression in the equilibrium melting temperature of PEO in blends of high PVC content was observed, and subsequent analysis of the data using the Flory-Huggins equation reveals that, at best, PEO and PVC exhibit limited miscibility in the melt. The melting temperature depression may be accentuated by the addition of TCP, but the depression observed in the ternary mixtures lies within the experimental uncertainty. In general, the spherulites grown in the presence of additives are coarser and less birefringent than those grown in the pure melt, with the degree of coarseness increasing with increasing additive concentration. The interpretation of the crystallization kinetics of PEO using current nucleation theory clearly demonstrates that the crystallization of PEO in the temperature range of interest occurs within regime III. The slight kinetic discontinuity at $ sim$51$ sp circ$C that has been thought to arise from a regime II/III transition can be attributed to a transformation of the dominant crystal growth face from the (010) crystallographic face at lower temperatures to the (120) face at higher temperatures. The growth rates of PEO spherulites in PEO/PVC blends are not affected by the presence of PVC in the temperature range 49-55$ sp circ$C, even at concentrations as high as 50% PVC. However, the growth rates of spherulites in mixtures containing TCP are significantly depressed. Dichroic infrared microspectroscopy was employed to investigate the variations in the crystalline structure at the sub-spherulitic level. The determination of the dichroic ratios and the selected peak ratios from the spectra of purely crystalline PEO (obtained by difference spectroscopy) reveals that PVC disturbs the orientation of the crystalline stems of PEO within the spherulites and causes an increase in the crystallization of PEO in the strained, planar zig-zag conformation. PEO, in turn, appears to induce a higher incidence of the planar zig-zag conformation in the PVC molecules. In the ternary mixtures, the plasticizing effect of TCP on PVC renders the PVC molecules more flexible and more mobile, thereby drastically reducing the shearing of the PEO and the resultant formation of the planar zig-zag conformation during crystallization. In effect, the crystallization kinetics and the basic crystalline structure of PEO can be controlled by selection of appropriate proportions of PVC and TCP, a result of major significance and practical importance to the field of polymer blends.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brown, G.

The author argues that all-encompassing theoretical approaches to plagiarism cannot account for vast variations, both in the motivation for plagiarizing on the part of the author, and in the reception of the plagiarized material by individual readers and by the literary/discursive community. Varying standards of acceptability for plagiarized texts are contingent upon the historical, political, geographical and legal juncture within which they are undertaken, and the consequences of plagiarisms uncovered vary accordingly. Nevertheless, the author notes an important relationship between prevailing socio-economic relations within the society and the ways in which plagiarism is regarded by the institutions entrusted with the regulation of, for example, copyright, author's rights, and the publishing industry. After considering the findings and failings of the growing corpus of approaches to plagiarism from Angenot to Zumthor, the author concludes that at the end of the day, approaches are most significantly narrowed-down to categories that uphold or reject the practise of plagiarism. Two extreme examples of these categories would be the corporations' attempts to purchase for all time the rights to the reproduction and diffusion of literary texts, and the Bakhtin-inspired approach that emphasizes the point that utterances are common to communities of speakers, and as such redundancy and repetition are inevitable--but so too is assurance that the originality of each repetition will be affirmed by the ever-changing context within which it is spoken.

In order to study communication, two takeover mechanisms are studied which are tender offers and negotiated takeovers.

This dichotomy continues in the Labrador Basin, where the leveed Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel (NAMOC) is flanked by a sandy submarine braidplain in the east, which is the basinward extension of the differences on the upper slope. The floodplain west of NAMOC contains extensive debris-flow deposits generated on the Labrador Slope. The meandering low-sinuosity, low-gradient NAMOC contains three segments: In the upper equilibrium channel, channel morphology is in equilibrium with spill-over from low-velocity, low-density upper portions of turbidity currents flowing in the channel; in the middle modified equilibrium channel, equilibrium morphology is altered by the confluence with tributary channels, and in the lower segment, channel morphology and position is controlled by basement topography (oceanic fracture zones and seamounts). The NAMOC levees interfinger with the braidplain deposits to the east and prograde southeastward in 7-8 packages. Most packages show a strong cross-channel decrease in thickness, and a strong asymmetry between the left and the right levee, as a Coriolis effect. The braidplain east of the NAMOC, which developed simultaneously with and prior to the NAMOC, shows a north to south gradient from laterally very extensive to highly channelized deposits. In the channelized part, channel positions change rapidly and deposits vary from sandy to gravelly. Extensive sheet-like turbidity currents on the braidplain may have been caused by catastrophic outbursts of subglacial lakes during times of ice-stream surges. Quantitative morphological analysis shows that the NAMOC is characterized by particularly low sinuosities due to very low channel-gradients compared to other submarine channels. The channel displays several features not recognized before in the deep-sea, or not in the same detail; including submarine hanging valleys and chute pools, submarine point-bars within the channel, coarse-grained wash-over fans on the lee-side of the levees, and terraces within the channel. The talweg is variable in depth and meanders within the channel. An up to 80 m deep talweg is present in the distal NAMOC resulting from flow restrictions due to seamounts. Channel morphology as well as grain size of spill-over deposits suggest that the flow tops of turbidity currents in the NAMOC are slow ($&lt;$0.7 m/s) and dilute ($&lt;$12 kg/m$ sp3$). Gravel deposits in the channel require velocities of 6.5-8 m/s for suspension transport, suggesting a strong vertical velocity and density gradient.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hesse, Reinhard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301328v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff3657144</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical Oceanography.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical Geography.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cm84p"><dcterms:title>Genetic studies of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) using morphological, isozyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kongkiatngam, Prasert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Genetic variation within and between two cultivars of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), Essi from Europe and Ottawa from Canada was estimated using morphological, isozyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers.

Nine 10-mer primers were used to assay 20 individuals from each cultivar for RAPD markers. Each primer gave from 7 to 20 amplified bands with an average of 14.8 bands per primer. High within-cultivar variation was observed in both cultivars using both isozyme and RAPD markers. The mode of inheritance of seven isozyme loci: Aat-2, Amy-1, Est-4, Est-7, Pgd-1, Pgd-2 and Skd-1, in red clover was verified. The genetic basis of banding patterns for 16 other isozyme loci: Aat-3, Adh-1, Dia-1, Dia-2, Dia-3, Est-1, Est-2, Gpi-2, Idh-1, Mdh-1, Mdh-2, Mdh-3, Mdh-4, Me-1, Me-2 and Pgm-2, was also postulated, based on the segregation patterns observed within cultivars. Two pairs of linked enzyme-coding loci, Est-4/Est-7 and Pgd-2/Skd-1, were found with joint segregation analysis. Estimates of genetic variability of 15 red clover cultivars from three different origins indicated that within-cultivar variation was much higher than between-cultivar variation. Allele frequencies of these isozymes could discriminate the five North American cultivars assayed, but they could not differentiate cultivars from Europe and Japan.

Two sets of questionnaires were administered in order to elicit information pertaining to how surgeons communicate information to surrogates and to investigate how that information is received and processed by the surrogate. Results showed that while the obtaining of signed informed consent itself may not be a major problem, there are some difficulties in the communication between surgeons and surrogates in this domain. Based on the findings, recommendations for improved communication between surgeons and surrogates are proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Talley, William (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q823v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mh40m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physician and patient</dc:subject><dc:subject>Informed consent (Medical law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jd225"><dcterms:title>Neuropsychological performance, acute alcohol intoxication and aggression in adult males</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lau, Mark, 1959-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Epidemiological and laboratory research supports a relationship between acute alcohol intoxication and aggression. Recent data suggest that alcohol disrupts cognitive abilities associated with frontal lobe function. Moreover, neuropsychological research provides suggestive evidence that frontal lobe dysfunction may predispose an individual to increased aggression. The research recounted in this thesis was conducted to investigate the role of individual differences of cognitive abilities associated with the dorsolateral frontal cortex in aggressive behaviour and to test the hypothesis that alcohol indirectly potentiates aggression by impairing these cognitive abilities. The three experiments included in this thesis demonstrated that: (1) acute alcohol intoxication interferes with the ability to integrate previously acquired knowledge in the formulation of behavioral strategies; (2) individuals grouped according to performance on two neuropsychological tests of cognitive abilities associated with frontal lobe function differ in degree of aggressive response. Specifically, individuals in the lower versus upper performance quartiles became more aggressive when provoked; and (3) individuals in the upper cognitive performance quartile demonstrate significantly greater reductions of unprovoked aggression in response to monetary reward.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603r035p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jd225</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aggressiveness.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Frontal lobes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alcohol -- Physiological effect.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z284z"><dcterms:title>Study of heavy metal accumulation mechanisms in the Lachine Canal sediments</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Galvez de Cloutier, Rosa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Due to industrialization over the past 100 years, the sediments at the bottom of the Lachine Canal and Bay have become contaminated. This study investigated the heavy metal accumulation mechanisms within the Lachine Canal sediments and was carried out in three phases. Laboratory analytical and instrumental work were included. During Phase I, 28 parameters were measured on 44 samples collected along the Lachine Canal and Bay. The results revealed the presence of a wide variety of both organic and inorganic contaminants. Heavy metals such as Zn $&gt;$ Pb $&gt;$ Cr $&gt;$ Ni $&gt;$ Cu $&gt;$ Cu (in order of decreasing abundance) in addition to organic contaminants (PAH $&gt;$ MAH $&gt;$ PCBs) were found in high concentrations exceeding background concentrations and various quality criteria levels. The total load of both organic and inorganic contaminants was found to be higher in the canal than in the bay zone. Although a positive correlation existed in between % mineral clay fraction or TOC and the total cumulative load of heavy metals, the correlation could not be assessed as conclusive. Further study on the association heavy metal-sediment constituents (Phase II and III) was carried on the canal zone. X-ray diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy and other geochemical analysis revealed that the sediments consisted mainly of silt and clay size fractions composed of: illite, kaolinite and chlorite, calcite and dolomite and minor amounts of Fe- minerals, organic matter and amorphous metal oxides. Each of these constituents bound heavy metals at varying degrees as assessed by a sequential extraction (SE) protocol. The partition distribution pattern was ruled by the geochemical setting. The associations with each phase were (in order of decreasing significance): (1) residual phase Pb (50%) = Cd (50%) $&gt;$ Cr (49%) $&gt;$ Zn (20%), (2) oxide phase Zn (33%) $&gt;$ Pb (32%) $&gt;$ Cr (28%) $&gt;$ Cd (10%), (3) carbonate phase Zn (38%) $&gt;$ Cd (26%) $&gt;$ Pb (13%) $&gt;$ Cr (5%), (4) the organic phase Cr (14%) $&gt;$ Zn (8%) $&gt;$ Cd (6%) $&gt;$ Pb (5%) and (5) the exchangeable phase Cd (8%) $&gt;$ Cr (4%) $&gt;$ Zn (1%) = Pb (1%). The order of abundance in terms of total concentration was 1300 mg Zn/kg, 500 mg Pb/kg, 90 mg Cr/kg and 10 mg Cd/kg. According to the cation exchange capacity (CEC), carbonate and oxide content measurements, the heavy-metals occupied a minor fraction of the total capacity to retain metals by these mechanisms. The SE results revealed that the partition patterns varied with pH. The phases associated to the carbonate and the exchangeable phases were the most sensitive to a change in pH with the residual phase being almost unchanged. The Zn and Cd were sensitive to release when the conditions drifted to acidic conditions. Towards basic conditions no change in the metal distribution was observed. The partition patterns for various grain size fractions (${}175 mu$m) revealed that no particular fraction accumulated a certain heavy metal. However, a small increment of heavy metal content with decreasing grain size was found for Zn, Pb and Cd while the contrary was found for Cr. The metal distribution of each grain size fraction followed the pattern under unsieved conditions. Additionally, it was found that the geotechnical behaviour of sediments was influenced by the chemical composition of the sediments specially with respect to water retention.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yong, Raymond N.

This laminin binding protein, LBP120, is closely to dystroglycan-$ alpha$, part of a complex of proteins associated with dystrophin, the product of the gene that is absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Five peptides from purified bovine brain LBP120, ranging in size from 7 to 19 residues, are up to 100% identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of muscle dystroglycan-$ alpha$ (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya, O., Ervasti J. M., Leveille, C. J., Slaughter, C. A., Sernett, S. W., and Campbell, K. P., (1992) Nature 355, 696-702). The glycosylation and extracellular localization of LBP120/dystroglycan-$ alpha$ are consistent with it being a cell surface laminin receptor. It binds, either as a native protein, or following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, with high affinity (K$ sb{ rm d}$ = 90 nM) to native laminin and more specifically, to a proteolytic fragment of laminin (E3) composed of two globular (G)-type repeats and containing the major heparin binding domain. This binding is Ca$ sp{++}$ dependent and inhibited by low concentrations of heparin. The presence of G-type repeats in the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregating protein agrin suggested that it might also be a ligand for dystroglycan-$ alpha$. Agrin, like laminin, binds specifically to dystroglycan-$ alpha$ in in vitro assays. This binding is calcium dependent and is inhibited by MAb IIH6 against dystroglycan-$ alpha$, by heparin and laminin, but not by fibronectin. Dystroglycan-$ alpha$ and utrophin (dystrophin-related protein (DRP)) are concentrated within AChR aggregates in cultures of C2 myotubes. In S27 cells, which do not aggregate AChRs spontaneously, agrin and laminin binding to dystroglycan-$ alpha$ are dramatically decreased.

Subsequently, new types of poly(aryl ether sulfone)s, poly(aryl ether ketone)s, polyesters, polyformals, polyimides, poly(phenylene oxide)s and cyclic aryl ether oligomers containing the internal trans-1,2-diphenylcyclopropane, ethylene, chalcone, epoxide and 2-pyrazoline moieties were synthesized from these monomers by condensation polymerization reactions. Characterization of and cross-linking studies on these polymers were carried out utilizing DSC, TGA, TMA, GPC and NMR. The prepared polymers are high molecular weight, amorphous and soluble in common organic solvents. The polymers can be thermally cross-linked.

Those periodicities are related to the helicoidal pitch of such organisations. Furthermore, specific structural defects were observed in sections of the chiral nematic films. These defects are associated with a parabolic focal conic texture. Chiral nematic gels were produced by $ gamma$-ray irradiation of (hydroxypropyl)cellulose (HPC) mesophases in water or methanol. Solid/liquid extraction performed on irradiated HPC films and mesophases allow us to evaluate their respective degrees of crosslinking. Optical microscopy, TEM and AFM results showed that a chiral nematic order is preserved in the crosslinked mesophases. Helicoidal suspensions of cellulosic microfibrils were prepared by acidic hydrolysis of wood pulp. Solid films, dried from these microfibril suspensions, show that the chiral nematic arrangement of the cellulosic microfibrils can be maintained in a solid material. Basic morphological data on chiral nematic films made from cellulosic microfibrils are given in this thesis. The origin of the strong contrast observed in TEM images of sections of chiral nematic cellulosic materials is discussed.

In this thesis, macrophage cell lines derived from the bone marrow of B10.A (B10S macrophages) and B10A.$Bcg sp{r}$ (B10R macrophages) were used to study functional parameters associated with Bcg gene activity. We have discovered that there is a significant difference in the production of NO$ sb2 sp-$ of B10S as compared with B10R macrophages in response to IFN-$ gamma.$ The bacteriostatic activity against M. bovis BCG was higher in B10R macrophages compared to B10S macrophages. The bacteriostatic activity of B10R and B10S macrophages correlated with the amount of nitric oxide produced by the macrophages. The antimycobacterial activity was inhibited by N$ rm sp{g}$MMLA, a specific inhibitor of nitrite and nitrate synthesis from L-arginine. Addition of L-arginine to IFN-$ gamma$-stimulated macrophages in the presence of N$ rm sp{g}$MMLA restored nitrite production and bacteriostatic activity of macrophages. Northern blot analysis of macrophage nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) revealed that the difference in NO$ sb2 sp-$ production by IFN-$ gamma$ treated B10S and B10R lines was reflective of the difference in iNOS mRNA expression. The Bcg gene differentially affects the ability of BCG-resistant and -susceptible strains of mice to express important macrophage genes including Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II genes. We have found that differences at the level of I-A$ sb beta$ gene transcription, and I-A$ sb beta$ and I-A$ sb alpha$ mRNA stability may be responsible for observed differences between steady-state levels of I-A$ sb beta$ mRNA in B10R and B10S macrophages and consequently in the Ia surface protein expression. Differences observed in protein binding to the X box may explain the difference in transcription activation of the I-A$ sb beta$ gene. In addition, we found that B10R macrophages transfected with an Nramp-1 antisense cDNA containing a ribozyme construct expressed lower amounts of Ia antigen compared to mock-transfected macrophages in response to IFN-$ gamma.$ Overall, these findings strongly suggest involvement of the Nramp-1/Bcg gene in the control of Ia antigen expression in macrophages. Finally, I have developed a new PCR-based method that allow an assessment of the mycobacterial content of infected macrophages. This method allows an assessment of the level of M. bovis BCG infection from a variety of sources, including peritoneal macrophages and macrophage lines, within a few hours, making it an assay of choice for rapid determination of the level of mycobacterial growth in infected cells, in experimental models of mycobacterial infection.

Understanding the cause of the rapid growth rate of malignant gliomas would be useful in devising new therapeutic strategies to treat this disorder. Previous work from this laboratory suggested that the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) was a critical regulator of the hyperproliferative state of glioma cells. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that (1) PKC activity was differentially increased in glioma cell lines when compared to other fast growing cell types of non-glial origin, (2) inhibitors of PKC (staurosporine, tamoxifen, CGP 41 251) block the proliferation rate of glioma cells at IC50 values that correspond to their respective IC50's for inhibition of PKC activity, (3) of the PKC isoforms, rat astrocytes and rat glioma cells contain $ alpha, beta, delta, varepsilon$ and $ zeta$, but not $ gamma$, (4) of the expressed isoforms, the activity and amounts of PKC$ alpha$ correlate with cellular growth and (5) an anti-sense oligonucleotide directed against PKC$ alpha$ decreases the proliferation rate of glioma cells.

An understanding of the nutrient status of the rice rhizosphere is essential for the development of appropriate management practices to increase rice yields. Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one aspect of rice nutrition. Increased rice root respiration and P uptake efficiency, and an increase in H$ sp{+}$ released from roots and enhanced solubility of calcium phosphates are two possible mechanisms of tolerance to low P levels. These mechanisms were evaluated but could not be used as single tests to differentiate among cultivars for tolerance to P deficiency. Phosphorus reactions in the soil may be confounded by the chemistry of iron (Fe). Iron and P interactions in the rice rhizosphere were investigated using a Philippine paddy soil. Root loss of oxygen (O$ sb2$) into the rhizosphere caused the oxidation of Fe$ sp{2+}$ and the concurrent release of H$ sp{+}$. Root release of H$ sp{+}$ from cation-anion uptake imbalances also contributed to the acidification of the rhizosphere. Accumulation of Fe$ sp{3+}$ was found next to the root plane.

The evidence suggesting the existence of receptor subtypes is based on the differential potencies in several in vitro and in vivo bioassays of the C-terminal fragment, CGRP$ sb{8-37}$ and the linear analogue, (acetamidomethyl-cysteine$ sp{2,7}$) CGRP$ alpha$. The CGRP$ sb1$ is particularly sensitive to the antagonistic properties of CGRP$ sb{8-37}$ whereas the linear analogue acts preferentially as an agonist on the CGRP$ sb2$ receptors. The primary focus of my thesis was therefore to provide novel evidence for the existence of multiple CGRP receptor sites in peripheral and especially brain tissues. Taken together, the findings of my thesis support the existence of functionally distinct receptors for CGRP and related peptides in the rat brain.

Mutant proteins of the multifunctional Mu transposase were constructed in vitro in order to locate regions of the enzyme that may be important for function. Deletions in the Mu A gene yielded two mutant proteins that help to define the end-specific DNA-binding domain. The insertion of two or four amino acids at eight different sites produced six mutant transposase proteins that were inhibited for $ mu$Mu transposition in vivo, but not DNA binding in vitro, at 37$ sp circ$C. In addition, site-specific mutagenesis was performed to alter tyrosine 414, an amino acid which is situated in a region that displays amino acid homology to the active sites of other nicking-closing enzymes. The A and B genes of transposable phage D3112 were cloned and sequenced in order to compare their gene products to those from the analogous genes of ccliphage Mu.
