Further results are given with the underlying Lebesgue space replaced by a homogeneous measure algebra. It is also shown, in chapter III, that ergodic transformations are algebraically distinguishable from non-ergodics. Chapter IV introduces the notion of a fibered ergodic transformation. A fibered analogue of Dye's theorem is proved. In chapter V the family of transformations satisfying Dye's theorem for two fixed ergodics is shown to be dense in the coarse topology. Finally, in chapter VI, the concept of a triangle set in the unit square is introduced.

A. (Mohamed A.), 1932-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is an attempt to analyze some of the social psychological underpinnings of the contemporary trends in postponement of marriage and possible increase in singlehood in the U. S. Recent census data, for 1970-78 specifically, and for 1960 to date generally, show marked increases in that direction among the young marriageables 18 to 34 years old. After reviewing the available literatue, we have identified three loosely defined categories of writings that exist on the topic, namely, "psychological-ideological", "structural", and "social psychological." For reasons of parsimony, as well as in view of other theoretical considerations, we favor the social psychological analyses as a source of our hypotheses in this study. Therefore, utilizing primarily social psychological theory and research we have proposed a model relating the peer group, the family, and selected personality variables to traditionalism in individual sex role perceptions and to singlehood predispositon, and stated thirteen hypotheses which were tested from empirical data gathered for the study. The data were gathered by the use of a questionnaire which was administered to a probability sample of some four hundred and fifty undergraduate students on the campus of a small, private, independent, midwestern university in the fall of 1976. The actual sample size used in the analysis consisted of 394 students (233 males and 161 females): some 56 questionnaires had to be rejected for various reasons such as those with incomplete responses, or those completed by married or divorced individuals, etc. The data tended to support some of our hypotheses and indicated rejection of others thus providing only selective support for our over all model. Our central hypothesis positing a negative correlation between the degree of traditionalism in individual sex role perceptions and singlehood predisposition was supported by our data for males only even though we obtained a somewhat low correlation (Gamma = -.130). For females we found a relatively stronger positive association (Gamma = +.37). It is our interpretation that the more the females perceive traditionalism in societal sex role definitions the more they are likely to choose the singlehood alternative. It seems that future work and career plans may be important factors in current marriage postponement among the college females studied. We found a strong association between future work and career plans and singlehood for females (Gamma = +.622). Marriage interest in general is still very high in this generation and all but a small minority intend to marry ultimately. There is also strong attitudinal support for the "liberal" view of sex rule definitions in general. Our most significant findings were in the area of male-female differences where we frequently found correlations in the opposite directions for the two sexes. The study found the males to be a bit more likely to uphold traditional view of sex roles. Whereas personality variables (assertiveness and dependence) appeared to be unrelated to the degree of traditionalism in individual sex role perceptions and to singlehood predisposition, happiness and conflict in the family of orientation seemed to influence marriage decisions. Males from happy families and females from unhappy families of orientation were somewhat more likely to choose marriage; at the same time there is low positive correlation between family conflict and choosing marriage for males and negative correlation for females in this respect. We find it challenging to extrapolate from our data and analysis the implication that those men who marry or those who prefer to remain single choose those states for different, even opposite, reasons from those of the females. What meaning this has for the marriages of those who do marry and for the sex role relationships of those who remain single is an intriguing question somewhat beyond the scope of our present study.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm429.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wd59d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Single people -- United States -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marriage -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex differences (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>College students -- United States -- Attitudes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex role.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bc50w"><dcterms:title>Precipitation, recrystallization and solute strengthening in microalloyed steels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Akben, Melek G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Constant strain rate compression and torsion tests were carried out isothermally at temperatures of 875 to 1075(DEGREES)C on a series of six steels. The base steel had a composition of 0.06% C and 1.43% Mn and the others contained one of the following sets of additions: (i) 0.035% Nb; (ii) 0.035% Nb + 0.115% V; (iii) 0.035% Nb + 0.30% Mo; (iv) 0.035% Nb + 1.90% Mn; (v) 0.115% V. The tests were conducted to determine the effects of Mn, Mo, Nb and V, singly and in combination, on the high temperature flow and recrystallization behavior of the materials. The dynamic precipitation kinetics for Nb(CN) and VN were determined by the Weiss method. The two PTT curves were similar, with the nose of the VN curve being situated at a slightly lower temperature (885 vs. 900(DEGREES)C) and at a somewhat longer time (26 vs. 16 s), in agreement with the lower equilibrium solution temperature of VN. The dynamic precipitation kinetics of Nb(CN) were retarded by the addition of Mn, V or Mo. This retardation is attributed to the increased carbonitride solubility that follows the addition of these elements because of the way in which they decrease the C and N activity coefficients. RTT curves were constructed for dynamic recrystallization in the six steels investigated. These were derived from the peak strains of the compression flow curves, as determined at a strain rate of 3.7 x 10('-2)s('-1). Recrystallization occurred earliest in the plain C steel followed fairly quickly by the 0.115% V steel. All of the Nb bearing steels recrystallized considerably later, with the greatest retardation being noted in the 0.3% Mo steel, where it was nearly twice that due to Nb addition alone. This very large effect, and the retardation due to each of the transition elements, is explained in terms of the electronic differences between iron and the particular element. The effect of the atomic size differences with respect to iron is also considered. The strengthening due to the presence of Mn, Mo, Nb and V in solution was determined from the yield strengths of these steels. The increment in yield strength over that of the plain C steel was determined as 70% and 7% per 0.1 at.% of Nb and V when each is added singly. The strengthening increased to 80% and 8% respectively for these elements when present jointly in austenite. The strength increments were 9% for Mo and 1.3% for Mn per 0.1 at.% when added to a 0.035% Nb steel. The rank order of these effects is also explained in terms of the electronic and atomic size differences, and a possible reason for the synergistic effect (e.g. in the case of Nb and V in a Nb-V steel) is proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh60n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc50w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Austenite.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel, High strength.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Recrystallization (Metallurgy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel alloys.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb397921v"><dcterms:title>Studies of hemodynamic responses to cardiac tamponade in the chicken (Gallus domesticus)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Light, Margaret Jean Constable.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cardiac tamponade hypotension was produced in White Leghorn roosters by infusion of saline into the pericardial sac. Concomitant with the decrease in arterial pressure to 50 mm Hg, the central venous pressure increased 8-fold (up to 12 mm Hg). Despite this marked venous congestion the response to cardiac tamponade was characterized by a significant increase in plasma volume due to the influx of protein-poor interstitial fluid into the vasculature. The mechanisms underlying the hemodilution response in the roosters were markedly different from those involved in the hemodilution response to hypotension in mammals. The observed hemodilution was not mediated by a glucose osmotic gradient and did not appear to involve activation of the sympathoadrenal axis. The increase in central venous pressure was not transmitted to the microvasculature of skeletal muscle. The plasma volume expansion appeared to be due to passive transfer of the fall in arterial pressure to the microcirculation; this indicated a predominant arterial influence on the skeletal muscle microvasculature in the chicken. Studies on the disruption of normal steady state hemodynamics in the rooster by pressure perturbations imposed by cardiac tamponade suggested that the regulation of normal fluid balance in the chicken was different from that in mammals. Summation of the steady state Starling parameters governing fluid exchange (capillary hydrostatic pressure + tissue oncotic pressure - plasma oncotic presure - tissue hydrostatic pressure) indicated a large imablance in favor of a net fluid filtration from the bloodstream. The maintenance of fluid balance in the chicken appears to involve factors other than those outlined by Starling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg80h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397921v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rh89v"><dcterms:title>The effects of stimulus novelty on viewing time and processing efficiency in hyperactive children /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ain, Marilyn Esther.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Four studies were designed to examine the effects of stimulus novelty on looking time, preference, and processing efficiency in hyperactive children. Two control groups were selected; normal children and nonhyperactive poor readers. According to underarousal theories of hyperactivity, the hyperactives should show a unique, heightened attraction to novel stimuli. Novelty was defined in two ways, as incongruity and as unfamiliarity. The responses of all three groups varied systematically as a function of the changes in novelty. There was limited evidence that the hyperactives were unusually attracted to the novel materials. Although they initially spent more time viewing the incongruous stimuli, this heightened interest was short-lived. Furthermore, this attraction was not apparent in their preference judgments, or in their looking time for unfamiliar stimuli. Tests of recognition and speeded matching indicated that the hyperactives needed more time than normals to process both ordinary and novel stimuli. However, they did not take this extra time unless they were motivated by the presentation of incongruous stimuli or were guided by the experimenter. Poor readers, in contrast, showed no special attraction to novelty. They tended to adopt a slower free-viewing pace than normals, possibly due to difficulty processing complex materials. However, they did not differ from normal children in speed or accuracy of matching simple stimuli.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp04c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rh89v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hyperactive children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human information processing in children.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x4872"><dcterms:title>Methadone hydrochloride : effects of acute administration on disposition and hepatic functions in adult and perinatal guinea pigs</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pak, Raphael C.

The thesis traces this theme to certain classic and romantic ideas about art in the nineteenth-century American romance, as well as to the literary theories of such modernists as T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf, and to the theories of such disparate writers as, among others, the New Critics and Alain Robbe-Grillet. The ideas and structure of Gaddis' novels are located and discussed in relation to this context. Like many contemporary novelists, Gaddis transposes his themes into the reflexive structures of his works. His development of self-referring form culminates in JR, a novel in which language is itself the structural and thematic focus. This thesis shows that, although Gaddis' novels demonstrate the modernist tenet that art vindicates life, they are also powerful satires which express the writer's concern for the social relevance of art.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w0777.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq57f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gaddis, William, 1922- -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vr74b"><dcterms:title>Studies on morphine analgesia in an animal model of tonic pain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Abbott, Frances V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dose-response relation and tolerance pattern of morphine in the formalin test, an animal model of tonic pain, were shown to be similar to those observed clinically in man.

Before, during and after TENS and placebo stimulation on Day$ sb1$, Day$ sb5$ and Day$ sb{10}$, the FR was elicited by electrically stimulating the sole of subject's right foot and recorded electromyographically from biceps femoris (BF) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Subjective pain sensation was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). Compared to placebo stimulation, a single session of 60 min TENS significantly decreased the VAS scores (p $&lt;$ 0.05) and TA FR areas (p $&lt;$ 0.05) obtained during the 60 min post-stimulation period. However, the between-group difference in the decrease of the BF FR area did not reach statistical significance. After 10 repeated daily applications of TENS, the pre-stimulation VAS scores and FR areas of both muscles were significantly more inhibited (p $&lt;$ 0.01) than placebo stimulation. Furthermore, the suppression of VAS scores during and after TENS was linearly correlated with that of FR areas of both muscles in each of the 3 testing days. These findings indicated that repeated daily TENS applications produced cumulative inhibitory influence on both subjective pain sensation and FR over a two-week period. Such a gradual development probably implicated that plastic changes could have been induced in the neural pathway. The similar time course of the inhibitory effects of TENS on the two pain indices, which could cumulate over time, suggest possible similar processing at both cortical (subjective pain) and spinal (FR) levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hui-Chan, Christina W.

Over 14 million tonnes of kelp are estimated to be available for harvesting every year, but only 6.3% is harvested, mostly for food products or alginate extraction. The inclusion of kelp in an animal's ration has been found by several researchers to have a beneficial effect on the animal's health and productivity. High concentrations of kelp in an animal's ration, however, can have detrimental effects on the animal's health due to toxic levels of certain inorganic salts. By including a dewatering operation in the production of dried kelp meal, much of the soluble salts present in the kelp will be removed with the filtrate. The filtrate would also be valuable as a source of potassium, trace minerals, and phyto-hormones for crops. Energy costs for dewatering are also much lower than for drying. Because kelp is difficult to dewater using conventional methods, a combined fields technique using electro-osmosis and mechanical pressure was investigated. Electric current and pressure were both found to have a significant positive effect on dewatering. Dewatering resulted in significantly lower ash and available carbohydrate fractions, while having no other significant effect on kelp meal composition. The combined fields dewatering resulted in significant total energy savings over conventional dewatering or drying alone. The combined fields dewatering process was successfully scaled up to a continuous process using a prototype roller press. The press was able to produce a press cake with up to 32% solids. The continuous process resulted in significantly lower ash content and significantly higher protein. The total energy to produce kelp meal with the roller press was found to be about half of the energy required for drying alone.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raghavan, G. S. V.

Exposure of rat neonatal muscle cells in culture to TPO on a long-term (days) and short-term (minutes) basis resulted in the inhibition of $ sp{125}$I-$ alpha$-bungarotoxin (BGT) binding. Short-term pretreatment with TPO also led to a decrease in carbachol-stimulated $ sp{22}$Na uptake; however, long-term exposure resulted in an enhanced carbachol-stimulated uptake. Chronic treatment also resulted in greater muscle cell morphological development. These results suggest that TPO regulates the nAChR and exerts trophic effects on myotube morphology. As another approach to study factors that affect nAChR expression, non-muscle cells were transfected with MyoD cDNA. After transfection, saturable, high affinity $ sp{125}$I-$ alpha$-BGT binding was readily detectable, as was carbachol-stimulated $ sp{22}$Na uptake.

This work shows that the nAChR function and expression can be regulated through (a) the chronic interaction of TPO at the nAChR at the cell surface and (b) the action of MyoD at the gene level. ftn$ sp *$ As stated in the addendum to this thesis, recent work by Quik et al. 1993a has shown that the preparation presumed to be TPO, contained $ alpha$-cobratoxin; the effects observed in the present thesis must therefore now be attributed to the presence of $ alpha$-cobratoxin contaminant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quik, Maryka (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569541z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d738h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st497"><dcterms:title>Herbage productivity and goat performance from legume-seeded pasture (fodder banks) managed by small-scale farmers in Nigeria</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Oji, Michael Isaiah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study was conducted on the grazing of West African Dwarf (WAD) goats managed by 41 farmers in Nigeria.

There were no significant differences among the grazing systems with regard to birth weights and 3-month body weight (weaning weight). However, during the 3 to 6-month growth period, the ADG of goats tethered on natural pasture was higher than that observed for goats grazing S. hamata seeded pasture or fenced natural pasture, but this difference disappeared with time. At the 12-month period goats grazing fodder banks were heavier than goats tethered on natural pasture during the late wet season period, but the effect was not significant. Although animals lost weight during the late rainy season, animals grazing fodder banks seemed to have lost less weight than those grazing natural pasture.

The study was restricted to near-stream processes, particularly how the chemistry of water leaving a hillslope influenced stream chemistry. For snowmelt, 1986, a number of naturally occurring chemical elements were used to separate stream flow into three subsurface flowpaths: groundwater, solum and upwelling flow. By quantifying upwelling flow, we introduced a new approach to identify solutions forced from the groundwater up through the solum before entering the channel. In upwelling flow, we found that dissolved silicon was reactive and total aluminum, monomeric aluminum, hydronium, magnesium and fluoride were non-reactive. For spring storms, 1992, we used an end member mixing approach to describe streamwater as a combination of chemically distinct solutions from different depths in the soil. Solutions were defined by concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and dissolved silicon. The contributions of water from each soil depth were estimated using the variations in end member chemistry that were measured during the storms. Hydrological reconstructions of the events were possible and it was found that the contribution of water from each depth in podzols is related to the height of the water table in the near-stream soils.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendershot, W.

Regardless of its source, cellulose displayed a relatively high characteristic emission. The emission spectra of mechanical pulps were red-shifted with respect to that of cellulose, and peak shapes were influenced by the pulping process, by hydrogen peroxide bleaching and by monochromatic UV irradiation of the sheets. Changes in emission spectra due to bleaching or UV-irradiation occurred principally in the 370-440 and 500-550 nm regions, and were similar to changes in reflectance spectra reported in the literature. Fluorescence emission spectra of commercial lignins and lignin model compounds were blue-shifted with respect to mechanical pulps, even upon absorption of the fluorophores on solid substrates. Concentration and inner filter effects were evident in emission spectra of commercial lignins, at concentrations as low as 60 ppm. These results suggest that, to a first approximation, emission spectra of mechanical pulps may be interpreted as a decrease in emission of cellulose caused by light absorption by lignin; changes due to bleaching and irradiation may be attributed to changes in lignin absorption.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray, Derek G.

These factors were explored with 179 women chosen to reflect varying frequencies of drug use. In addition, patient-physician interaction was evaluated by psychiatrists' diagnostic and prescriptive reactions to differing patient attributes. Multidimensional scaling interpretations across drug frequency groups indicated that external causal attribution and lack of control were concomitants of drug use. Deficient problem-solving, particularly at the definitional stage, accounted for 21% of drug use variance, discriminating 73% of drug users.

This conjecture quickly gained a wide popularity and, at the end of 1970, it was established by H. Fleischner. His proof of the existence of a hamiltonian cycle in the square of a block does not explicitly provide an algorithm for finding the cycle. The thesis will describe such an algorithm, with a running time O(n('2)) on every input with n vertices. For the most part, our algorithm follows closely the original lines of Fleischner's proof. The main difference occurs at the part where Fleischner proves the existence of a certain spanning subgraph in every connected bridgeless graph: we replace Fleischner's argument by a radically different one.

The hypothesis of this study was that protein glycation and oxygen free radicals play a role in hyperglycemia-induced malformations. CD-1 mouse embryos (0-2 somites) were cultured under hyperglycemic conditions for 48 hours with the exogenous addition of anti-glycating agents and oxygen free radical scavengers. The exogenous addition of aspirin (ASA) and D-lysine reduced significantly the malformations and embryonic glycated protein levels. Salicylate, arachidonic acid (AA), and to a lesser extent, indomethacin also exerted protective effects, but with no effect on glycated protein levels. We hypothesize that ASA, salicylate and indomethacin are protective by exerting free radical scavenging action; and ASA and D-lysine are acting as potent anti-glycating agents. Moreover, we suggest that AA may have inhibited hyperglycemia-induced malformations through the protective action of prostaglandins against free radical damage. Serum media lipid peroxidation (LPO) was reduced in the ASA and indomethacin groups possibly due to either a direct free radical scavenging action and/or the inhibitory effects of these agents on cyclooxygenase activity thereby decreasing the oxygen free radicals produced by this enzyme system. On the other hand, AA was associated with an increased level of LPO in the serum media. As the evidence has shown, the cause of hyperglycemia-induced malformations appears to be multifactorial and no one agent can completely eliminate the problem, although protective action can be exerted at different levels of the glycation-free radical cascade of tissue damage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kubow, S.

The sample consisted of Italian grandmothers from two groups of families: intact families (N = 30) in which grandmothers' adult children were in first marriages; and divorced families (N = 23) in which grandmothers' adult children were permanently separated or divorced. Level of involvement was operationalized in terms of contact, specifically frequency of visitation and telephone calls, between a grandparent and a grandchild. Variables that have been found to influence contact (a grandparent's custodial and kinship relationships, geographic distance, age of both grandparent and grandchild, and grandparent-parent accord) were also assessed. A grandparent's role within the family was operationalized in terms of their level of agreement to statements made by grandparents about their roles as involved family members, special protectors of grandchildren, available family members, conveyers of cultural traditions, and family "watchdogs". A grandparent's view with respect to contemporary family issues was assessed through their responses to statements about contemporary family life. The results indicate that contact was significantly greater between grandmothers and grandchildren in the intact as opposed to the divorced group. Grandmothers' roles within the family as well as their attitudes towards various family issues were not found to differ across family type. The findings were discussed in light of cultural and ethnic perspectives on divorce.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Derevensky, Jeffrey L.

Experiments are described which demonstrate a competitive difference between the mating types of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga with two isogamous mating types, mt + and mt $-.$ When grown vegetatively under phototrophic (light) conditions, mt + outcompetes mt $-.$ Assays of the growth parameters of isolated spores suggest that mt + has a higher growth rate than mt $-$ in the light, and that mt $-$ has a higher growth rate than mt + in heterotrophic (dark) growth conditions. A literature review shows that sampling from natural populations of heterothallic, facultatively sexual species often yields only one mating type or significantly skewed mating-type distributions. This indicates that competition between mating types and the consequent loss of one mating type may be common in these populations. A discussion of current theories on the evolution of heterothallism as well as the results of a simulation model reveal that heterothallism will spread if any fitness reduction is suffered by in-crossing homothallic individuals. However, fitness differences between the heterothallic alleles allow the invasion of a homothallic allele into a heterothallic population. The implications of mating type competition on the maintenance and distribution of heterothallic populations in nature are discussed. It is argued that heterothallic, facultatively sexual populations commonly lose the potential for sex because of the loss of one mating-type allele. The prediction is made that homothallism is more common among facultatively sexual organisms than it is among obligately sexual organisms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, Graham (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n38t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838145w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii -- Reproduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition (Biology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f661q"><dcterms:title>Habitat selection and reproductive biology of the loggerhead shrike in eastern Ontario and Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chabot, Amy A.

Shrikes returned from wintering areas in April and egg laying began by the end of April and early May. The population of Loggerhead Shrikes in eastern Ontario was found to consist of 51 pairs distributed over three core areas, each associated with a limestone plain. Only one pair of birds was found breeding in the province of Quebec in 1991 and 2 in 1992. Shrikes nested in hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and other species, most often inactively grazed pastures. Suitable historic nesting sites were reoccupied and there was a high rate of reoccupancy of 1991 sites in 1992. Breeding territory selection was affected by the amount of habitat fragmentation around a site, but nest site selection appeared to be random within a suitable territory. Shrikes nesting in Ontario have a high rate of reproductive success (58 to 93%). The number of fledglings per nest is high, however, only half survive the 3 to 4 weeks needed to become independent of their parents (2.30 of 3.90 in 1991 and 2.50 of 4.17 in 1992). Shrikes were found to renest several times and double brooding was observed. More time was spent hunting and feeding mates and young as the demand for food increased through the reproductive cycle.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh672.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f661q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Québec (Province) -- Reproduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Ontario -- Reproduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Habitat -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Loggerhead shrike -- Habitat -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591925f"><dcterms:title>Visual filtering and covert orienting in persons with Down syndrome</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Randolph, Beth</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A forced-choice reaction time (RT) task was used to examine the relations between covert orienting (shifts of visual attention independent of eye movement) and filtering (the inhibition of processing of irrelevant stimuli) components of attention in persons with Down syndrome (n = 17) and children of average intelligence (n = 17) matched for mental age (MA), (MA = approximately 5 years).
