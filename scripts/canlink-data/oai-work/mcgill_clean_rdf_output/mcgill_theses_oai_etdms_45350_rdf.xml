A computer program, used to determine target coordinates from planar stereotactic image pairs, has been developed. Digital subtraction angiography images, obtained with a localizer attachment affixed to the stereotactic frame, are analyzed with the program for the localization of certain malformations. During treatment set-up verification, the center of the radiation distribution is determined using portal linear accelerator images of the collimated radiosurgery beam, with the patient in the final treatment position and without removal of the radiosurgical collimator. A custom portal localizer attachment has been developed in-house for this purpose. Localization results obtained with a test phantom show a maximum deviation of 0.4 mm from the known target locations. The program has also been shown to be effective in detecting a misalignment between a localized target and the treatment radiation center during set-up verification.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311q33z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs82d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zr91r"><dcterms:title>Effects of sodium chloride supplementation on urinary calcium, other urine and blood electrolytes and parathyroid hormone levels in postmenopausal women</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zarkadas, Marion</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch72s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr91r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Nutrition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calcium in the body.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sodium in the body.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Menopause.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mg640"><dcterms:title>The reindeer years : contribution of A.

Selective attention was defined as the children's abilities to identify and respond to a target stimulus on a forced choice reaction time task. Distractibility was considered to be the extent to which the children's performances on the task were interfered with by extraneous stimuli in the visual field. Conditions on the task varied with regard to the presence or absence and location (close and far) of distracting stimuli and the presence or absence and size (small, medium and large) of boundary cues. Participants included 10 children with Down syndrome and 10 children of normal intelligence matched for mental age. The primary finding of this study was that the performance of children with Down syndrome was more adversely affected by the presence of distractors than that of the children of normal intelligence. This finding indicates that children with Down syndrome suffer from selective attention deficits and increased distractibility. The selective attention of children with Down syndrome is characterized as distractor-controlled as a result of a defective attentional (zoom) lens that "wanders" in visual space.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b93c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz60n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Down syndrome</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149q92j"><dcterms:title>The politics of knowledge : a critical theoretical approach to feminist epistemology and its educational implications</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Todd, Sharon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Stemming from the dialectical concepts of critical epistemology developed by feminism and Critical Theory (specifically, the Frankfurt School), this thesis attempts to articulate the political dimension of knowledge and to demonstrate how this dimension is incorporated into the liberatory pedagogical theory of Paulo Freire, Henry Giroux and various feminist authors. Hence the epistemological significance of domination and oppression is explored in relation to the concepts of subjectivity and objectivity held by critical epistemology. In ultimately aiming at liberation from social oppression, both Critical Theory and feminist epistemology provide theoretical insights into the social construction of knowledge, the intersubjective character of knowledge and the depth psychological dimension of the knower. It is maintained that a synthesis of these insights can provide the groundwork for a liberatory educational theory based on the interrelation between experience and knowledge. Also, in dialectical interaction, a liberatory educational theory provides a means for actualizing the liberatory aim of critical epistemology.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk579.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149q92j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feminism and education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminist theory</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g860v"><dcterms:title>Graham Greene : the link to fantasy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tracey, Linda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Graham Greene has stated that he believes there to be an undercurrent of fantasy running through all of his work that has largely gone unnoticed by his critics. Within the context of any discussion on Greene can be found a starting point for an evaluation of his work in terms of the fantastic and fantasy. Eric S. Rabkin defines fantasy as the inverse of reality. In a fantasy world, the ground rules, expectations, and perspectives of everyday experience are reversed, or diametrically opposed, and the effect is a sense of hesitation and wonder. All of Greene's fiction describes worlds divided. He constructs borders that continuously separate people, places, situations, motivations, perspectives, objectives, and states of mind. Each side of the border describes a world that is the opposite of the other. The reality of one side is turned over on the other side, and life on the border is unpredictable and uncertain. The concept of alternate realities and other worlds which characterize fantasies, can be applied to all of Greene's works in general, and more specifically to a particular group of the fiction which exhibits a much higher degree of fantastic content.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx293.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g860v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Greene, Graham, 1904-1991 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w356v"><dcterms:title>Thermo-chemical recovery of styrene from polystyrene waste</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marc, Katya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Styrene was recovered from polystyrene by thermo-chemical treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere carried out at 330$ sp circ$C to 410$ sp circ$C, for 30 to 60 minutes.

The creative work is entitled "Les lits clos". It is a compilation of nine novels imprint with black humor. This creative work tends to demonstrate that daily routine is a source of black humor and that reality is nothing but the perception that everyone makes of it. "Les lits clos" will be preceded by a critical study which intends to explain what is black humor by following Andre Breton, founder of that term. First of all we will discuss of Jacques Vache who, in his correspondence with Andre Breton, was interested to what he called "Umour". Then we will see how Breton, using Freud's theory, has refined objective humor created by Hegel. Black humor is at first a search for freedom, moreover the desire to overcome death. Black humor is nourished by the imagination to recover the origin of image. The black humorist lies between the subjective and the objective and tends to stay in balance within each other.

Polyethylene was degraded in a stirred, batch reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction temperatures that were investigated ranged between 375$ sp circ$C and 421$ sp circ$C. The reaction time ranged between 20 and 50 minutes. Three major products were collected, an insoluble solid residue, a condensable wax that was volatile during the reaction, and a residual wax that was not volatile during the reaction. It was determined that above 409$ sp circ$C, 90% of the original resin weight was converted to both the volatile and residual wax. Both waxes had a final Mn of 400 to 500. Analysis revealed that the volatile wax was a mixture of straight chain hydrocarbons, with 4% of the carbon bonds unsaturated. The residual wax was a mixture of hydrocarbons, both straight and branched components. No liquid product was collected, and gaseous components did not exceed 10% of the original resin weight.

While her protagonists include both male and female, in the three novels, The Old Jest, The Christmas Tree, and The Invisible Worm we witness the emergence of a new kind of heroine: the female Bildungsroman protagonist. I begin my study with a discussion of the traditional Bildungsroman as a male project, which traces the growth and self-development of an adolescent as he approaches maturity. A reformulation is then established allowing for a female version of the genre while differentiating between stories of the failure of development, such as Jane Eyre, and Johnston's stories where development is realized. I propose to demonstrate how Johnston's works exemplify the Bildungsroman form and also explore questions relevant to female development such as the protagonist's relationship to work, to love, to family, to tradition, and to writing.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462659h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n60b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Johnston, Jennifer, 1930- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kk769"><dcterms:title>A developmental study of visual filtering /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dagenais, Catherine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Visual selective attention was investigated in children aged 5, 7 and 9 and in adults.

The results were analyzed with regard to development differences between the age groups. Contrary to expectations, the presence of non-relevant stimuli was not related to impaired performance nor was the presence of a solid-line border related to enhanced performance. No effect of border was found in any of the groups. However, the reaction times of older children and adults were faster with 8 non-relevant stimuli far from the target.

By this method, the forces from a G.P.W. (Gaussian Plane Wave) and a general TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam were calculated and studied. For a G.P.W. beam, there were two forces which acted on small particles located inside the electromagnetic field; one, called the scattering force, directed in the beam propagation direction, pushed particles axially. The other, called the gradient force, due to the non-uniformity of the electromagnetic field, acted like an optical well and confined the particles of the beam axis. The forces from a general TEM$ sb infty$ beam behaved differently due to the profile of the beam. It was shown that axial confinement was also possible for a highly focused TEM$ sb infty$ beam, therefore providing the possibility of single beam trapping. The relationship between the forces and the profile of a TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam was investigated comprehensively. Three experimental stations were designed and built. Both upward and downward accelerating experiments were constructed to confirm the existences of the scattering force and the gradient force in a G.P.W. beam. Furthermore, the scattering force was studied quantitatively. A single beam trapping experiment was designed to verify the possibility of axial constraint of small particles by a higher focused TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam. The single beam trapping conditions found in the experiment were in agreement with the results of the theoretical analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m290j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f457z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Optics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p570k"><dcterms:title>Allotransplantation of frozen irradiated menisci in rabbits</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rubins, Ian Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The meniscus is essential for normal knee function.

Today surgeons attempt to repair or minimally resect torn menisci, however many patients are encountered with irreparable tears or previously removed menisci. In these patients meniscale transplantation may prevent degenerative arthritis from developing. Problems facing transplantation are ability to store tissues and prevent disease transmission. To overcome this, freezing and irradiation effects were examined on 60 rabbits undergoing medial meniscal transplantation. Fresh, frozen, and frozen-irradiated allografts were followed up to 17 months, 10 other rabbits underwent meniscectomy alone. Zero-time studies revealed that freezing with or without irradiation rendered cells non-viable with no changes in mechanical properties. At long term follow-up, all grafts healed, and showed repopulation with metabolically active cells determined radioautographically. Mechanical properties were unchanged, except for a decreased time constant in the frozen group.

H$ sp{+} rm g sp{-1}$), and higher ENC/BCI compared to three other tree species. Deciduous species showed a higher BCI and a lower ENC in August. Our results suggest that sugar maple may be relatively sensitive to wet acidic deposition and that leaf buffering capacity is related to photosynthesis potential and seasonal change in foliar Ca concentration. Foliar analyses revealed that fertilization with a mixture of K, Ca, and Mg had significant effects on leaf concentrations of K, free amino acids (FAA) and the ratios of N to K, and FAA to N after two growing seasons. Our results suggest that base cation fertilization improved the N and K status of sugar maple and that leaf carbon partitioning appeared to be more dynamic in fertilized trees.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655h77z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q7477</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Foliar diagnosis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Effect of acid deposition on -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Fertilizers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430587k"><dcterms:title>A theoretical model for flow about a circular-arc aerofoil with separation /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cyr, Stéphane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the present research is to develop a theoretical model that could predict the trailing-edge separation over a circular-arc aerofoil and its effect on the pressure distribution, and on the lift. The model uses sources, in a potential flow, to simulate the effect of the separated region on the pressure distribution. An integral method, turbulent boundary-layer development, combined with the irrotational pressure distribution on the circular-arc predicts the point of separation. To make sure that trailing-edge separation is present alone and mostly to avoid any difficulties in predicting the boundary-layer flow after reattachment, the aerofoil is studied at design incidence. Two different circular-arc aerofoils were tested; one of 10% and one of 18% camber. The calculation for the 10% aerofoil did not predict any separation at design incidence, which was confirmed experimentally. The theoretical model predicted the right position of separation for the 18% aerofoil. It also provided a good simulation of the pressure distribution, including the right value for the base pressure and a good prediction of the lift. It follows that the pressure distribution when integrated, gives a good estimate of the pressure or form drag.

Choice of hunting method in kestrels was related to their appraise energy expenditure and relative success. Hunting from a perch was more common, presumably less strenuous and more successful than hunting afoot. Hunting prey confined to the vertical walls of the arena was considered more strenuous and was less successful than hunting freely-roaming ground prey. Infection with T. pseudospiralis did not affect attack rate or hunting success but altered the manner in which prey were taken. Thus, the frequency of strikes performed in level flight declined, and birds tended to hunt more on foot. In flight, the frequency of wing beats and the horizontal distance travelled to regain the elevated perch increased. Concordance was found between intensity of infection and magnitude of change in body weight and flight activities.

The study additionally investigated the consequences of this shift as well as the satisfaction levels of the client group. A questionnaire was used to gather data from the board as a whole and an interview protocol was used with a group of key informants. It was found that a shift in locus of control towards the Divisional Board of Education had taken place. This had resulted in higher satisfaction levels in terms of the overall system and improved outcomes in terms of participation in decision making, consultation processes, flow of information, services to communities, and conflict resolution. It was concluded that while these outcomes had been realized the board was constrained in its actions and in the exercise of its authority by the limited decentralization that had occured, by the lack of direction, and by the lack of an informed membership.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k368m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w99z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education -- Nunavut -- Baffin Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inuit -- Education -- Nunavut -- Baffin Island.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d0940"><dcterms:title>A logic for finite games /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mackling, Thomas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A formalism and calculus is presented for the treatment of a normal modal logic with two principal operators: 'necessarily next' and 'necessarily prior'. The formalism is proposed as an efficient means of representing classes of game configurations for a broad range of finite games. As part of this treatment a system of context-free, strongly normalizing rewrite rules is given, which identifies logically equivalent formulae and is itself adequate for K, the weakest normal propositional logic with one (principal) operator. Deduction (and deducibility), with respect to a given theory, is introduced and its soundness is shown via standard models. The canonical model construction is given, yielding completeness and, through filtrations, decidability. Finally, a mechanism, using decidability (and some properties of the rewrite system) is given for obtaining a (logically equivalent) reduced form of formulae, modulo a finite theory. Throughout the thesis, a score of smaller results and ideas are also presented.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt80z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d0940</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795884r"><dcterms:title>An evaluative study of the movement assessment of infants /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hardy, Susan A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this study was to develop norms for the Movement Assessment of Infants (MAI) and to investigate the concurrent validity of this measure. Sixty-three full-term, low-risk, four-month-old infants were tested according to the MAI, the Bayley Motor Scale and the Wolanski Motor Development Scale. Infants were scored according to the four-month Risk Profile (RP) of the MAI and the Study Population Profile (SPP) which was developed from the behaviours of the infants on the MAI. Risk scores of the infants on the RP were significantly higher than risk scores on the SPP. This difference was attributed to the inability of the MAI to differentiate the variability of normal motor behaviour at four months of age from motor behaviour which is truly deviant from the norm.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311q36s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795884r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Human Development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
