Specifically, it examines artistic responses to the medical/scientific image of HIV that circulates widely in the mainstream press. Examples of AIDS science reporting that focus on the medical/scientific image of HIV are selected from popular American news journals. It is argued that science and journalism are different and mutually dependent domains of knowledge, neither of which can be examined without the other. AIDS activist art engages with the relationship between science and the media and offers alternatives to the authority offered in science reporting. In the author's closing remarks, it is stated that AIDS activist art addresses not only the AIDS crisis but challenges the entire ideological apparatus upon which popular representations of illness are based.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marchessault, Janine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182n179.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t56c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) and the arts.</dc:subject><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) in mass media.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h153p"><dcterms:title>Kyai Haji Hasyim Asyʾari's religious thought and political activities (1871-1947)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khuluq, Lathiful.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis surveys the religious thought and political activities of K. H. (Kyai Haji) Hasyim Asy'ari (1871-1947), founder of both the Pesantren Tebuireng and the Nahdlatul Ulama. Given the extent of his legacy, it will study his life, educational background and pesantren milieu in order to gain an understanding of his career and the events that inspired him. A prolific writer, K. H. Hasyim Asy'ari produced works on theology, sufism, politics and Islamic law. Many of these works will be discussed. His theology was standard Sunni, while his mystical practice and thinking may best be described as sufi/ orthodox. He encouraged Muslims to follow the four Sunni schools (madhahib) in the belief that they contained the most valid teachings. In the political sphere, he called upon Muslims to strengthen the ties of Muslim brotherhood. And although K. H. Hasyim Asy'ari spent most of his life teaching in the pesantren, he also played an important political role, especially as leader of a Muslim unity movement during the late Dutch colonial period, as representative to Muslim organizations active under the Japanese occupation and finally as a supporter of Indonesian independence in the late 1940s. Significantly, K. H. Hasyim Asy'ari was regarded as the preeminent leader of the traditionalist Muslims from the 1920s to the 1940s, but enjoyed the respect of the modernist faction at a time when relations between traditionalists and modernists were strained. In effect, he served as spiritual leader to many 'ulama', soldiers and politicians.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Federspiel, Howard M.

Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews, this research depicts a Muslim school in Montreal which both reflects Quebec society and nurtures minority ethnic/religious identity. For many parents, Arabic language classes, academic standards, and behavioral norms were as important as the school's religious affiliation. Rejecting the hypothesis that emphasizing religious and cultural identities distanced children from mainstream society, some felt that the psychological and social effects of affirming a child's background were vital to integration and participation in mainstream society. In addition, the school also provided entry into social networks which offered parents an important support system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, A. U.

It explores Rahman's definition of Islamic philosophy, which is strongly characterized by three religious terms, iman, islam, and taqwa. The thesis furthermore looks at the reasons why Rahman borrowed certain philosophical expressions of the Muslim philosophers in his works when, at first glance, their doctrines contradict Rahman's own position. Special attention is paid to his book Major Themes of the Qur'an, wherein Rahman discusses human existence and his final destiny through his interpretation of the Qur'an. The thesis concludes that Rahman's Islamic philosophy is a moral one, which is practically oriented and based on his understanding of the Qur'an.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lawson, Todd (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z037f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px966</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rahman, Fazlur, 1919- -- Views on philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy, Islamic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bw49k"><dcterms:title>Charlevoix : un jésuite en quête de vérité : étude historiographique d'Histoire et description générale de la nouvelle France</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Anne, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After several visits to New France, the French Jesuit Pierre-Francois-Xavier de Charlevoix produced a detailed multivolume study entitled Histoire et description generale de la Nouvelle France.

Although each of these plays offers a unique perspective on this conflicted interaction, I attempt to demonstrate through close readings of each work that the broad trajectory traced by the problem plays is a movement from the festive comedies' idealistic faith in the possibilities of both romantic and generic "happy endings," to the bleak cynicism which characterizes the great tragedies' depictions of sexual relationships and social structures. Finally, I point to the romances, particularly The Winter's Tale, which, I argue, rework the problem plays' interest in sexuality and social order in such a way that the growing pessimism and inconclusiveness of these earlier works is transformed into aesthetically balanced narratives of romantic reconciliation and social integration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.

Unlike land acquisition, by which the non-Jewish aristocracy preserved itself, yikhus was intimately linked with achievement in the above realms, requiring a continual infusion of new talent from each generation of a particular family. A question which has yet to be resolved is the extent to which the founders of Hasidism, a mystical revivalist movement that swept Eastern European Jewish communities from the second half of the eighteenth century until the Holocaust, challenged prevailing notions of yikhus. The question relates to the identities of Hasidism's leaders--the Zaddikim--themselves. If, as the older historiography claims, the Zaddikim emerged from outside the elite stratum, and therefore lacked yikhus, they might be expected to challenge a notion which would threaten their perceived right to lead. If, on the other hand, the Zaddikim were really the same scions of noble Jewish families who had always led the communities, they would probably uphold the value of yikhus.

However, university grievance offices report that less than one percent of the student population, whether female or male, complains. Sexual harassment research indicates that a large number of people who experience sexual harassment do not label it as such and therefore, do not report it. The effectiveness of the objective sexual harassment definition in describing the experiences of students is questioned. A qualitative approach is used to explore how students define sexual harassment and how they categorize their experiences in relation to their definitions. The analysis, based on twenty interviews of upper year undergraduate students, suggests that although students define sexual harassment similarly to the objective definition, they do not relate their experiences to the definition. The disparity between abstract formulations and concrete experiences may account for the low reporting. The addition of examples of common sexual harassment experiences is suggested as a way of making the objective definition more comprehensive and accessible. An example of how the objective definition may be developed is provided in the concluding chapter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tancred, Peta (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk553.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr27z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sexual harassment -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sexual harassment in universities and colleges -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k707g"><dcterms:title>The expanding role of the United States Senate in Supreme Court confirmation proceedings /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dolgin, Anthony Shane.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis traces the growth the United States Senate's role in the Supreme Court confirmation process from the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789 to the nomination of Robert H.

Their task is problematic: Naomi has no mother, and Kae has too many maternal figures battling for control. Both narrators approach their texts (and their searches for identity) with a degree of ambivalence. In Obasan, Naomi's uncertainty over the family identity she attempts to uncover manifests itself in the silences which pervade the text. Over the course of the novel, she pushes aside silence, in the process giving rise to two problematic issues at the work's centre: first, the adult Naomi who narrates must re-enter the experiences of her younger, silenced self; secondly, Naomi must overcome an oppressive silence in order to tell a story both centred around and driven by silence. Whereas Naomi is reluctant to delve into her history, Kae is eager to recover what has been hidden from her. Instead of the numerous silences which pervade Obasan, Kae's growing ambivalence surfaces as narrative unreliability. Disappearing Moon Cafe is strongly mediated by Kae, who acknowledges the extent to which her authority is problematic; in reconstructing her past, she often reinvents it as well. This paper explores the parallels between Naomi's and Kae's searches for family, and the ways in which similar journeys find radically different narrative expression. While the text of Obasan resists the tendency to inscribe the silences of its family narrative, Disappearing Moon Cafe battles its desire to fill in the blanks, to romanticize and invent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, Nathalie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sj210.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq79b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kogawa, Joy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lee, Sky.

Perhaps with the intention of responding to needs of the pluralistic, multicultural society emerging at the end of the 1990s, values educators are turning their attention to the role of story telling and narrative in our moral development. This is an important contribution to values education because narrative approaches allow bridges to be built between different individuals and cultures and for a profound understanding of others to become possible. Many of the narrative approaches rest on a fuzzy or narrow definition of moral imagination. My thesis tries to clarify imaginations' abilities and gifts. I have reflected on the writings of Kieran Egan to establish what imagination brings to education and also the relationship between narrative and imagination. The final piece of my thesis sketches an outline of a moral imagination in consultation with two authors: Daniel Maguire and Mark Johnson. Through very different approaches, they both arrive at the idea that it is imagination which in fact underpins moral understanding. Kieran Egan opens the door to the idea of imagination and Daniel Maguire and Mark Johnson complete the picture by pointing out that imagination is our capacity to create moral understanding.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morris, Ron (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m874k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mr842</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Imagination -- Moral and ethical aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Moral education.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb494b34c"><dcterms:title>Création, éthique et vérité : Broch et Blanchot ; suivi de, En trompe-l'oeil</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bourgon, Julie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Criticism.

Furthermore, the veil of novelty could hide a side of reality darker than suspected.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rivard, Yvon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806184p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b34c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Blanchot, Maurice -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Broch, Hermann, 1886-1951 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jn44t"><dcterms:title>Perspectives on British middle class pleasure travel to Italy and Switzerland, 1860-1914</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Borenstein, Bonnie Jill.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the pleasure travels of British middle class men and women during the 1860s to World War One. I have considered pleasure travel as any type of travel primarily motivated by the desire to entertain and amuse oneself in a place other than home. It had become a popular leisure activity during this time period for a wide range of people, partly due to improved methods of transportation, increased monetary capabilities and the availability of free time. Paying special attention to the highly visited Italy and Switzerland, I have examined travel writings from this period to gain insight into both the individual perceptions of pleasure travel and the pleasure traveller and the general current of thoughts of the time. Travel writings include guidebooks and handbooks, personal memoirs and journals. Having become an integral part of middle class life during this period, pleasure travel also became the subject of many novels and articles which provide additional insight, mostly through criticism and mockery of the traveller.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Elbourne, E.

This thesis examines Pushkin's historiographical methodology and conclusions and considers Pushkin's writings from the viewpoint of the historian rather than the literary critic. It offers a chronological study of the four fictional and non-fictional works in which Pushkin analysed major figures and events in Russian history and traces the importance he attributed to them for the development of the Russian national consciousness. The themes of rebellion against the state and political legitimacy predominate in this investigation and shed light on how Pushkin's study of history reinforced and, in some instances altered, his own fundamental political and social beliefs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boss, Valentin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jq74q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb44g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pushkin, Aleksandr Sergeevich, 1799-1837 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v051h"><dcterms:title>Le voyage dans les "Contes" de Jacques Ferron ; Itinéraires</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bélanger, Stéphanie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of the analytical part of this master's paper is to specify the signification of the voyage motive considered as the theme of some of the stories in Jacques Ferron's Contes. This theme consists in being at the basis of both travel narratives and tales structure. It is a matter of studying, on the one hand, how the author is spiritually in line with these stories and on the other hand, how he distinguishes himself by his singular use of them. Two tales, "La vache morte du canyon" and "Cadieu" are analyzed, in the first part, according to literary theories applied on travel narratives. Ferron's versions of this type of stories are particular in that they favour the theme of the return from banishment. The second part of this work treats of the tale "Les Mechins", in which the themes remind the rituals of initiation in tribal societies. The effective displacement achieved by the hero appears as an interiorized voyage rather than a social one. The author transposes, from preexisting but inadequate material to explain the modern society, a new vision of the becoming of the self. In the creative part of the paper, eleven tales present the introspective reflexion of individuals who have to get over an important period into their life. The flow of the river along which the characters live is a fundamental element determining the way they can go through the learning process. The goal is to reconcile with personal and peculiar destiny.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boucher, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c250.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v051h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ferron, Jacques -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Travel in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n204110r"><dcterms:title>Changing of the guards : theories of sovereignty in Shakespeare's Richard II</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bayer, Mark, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Shakespeare's history plays are not merely benign representations of various historical figures and events but the site of political, cultural, and ideological contestation at the time of their performance. Richard II documents two divergent theoretical approaches to sovereignty which are more applicable to the political climate in Shakespeare's time than Richard's. In this essay, I read this play through the lens of various political tracts and historical tendencies dominant in late Elizabethan England. Though such an analysis might best be understood as historical materialist in orientation, I offer a contextual analysis of various modes of early modern political thought drawing variously upon theoretical precepts associated with new historicism as well as the 'ideas in context' school associated with Quentin Skinner, among others. Such an analysis reveals a shift in the mode of theoretical discourse. Richard's divine-right/monarchical approach to sovereignty based in an overarching ecclesiastical power base gives way to Bolingbroke's pragmatic and consensus driven politics. This shift mirrors the movement in late 16$ rm sp{th}$ and early 17$ rm sp{th}$ century England from traditional religious arguments offered by Richard Hooker, John Whitgift, and residually by James I to a more secular political discourse inaugurated by Machiavelli and his English adherents and symptomatic of the reign of Elizabeth herself. Roughly speaking this modulation follows the pattern of paradigm shifts in the physical sciences exposed by Thomas Kuhn's influential Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962). The emergent theory, while marking a rapid and overwhelming reorientation of the terms and initial presuppositions of political discourse, draws in many crucial respects on the accrued tenets of the outgoing paradigm. The play therefore acts as a retroactive representation of a political reformation which occurred much later than the events depicted in the play.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.

The first part will demonstrate how the different clergy members described by Voltaire are rendered quite faithfully as the characters of the secular and the regular clergy found in the author's novels. In the second part, we will find out the extent to which Pigault-Lebrun has used the 18$ rm sp{th}$ century philosopher's writings in order to write Le Citateur, an anti-clerical essay used by Napoleon as a political weapon, which summarizes the history of christianism from the biblical era until the Enlightenment.

However, unlike other political institutions, the Court does not draw that support directly from the democratic process. Scholars in the United States have examined this problem by analyzing the relationship between public perceptions of judicial institutions and their legitimacy, emphasizing the importance of myth in sustaining support for courts in the absence of democratic accountability. This thesis extends American research to the Canadian case, by examining the role of the media as a significant source of popular perceptions of the Canadian Supreme Court. The objective of this thesis is to provide a preliminary assessment of this role by analyzing newspaper coverage of three of the Court's important and high-profile decisions: The Morgentaler, Thibaudeau and Symes cases. The thesis contends that the media, at times through oversimplifications and mischaracterization of issues, help to perpetuate a positive myth of the Court. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, this thesis shows that the public appears to base its support on this myth, which is built upon incomplete and oversimplified information. This distorted image of the Court helps to strengthen its legitimacy in the eyes of the public.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Manfredi, C.

By examining the Internet as an alternative distribution network for Subcomandante Marcos' communiques, it can be conjectured that the technology provided him with a space through which his voice could be heard in the international political arena. It was a space both external to Mexican government control, and through which Macros disseminated a powerful discourse representing the insurgents' political goals and grievances--one contrary to that being transmitted by the state-controlled media. Internet technology, it can be argued, generated the necessary national and international public consciousness, opinion, scrutiny and support for the Chiapas insurgents, that ultimately transformed their conflict with the Mexican government from a violent war of arms, to one of peaceful negotiation and dialogue.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robinson, Gertrude J.
