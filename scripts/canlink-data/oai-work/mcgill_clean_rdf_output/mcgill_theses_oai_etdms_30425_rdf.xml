Further, since most channels cannot be realistically modelled by a simple Binary Symmetric Channel, it is required to reliably estimate the performance of error control schemes on real channels. This thesis considers the analysis and simulation of a Generalised Hybrid ARQ Type II (GH-ARQ II) error control scheme on a channel modelled by the Gilbert-Elliott model. The analysis is easily extended to higher order systems and channels modelled by first-order Markov chains. The results indicate that the performance of the GH-ARQ II scheme improves as the errors in the channel become burstier in nature and that this scheme is well suited to channels with relatively slowly varying error statistics. Further, it is found that the roundtrip delay of the selective repeat retransmission strategy may affect the performance of this error control scheme on burst-noise channels.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nm665.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cc01k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505170s"><dcterms:title>Children's reactions to parental separation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Greenstone, Harriet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to fully explore children's reactions to parental separation and to look at these reactions in relation to a number of environmental, demographic, and temperamental variables. The study also investigated parents' perceptions of children's reactions and the relationship between the two. Forty children between the ages of 8 and 12 years, inclusive, whose parents had been separated less than 3 years, participated in the study. A number of descriptive and ethnographic procedures were utilized. A negative correlation of.62 was obtained between anxiety and self-esteem. The children in the study appeared to have a well-developed, reality-based comprehension of the divorce, even though they were generally sad about the divorce and hoped for a reconciliation. Meaningful results were observed when the children's responses were compared with regard to gender, age, and duration of separation. Few differences in response were noted with regard to levels of self-esteem. Anxiety, however, appeared to be related to many rather apparent differences in response. When parents' responses were compared to children's responses, a moderate variability was observed in those questions related to time periods. In the open-ended questions, there was moderate variability in response agreement between parent and child. Differences in response were also noted with regard to when the children were told about the separation and by whom.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q5216.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505170s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children of divorced parents -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Parent and child</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child psychology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj6731515x"><dcterms:title>Ultrastructural and cytochemical characteristics of the Golgi apparatus in epithelial principal cells of the initial segment of the rat epididymis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Green, Harold G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Epididymides post-fixed in reduced osmium were used to study the morphological characteristics of the Golgi apparatus of principal cells of the initial segment. Others, fixed in glutaraldehyde, were treated to detect nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatase (NADPase), thiamine pyro-phosphatase (TPPase), and cytidine mono-phosphatase (CMPase) activities within Golgi compartments and glucose-6-phosphatase activity localized in cisternae of ER. The Golgi apparatus of these cells is composed of numerous saccular and tubular elements. On the cis face of the Golgi there is an osmiophilic tubular network. Of the numerous subjacent saccules, the first is dilated and unreactive for phosphatases, the next 3 show NADPase activity and the last 4 are TPPase positive. On the trans aspect of the stack there are 3 or 4 CMPase positive trans Golgi networks, one showing a peeling off configuration while the other 2 or 3 are completely separated from the stack. The TGN's often contain nodular distensions suggestive of secretion granule formation and occasionally present a shrivelled appearance. Cisternae of ER showing buds are present on the cis face of the stacks.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sh443.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731515x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hk34k"><dcterms:title>Development and survival of a postsynaptic specialization in cultures of embryonic xenopus nerve and muscle cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Samuels, Peter L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study has focussed on the formation and survival of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters at neuromuscular synapses formed in culture between myotomal muscle cells and spinal cord neurons derived from embryos of Xenopus laevis. AChRs were labelled with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated $ alpha$-bungarotoxin so that the neurite associated receptor patches (NARPs) on the muscle cells could be viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Reduced fluorescence excitation was used in combination with a low light level TV camera and a computer based image calculator to make daily observations on all NARPs. Observations suggest the following conclusions. Neurons retain the capacity to trigger NARP formation as long as they continue to grow. Changes in NARP shape as well as decreases (and increases) in NARP size can occur even in the absence of competitive interactions between neurons and these changes are locally regulated along the contact. The capacity of neurons to maintain NARPs in more proximal portions of their neuritic arbor persists even as growing distal portions continue to induce the formation of new NARPs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp36n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk34k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z993"><dcterms:title>The effect of hemisphericity and field dependence on performance on a programming task /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Coffin, Lorraine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated the effects of hemisphericity and field dependence on programming skills.
