In fact, for interview 1 to 3, the mean (SD) for the SF-36 PCS ranged from 53.0 (7.5) to 53.5 (6.5), for the SF-36 MCS from 49.5 (10.2) to 52.4 (10.4), for the EQ5D 81.7 (22.3) to 86.9 (18.6), for the VAS from 83.5 (15.6) to 86.9 (10.3) and for the SG 87.8 (19.6) to 89.7 (17.7). For both the VAS and SG, health states of active TB subjects ranked lower than those of other subjects (p-value ranging from 0.002 to 0.11 for each instruments and interviews, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). These measures of health-related quality of life and health utilities appeared feasible and reliable in this subject population.

Model domains were of two types, large raised bog type (LRBT) and kettle bog type (KBT), and were made to undergo various levels of meteorological forcing (water deficit). Substrate, too, was varied in order to determine its importance on reversals. Domain-wide reversals were successfully simulated in LRBT systems, but not in KBT systems. Although simulated flow patterns matched field-observed patterns, both pre- and post-drought, simulated reversals occurred more quickly than in the field. This may be due to insufficiently distributed parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity. Reversals were easily terminated by simulating non-drought conditions. In the LRBT system, reversal duration decreased, and time-to-reversal increased, with a decrease in drought severity. Increasing drought severity in KBT systems had the opposite effect on the duration of semi-reversed flow patterns, suggesting a possibly different/additional mechanism for flow reversals in KBT systems. Hydraulic conductivity had an appreciable effect on flow reversal evolution, though neither changing porosity, nor differences in catotelm layering had a great effect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roulet, Nigel T.

The purpose of this study is to measure total toxaphene levels in food samples commonly consumed by the Canadian Inuit and study the relationship between concentrations of total toxaphene and individual congeners. A total of 127 Inuit food samples were collected for toxaphene analysis. Total toxaphene and the specific toxaphene congeners including Parlar #26, #40/41, #42, #44, #50 and #62 were detected in the food samples. Total toxaphene concentrations ranged from 13 to 2800 ng/g and various congener concentrations ranged from 0 to 610 ng/g. Concentrations of total toxaphene were strongly correlated with congener concentration in marine mammals and weaker in fish. The sum of congeners Parlar #26, #50 and #62 accounted for 0--15% of total toxaphene in fish and 0--66% in marine mammals. Regression models were used to estimate total toxaphene based on individual or combinations of congener concentrations. Dietary intake was estimated to be 1.07 and 0.78 mug/kg body weight per day in Chesterfield Inlet and Igloolik. Our results show that there is no general conversion factor that can be used to estimate total toxaphene concentrations based on congener measurements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, H. M.

A search for angiogenesis inhibitors has been the focus of many investigations. One such inhibitor, which caught the attention of many researchers, is 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME). 2-ME is an endogenous metabolite of estradiol-17beta. The current study was undertaken to characterize the angiostatic effects of 2-ME in human microvascular endothelial cells. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to play a vital role in regulating endothelial cell growth and differentiation, as well as apoptosis. We, therefore, investigated whether TGF-beta is modulated by 2-ME using the human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. Findings suggest that 2-ME mediated apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial cells involve SAPK/JNK pathway and caspase-3 while the activation of p38 kinase pathway may represent a survival signal to counteract the 2-ME induced apoptotic events.

Analysis of transcriptional control mechanisms of the TnI gene of a primitive chordate, such as the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, may therefore provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the vertebrate ancestral TnI gene. As an initial step in such a study, I localized transcriptional control regions within 1.5 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of the Ciona TnI gene. I prepared a series of deletion constructs in which Ciona TnI 5'-flanking DNA segments were fused to a nuclear-targeted beta-galactosidase reporter gene. Constructs were introduced into fertilized Ciona eggs by electroporation, and following development up to the mid tailbud stage (12 h), reporter gene expression was assessed by whole-mount beta-galactosidase histochemistry.

The qualitative model involved interviews (N = 6) with a range of professionals in the area of addictions. Analysis of the data revealed that there is an urgent need for expanded and improved harm reduction strategies, that safer injection rooms could offer many benefits to Canadians, that several debates exist with regard to the policies and services related to safer injection rooms, and that safer injection rooms, as well as alternative initiatives, must be considered if Canada wishes to promote health among drug users and wider communities.

Modeling results suggest that the selfing rate is likely to have important effects on the abundance and polymorphism patterns of transposable elements in plant genomes. A primary characterization of diversity and abundance of transposons in the self-pollinating species Arabidopsis thaliana was conducted using genomic sequencing data, providing strong evidence for recent element mobility. Utilizing this information, a PCR-based approach was implemented to examine transposon dynamics in populations of Arabidopsis thaliana and its outcrossing relative, Arabidopsis lyrata. The results provide evidence for the importance of purifying selection in controlling transposon abundance in outcrossing populations, but not in selfers. Differences observed between the species are consistent with the hypothesis that host breeding systems influence the selective pressure acting on transposons.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schoen, Daniel J.

BDNF treatment led to an increase in primary neurites in calbindin- and calretinin-positive cells when compared with control, but had no effect on proliferation of the proportion of interneurons. We conclude that BDNF enhances the differentiation of cortical neurons. To investigate the role of Trk signaling in cortical neurons, we generated recombinant adenoviruses which carried either wild type or mutated forms of TrkA which inhibit binding and activation of some of its major downstream effectors, namely, SNT, SHC and PLCgamma.

This novel approach provides an early cancellation of erroneous events, from which the propagation of these "bad" events is prevented. It is oriented towards a distributed environment, as exemplified by a network of workstations. The dependence list can also provide "event filtering" function which detects "bad" future events to avoid, their processing, and provide minimizing the sending of anti-messages.

Synthesis of atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type (CNP) natriuretic peptides occurs mainly in the heart and brain and has been identified recently in the female reproductive tract. The expression of ANP and CNP, as well as their cognate guanylyl cyclase receptors (NPR-A and NPR-B, respectively), have been detected in the rat ovary. We have shown previously that the expression of the natriuretic peptides and their receptors, in the rat ovary, is modulated by the estrous cycle. Since estrogen and the gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) are important regulators of follicular development and ovarian function we hypothesized that expression of the natriuretic peptide system is modulated by these hormones. In order to test this hypothesis, the expression of the natriuretic peptide system (peptide and receptor) was evaluated in ovarian cells (granulosa and residual tissue cells) obtained from immature female rats treated with either diethylstilbestrol (DES), an estrogen analogue, or equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), a gonadotropin which possesses both LH and FSH activity.

This study presents direct evidence that stress-induced phosphorylation of NFH in both differentiated PC12 cells and cultured sensory neurons is inhibited by CEP-1347 (KT7515), a specific inhibitor of SAPK activation. In addition, long-term treatment of unstressed sensory neurons with CEP-1347 decreased the phosphorylation state of NFH in neurites. CEP-1347 differentially inhibited the activation of various SAPK isoforms in neuronal cell body and neurite fractions. Specifically, activation of a 55 kDa SAPK isoform in the neurite fraction was highly sensitive to CEP-1347 inhibition, with an IC50 of about 0.02 muM, while IC50 values for other SAPK species were at least 10-fold higher. The data indicate that SAPKs are involved in both constitutive phosphorylation of axonal NFH and stress-induced phosphorylation of perikaryal NFH in cultured sensory neurons and that SAPKs in the two neuronal compartments are activated by different signaling pathways.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mushynski, W.

Studies have demonstrated that these antagonists act on the transporter by interacting with amino acid residues within certain transmembrane domains (TM4 and 9). Experiments in our laboratory have identified three novel sites involved in inhibitor interactions (PP157--8, E350, and G356). The general focus of this thesis was to study the structure-function relationship of NHE1. One of the aims of this thesis was to assess whether mutations at these novel sites also affected transport kinetics (i.e., Na+ and H+ affinity). The results showed that neither Na+ nor H+ affinities were significantly altered with any of the mutations analyzed. The next objective was to investigate the nature of the interaction between the exchanger and pharmacological agents, by measuring transport activity in the presence of substituted guanidinium antagonists. The results suggest an interaction between L167 and the chlorine moiety at position 3 of the benzoyl group of a novel benzoyl guanidinium compound, while G356 appears to interact with the chlorine moiety at position 4 (rather than position 3) of the benzene ring. The last objective was to define the membrane topology of NHE1. The methodology involves reintroducing cysteine residues into a cysteine-less mutant NHE1 and assessing their accessibility with thiol-reactive agents. Unfortunately, these results were inconclusive and further optimization of the assay conditions is required.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Orlowski, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c03z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752j59g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278v985"><dcterms:title>Spatial intermittency, biodiversity, and multifractals</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ieraci, Luciano A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ecosystems involve highly non-linear interactions between species and their environments over wide ranges of scales. These interactions give rise to population number densities that are highly intermittent in both space and time. The simplest hypothesis about the variability of individual density fields is that they are scale invariant in space-time. For some cases, such as plankton, this has been demonstrated empirically. In addition, at a fixed space-time location there is a well-established information theory approach for treating the density statistics for different species. In this "species space", there are already two scaling biodiversity models: the (mono) fractal model and the lognormal model. The simplest treatment combining real and species space scaling is obtained by considering an anisotropic multifractal cascade in a (5-D) species-space-time space. With the help of a unique data base involving nearly three hundred different species densities, each over a spatial range of approximately 40, 0.5m x 0.5m samples from six underwater sites in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, this simple "superscaling" model is tested. It is shown that the scaling of all species densities is compatible with a "bilinear" multifractal model, where an "elliptical dimension" parameter characterises the anisotropy of species-real space. This information is then used to numerically simulate the spatial variability of joint species densities, and it is discussed how this framework can be used to define scale invariant measures of biodiversity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lovejoy, Shaun (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s192s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278v985</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Ecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq68t"><dcterms:title>A tool for resource conscious design of distributed real-time systems using end-to-end deadline constraints /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jabbour, Georges Safwan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a hard real-time system, the notion of time is very critical. For this reason, specific designing methods and different scheduling algorithms were developed. However, the scheduling algorithms are dependent on task attributes that are artifacts from system design, and the designers still do generate them by a trial and error process. [SH96] presents a resource conscious design method to systematically generate these attributes so that the task deadlines and the system end-to-end constraints are met. Using this method and the Rate Monotonic scheduling algorithm, I developed a tool that calculates the response time of each task of the system and a per-constraint heuristic parameter called "gain". Furthermore, it allows the designer to interactively change the timing attributes and to quickly check their effect on the system schedulability.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Avis, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r2825.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq68t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956h69t"><dcterms:title>The representation theory of finite semigroups /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hum, Marcus.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis provides a survey of several fundamental topics in the representation theory of finite semigroups.

This model was developed for the purpose of learning a mapping from an input space to an output space. A specific problem that occurs in the mining industry was used to develop and test the model's ability to learn the mapping between a three-dimensional input volume and a three-dimensional output volume. In this case, the mapping was a consequence of the industrial processes used in mining as well as the properties of the material being mined. Three main computational tools were combined in this work to form the complete mine stope prediction model. The three modules are a learning module, an optimisation module, and an overall network architecture. The overall network architecture is a 3-D lattice of cellular automata (CA) and has the capability to implicitly capture the complexities in shape that render other types of models arduous or inapplicable. The learning module uses a Discrete Time Cellular Neural Network (DTCNN) to store and recall information about a given mapping. The optimisation module uses the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to perform a non-linear optimisation on the set of weights used by the DTCNN. Variations of the model, and different experiments, were performed to test and explore the model in depth. Concepts such as "Small-Worlds" and "Forgetting Factor" were investigated. The applicability of a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model as an alternative to the DTCNN transition rule was also explored.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Therien, Denis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt89b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128c686</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Artificial Intelligence.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff365702b"><dcterms:title>The spatial distribution of traditional plant resources on an indigenous territory (Darien, Panama) and implications for management /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dalle, Sarah Paule.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ecological research aimed at the conservation of useful plants has rarely considered the spatial distribution of resources nor the potential implications for management.

A systematic random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species, as well as the physical environment. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the species-environment relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressures and an edaphic gradient. The habitat associations of the individual species are described and data on one species, Sabal mauritiiformis , is used to illustrate the utility of these data in the management of plant resources on human landscapes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Potvin, Catherine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p2090.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365702b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plants, Useful -- Panama -- Darien (Province) -- Geographical distribution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cuna Indians -- Ethnobotany -- Panama -- Darien (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sabal -- Panama -- Darien (Province) -- Geographical distribution.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977w82v"><dcterms:title>Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Côté, Richard Gaston.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The retinoblastoma (RB) family of proteins plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation. Its members, p105/Rb, p107 and p130, interact with the E2F and DP family of transcription factors to regulate transcription of essential cell cycle and DNA synthesis genes. Several reports have mapped the regulation of E217 by RB family members to the "pocket" domain of these proteins. We demonstrate here that RBP2, a pocket-binding protein that encodes multiple DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction domains, is a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of RBP2 inhibits E2F-dependent transcription and inhibits cellular growth. The growth suppression activity of RBP2 could not be associated with a single domain within the protein but the transcriptional repression activity can be mapped to a minimal 17 kDa fragment located at the extreme N-terminus of RBP2 that can repress transcription when expressed alone but requires the C-terminus in the context of the full-length protein.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.

The IPSec protocol suite developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) makes it possible to implement secure communication channels or virtual private network (VPN) over the Internet. Corporations can benefit from substantial financial savings by utilizing VPN for inter-company or intra-company communications rather than using expensive lease or privately own network infrastructure with its associated high maintenance costs. In this thesis, we will discuss the architecture, design and use of IPSec base VPN.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, G.
