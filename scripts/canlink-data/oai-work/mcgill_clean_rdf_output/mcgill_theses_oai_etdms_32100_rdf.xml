(Armando Carlos)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Traditionally, the Oculomotor Control System (OCS) has been considered as composed of several independent subsystems acting in parallel, where each dedicated subsystem controls a particular type of conjugate or disjunctive eye movement. Previous mathematical models built upon this assumption have mainly focused on input-output relationships, being difficult to relate to anatomy. This fact may limit the application of such models in the clinical environment. A new integrated approach for the modelling of the OCS is proposed, compatible with both known anatomy and physiology. This study presents a single, bilateral model capable of predicting the general characteristics (dynamics) of vergence and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during slow phase eye movements. The present study is motivated by growing evidence of interactions between conjugate and vergence premotor activities. The model relies on the sharing of neural signals among several premotor structures located on both sides of the brainstem. A new possible role for the superior colliculi in the control of slow phase and vergence eye movements is suggested. The proposed model incorporates the presence of near response cells located in the midbrain including modulation of their discharge rate with vergence angle. The bilateral model proposes a distributed vergence integrator whose slow discharge accounts for the vergence relaxation pattern found after binocular occlusion. The model reproduces very recent physiological data concerning the activity profiles of abducens interneurons and extraocular motoneurons during vergence responses and can provide tentative explanations for changes in VN modulation during VOR responses at different vergence levels. Additional extensions of the model can easily include burst cell populations for the simulation of fast vergence responses, and their interaction with conjugate saccades or vestibular quick phases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, H.

Field experiments were conducted to investigate effects of added ALS and P on soil organic matter and P fractions, as well as corn yields and nutrient uptake in a Ste. Rosalie clay soil and an Ormstown silty clay loam soil in 1990 and 1991. Incubation studies showed that added ALS increased organic matter but added P as diammonium phosphate (DAP) decreased organic matter in the fertilizer band location in both soils. Applied ALS with P increased Mehlich-III (M$ sb3$P) extractable P and bicarbonate extractable P in the fertilizer band location in both soils during early incubation periods. Soil Ca-P was decreased with increased ALS. However, soil Al-P and Fe-P compounds were increased with increased ALS. Applied P increased corn shoot P concentration at the six leaf stage, and increased grain yields, total dry matter (TDM) and N and P uptake in both soils. Applied ALS at up to 608 kg ha$ sp{-1}$ with P increased corn shoot P concentration at the six leaf stage in the Ste. Rosalie soil in 1991. Applied ALS at up to 304 kg ha$ sp{-1}$ with P increased grain yield, N and P uptake. However, applied ALS without P decreased stover N concentration. Thus, ALS may improve efficiency of fertilizer P for corn production depending on soil and application methods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackenzie, A. F.

This thesis presents the design of a specialized convolution processor that operates on double precision floating-point data. This convolver is based on an array of systolic cells and may be configured to process both images and unidimensional signals. Support circuitry handles data format conversion as well as data sequencing for the systolic array. In addition, the processor communicates with the memory of a host computer via a DMA (direct memory access) interface to he VMEbus. In this thesis, the design of these auxiliary subsystems is emphasized and their implementation in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Malowany, Alfred S.

In this work, $ rm Y sb2O sb3, Al sb2O sb3$ and AlN were added as liquid-forming additives, which react with surface SiO$ sb2$ on the $ rm Si sb3N sb4$ particles. The mechanism of pressureless sintering $ rm Si sb3N sb4$ with these additives was a combination of particle rearrangement, solution-precipitation and elimination of closed porosity. The rate of densification and $ alpha$-$ beta$ phase transformation were strongly influenced by the amount and viscosity of liquid phase. The kinetics suggested that the rate of densification increased with $ rm Al sb2O sb3$ content, since the higher viscosity of the liquid provided more capillary pressure. On the other hand, the rate of transformation was improved by a higher $ rm Y sb2O sb3$ content, because of the increased rate of solution and diffusion in the low viscosity liquid environment. In addition, AlN decreased the rates of both densification and transformation, due to its low solubility in the liquid phase. A morphology analysis was carried out on the samples sintered in the range 1600$ sp circ$C to 1900$ sp circ$C and at 1850$ sp circ$C for various soaking times. The coarsening process of the $ beta$ grains occurred with increasing temperature. Moreover, the $ beta$ grain aspect ratio and size distribution also increased with prolonged sintering. The formation of $ beta$ phase indeed improved the mechanical properties of the materials, however, excessive grain growth led to microcracking, which decreased the strength. The best values were obtained at 1850$ sp circ$C for one hour and corresponded with 98% theoretical density and 100% $ beta$ structure.

The receiver, which is robust against channel models, provides a performance close to optimal in the GL sense. The GL receiver combines naturally both channel estimation and data detection and therefore it is ideal for transmission systems which operate over unknown channels. The effects of multipath induced intersymbol interference (ISI) on the channel estimation process are mitigated by employing the technique of commutation signaling. In addition, by union bounding technique, it is shown that with sufficient bandwidth expansion, the probability of having significant ISI on the data detection process can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, a simplified GL receiver is proposed to combine binary commutation signaling with DPSK modulation scheme. The error performance of such a receiver under perfect channel estimation over multipath Rayleigh and Lognormal fading channels is presented and the performance degradation due to incorrect channel estimation is investigated via computer simulations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c08s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085m469</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289k35x"><dcterms:title>A numerical investigation of the isothermal and nonisothermal shrinking core model /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carabin, Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The shrinking core model, including the effect of transient diffusion, non-linear kinetics and non-isothermal effects was solved using finite elements in space and finite differences in time.

Moreover, thermal stresses and strains must be evaluated to define the initial loading conditions for seismic safety analyses. In this study, finite element procedures to model the thermal response of concrete gravity dams are presented. Heat transfer and structural models of a typical dam-foundation-reservoir system are developed. The reservoir, foundation, and air temperature variations, as well as solar radiation, are evaluated from data collected from different sources. The rate of convergence of the numerical solution is examined, and a methodology to identify the critical temperature states and to compute the related stresses, considering creep, is presented. Extensive parametric analyses are then performed to determine the relative influence of (i) the geometrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the dam, (ii) the reservoir, foundation and air temperature distributions, and (iii) the heat supply from solar radiation, on the stress-strain response of the system. Temperature states to define critical stress conditions for structural safety analysis are determined. Significant thermal stresses occur in the vicinity of the exposed surfaces of the dam. The typical depth of frost penetration is about 6m. The parameters which affect the surface stresses most are the air temperature distribution and the height of the dam, while for the frost penetration they are the solar radiation, convection coefficient, and conduction coefficient.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kv05v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gm07b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mw51r"><dcterms:title>A geochemical evaluation of the alteration zone at the Norbec mine, Noranda, Quebec : bulk chemical composition, mass and volume change, flux elements</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shriver, No√´lle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A funnel-shaped alteration pipe in Archean tholeiitic to transitional rhyolite and andesite underlying massive Zn-Cu sulphide ore at the Norbec mine in northwestern Quebec was outlined from drill core samples.

The effects of various types and rates of LS on soil respiration and soil N dynamics were determined. Effects of LS in combination with fertilizers on microbial activity and N dynamics were measured. Due to the high water solubility of LS a leaching column study was conducted to determine the potential leaching of LS. Higher rates (20% w/w) of LS initially inhibited microbial activity. Generally LS was relatively resistant to degradation by soil microorganisms and small proportions of added LS-C ($&lt;$2.1%) were leached from the soil columns, but leaching was a function of soil and moisture regime. Recovery of added mineral LS-N from soil treated with LS was low ($&lt;$41%). Mineral N recovered from LS plus fertilizer amended soil was higher than recovery from corresponding fertilizer treatments. Lignosulfonate reduced urea hydrolysis and the proportion of added N volatilized as NH$ sb3$-N from a LS plus urea treatment. The mineral N pool from LS plus fertilizer treated soils had significantly lower NO$ sb3$-N concentrations than corresponding fertilizer treatments. Nitrification inhibition was believed to have been due to high fertilizer concentrations. At reduced urea and LS concentrations, LS decreased NO$ sb3$-N recovery in one of four soil types.

In 1987, 301 Montreal adults were sampled by random digit dialing. A diet history and lifestyle habits were recorded. Mean total fat intake (%kcal) was 34.75% ($ pm$6.23). Principal Components Analysis identified specific dietary patterns. Regression analyses indicated that the first 4 food factors were associated with total fat intake (%kcal p $&lt;$ 0.01). Household size was inversely related to total fat (%kcal); 0.8% less kcal from fat for each additional member of the household (p $&lt;$ 0.01). Females had 2.8% more kcal from fat than males (p $&lt;$ 0.01). The number of fast food meals consumed per week was positively associated with outcome when age was considered (p $&lt;$ 0.05). BMI and education level were not associated with total fat (%kcal). Smoking was associated with intake of higher fat foods (p $&lt;$ 0.01). These predictors can identify groups in the population who may be at increased cardiovascular risk.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx90q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483k54m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lipids in human nutrition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nutrition -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diet -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78td35n"><dcterms:title>Dietary fat modulation of phenytoin teratogenicity in CD-1 mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>High, Kim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The hypothesis of this study was that dietary n-3 fatty acids protect against phenytoin (P) teratogenicity by inhibiting embryonic prostaglandin H synthase bioactivation of P and/or by delaying embryonic development. Female caesarian-derived (CD-1) mice were fed a safflower (SAFF)- or a cod liver/linseed oil (CLO/LO)-based diet for three weeks prior to impregnation and throughout pregnancy. The CLO/LO diet, compared to the SAFF diet, reduced malformations and fetal growth retardation due to P. Open eye defect was the only anomaly induced by P in CLO/LO fetuses while P produced cleft palates only in SAFF fetuses. Since the period of maximal susceptibility to open eye defect occurs before palatal closure, this result suggests that the CLO/LO diet delayed development relative to the SAFF diet. In Exp 2, dietary n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios were reflected in maternal hepatic phospholipids. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was induced in maternal hepatic tissues by the SAFF diet while LPO was induced by P only in CLO/LO embryos.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz836.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td35n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teratogenic agents.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phenytoin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fatty acids.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj95m"><dcterms:title>La situation de l'affr√©teur/propri√©taire de Cargaison au regard de "L'oil Pollution Act" Am√©ricain de 1990 /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Etcheberry, Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>On August 18, 1990, President Bush signed into law the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), the most comprehensive federal legislation ever dealing with oil spill liability, compensation, prevention, response and research. Upper limits on shipowners and operators' liability are set under OPA, but are somewhat artificial and can be overidden by individual states choosing to impose unlimited liability. Consequently, mutual insurance associations are refusing to provide the required financial guaranties needed to acquire the Certificates of financial responsibility, basing their refusal on an interpretation that OPA grants unlimited liability for oil pollution claims. The purpose of this thesis is to focus on the potential exposure of charterers and cargo owners who are not specifically mentioned in the Act. If U.S. courts classify them as "operators", the whole oil industry is threatened. The U.S., as the most "energy-hungry" nation in the world, imports well over 400 million tons of oil annually, but is unwilling to take any of the environmental risks involved or even share such risks with the international maritime community.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, W.

Immunoblotting demonstrated that seven perforatorial polypeptides tested in this study, had epitopes in common. Immunogold labeling of spermatozoa showed that the distribution of the 34, 43, 57 and 63 kDa polypeptides corresponded exactly to the regions of the perinuclear theca immunolabeled with the whole perforatorium serum. However, antibodies affinity purified against the 13, 13.4 and 16 kDa polypeptides were restricted in their localization to the thicker apical portion of the perforatorium and to the inner layer of the ventral spur. These results suggest (1) the perforatorium is biochemically distinct from the postacrosomal sheath with the exception of a restricted region referred to as the ventral spur; (2) there are regional differences in protein composition of the perforatorium, of the outer periacrosomal layer and of the postacrosomal sheath; and (3) that perforatorial polypeptides may not necessarily be restricted to the subacrosomal region, by may also compose portions of the outer periacrosomal layer, and postacrosomal sheath; and (4) Actin is not part of the perforatorium in mature rat spermatozoa.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236329s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fj27c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r431t"><dcterms:title>The neurological basis of linguistic prosody : an acoustic investigation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Human Communication Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ouellette, Gene Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explored the ability of left hemisphere damaged (LHD) nonfluent aphasics, right hemisphere damaged (RHD) patients, and normal speakers to produce acoustic correlates of linguistic prosody.

Results indicated that RHD and LHD groups resembled normal speakers in the use of fundamental frequency and amplitude to encode stress, indicating preserved abilities in both neurological populations. However, the LHD aphasic subjects demonstrated patterns of durational alterations that were statistically different from those obtained for the control and RHD groups. The data are indicative of a basic impairment in speech timing subsequent to LHD.

Cortical specimens were analyzed after six and twelve week periods of implantation. Bone ingrowth at six weeks for the cobalt-chromium implants averaged 50.4% $ pm$ 10.4% and for the titanium implants averaged 54.1% $ pm$ 5.1%. At twelve weeks, ingrowth for cobalt-chromium was 55.1% $ pm$ 9.2% and for titanium was 57.3% $ pm$ 9.3%.
