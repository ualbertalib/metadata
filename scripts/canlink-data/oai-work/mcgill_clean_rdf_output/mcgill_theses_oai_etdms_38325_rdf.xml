The essential steps required to optimize the fabrication conditions were established. Firstly, parameters such as quantum efficiency, junction depth, surface recombination velocity, and minority carrier diffusion length are analyzed. Secondly, the dark current-voltage characteristics of devices were measured. Some detector dark current is only 80nA at 0.5V reverse bias. It was confirmed that the diffusion current and recombination current are comparable in the dark current transport mechanism of the CuInSe2 homojunctions. Thirdly, the relationships between capacitance-voltage, capacitance-frequency characteristics were also investigated. It was observed that at a given voltage, the capacitance value decreased when the measuring frequency was increased. This result confirmed that deep defects exist in the material. Fourthly, the diffusion length of minority carriers was determined by the photocurrent and capacitance method. The diffusion length is smaller than 1 micron. The quantum efficiency and photoresponse were also measured. The maximum quantum efficiency of the detectors was measured as high as 60%. The photodetector response time range from 14 mus to 21 mus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, I.

This particular qualitative study explored the feelings and experiences of permanent grandparent caregivers between the ages of 58 and 71. Data was collected using a semi structured interview format from four separate couple grandparents and one single grandmother. Although the study was limited due to the small sample size, the findings showed that despite some rewards, grandparent caregivers experienced a number of emotional issues. In analyzing the written transcripts, several themes emerged, included: feelings of loss; anger and frustration, disappointment and guilt; fears and concerns; isolation and lack of supports and, positive aspects. There were also several variations on these themes. The need for grandparent caregivers to be able to access services, and especially support groups for themselves, was evident.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wright, Robin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw39b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cj43j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caregivers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grandparent and child.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj3860877p"><dcterms:title>Implementing change in child protection agencies : the case of the Ontario Risk Assessment Model at Children's Aid Society "X"</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carter, Jayna.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This qualitative study presents findings from interviews with ten front line social workers employed at a small, eastern Ontario Children's Aid Society.

NO is a putative neurotransmitter involved in the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) system and is synthesized by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS has been localized in peripheral autonomic nerves innervating vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles in many organ systems. The introduction of intracavernous injection (ICI) of vasoactive agents in 1981 was an effective means to restore erectile function for men with erectile dysfunction (ED). Recent evidence supports the theory that increased blood flow can induce the release of NO from vascular endothelium, suggesting that ICI may have positive benefits for the host. Our study looked at (1) a new delivery system for intracavernous injection and (2) the effect of modulation of penile flow on the regulation of NOS content and activity. A canine model assessed the effectiveness of a subcutaneous drug delivery as an alternate means to ICI. Additionally, a paraplegic rat model was developed to assess the effects of chronic ICI of papaverine on the expression of NOS in the penile tissue. Our first objective, testing a new subcutaneous drug delivery system, yielded no data due to technical difficulties. The experiment involving the rat model, our results demonstrated that ICI of papaverine significantly increased the number of NOS fibers within the penile shaft, indicating that an increase in the flow of blood within the penis can alter levels of NOS within penile tissue. This result may in part explain the observation seen in patients, whereby after 1 year of ICI, spontaneous erections return and ICI therapy may be discontinued.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brock, G.

She draws a distinction between the vita activa and the vita contemplativa, challenging prior conceptions of the radical division between the two. I examine, in Arendt's work, the concepts of solitude and isolation and how these inform her discourse on reflective thinking. It is my argument that the distinction between these two concepts cannot be drawn as neatly as she attempted to do. These two states of being in fact meet in the figure of the pariah as critical thinker, as well as storyteller, and finally as a catalyst for public action. I submit that there is a subtextual theme of temporality within Arendt's work and then move to demonstrate how this theme expresses the nature and context of thinking and judging, in relation to action. Finally, I draw upon Arendt's distinctions between thinking and judging, arguing that one cannot be extracted from the other and that the two cannot be defined as autonomous, in the context of critical thinking.

Both cas15 and cas30 genes are present in the genomes of both species but whereas both genes are cold-induced in M. arborea, only cas15 is induced in M. truncatula. Cold-induced expression of these genes is inhibited by calcium chelators and channel blockers and by the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol. Treatment of leaves with dimethylsulfoxide, a membrane rigidifier, induced both genes at 25°C. A cold-activated MAP kinase activity was expressed in both species.

It is found that maternal transmission is likely to occur at low rates. Measures taken to eliminate meat and bone meal feed supplements, the main infection source, have essentially eliminated BSE.

Ochromonas sp., Chrysochromulina ericina (a coastal strain) and C. ericina (an oceanic strain) were grown in iron-free seawater supplemented with 1 muM goethite, hematite, magnetite/maghemite or ferrihydrite (90°) in the presence and absence of desferrioxamme B, an iron-binding siderophore. Both strains of Chrysochromulina grew at 35--70% of their maximum rates with goethite, hematite, and magnetite/maghemite, but were unable to use ferrihydrite. Ochromonas, however, grew well with ferrihydrite, but could not use any of the other forms. All the flagellates were able to acquire iron from ingested bacteria. Diatoms that were known only to take up dissolved forms of iron, Thalassiosira oceanica (clone 1003) and T. pseudonana (clone 3H), were unable to use any of the colloids tested. The mechanism of iron acquisition by the flagellates appeared to involve ingestion of the iron colloids as DFB had no effect on colloidal iron availability and bacteria resident in the cultures were unable to use the iron contained in the colloids. Variations in the size of the colloids were hypothesized to account for differences in their availability, independent of colloid chemical stability. The results provide the first strong evidence for direct utilization (i.e. without prior dissolution) of colloidal iron by mixotrophic phytoplankton and document a new pathway of iron acquisition that may be important for their survival in low-iron waters of the sea.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Price, Neil (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393911.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv64j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iron -- Physiological transport.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Colloids.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chrysochromulina.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marine phytoplankton.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ochromonas.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iron -- Metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px89s"><dcterms:title>Developmental relationships in the function of pea root plastids</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Hongping, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Germinating pea (Pisum sativum L.) roots were divided into five sequential 0.5 cm segments from the root tip.

Fresh weights of root segments were lowest in the tips (4.45mug per segment) and progressively higher up to the fifth segment (11.09mug per segment). Total protein, starch and lipid content, on a per segment basis, were all highest in zone 1 (tip segment) and progressively lower up to zone 5. Plastids were isolated from each of the five root segments and analyzed for their capacity for lipid biosynthesis under several different in vitro conditions. Collectively, the observations presented here suggest that the relative contributions of plastids to the overall physiology of germinating pea roots gradually diminishes as root development proceeds, and that plastids isolated from progressively older root zones have increased capacity for glycolytic and/or pentose phosphate metabolism.

This thesis attempts to identify three binding partners of E4orf6: p14, p19, and pp84. Mapping studies revealed residues 1--43 of E4orf6 were unnecessary for p14 and p19 binding. Mdm-2 and p14 ARF were selected as potential candidates for pp84 and p19 respectively. No interaction was observed between E4orf6 and Mdm-2. Binding of E4orf6 and p14ARF was observed, however attempts to clarify the interaction were inconclusive. After purification, microsequencing analysis identified p14 as Elongin C, p19 as Elongin B, and pp84 as VACM-1/Cul5. These proteins are known to exist in a complex containing E3-ligase activity, necessary for ubiquitin-proteasome mediated protein degradation. As E4orf6 acts with E1B-55kDa to induce p53 degradation, it may do so by recruiting this complex. Future studies will elucidate more about the role of E4orf6 in p53 degradation, and may reveal new functions of this viral protein.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.

Others, on the contrary, considered that cultural industries constitute commodities entirely subjected to the principles of free trade. This thesis analyzes the present debate in order to determine if the cultural value of certain industries is enough to justify a specific treatment in international trade. For that purpose, the study goes back to the historical origins of the problem and attempts to determine if these industries have a specificity, particularly by analyzing their role in a society and by examining their legal nature. Based on these considerations, during the negotiations of the international trade agreements, some States intended to impose their point of view. Some of the latest agreements hold a specific regime to the cultural sector, whereas others did not refer explicitly to these. However, several governments have implemented support measures for their cultural industries, something other States considered violations to the principles of free trade and attacked them on political and legal grounds. Finally, this thesis examines the recent evolutions of the debate, especially at the time of the new round of negotiations within the framework of the WTO. It analyzes, as well, the new questions given arise by the development of new technologies, the new strategies of the States, and the solutions proposed to solve this debate. Most of these solutions refer to the cultural diversity concept, which, in a sense tend to appear as a political objective, which will make it possible to draw some legal conclusions in the field of international trade.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>de Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dr43k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r69p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Free trade.</dc:subject><dc:subject>International trade.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cultural policy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Commercial policy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gj307"><dcterms:title>La responsabilité des controleurs aériens dans les systèmes américain et français /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Warriner, Vanessa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the international level, standards and recommended practices adopted by the ICAO have settled the general framework followed by States in the provision of ATC services. However, as those international instruments have no binding effect, liability of air traffic controllers is governed by national regulations. Therefore, if in both the United States and France the liability regime is based on fault, nevertheless the nature of the fault and the one of the duties of air traffic controllers, as determined by the courts of each States, differ. This lack of uniformity is also obvious regarding the comparison between controllers' and pilots' liabilities. To mitigate the consequences of the deficiency of harmonisation, taking into account technical improvements inherent to the field of ATC and, broadly, to air navigation, two solutions have been suggested. The first one, Free flight, is still under study whereby the second one, privatisation, has already been successfully implemented in several countries and, while being strongly considered by the French government, has by now been initiated by the American one.

A rational and well-balanced treatment is long awaited. Indeed, the artificial distinction between co-operative and concentrative joint ventures was based on complex and contradictory criteria. The European Commission applied them flexibly at the expense of predictability, damaging the legal certainty that is so necessary for these transactions. The existence of two distinct regimes, one for concentrative and one for co-operative joint ventures, with more favourable treatment for the former, explains why firms wished to subject their transactions to the Merger Regulation rather than article 81 of the Treaty. The reform of the Merger Regulation, which entered into force in 1998, modifies the boundaries between the different types of joint ventures, now focusing on structural criterion. It gives birth to a new distinction between structural and behavioural joint ventures. This simplification of the qualification phase, however, raises new questions relating to the content and the relevance of the chosen criterion.

This study explores one man's journey of survival and the recurring issues that have deterred his complete healing. Sexual abuse is examined in its social and political context as well as issues related to male victimization. The myths and stereotypes surrounding males who have been sexually abused are addressed. The notion that only women are sexually abused and that men abuse, is challenged. This case is analyzed by focusing on the trauma, the immediate effects, the immediate adaptation and the long term consequences. The long term effects are addressed in-depth and focus on issues such as grief and loss and attachment related difficulties. The theory that links attachment in infancy and attachment-related trauma to later dissociative symptoms is addressed. Also, the notion that abuse is often symptomatic of the system of caregiving within the family is argued. The nature and duration of the abuse is not random, but systematically related to the family's functioning. In this respect, Dissociative Identity Disorder is viewed as an adaptive technique resulting from an abusive situation, rather than a pathology. The importance of incorporating a loss model in treating these individuals is emphasized by addressing non-bereavement losses and attachment related issues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, Ingrid (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj99j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430661n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dissociative disorders -- Case studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child sexual abuse -- Case studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644t439"><dcterms:title>Specialized worker training related to child sexual abuse custodyaccess investigations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gentile, Sonia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this paper the researcher discusses the importance of specialized training for workers in child welfare who are responding to allegations of child sexual abuse in the context of custody/access disputes. The researcher has implemented an experimental design involving two matched groups of staff, equally sized, from an Ontario child welfare agency. Participants were requested to complete a pre-test and post-test which measured the priority assigned to a set of fictitious scenarios developed for the project. A training session was offered to the experimental group prior to the post-test. The outcome data suggests that the training affected the coding which members of the experimental group applied to scenarios. The experimental group tended to consider dynamics related to the issue of custody/access when assessing the priority of response time given to a referral. The control group evidenced no consideration of such dynamics. The researcher has included a number of recommendations within the analysis section so that future applications of similar studies may be improved. The conclusion of this study clearly states that adequate worker training is essential in order that objective, reliable, and competent service is available to child welfare clients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rowe, Bill (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386m229.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t439</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social workers -- Training of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child welfare workers -- Training of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child sexual abuse -- Investigation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290c372"><dcterms:title>Embodiments of art, narratives of architecture : in the Sir John Soane Museum</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martin, Cécile.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sir John Soane (1753--1837) is an intriguing character.

Once you have dived, accepted the invitation, you have found a house full of art objects gathered to teach architecture. Art and architecture meet. The experience is haunting. Through it the architect rediscovers the story of objects to identify, the everyday story he builds. The experience of the House is a mirroring of Soane's mind.

The model user is required to enter a set of basic data: crop and field conditions, irrigation technical parameters and basic economic data, following which the model establishes the preliminary irrigation system and a comparative investment analysis. The model was applied and tested on a potato farm situated in Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix (southwestern Quebec). Based on a 14-year climatic analysis, supplemental irrigation for a normal rainfall growing period (368 mm) was estimated at 250 mm. The application of the model indicates that for a normal rainfall period with an assumed yield increase of 25% over non-irrigated production, all three systems provide net profits (increases of 11% to 50%). However, when determining the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on a 10-year period, the maximum rate attained by the more profitable systems---portable pipe and non-towable centre pivot (both with an electric pump)---was 14%, a rate inferior to the IRR for non-irrigated production (17%). The Net Present Value (NPV) analysis for the two most profitable irrigation systems provided a slightly higher NPV value for irrigated than for non-irrigated production ($10,942---irrigated vs $10,522---non-irrigated production). The payback period for those two irrigation systems was 7 years. Greater gains of irrigated over non-irrigated yields would be expected for a dry period because of low and unpredictable yields in non-irrigated conditions. A farmer planning to invest in an irrigation system must carefully investigate all technical and socio-economic aspects. The model presented gives the farmer a useful tool with which to do this.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bonnell, Robert (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kv69d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z026x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Potato industry -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potatoes -- Irrigation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Irrigation -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m3708"><dcterms:title>Biological control of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Templeton, Karen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two European leaf-eating beetles, Galerucella calmariensis L. and G. pusilla (Duft.)(Chrysomelidae:Coleoptera) were released at four sites in Quebec to manage the semi-aquatic exotic weed, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.). Protocols for monitoring the Galerucella populations and detecting changes in the plant communities were implemented. In addition, the effect of seeding with native plants species in conjunction with Galerucella herbivory was tested in an experiment at a purple loosestrife stand in Ontario. Releases of lab-reared beetles in Quebec in 1996 did not survive to 1997 at any of the 4 sites, but releases of field collected beetles in 1997 overwintered successfully at 3 of the 4 sites. The density of purple loosestrife in 1998 ranged from 28% (Cap Tourmente) to 84% (Hull). The density of Galerucella in 1998 ranged from 6 (Lac St Francois) to 50 (Hull) adults/m 2/min. In the Ontario experiment, herbivory and seeding together interacted to increase the biomass of other plant species significantly---and thereby reduced the dominance (proportion of the biomass) of purple loosestrife---but did not have a significant effect on the biomass of purple loosestrife in the first season.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, R.

The only known function of E4orf4 is to bind to the Balpha subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). A series of experiments were performed with both wild-type and mutant forms of E4orf4 to examine Balpha subunit binding and cell killing following introduction into p53-deficient cells. Deletion mutant analysis indicated residues 12--18 and 103--114 were not required for cell killing. Point mutant analysis indicated that residues required for Balpha binding and cell killing are dispersed throughout the E4orf4 sequence. Analysis of these results showed that binding to PP2A via its Balpha subunit is essential for induction of p53-independent apoptosis by E4orf4. Binding assays showed that E4orf4 cannot bind B'' subunits of PP2A. In human cells, E4orf4 induces an apoptosic pathway that involves caspase-3 independent cleavage of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase. E4orf4's activity may be controlled through post-translational modification since E4orf4 was found to be phosphorylated on serine residues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.

The results also revealed that reserve networks encompassing the majority of the biodiversity could be established using as little as 10% of the information. The key to producing efficient networks is the ability of the selection algorithm to identify complementary sets of sites in terms of species composition. The results reveal that the algorithm can best accomplish this when the data set used is produced using a geographically intensive site-based survey approach. The results were consistent over three data sets, the original and two modified, indicating that they are transferable to geographic areas and species groups with differing species distribution characteristics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Seutin, Gilles (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z274q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q275</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>National protected areas systems -- Québec (Province) -- Planning.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Birds -- Québec (Province) -- Geographical distribution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biodiversity conservation -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
