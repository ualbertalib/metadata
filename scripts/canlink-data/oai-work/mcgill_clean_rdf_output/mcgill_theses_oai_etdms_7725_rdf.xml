It may be stated on general grounds that a full knowledge of the chemical nature of rubber is essential to its most efficient utilization.

In the past, many concrete specifications have been drawn up and have failed to state the proportions by definite weight or vol1une, but give the quantities simply in "parts." This kind of specification left much to the honesty of the contractor who could choose within certain limits, which would not be altogether too grotesque, what he would consider to be the weight of a cubic foot of cement. By this method of simply stating the quantities by parts an unscrupulous contractor can measure a oubio foot of cement very loosely packed andthus produce too lean a concrete.

In succeeding chapters he develops his theory of an ideal state, the chief safe-guard of which is to be found in education. The  governors, he says, must be careful to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation, quoting Damon to the effect that a change in the songs of a country would soon result ln the alteration of its laws.
