In this thesis, a 3-step Nyquist rate ADC is presented which makes use of bitstream processing to calibrate the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the residue amplifier, while using the same hardware to calibrate the sub-ADC. The system is designed to provide programmability and calibrate undesired circuit characteristics such as offset, gain error, and nonlinearity. Thus, the DAC can tolerate gain errors much higher than the standard amount, and has the potential to completely cancel nonlinearity and offsets in its transfer function. The offset of the residue amplifier can also be calibrated with this system. Moreover, the system eliminates the need for a reference ladder in the sub-ADC, and calibrates comparator offsets. Simulation and experimental results of the circuits fabricated in a 0.18mum CMOS process are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, G. W.

The approach aims to improve the material distribution of a formed thermoplastic part via better sheet temperature control prior to forming. Improved control of material distribution will increase part quality and result in fewer part rejects, thereby increasing production efficiency. A process model consisting of individual components describing sensor, heater, and sheet heating dynamics has been developed. Recommendations for improvements to the process model, particularly for the sheet heating model, are also made.

After 1989, Romanian history books changed. In my thesis, I seek to modify the myth of invincible Romanian heroes and to understand the reason why Romanian principalities enjoyed a special treatment during the Ottoman period. The Romanian principalities served as buffer states, stopping, halting the Ottoman advancement to the north of the Danube on many occasions. The double game often used by Romanian leaders helped Valaquia and Moldavia retain their special status. Also, the treaties of vassalage signed with the Romanians and the power of the Orthodox Church have prevented the Ottomans from imposing their own laws and customs.

It is a work of art, an artwork. A common understanding of what art is and should be forms the background to the diverse works' heterogeneous forms of expression. Although the focus of this paper is on one of Hoffmann's Works, it reveals Hoffmann's ideas and ideals as a human being and romantic author, as well as his philosophical outlook on life ("Weltanschauung"). In Hoffmann's "The Devil's Elixirs," practically impossible events often serve a psychological function, by projecting the hero's internal processes externally and portraying mental or emotional events in realistic images. In his novel, the poet did not just seek to portray a psychological conflict, but rather to use the various means provided by his knowledge and imagination to write a captivating, interesting story, which also reflects his ideas and ideals. Hoffmann was not a psychologist, but rather a poet. He didn't write a medical case history, he wrote a novel. His experience and observations of the internal and external world of human beings served as a stimulus for literary creation, without being the sole theme of the artistic work.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schmidt, Josef (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107094b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq064</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hoffmann, E.

Bossuet taught a lesson in humility, modesty and piety, in a language that was bound to leave an imprint on the worldly; heroics, praise, moral portrait, epic tables and Cornelian vocabulary, usually destined for entertainment, were now used to convert: pagan techniques to save souls....

Participants ranging from 8 to 20 years of age completed the Attitudes and Gambling Activities Questionnaire (AGAQ) and scaled questions designed to delineate the perceived degree of skill and luck involved in various gambling activities. The frequency and reasons youth engage in specific gambling activities and explored attitudes and their relationship to perceptions of perceived control over gambling outcomes. Results revealed age and gender related attitudes toward gambling that may increase their vulnerability to developing problem gambling were examined. Older youth expressed more tolerance of gambling activities while young children under-estimated the addictive nature of gambling and over-estimated the degree of control over gambling outcomes. Males expressed being less fearful of getting caught gambling and had much more tolerant attitudes toward gambling behaviors. Furthermore, those youth found to have a greater number of permissive and/or irresponsible attitudes also had greater misperceptions concerning the degree of skill involved in gambling. Phase II of the study elaborated upon quantitative findings through focus group analysis involving 59 participants in grades 4, 7, 9 and 11. Results expanded upon findings regarding youths' perceptions of gambling and attitudes towards gambling at school, and outline youths' understanding of responsible gambling.

The 4,200 hectare bog provides habitat to a large number of rare and endangered species and plays an integral role as a natural water filter. This study used the contingent valuation survey method to estimate respondents' willingness to pay for the preservation of the Alfred Bog wetland, which is threatened by the competing activities of drainage, burning, and the extraction of peat. A multiple bounded discrete choice model was used to analyze the survey results. Results indicated that respondents were willing to pay an average of $79.22, in the form of a one-time voluntary contribution to a hypothetical preservation fund, for the preservation of the Alfred Bog wetland. Conservation club membership, visits to the bog, donations to wetland preservation programs, attitudes, distance from the bog, household income, and education level were found to be important predictors of willingness to pay. Aggregate willingness to pay to preserve the bog was estimated to be between $2.2 million to $663,000 depending upon the inclusion or exclusion of protest bids. The survey results suggested that most of this value was nonuse value attributed to option, bequest, and altruistic values. Thus, the failure of policy makers and resource managers to consider nonuse values in decision making processes can understate the value of preserving the Alfred Bog.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomassin, Paul (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cz47g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c0126</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Contingent valuation -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wetland conservation -- Ontario.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42n981r"><dcterms:title>Molecular characterization of a novel, aberrant type of apoptosis induced by the adenoviral death protein E4orf4</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Szymborski, Adam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The adenoviral Early Region 4 open reading frame 4 (E4orf4) protein has been shown to induce p53-independent apoptosis in transformed human cell lines. In rodent cells, E4orf4 has been shown to mediate apoptosis in the presence of a caspase inhibitor. These early results suggested that E4orf4 triggers a novel, non-classical form of apoptosis that may be independent of the core death machinery. A series of experiments were performed to analyze the activation of apoptotic machinery in response to the expression of E4orf4 in human cell lines. The analysis of E4orf4-induced cell death focused on a detailed examination of molecular mechanisms involved in the induction and execution of classical apoptosis. The results showed that E4orf4 induces moderate levels of cell killing of human cancer cells and causes some externalization of phosphatidylserine. However, E4orf4-mediated cell death is not associated with the activation of caspases or with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Furthermore, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) is not proteolytically processed, mitochondrial membranes are not depolarized, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not generated. Thus, E4orf4 seems to induce an aberrant type of apoptosis characterized by no apparent activation of the classic molecular apoptotic machinery.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.

The main purpose of this study was to determine whether winter-born and non-winter-born schizophrenia patients differ in terms of PMA and to examine how family history may influence the association. A second objective was to determine which of the proposed underlying seasonal factor, and during which trimester of gestation, explains the most variance in PMA. Method.

Non-winter-birth and a positive family history of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were associated with worse PMA. Prenatal exposure to both sunshine and temperatures during the first and third trimesters of gestation explained variance in particular PMA dimensions.

To determine if RPTPsigma might influence axonal regeneration, the time course of regeneration following facial nerve crush in wild type and RPTPsigma (-/-) mice was compared. Mice lacking RPTPsigma exhibited an accelerated rate of functional recovery, suggesting that RPTPsigma slows the extension of regenerating axons. We detected a decrease in RPTPsigma expression by facial motoneurons following nerve crush in wild type mice. Consistent with this, we show that the rate of axon extension is enhanced in neurons obtained from RPTPsigma (-/-) mice. Furthermore, in wild type mice. RPTPsigma is enriched in axonal growth cones. These findings indicate that RPTPsigma slows axon growth via a mechanism intrinsic to the neuron and identify a role for RPTPsigma in regulating axonal regeneration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kennedy, Timothy E.

Daycare centres play a role in hepatitis A infection epidemiology; however, there is little information on this infection among daycare educators in Canada. Objective. To determine hepatitis A seroprevalence and risk factors among daycare educators. Methods. Directors and educators from randomly selected daycare centres in Montreal completed questionnaires on daycare-level and educator-level characteristics. Sera were collected during on-site visits. Results. The seroprevalence of hepatitis A among the 492 participating educators was 35.6% (15.9% among Canadian-born educators). Risk factors included: region of birth by income-level (OR = 20.8; 95% CI: 9.4, 46.0); report of previous hepatitis A vaccination (OR = 6.1; 95% CI: 2.9, 13.0); travel to endemic areas (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.2); and age (OR5-yr = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.7). For Canadian-born educators, a further association was found between seropositivity and years worked in daycare (OR5-yr = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.8). Conclusion.

The sulfurizing reagent "EDITH" allowed for the synthesis of the diastereomeric mixture of dimers with minimal formation of oxidized side products. The separation of the two isomers was carried out using silica gel flash chromatography to afford the stereoisomerically pure Rp and S p dimers. The orthogonal solution-phase coupling of the individual dimers to the appropriately protected monomers allowed for the creation of the corresponding branched trimers bearing vicinal 2',5'-phophorothioate and 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages. Conversely, a convergent solid-phase strategy applicable to the synthesis of branched oligonucleotides was employed to construct a symmetrical branched phosphodiester trimer, A(pG)pG, using an adenosine bisphosphoramidite synthon. This compound served as a positive control substrate, relative to both the Sp and Rp-phophorothioate V-trimers, in the investigation of the stereochemical requirements of the yeast debranching enzyme (yDBR) at the 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage.

Two approaches are tested thoroughly. The first is to use forced convection to heat the sample. This is tested experimentally up to about 500 K with 1.5 mm thick samples and theoretical calculations are used to resolve these data and to predict the behaviour of the thin ribbons at higher temperatures. The results show that the ideal configuration for this heating mechanism involves heating the ends of the samples while allowing hot gas to flow over the surface. Despite its expected advantages, such as small thermal gradients within the sample, this system should have poor long term stability and require a difficult calibration in order to couple the gas heater to the heaters at the ends of the sample.

We represent vortex filaments as thin tubes on a 3D-grid and use a Lagrangian vortex filament method to describe their motion within a level set framework. We thus obtain a hybrid method that incorporates the accuracy of vortex methods in modelling filament motion and the benefits of working on a fixed grid within the level set framework. These benefits include a general grid characterization of the topological changes that, may occur and natural filtering of high-frequency perturbations. We have validated the consistency of the hybrid method reproducing the motion of well studied configurations of vortex filaments. More importantly, we have demonstrated the capability of this hybrid method to simulate the reconnection of vortex filaments for a number of examples, including the reconnection subsequent to the head-on collision of two sinusoidally perturbed circular filaments. To our knowledge, these are the first results illustrating the use of a hybrid Level-Set Lagrangian framework to model and simulate the reconnection of vortex filaments in an inviscid fluid.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Siddiqi, Kaleem (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Cortelezzi, Luca (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p0969111.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv51q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bh02t"><dcterms:title>Whole cell and single channel analysis of cloned T-type calcium channel functionally expressed in HEK cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Foster, Nicholas E.

Whole cell currents were measured in 2 mM extracellular Ca2+, and single channel activity was recorded from cell-attached patches in 120 mM Ba2+. We found that macroscopic rates of activation, deactivation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation each have voltage-dependent and voltage-independent components. Single channels opened and closed rapidly in bursts before inactivating, with a mean open time of 1 ms, a mean intra-burst close time of 0.3 ms, and a mean burst duration of 5.5 ms. The conductance of these openings was 4.4 pS. We also observed occasional larger and smaller openings that may indicate subconductance states. These data will further contribute to the understanding of the biophysical function and diversity of this calcium channel isoform.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ragsdale, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tr219.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bh02t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vd383"><dcterms:title>End-of-life : insight from administrative data</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Bruno</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to develop and test the validity of an algorithm allowing the classification of the decedents as were dying of, died of and died with BC, using administrative data, for the study of service delivery to the terminally ill.

From April 2001--February 2002, qualitative, key informant interviews and survey data collection methods were employed. Questions were appended to a study monitoring HIV risk among Montreal IDU. Univariate and bivariate analyses preceded logistic regression. 11 key informants and 251 IDU participated in the study. Key informants generated specific SIT models subsequently presented to IDU. Overall, SIF acceptability was high. Two logistic regression models presented factors independently predictive of potential SIF use including drug use characteristics and SIF attributes.

The tridimensional fold is similar to that previously observed for the human isoform, except for a missing N-terminal alpha helix out of the five helices expected in total. A series of putative binding partners was identified in public databases, based on a consensual interaction motif that we formally defined as being S-X-L-[NS]-X-[ND]-A-X-E-F-X-P. However, no putative binding partner could be found that would match this pattern in S. Cerevisiae. Phylogenetic modeling tends to indicate that such an interacting domain might not be a fundamental part, if existing at all, of PABC function. A tridimensional model of each of the remaining twenty PABC orthologs was generated: the overall fold of five consecutive helices seen in human PABC is well conserved, in contradiction with recently published modeling studies based on the crystal structure of the homologous PABC domain from HYD, which predicts only four helices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehring, Kalle (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq414.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c436</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644t48p"><dcterms:title>Caspase inhibitors rescue renal hypoplasia of PAX2 mutant mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Clark, Patsy C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Heterozygous 1Neu mice transmit a single base pair insertion mutation within the paired domain (exon 2) of the PAX2 gene; this mutation is identical to that in humans with Renal-Coloboma Syndrome.
