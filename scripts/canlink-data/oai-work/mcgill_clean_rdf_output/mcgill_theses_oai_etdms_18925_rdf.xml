These authors claimed that a commercial cellulose "dinitrate" ( N, 11.9% ) yielded an acetylide which retained a small amount of nitrate groups and also contained amino groups derived from by-product sodamide. Segall, in a Ph.D. thesis submitted to this University in 1946, showed that hydroxylamlne or O-methyl hydroxylamine in pyridine reacted with cellulose trinitrate in pyridine to yield a white fibrous material approximating cellulose dinitrate in composition, and which was unusually stable to bases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

The beginning of the 19th century saw the family on this continent as an almost self-sufficient social and economic unit. Gradually, however, its many functions were taken over by other institutions; education by the school, religious guidance by the church, the manufacture of personal and household goods by the factories, recreation by the community centres.

Subject to restrictions of a rather broad nature, which will be investigated in the sequel, the definition of a norm in terms of the elements of a matrix is arbitrary.

Indeed, 2,3-dihydro-l-tosylquinolin-3(1H)-one derivatives, aza-isoflavanones, have been efficiently synthesized via a gold-catalyzed annulation of 2-tosylaminobenzaldehyde and alkynes.

Some of these experiences have been pleasant, others have been arduous, a few have been considered as chores but rarely has a committee membership been accounted an activity of such worth as to lead to an increase in personal knowledge and enhancement within the profession. Having been an active participant in numerous committees and having had an advisory relationship to others, one is sometimes inclined to agree with the anonymous wit who believed that 'the best committee is that one which consists of a good chairman and two members, the latter being absent.'

When it was realized that the complex analysis rests heavily upon the concept of the "absolute value" which in turn could be characterized axiomatically as a certain valuation satisfying the weak triangle law it became evident that other valuations could also be used to construct analogues of the classical function theory. As, Ostrowski 12 had showed there are essentially two types of valuations: archimedean and nonarchimedian. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zassenhaus, H.

Most frequently a monograph is presented, a ease study documenting the economic possibililities and making definite policy recommendations for a given country. This method is essentially empirical and inductive; the concern is with immediate obstacles to economic progress. There is little attempt to deal with economic development more generally or to formulate a theory which might be applicable to a variety of countries and conditions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h566b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580r57q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Economics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
