In the present study it was found that these AChR patches often occur at sites of strong adhesion with the culture dish and remain in a fixed position, relatively unchanged for several days. Discrete patches of cholinesterase (ChE) also develop, often at the same sites as the AChR patches, even if the muscle cells have never been innervated in vivo. ChE, like AChRs, also becomes localized at sites of nerve-muscle contact in cultures grown with spinal cord cells whether or not neuromuscular transmission is blocked by curare. The results further indicate that in addition to directing AChR and ChE localization to the site of nerve-muscle contact, the nerve prevents the formation and reduces the survival of AChR and ChE patches elsewhere on the muscle cell.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s37z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bz02k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k5845"><dcterms:title>The synthesis of 8R, 11R, 15 (R and S)-trihydroxy-9S, 12S-oxyeicosa-5Z, 13E-dienoic acids and related compounds /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Oh, Hunseung, 1946-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The structure of 8,11,15-trihydroxy-9,12-oxyeicosa-5,13-dienoic acid A, isolated by Pace-Asciak and Wolfe from enzymatic incubation of arachidonic acid, was proven by the synthesis of 8R,9S,11R,12S,15(R and S) isomers 1a and 1b.

The flow stress was determined in constant true strain rate hot compression over the strain rate 10('-4)-10('-1)s('-1). In order to provide data for LOCA modelling, the 0 concentration range 1260 to 12360 ppm was investigated. For the single phase (alpha) and (beta) materials, the flow curves were normal, whereas the ((alpha)+(beta)) materials exhibited significant yield drops and strain aging, especially when over 50 vol.% (beta) was present. These effects are attributed to the enrichment of the (beta) phase by the solutes Fe and Cr, which are considered to form ordered zones of the Zr(Fe,Cr)(,2) type in the vicinity of dislocations. The flow stress for both the (alpha) and (beta) Zircaloy-2 obeyed the relationship (sigma) = (sigma)(,0) exp(kc), where (sigma)(,0) and k are constants and c is the wt.% 0. The experimental values indicated that 0 strengthens the (beta) phase less effectively than the (alpha) phase. Rule of mixtures calculations were carried out to predict the flow stresses of the ((alpha)+(beta)) alloys; these agreed reasonably well with the experimental data, as long as due allowance was made for the 0 enrichment and 0 empoverishment of the (alpha) and (beta) phases, respectively. Within the experimental range, the rate sensitivities increased with temperature from 0.13 to 0.20 and from 0.27 to 0.32 for the fully (alpha) and fully (beta) materials. By contrast, the m vs. T curves for the two-phase materials were marked by a rapid increase in m near the beginning and end of the ((alpha)+(beta)) domain, with a dip at large (beta) fractions, particularly in the high 0 alloys. The dip in rate sensitivity was associated with significant strain aging. The experimental activation energies decreased with stress from 440 to 330 kJ/mol (50 to 140 MPa) and from 150 to 125 kJ/mol (1 to 5 MPa) for the (alpha) and (beta) Zircaloy-2 respectively. The extrapolated zero-stress values of Q increased with 0 concentration from 520 to 570 kJ/mol and from 170 to 260 kJ/mol for the (alpha) and (beta) materials, respectively. These data indicate that high temperature dynamic recovery is easier to activate in the (beta) phase but is more sensitive to oxygen than is (alpha) Zircaloy-2.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zp23r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p80n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metals -- Effect of high temperatures on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zircaloy-2 -- Metallurgy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonferrous metals -- Metallurgy -- Oxygen processes.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pn829"><dcterms:title>Operating characteristics and energy distribution in transferred plasma arc systems : a thesis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Choi, H.

The plasmagen gas consisted of pure argon and arc lengths as high as 7 cm were studied. The arc voltage increased markedly with arc length and with an increase in the inlet velocity of the argon flow past the cathode tip, and much less with an increase in current. The effect of the gas velocity was minor at low velocities (1 to 3 m/s) but became important at higher velocities (20 to 60 m/s). Arc length and gas velocity were again the major factors in the distribution of the arc energy. For long arcs and at high gas velocities, the energy emitted by the arc to the wall of the chamber was dominant, while for short arcs the energy absorbed by the water-cooled anode was greater. In all cases, the fraction of the input energy absorbed by the water-cooled cathode, or leaving the system as sensible heat in the exit gas was small. At the anode, the major contribution was from electron recombination, with convection heat transfer from the plasma somewhat less. Direct radiation from the plasma to the anode surface was very small. The recombination of the electron stream occurred on a very small area of the anode ((TURN) 5 mm in diameter). In spite of the energetic water cooling, appreciable vaporization took place on that area. Appropriate instrumentation permitted the measurement of the stagnation-pressure and pressure distribution on the anode, and that of total heat flux and radiative heat transfer. From the latter, it was estimated that the plasma temperature just above the anode was in the range 10,000 - 12,000 K. Preliminary experiments with an anode consisting of molten copper showed that the arc root was no longer fixed, but moved around continuously. The arc was otherwise quite stable, and its operating characteristics differed little from those reported for solid anodes, in spite of the greater extent of metal vaporization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p123.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn829</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plasma arc melting.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558f16k"><dcterms:title>Effects of dissimilarity in initial interviews : an experimental evaluation of cross-cultural training</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Christensen, Carole C.

A review of the literature indicates that counsellor effectiveness and level of anxiety may be affected when a client is perceived as culturally dissimilar. Research documenting the success of cross-cultural training as a method of increasing counsellor effectiveness during live client interviews is meager. Thirty-one white graduate students in counselling participated in this research. Counsellor trainees were randomly assigned to treatment/no-treatment conditions. Following the 11-hour treatment program, all 31 counsellors conducted videotaped interviews with one black and one white female coached client. Trained judges who maintained an interrater agreement of .87 rated excerpts of the counsellors' performance on the empathy and attending behaviour variables; a self-report measure of anxiety was employed. The overall results of the multivariate analysis of variance indicated no significant difference between treatment and control groups when the three dependent variables were considered as a set. However, the univariate analysis was significant for levels of anxiety during interviews with the black client (p = .01114); counsellors in the treatment group experienced lower levels of anxiety than those in the control group. Modest gains in empathy resulted from crosscultural training. A significant correlation was found between empathy and attending behaviour (p = .0001). Implications for the cross-cultural training of counsellors are discussed. The mixed findings of this study indicate the need for further research in this area.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171z05p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f16k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cross-cultural studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Interviewing -- Study and teaching.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Counseling -- Study and teaching.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intercultural communication.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc10x"><dcterms:title>Crystal growth and photoconductivity of tellurium and selenium-tellurium alloys</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shih, Ishiang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of the growth of monocrystals of tellurium and selenium-tellurium alloys by the Czochralski method has been made, together with measurements of the photoconductivity in such materials. In tellurium, it was found that large temperature gradients occur within a growing ingot which cause an increase in the concentration of lattice defects. This concentration can be reduced by subsequent annealing. An etch pit orientation effect was observed enabling the growth direction of an ingot to be determined, arising from a correspondence between preferential growth and etching planes. Photoconductivity in tellurium at 77 K was found to be decreased by abrasive polishing of the samples and increased by annealing. Transient photoconductivity was found to be characterized approximately by two time constants, one of the order of microseconds and the other tens of microseconds. The largest D* detectivity measured on the samples was 1.3 x 10('11) cm Hz(' 1/2)w('-1) at 3.5 (mu)m. Crystals of Se(,x)Te(,1-x) were prepared by the Czochralski method for Te-rich and Se-rich compositions with 0.1 &gt; x &gt; 0.95. For intermediate compositions with 0.1 &lt; x &lt; 0.95 it was not possible to obtain Czochralski-ingots due to a meniscus rupture problem arising from excess selenium at the growing interface. In this case crystallographically aligned samples were obtained by a slow cooling method. Measurements on the Se(,x)Te(,1-x) alloys showed a continuous wavelength displacement of the photoconductivity maximum from 3.7 to about 0.8 (mu)m in going from tellurium to selenium. This was accompanied by an increase of some 5 orders of magnitude in the photoresponse, in the photoconductive decay time constants and in the electrical resistivity. From the results the estimated energy gaps were found to change continuously from tellurium to selenium with a possible change of slope starting near 40 at.% Se.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc65x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc10x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Photoconductivity -- Measurement.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tellurium alloys.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Selenium-tellurium alloys.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913q79q"><dcterms:title>Genetic analysis of protein content and other agronomic characters in early maturing soybeans.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Safo-Kantanka, Osei.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nine soybean crosses were tested in the F(,2) and F(,3) with their parents to study the inheritance of plant height, maturity, yield, seed size, oil and protein per cent. In three of the crosses involving determinate and indeterminate lines, plant height showed Mendelian segregation in the F(,2) and some F(,3) lines were uniformly short and determinate. This was considered to be due to the dwarfing effect of the determinate gene dt(,1), when it interacts with the earliness gene e(,1). The dwarfing resulted from both a reduction in the number of nodes and the shortening of the internodes. The means and variances were analysed using the methods of Mather (1949), Mather and Jinks (1971) and Aksel and Johnson (1964). The results confirmed reports that additive variance is the most important variance component in soybeans but also showed that non-additive variances are important. Negative variances and large standard errors obtained in certain cases confirmed reports that the selfing series is relatively inefficient for estimating variance components in crosses between two homozygous parents. Broad and narrow sense heritabilities showed a trend of plant height &gt; yield = oil &gt; protein. Four methods used in cross prediction showed that F(,2) phenotypic statistics used jointly with genetic analysis of the F(,2) could be reliably used in cross prediction. Phenotypic, genetic and error correlations showed that in some crosses, selection for high yield and high oil or protein content could be possible. Three interspecific crosses included in the study revealed that the common wild species parent had dominant genes for yield and seed size. In the F(,3), segregants with about 40% protein were found in two of the interspecific crosses involving low protein parents and those with about 45% protein in the cross with a high protein parent.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mg330.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913q79q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soybean</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h279s"><dcterms:title>Theoretical and experimental studies of the flow of cohesionless granular materials</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sayed, Mohammed.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of the constitutive equations of the flow of cohesionless granular materials at large rates of deformation and low stress levels is presented. The interstitial fluid effects are assumed negligible and the particles approximately incompressible. Dimensional arguments and experimental observations suggest that two different regimes of flow may occur. At low rates of deformation, the Coulomb friction gives rise to stresses that are rate independent (of the plastic type). At large rates of deformation, momentum transfer arises from particles collisions and the resulting stresses become rate dependent (of the viscous type). A continuum model that includes both types of behaviour is proposed. The equilibrium part of the stress tensor satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion and a non-coaxial flow rule. The viscous part is assumed to have a form corresponding to an isotropic Reiner-Rivlin fluid. Experiments of simple shear flow flow in an annular shear cell were performed on several types of dry granular materials. The purpose of the tests was to obtain the information needed for the continuum description of the material behaviour. At lower solids concentrations and high shear rates where the inter-particle collisions are dominant, both shear and normal stresses were proportional to the square of the shear rate. At higher concentrations and lower shear rates, Coulomb friction between particles became increasingly important and the stresses were proportional to the shear rate raised to a power less than two. All tests showed a strong dependence upon solids concentration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gd859.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h279s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Granular materials -- Fluid dynamics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bulk solids flow.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816n37j"><dcterms:title>Stochastic fatigue crack growth : an experimental study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mbanugo, Chinwendu Chukwueloka Ike.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis experimentally investigates the statistics (mean and variance) of the fatigue-cycle-dependent evolutions of both the crack tip front penetration's distribution function and the microscopic growth rate's distribution function, as a fatigue crack propagates to final fracture. A novel technique which facilitates striation counting and striation spacing measurements, is developed and used for extracting and analyzing the relevant statistical data for characterizing the stochastic fatigue crack propagation in polycrystalline metals. Two types of pure copper materials are investigated. The investigation confirms the existence of the mean and variance of both the crack front penetration and its growth rate. Details of the variations of the mean crack penetration with respect to the dispersion of the crack front distribution and the mean growth rate, respectively, are established. Other contributions include the evaluation of the material characteristic associated with the transition intensity of the growth process. These results are correlated with the predictions of the "Provan-Ghonem" theory in order to ascertain the validity of the linear Markov birth stochastic process, as a viable description of the fatigue crack propagation process in polycrystalline metals. The trend of the experimental results suggest a spatially correlated Markov process which accounts for both the strong nearest-neighbour-interactions between "points" along the crack front, and the boundary effects as a more viable representation of the fatigue crack propagation process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr11n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n37j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stochastic processes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metals -- Fatigue.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fp82f"><dcterms:title>Studies on the prostaglandin system in brain with emphasis on the precursor-product relationship</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marion, Jean.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The arachidonic acid released post-mortem from the complex lipids of rat forebrain labelled with {('3)H(,8)}-arachidonic acid had a specific activity close to that of the total phospholipids and much lower than that of the neutral lipids.

Serial sections of the callusing anthers revealed the pollen origin of these calluses. Genotypic differences in anther response in oats were confirmed. Aborted multicellular structures were observed in the pollen sacs of 12 cultivars/strains. Further improvement of the medium is necessary to ensure the continual development of initiated pollen grains to plantlet formation. Cultivar differences in the frequency of non-stained (NS) grains were observed. Cold pre-treatment did not increase the frequency of NS or abnormal bi-nucleate grains. The possible effect of cold pre-treatment is to delay anther deterioration, which ensures the survival of more grains to switch into embryogenesis. For ovary and panicle culture, no callus formation was obtained. The potential of the latter approach is discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv44r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq512</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Oats -- Genetics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45q982x"><dcterms:title>Physiological and chemical mediators of an antinociceptive mechanism activated by heterosegmental synaptic input in the spinal cord of the rat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pitcher, Graham Michael</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines a reflex mechanism involved in mediating the inhibition of nociceptive input at a heterosegmental spinal level. This heterosegmental inhibitory mechanism is activated by noxious stimulation of a peripheral body region and is regulated by afferent fibers, local spinal neuronal circuitry and supraspinal structures. A conditioning stimulus, consisting of immersion of one paw of the lightly anesthetized rat in water at a noxious temperature for 90 s elicited an inhibition of a spinal nociceptive reflex in response to a noxious thermal test stimulus in the tail flick test. The magnitude of this antinociception varied with the intensity of the noxious conditioning stimulus, as immersion in water at 40$ sp circ$C, an innocuous temperature, did not evoke an increase in tail flick latency. The antinociceptive response to noxious conditioning stimuli persisted for 3 to 6 min. The response was observed with noxious thermal stimulation of either the hindpaw or the forepaw. Adult animals treated neonatally with capsaicin, which inhibits development of small diameter unmyelinated afferent fibers, did not show this response, suggesting that unmyelinated afferent fibers mediated the input of the conditioning stimulus. Furthermore, in rats transected at the thoracic level, the antinociception following noxious stimulation of the forepaw was blocked while that following hindpaw stimulation was attenuated, indicating that the conditioning stimulus activated heterosegmental inhibitory mechanisms controlled in part by supraspinal structures and in part by spinal structures. Systemic preadministration of substance P (NK-1) receptor antagonists blocked the antinociceptive effect. These results support an earlier hypothesis that substance P is involved in the transmission of nociceptive information in the spinal cord.

Specifically, it is not known what happens to patients' functional status during an infection or whether functional status predicts patient outcome. In this report we examine the relationship between functional status and mortality. We also examine how functional status (measured by the Karnofsky, Barthel, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scales) of patients with bloodstream infections changes from preinfection (baseline level) to infection, and from infection to postinfection. When prospectively studying 104 adult patients with bacteremia, demographic, host, clinical and treatment characteristics were compared between several subgroups: patients with nosocomial and community-acquired infections; with gram-negative, gram-positive, and polymicrobic infections; with different severities of underlying disease; and patients who did and did not survive. Patient demographic, host, clinical, and treatment characteristics of the subgroups examined were similar to those of bacteremic patients reported in the literature. Functional status decreased from its preinfection level, reached its lowest point at the time of infection, and within 3 weeks returned to baseline level. When patients acquired their bloodstream infection nosocomially, however, their scores did not return to baseline level. Overall, patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections had lower mean functional status scores, at each time point measured, than did the patients with community-acquired infections. Twenty-three patients died. Poorer preinfection and intrainfection functional status were associated with higher mortality. Functional status measures change significantly during the course of bloodstream infection and low scores are associated with fatal outcome.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Flegel, Ken (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch376.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t269</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zv247"><dcterms:title>Macroinvertebrate community responses to acidification : isolating the effects of pH from other water chemistry variables</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lonergan, Sean P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of lake acidification was evaluated, in the field, in terms of its impact on both the structural and functional composition of the macrozoobenthic community. The littoral macrozoobenthic community and water chemistry of 45 Canadian Shield lakes was sampled. The water chemistry variables sampled included pH, total dissolved calcium, conductivity, and dissolved organic acid (measured as colour). Partial canonical correlation analysis and partial regression analysis were used to identify those components of the macrozoobenthic community that most directly reflected pH variability. This was done by first removing from the data that portion of the variability attributable to total dissolved calcium, conductivity, and dissolved organic acids. In addition, the spatial structure in the data was removed by identifying the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites. In general, the results presented here are not consistent with previous studies where the response of the macrozoobenthic community was related to pH without consideration of confounding covariables. Snails, leeches, mayflies and crayfish have all been cited for their sensitivity to acidification. The present study found these taxa to reflect, not pH variability, but rather attributes of water hardness. Similar results were found for both total zoobenthic biomass and functional feeding group abundance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rasmussen, J. B.

First, the accuracy, the speed and the ease of use of PETSIM were improved by using tabulated values of the Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption partial interaction attenuation coefficients for all common biological, collimator and detector materials. These were generated from chemical formula, or physical composition, and density of the absorbing medium. Furthermore, simulations of PET systems waste considerable time generating events which will never be detected. For events in which the original photons are usually directed towards the detectors, the efficiency of the simulations was improved by giving the photons additional chances of being detected. For simulation programs which cascade the simulation process into source, collimation, and detection phases such as PETSIM, the additional detections resulted in an improvement in the simulation precision without requiring larger files of events from the source/phantom phase of the simulation. This also reduced the simulation time since fewer positron annihilations were needed to achieve a given statistical precision. This was shown to be a useful improvement over conventional Monte Carlo simulations of PET systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, C. J.

The most immediate goal was to acquire theoretic and methodological tools allowing to progress in the study of the meanings of pregnancy from the point of view of adolescent girls and in the analysis of the underlying semantic network. In particular, the research specifically explores and compares the meanings and the social representations of teenage pregnancy in low-income sectors, in the family and among peers. It also examines how these meanings and representations circulate in a non pregnant teenage group from the same social sector. Family meanings associated with pregnancy have been studied through the pregnant and non pregnant teenage perceptions. Social meanings have been studied from the interpretation that the social group of reference--peers group--gives to pregnancy, according to the perception of the interviewed girls. The sample is comprised of 17 teenagers: 7 pregnant teenagers, 6 non pregnant teenagers and 4 teenage mothers in low income, french speaking sectors. The methodology is qualitative and based on exploratory instruments. Interviews are semistructured. The variables describing the meanings and social support figure prominently in the present study.

Patch clamp, short-circuit current, and electronic cell sizing techniques were used to investigate the role of the outward rectifier in transepithelial chloride secretion and cell volume regulation, the two main functions that have been proposed for this channel in epithelia. Patch clamp studies of the human cell lines PANC-1 and T$ sb{84}$ showed that the chloride channel blockers IAA-94 and NPPB decrease the open probability of the outward rectifier, with half-maximal inhibition at 15 $ mu$M and 23 $ mu$M, respectively. At these concentrations the blockers did not affect cAMP-induced short-circuit current. They did inhibit the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) which occurs after hypotonic cell swelling, but only at much higher concentrations. Moreover, the commonly-used inhibitor DIDS, which blocks the outward rectifier in the 10-20 $ mu$M range, had no effect on the RVD when tested at 100 $ mu$M. The results indicate that the outwardly rectifying Cl channel does not mediate a significant fraction of transepithelial Cl secretion across T$ sb{84}$ cells. Although the data do not exclude a role for the outward rectifier in cell volume regulation, the selectivity and pharmacological properties of the swelling-induced anion conductance in T$ sb{84}$ cells is more similar to the ClC-2 channel than to the outward rectifier.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hanrahan, J.

A cathode assembly suitable for transferring the electric arc to a molten metal bath or to a cooled anode was designed and constructed to produce the plasma in open air. It included provision for the injection of secondary gas into the arc column. The measured electrical characteristics indicated that the sustained voltage depended strongly on the arc length and much less on current. The inlet gas velocity past the cathode tip was determined to be an important operating parameter, rather than the volumetric gas flowrate. The measurement of the axial and radial profiles of temperature was effected with (+OR-) 8% accuracy by a novel diagnostic technique based on the determination of the variations in the outputs of a two-wavelength pyrometer that views a small section of the plasma, as the latter is swept rapidly by a blocking element. Temperatures up to 18,500 K were observed on the axis of the plasma column. A sweeping microprobe was used to measure the axial and radial profiles of velocity. Velocities up to 190 m/s were recorded. The presence of a relatively colder flow surrounding the plasma column was detected. Mass and energy balances performed by taking this flow into account agreed with the measured input rates.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c1387.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x337</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plasma arc melting.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s1617127"><dcterms:title>Proteoglycans of the human intervertebral disc</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liu, Jane J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The composition and heterogeneity of human intervertebral disc proteoglycans from different aged individuals were investigated.

Country rocks, in the vicinity, are Pre-Grenvillian syenites belonging to the Central Gneiss Belt of the Grenville Province. The complex has a reniform shape, and consists of a central portion of carbonatitic rocks enclosed in an alkaline syenite. The carbonatite comprises concentric lenses which evolved from calcitite through dolomitite, to a brecciated core of ferrocarbonatite which hosts REE mineralization, mainly as REE flurocarbonates and monazite. This mineralization forms part of the breccia cement, and is associated with hematite, chlorite, ferroan dolomite, minor thorite, ilmenorutile and pyrite. Apatite-phlogopite geothermometer yielded magmatic temperatures between 1150 and 800$ sp circ$C for the complex, and for the REE Zone, the temperatures range between 380 and 346$ sp circ$C, and are interpreted to reflect subsolidus conditions. An independent chlorite geothermometer yielded similar temperatures (364 to 321$ sp circ$C) for the REE Zone breccia cement. A model is proposed in which REE concentration in the magma was initially buffered by the crystallization of pyrochlore and apatite, and was subsequently allowed to build up when these phases stopped crystallizing in the most evolved ferrocarbonatite. Saturation of this magma with water, late in its crystallization history, led to the separation of an acidic aqueous phase into which the REE were partitioned as fluorocomplexes. Fluid overpressure produced hydrobrecciation which led to adiabatic expansion of the fluid and rapid cooling. The precipitation of REE minerals was caused by a combination of the drop in temperature and an increase in pH due to the interaction of the fluid with the dolomite.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams-Jones, A.

Replacive dolomitization postdates submarine cementation and deposition of overlying shales, overlaps stylolitization, and produces $ delta sp{18}$O values indicating precipitation between 45 and 75$ sp circ$C. Therefore, this dolomitization likely originated at burial depths of more than 500 m. Strontium isotope ratios suggest that dolomitizing fluids were slightly more radiogenic than Upper Devonian sea water. Dolomite cements, however, are slightly depleted in oxygen-18, and contain primary fluid inclusions with high homogenization temperatures and salinities reflecting the different fluids responsible for their formation. The distribution of pore types is governed by depositional facies, whereas effective porosity and permeability are strongly controlled by post-depositional processes. Late-stage cementation (anhydrite, dolomite, calcite, and native sulphur) reduces porosity. This cementation decreases northward, resulting in better reservoirs north of the Medicine River field, above present depths of 3000 m. Replacement dolomitization modified original pore type distribution, improved permeability, and helped retain porosity because dolomites are more resistant to pressure solution than limestones. Burial dissolution of dolomites may have been induced by mixing corrosion, maturation of organic matter, and thermochemical sulphate reduction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mountjoy, E. W.

Smith's views as a historian of religion, as an Islamicist and as the pioneer of a new approach to the study of other men's faith are of great significance. This thesis studies his work on Islam in the light of the development of his ideas with regard to the concept of religion and the approaches to studying it. The evolution of Smith's understanding of Islam is classified here into three phases. During the first phase, Smith's approach was socialistic; he was essentially concerned with the social role of religion, in this case Islam, in modern society. In the second phase of his work as an Islamicist, it was the concern to acquire a more adequate knowledge of Islam and to create a sympathetic understanding of the Muslim culture and religion. The third phase was marked by the publication of his seminal work, The Meaning and End of Religion (1962). His work on Islam in this phase is in the nature of explorations into his own theories regarding the study of religion in general. During this phase, Smith devoted much attention to such concepts as "religion", "faith", and "cumulative tradition", as well as to a new approach in the comparative history of religion. This indicates that Smith in this phase was not only a specialist of Islam, but a historian of religion and a comparative religionist.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mc819.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r187b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Smith, Wilfred Cantwell, 1916- -- Contributions in study and teaching of Islam</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Study and teaching -- North America</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
