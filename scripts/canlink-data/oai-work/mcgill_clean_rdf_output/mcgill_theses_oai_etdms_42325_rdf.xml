I begin by investigating the historical factors surrounding early water policies and consider their influence on water development in the 20th century. Next I critically examine the policy reforms from 1996-2006 and consider both how early policy decisions influence contemporary plans and the claims offered in support of current management decisions. I then look to the future of water policy in southern Alberta and the planned implementation of adaptive management systems. I analyze adaptive management theory in the policy context of Alberta and find the normative claims of adaptive management insufficient. I then suggest a more robust normative framework to supplement adaptive management theory.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sv198.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z934n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>South Saskatchewan River Watershed (Alta. and Sask.)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water-supply -- Government policy -- South Saskatchewan River Watershed (Alta. and Sask.).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water-supply -- South Saskatchewan River Watershed (Alta. and Sask.) -- Management.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water resources development -- South Saskatchewan River Watershed (Alta. and Sask.).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68km34h"><dcterms:title>Muslim political mobilization in the United States : 2001-2004</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sarebanha, Mahgol.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Muslim-American community faced a crucial moment after the events of September 11th to define themselves both at home in the United States and abroad.

Since the Enlightenment, Mark's Western audience has often found them to difficult to interpret, especially in the case of possession itself. The author of Mark assumed that his audience would understand the idea of possession, an assumption that does not necessarily hold true for modern audiences. This study aims to provide some idea of what possession means in Mark. It proceeds with exegesis of Mark's possession pericopes and situates them within the context of ancient beliefs about demons and possession. Critical consideration of modern cross-disciplinary research related to possession is important in this task. So too is the history of modern interpretation and exegesis of Mark, which has offered insights as well as misapprehensions. The weight of evidence supports the conclusion that part of the spiritual importance of possession for Mark is its disorienting, frightening, and ultimately incomprehensible nature.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dx686.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225g32p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Demoniac possession.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exorcism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92gc443"><dcterms:title>&amp;quot;Incorrigible enemies of Soviet power&amp;quot; : Polish citizens in the Soviet Union, 1939-1942, in the light of Soviet documents and Polish witness' testimonies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Janicki, Maciek.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Between February 1940 and June 1941, in four major deportations Soviet authorities moved Polish citizens to work-colonies in the Soviet interior and detained others in various prisons and camps. Based on war-time information, works on the deportations published in the West during the decades of communist rule in Eastern Europe and since reported figures of over 1.5 million deportees, of whom as many as half reportedly died in the USSR. These works held a prevailing view that Soviet intentions towards the deported Poles were genocidal. Recent work with Soviet archival materials has led Polish and Russian historians to revise the number of deportees to 320,000. This substantial reduction has received a mitigated response in the work of Western commentators. A review of published archival materials and of accounts left by witnesses demonstrates that both sets of sources are indispensable to an analysis of the deportations. It also shows that Soviet policies directed against the deportees were not genocidal in their intent and adds a dimension, that of the perpetrators, to the limited conceptualization afforded to the subject thus far. The study shows that under the control of the NKVD the deportations were economic and political components of internal Soviet policy in 1939-1942 and suggests that the Soviet infrastructure was incapable of supplying the resources necessary to fulfill plans set by Moscow. Moreover, the Soviet documentation offers a glimpse into the perpetrators' planning and execution of massive population displacement, thus taking the deportations outside of the realm of conjecture and placing them more firmly within the grasp of historical understanding.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655m62z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92gc443</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Polish people -- Soviet Union -- History -- 20th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Deportation -- Soviet Union -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60d1871"><dcterms:title>Brothers in arms : Congress, the Reagan administration and Contra aid, 1981-1986</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Holm, Michael, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>From 1981 to 1986, the Reagan administration viewed Nicaragua's Marxist regime as a threat to regional and U.S. national security. The administration's support of the Contra rebels, who were actively fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's government, embroiled the U.S. in a "limited" regional war. While conventional scholarship has characterized this conflict as "Reagan's War", Congress played a significant role in keeping the Contra army active and intact. Caught between Reagan's strident anti-Communist ideology and the fear of a Marxist state in Central America, Congress attempted to establish a middle-of-the-road policy, first cautiously funding the Contras through covert operations and non-lethal aid, finally approving full military support in 1986. Despite opportunities to end U.S. involvement, Congress failed to curb both military escalation and Reagan's ideological ambitions. Ultimately, responsibility for U.S. involvement in the Contra war does not lie solely with the White House; this burden must also be shared by Congress.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dx69g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d1871</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>United States -- Foreign relations -- Nicaragua.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nicaragua -- Foreign relations -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>United States -- Politics and government -- 1981-1989.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v6816"><dcterms:title>Taking strategic interactions seriously : a rationalist approach to power transition theory</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Henripin, Olivier.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study addresses the mechanisms and consequences of shifts and transitions at the apex of the international hierarchy of power. It begins with the assessment that in spite of recent advances, progress in this area has been limited by lack of theoretical consistency and rigor. To remedy this problem, a game-theoretic model is developed which conceives of power shifts as transitions in preferences and learning processes. The model is then tested against the case of the pre-World War I British-German power shift. Findings provide new insight into the dynamics of prewar European diplomacy, and suggest that the war fundamentally resulted from a German challenge to the British-led international order. As regards the current Sino-American power shift, this study suggests that relations between China and the U.S. are headed towards a Cold War-like pattern, the severity of which could be alleviated by a successful U.S. policy of engagement towards Beijing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720j058.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v6816</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>War, Causes of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>International relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Balance of power.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans064994w"><dcterms:title>To have authority over a body : 1 Corinthians 7:3-4 and the conjugal debt</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gilbert, Lisa Kristin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Commentaries on the medieval notion of the "conjugal debt" have often emphasized its reciprocal nature, but its inequality becomes apparent when re-embedded into its theological, medical, and legal contexts.

Finally, by demonstrating ways in which consent and coercion blurred together in twelfth-century legal debates, I will ask how meaningful it is to grant spouses equal rights to sex when their marriage may have been coerced.

The data comes from the 2001 Canadian Census of Agriculture, which makes this study the first that is national in scope and includes detailed analysis of the differences between organic and conventional agriculture using a large sample size. Farms were divided into three groups: conventional, primarily organic, and mixed production (some organic production). Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to analyze farm and operator characteristics. Logistic regression was used to determine which variables explain whether a farm is organic, conventional or mixed. Results indicate that organic farmers are more likely to be younger, female, work less off farm and more on farm, when compared to conventional. Organic farms tend to be smaller, more profitable, more diversified, and have a higher dependency on hired labour. There were no differences in capital intensity. Mixed farms manifested the same patterns as organic when compared to conventional.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dx707.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h387x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organic farming -- Social aspects -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Social aspects -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Farmers -- Canada -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organic farming -- Economic aspects -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602506t"><dcterms:title>A portable profiling system for determining horizontal and vertical carbon dioxide advection /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lizotte, Pierre-Luc.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to better quantify the continuous net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at the farm scale, a 24 m high transportable tower-based eddy covariance and profiling system was tested during three field campaigns during the summer and autumn of 2006.

A tethered blimp-based measurement system for the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) budget technique was deployed on several calm nights to compare with the concentrations and fluxes determined with the profiling system. The profiling system was also installed to determine horizontal and vertical advection. The two-dimensional horizontal positioning of the profile inlets allowed an examination of the CO2 advective gradient in relation to the wind direction.

Nevertheless, the relatively limited available research has suggested that maze frequency increases with linguistic complexity and that mazes are produced more frequently by children with specific language impairment (SLI) than normal language (NL) peers. This study examined the hypothesis that greater maze production by children with SLI results from their processing limitations. Language samples of school-age children with SLI (n = 9) and NL (n = 11) were collected in contexts varying in task demands: conversation, narration and expository discourse. Both groups produced significantly more mazes in the more demanding contexts than in conversation. However, no significant group effect was noted for age-matched or MLU-matched groups. These results suggest that mazes should not be viewed primarily as an indication of processing limitations or a clinical marker for SLI, but more appropriately as a byproduct of linguistic complexity across groups.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67ws00w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246x212</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Language Development Disorders.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language Disorders.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010v183"><dcterms:title>Gender differences in socioeconomic inequalities in health : trends in Canada, 1994-2003</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Luchenski, Serena.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gender and socioeconomic inequalities in health are ubiquitous in developed countries; however, the modifying effect of gender on the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and health over time is less clear.

Three main questions are addressed: (1) are there gender differences in health over time, (2) do changes in SEP lead to health inequalities and (3) do changes in SEP impact health differently for women and men? Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to analyze the Canadian National Population Health Survey for four measures of health, number of chronic conditions, self-rated health, functional health, and psychological distress, and three measures of SEP, income, education and employment status.

Its spatial distribution is the consequence of multiple interactions with the surrounding soil medium. In particular, the presence of pathogens in soil may influence the development of the plant, especially the below-ground part, in both its physiology and its structure. Studies of diseased plant roots may take different approaches and investigate disease effects at different levels. In this study, two groups of four potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants were grown in middle-sized plastic pots in a greenhouse, and their root systems, together with the soil medium (i.e., sieved and autoclaved homogeneous sand), were submitted to computed tomography (CT) scanning every two weeks until 10 weeks after planting. For the "diseased" group, sand was inoculated with Streptomyces scabies EF-35, the causal agent of potato common scab, at the time of planting. Disease effects on tissue density of roots and below-ground organs, space occupancy and complexity were assessed by analyzing the CT scanning data in the spatio-temporal approach. Fluctuations of tissue density over time were different, on average, between the two groups. They were characterized by an increase of density in Week 2 for the diseased group, reflecting a hardening of tissue, and a delayed decrease relative to the "healthy" group, suggesting a slower transfer of energy from the seed potato to growing roots. Space occupancy, which was studied via volumetric growth rates evaluated from CT scan data, and complexity, which was quantified by the fractal dimension estimated from skeletonized 3-D images constructed from CT scan data, also showed differences in the first part of the experiment. Original analytical procedures based on data transformation and curve fitting in histogram analysis of CT numbers were developed to obtain those results. In conclusion, the new approach presented here, which is based on the advanced processing of CT scanning data collected over time on developing plant root systems and below-ground organs, can be recommended for future phytopathological applications.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc86s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mv16j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tomography.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Streptomyces scabies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potato scab.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potatoes -- Roots -- Diseases and pests.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784q630"><dcterms:title>Ontario feedlot operators' willingness to accept carbon credit revenue for adopting management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hristeva, Polina.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Canadian agricultural sector was recognised as a potential seller of carbon offset credits in the domestic emission trading system. A number of beneficial management practices may reduce GHG emissions while increasing production efficiency and profitability of agricultural activities. A contingent valuation survey was used to estimate the carbon offset price at which feedlot operators in Ontario would adopt two management practices that reduce GHG emissions: adding roasted soybean seeds to a cattle diet and increasing the intensity of feedlot operations. The value elicitation questions to estimate the mean WTA compensation were designed using a multiple bounded discrete choice format developed by Welsh and Poe (1998). It was estimated that at a carbon offset price of $ 25.14/t CO2 e provided enough incentive for feedlot operators to intensify their operations and a price of $ 109.51/t CO2e to change their feeding strategies. The mean willingness to accept a cost to change a conventional practice to a greenhouse gas emissions reducing practice was estimated to be 62% of the carbon revenue. The regression analysis demonstrated that producers' willingness to accept compensation was influenced by the individual's characteristics, farm structure variables, and practice attributes. Policy makers may use these results in the design of greenhouse gas reduction strategies for the beef sector.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451n83k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q630</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Greenhouse gas mitigation -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soybean as feed -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emissions trading -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feedlots -- Economic aspects -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon offsetting -- Ontario.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bg90g"><dcterms:title>Design, synthesis, and optical characterization of a novel, biocompatible azo-polymer</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haria, Mehul.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of this thesis was to create a novel stable water-soluble azo polymer with photoswitchable properties, which was to be used as a scaffold in directing neuron growth. The new polymer, PDR2, was synthesized and extensively characterized to understand its physical and chemical properties, as well as to ascertain the structure. Characterization techniques included nuclear magnetic resonance, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, absorption spectroscopy, and ellipsometry. The photoresponsive properties of the polymer were then studied by examining quantum yields and birefringence, and the variation of these properties with humidity was examined, after being deposited onto thin films using layer-by-layer self-assembly. Quantum yields were found to increase with humidity up to a maximum determined to be at approximately 30% relative humidity, and were then found to decrease with increasing humidity. This was thought to be due to a combination of factors including plasticization and the formation of water clusters. Birefringence experiments revealed that the thin films did not produce a stable birefringence state. Many factors, including low azo content in the polymer, interaction with polymer side groups, and the mobility of polyelectrolyte multilayers were thought to contribute to these results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2677084n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg90g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Azo compounds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers in medicine.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21tk728"><dcterms:title>Atypical methylmalonic aciduria : frequency of mutations in the methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCEE) gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gradinger, Abigail.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methylmalonic aciduria results from defects in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and from defects in the synthesis of the enzyme's cofactor adenosylcobalamin.

These experiments support the hypothesis that a defective epimerase enzyme can be a cause of elevated methylmalonic acid excretion.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vz111.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tk728</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Racemases and Epimerases.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors -- etiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase -- deficiency.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methylmalonic Acid -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289p20x"><dcterms:title>Depth of calcium uptake by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and its relationships with climatic extremes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beauregard, Frieda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) has experienced diebacks in many parts of its range; these declines have caused researchers to consider the many connected factors governing tree health. Altered availability of base cations due to acidic deposition and climatic extremes (drought, late winter freeze-thaw cycles) have been identified as two main causal stressors. To predict the role of climate on Ca nutrition, I investigated the relationship between the climatic factors of temperature, precipitation, water availability and windstorm on temporal changes to depth of Ca source of sugar maple. I hypothesized that the Ca uptake depth would be deeper after windstorms, or under dry or cold conditions, and shallower under warm or wet conditions. The ratio of Ca/Sr can be used to track the source of Ca. Calibration of the relationship between soil and plant Ca/Sr was done by analyzing Ca/Sr ratios in soil extracts of various strengths (H2O, NH4Cl, and ammonium EDTA) and in seedlings of sugar maple grown from natural regeneration on 37 differing sites. The relationships between soil extract Ca/Sr ratios and leaf and stem Ca/Sr ratios were linear, and the slopes of these relationships were different. These findings support the use of Ca/Sr as a tracer to Ca and they highlight the need to calibrate the technique for the plant tissue and the soil extractant used. This technique was then applied to study Ca uptake depth and its relationship with climate in the Hermine watershed, a sugar maple dominated forest in southern Quebec. The Ca/Sr was measured in soil, incremental cores of wood, and leaves. The ratio of Ca/Sr from nine soil profiles decreased with soil depth (r2 = 0.320, p&lt;0.05), providing a signature for depth. Wood cores from ten trees were analysed in five or ten year increments from 1940 to 1999 to provide a long-term trend of Ca nutrition. Sugar maple leaves from 1995-2005 from the same 25 trees were analyzed to determine the annual dynamics of Ca uptake depth and its relationship with climate. Results suggest that the majority of tree Ca is taken from the lowest part of the rooting zone, regardless of the climatic conditions that occurred during this study, although the minor variations were related to the April temperature (r2 = 0.208, p = 0.023) and the June, July and August combined total precipitation (r2 = 0.581, p = 0.006). The effect of the windstorm on Ca uptake depth was only apparent in the area of the forest most visibly affected; Ca uptake was deeper.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182q465.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289p20x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Québec (Province) -- Nutrition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sugar maple -- Climatic factors -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plants -- Effect of calcium on -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bn633"><dcterms:title>Marrow stromal cells as &amp;quot;universal donor cells&amp;quot; for myocardial regenerative therapy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Atoui, Rony R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Recently rodent and porcine bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) have been reported to be uniquely immune tolerant. In order to confirm these findings in human cells, we tested the hypothesis that human MSCs are also immune tolerant, such that they can be useful as "universal donor cells" for myocardial regenerative therapy. Methods. Immunocompetent female rats underwent left coronary ligations (n=90). They were randomized into 3 groups. In Group I, lac-Z labeled male human MSCs were implanted into the peri-infarcted area. In Group II and III isogenic rat MSCs or culture medium were injected respectively. Echocardiography was carried out to assess cardiac function, and the specimens were examined serially for up to 8 weeks with immunohistochemistry, FISH and PCR to examine MSCs survival and differentiation. Results. Human MSCs were found to survive within the rat myocardium without immunosuppression. This was confirmed by PCR and FISH test. No cellular infiltration characteristic of immune rejection was noted. Some of these cells appeared to express cardiomyocyte-specific markers such as troponin-Ic and connexin-43. Furthermore, the implanted MSCs significantly contributed to the improvement in ventricular function and attenuated LV remodeling. Conclusions. Human MSC survived within this xenogeneic environment, and contributed to the improvement in cardiac function. Our findings support the feasibility of using these cells as "universal donor cells" for xeno- or allo-geneic cell therapy, as they can be tested, prepared and stored well in advance for urgent use. Allogeneic MSCs from healthy donors may be particularly useful for severely ill or elderly patients whose own MSCs could be dysfunctional.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Plusieurs études ont récemment démontré la tolérance immunologiquedes cellules souches stromales (CSS) issues de rongeurs et de porcinés.

The previously established decomposition of the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties into ten well-defined reusable aspects had one limitation: it didn't take into account the concerns of transaction life-time support, resulting in the creation of a cross-cutting concern among the aspects. This thesis removes the cross-cutting concern by integrating the transactional life cycle management issues such as determining the transaction boundaries, maintaining a well-defined state and managing the involvement of the participants. The integration process results in the creation of new aspects that serve as building blocks for various transactional models. The thesis also demonstrates how these base aspects can be configured and composed in different ways to design customized transaction models with different concurrency control and recovery strategies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860c10x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj737</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aspect-oriented programming.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150p32q"><dcterms:title>Les enjeux d'imputabilité de l'État envers la protection de l'intérêt général dans un partenariat public-privé : étude des types d'imputabilité émanant du secteur public et du secteur privé et des interrelations suscitées à l'intérieur d'un partenariat public-privé</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Imbleau-Chagnon, Claudie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At a time of reorganization for certain socio-economic paradigms within the Province of Quebec, the public-private duality is in need of a competitive and sustainable collaboration in order to promote and ameliorate public services, provide more controlled levels of risk and lower initial investment costs in such projects. The concept of a public-private partnership is born from a necessity to adapt the structure of the existing systems to better serve the modern demands of users, to replace old and inefficient infrastructures as well as to abet prohibitive financial considerations of the Province of Quebec. Under which circumstances and to which degrees would the private partner in a public-private partnership, having become the custodian of a project serving primarily private interests, be responsible to absorb the risks transferred by the Province of Quebec to the partnership? How can it be assured that the protection of the public interest and inextricable public values links of the public partner are preserved in a public-private partnership? This thesis is structured into three sections. In the first chapter, we analyze the concept of public private partnerships and the parameters that circumscribe to it. This analysis deals with public services and the public interest. The second chapter defines the concept of accountability while outlining various traits of accountability which may be associated with each member of a public-private partnership as well as with the partnership itself. A more pointed examination then discusses the pitfalls of current systems of accountability within the public-private framework. Finally, we examine the notional values that the current control mechanisms contribute to a public-private partnership. This analysis indicates that a series of new and renewed control and accountability mechanisms is needed to manage the various idiosyncrasies of a public-private partnership while congruently promoting a balance of interest and vision between the partners of a public private partnerships.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698c98g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150p32q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Public-private sector cooperation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public-private sector cooperation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liability (Law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702qb62z"><dcterms:title>Bill C-55 and the UNCITRAL model law on cross-border insolvency : the harmonization of Canadian insolvency legislation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Hugo-Pierre.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bill C-55 proposes amendments to the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act tailored on the procedural framework contemplated by the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency.

Multilateral cooperation may allow nation states to overcome many of globalization's effects. The two prospects for multilateral cooperation are the creation of an international tax organization and a multilateral tax treaty to replace the current bilateral tax treaty network. Whereas there is currently no organization responsible for the surveillance of the international tax system, such an organization is within the realm of possibility. The perfect home for such an organization would be the OECD given its large expertise and history in taxation. However for political reasons it is difficult to foresee such scenario in the near future. A more likely prospect is the creation of a series of multilateral tax treaties for economic regions. This is due to the fact that a multilateral tax treaty, as demonstrated by the Nordic Tax Convention, can be most successful within a group of nations that share close cooperation and highly integrated economies such as members of the EU or NAFTA already tied together through trade agreements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f829.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q65j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Double taxation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Taxation -- International cooperation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Taxation -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fs929"><dcterms:title>Redefining Canadian Aboriginal title : a critique towards an Inter-American doctrine of indigenous right to land</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fuentes, Carlos Iván.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Is it possible to redefine Aboriginal title?

Mild deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme of folate-dependent homocysteine metabolism, is common due to a polymorphism at bp 677, and may influence response to VPA. To examine interactions between VPA and MTHFR in vivo and in vitro, VPA-induced teratogenicity was studied in Mthfr -deficient mice, and the effects of VPA on MTHFR expression in HepG2 cells were investigated. Mthfr+/+ and Mthfr+/- pregnant mice were injected with VPA on gestational day 8.5; resorption rates and occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) were examined on gestational day 14.5. MTHFR expression in HepG2 cells was studied by promoter assays, quantitative RT-PCR and Western analysis. Mthfr+/+ mice had increased resorption rates (36%) after VPA treatment, compared to saline treatment (10%), whereas resorption rates were similar with Mthfr+/- mice with the 2 treatments (25-27%). NTDs were only observed in one group (VPA-treated Mthfr+/+). VPA increased activity of both MTHFR promoters (1.8- and 3.5-fold), and levels of MTHFR mRNA and protein (2.5- and 3.7-fold, respectively) in HepG2 cells. Consistent with MTHFR upregulation in vitro, plasma homocysteine decreased in mice one hour after VPA injection. VPA increases MTHFR expression and may have lower teratogenicity in MTHFR deficiency. These phenomena underscore the importance of folate interconversion in VPA teratogenicity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096c16t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8064300</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sz07j"><dcterms:title>Rotational total skin electron irradiation (RTSEI) with a 6 MeV electron linear accelerator</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Reynard, Eric P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The rotational total skin electron irradiation technique at the McGill University Health Centre has undergone several developments over the past few years.
