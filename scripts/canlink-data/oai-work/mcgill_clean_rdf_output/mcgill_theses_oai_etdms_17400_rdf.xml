Premenopausal women have a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than men and in observational studies hormone replacement therapy (HRT) decreases CVD in postmenopausal women. However, prospective randomized trials of secondary and primary prevention have failed to substantiate an overall protective effect from HRT and have even shown some harm. To explain this paradox it is necessary to better understand the effects of estrogen on the vascular wall. Estrogen rapidly mediates the activation of eNOS and increases the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important factor for endothelial health. In ovariectomized rats estrogen reduces production of superoxide (O2-) by NAD(P)H oxidase. The decreased function is associated with a decrease in the p47phox component of NAD(P)H oxidase and its interaction with the multicomponent enzyme. In these rats estrogen did not alter eNOS expression and bioavailability of NO, which is in contrast to its acute effects. This highlights the difference between chronic and acute studies. The decrease in O2-production suggests the intracellular signaling. Estrogen has antiapoptotic effects. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and the inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha increased apoptosis which is associated with atherosclerosis. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), estrogen decreased the extent of TNFalpha and oxLDL induced apoptosis as indicated by the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and FACS assay. Estrogen also preserves the antiapoptotic mitochondrial Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Estrogen has angiogenic properties that can help a healthy endothelium respond to injury. However, estrogen increases the angiogenesis caused by TNFalpha and this could lead to revascularization in the plaques of women with advanced disease. Overall the balance between the positive and negative aspects of the effects of estrogen on the vascular wall could explain the paradoxical response in older women.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vg12c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m307r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Estradiol -- pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Endothelial Cells -- drug effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Endothelium, Vascular -- drug effects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Estrogens -- pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x753v"><dcterms:title>Electroless deposited palladium membranes and nanowires</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shi, Zhongliang, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Hydrogen is considered to be the fuel of the future as it is clean and abundant. Together with the rapidly developing fuel cell technology, it can sustain an environmentally sound and efficient energy supply system. Developing the technologies of palladium-based membrane for hydrogen separation and palladium nanostructured materials for hydrogen sensing and hydrogenation catalysts makes the "hydrogen economy" possible. This is because these technologies will allow for commercially viable production of comparatively cheap and high-quality hydrogen, and safety of its application. Based on the market requirements and interest in the development of a hydrogen economy, the purposes of this thesis are to develop thin palladium membrane for hydrogen separation and to explore an economic method for the synthesis of palladium nanowires in potential engineering applications. The original contributions of this thesis are outlined below: The investigation of deposition progress of a palladium membrane on porous stainless steel substrate illustrates that palladium deposits will form a network structure on pore areas of the substrate surface in the initial stages. A bridge model is presented to describe the formation of a membrane. This model is confirmed from the cross-section of the deposited membranes. Based on the bridge model and the experimental measurements of palladium membranes deposited on the pore area of the substrates, the thickness of a palladium membrane deposited on 0.2 mum grade porous stainless steel substrate can be effectively controlled around 1.5~2 mum, and the thickness of a palladium membrane deposited on 2 mum grade porous Inconel substrate can be effectively controlled around 7.5~8 mum. Comparing the thickness and quality of palladium membranes deposited on the same substrates with the data in the literature, the thicknesses of the membranes prepared in this program are lower. The obtained result will be beneficial in the design and manufacture of suitable membranes using the electroless deposition process. In the initial deposition stages, palladium nanoparticles cannot be deposited at the surface of the SiO2 inclusions that appear at the substrate surface. With the extension of deposition time, however, palladium nanoparticles gradually cover the SiO2 inclusions layer by layer due to the advance deposited palladium nanoparticles on the steel substrate surrounding them. The effect of the SiO2 inclusions on palladium deposits cannot be neglected when an ultra-thin membrane having the thickness similar to the size of inclusions is to be built. The chemical reaction between phosphorus (or phosphate) and palladium at high temperature can take place. This reaction causes surface damage of the membranes. If palladium membranes are built on the porous substrates that contain phosphorus or phosphate used in the inorganic binders, they cannot be used over 550°C. This result also implies that palladium membranes cannot be employed on the work environment of phosphorus or phosphates. Palladium nanowires are well arranged by nanoparticles at the rough stainless steel surface. The formation procedures consist of 3 stages. In the initial stage, palladium nanoparticles are aligned in ore direction, then the nanowire is assembled continuously using follow-up palladium deposits, and finally the nanowire is built smoothly and homogeneously. It is also found that palladium nanoparticles generated from the autocatalytic reaction are not wetting with the steel substrate and they are not solid and easily deformed due to the interfacial tension when they connect to each other. Various palladium nanowire arrays possessing the morphologies of single wires, parallel and curved wires, intersections and network structures are illustrated. The results demonstrate that palladium nanowires can be built in a self-assembled manner by palladium nanoparticles in the initial deposition stages. Such self-assembled nanowires may attract engineering applications because electroless deposition process and preparation of a substrate are simple and inexpensive. The diameter of palladium nanowires can be effectively controlled by the concentration of PdCl2 in the plating solution and deposition time. The size of palladium nanoparticles generated from the autocatalytic reaction is directly dependent on the concentration of PdCl2 in the plating solution. The higher the concentration of PdCl2 in the plating solution is, the smaller the deposited palladium nanoparticles are. The experimental results provide a controllable method for the fabrication of palladium nanowire arrays with potential engineering applications.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jz08r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x753v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electroless plating.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Palladium.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nanowires.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687m919"><dcterms:title>Transmission and distribution pattern of disease-related genes in early mammalian embryos</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dean-Booth, Nicola.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the transmission of pathogenic mutations during early development is paramount to understanding the inheritance of human disease. The current thesis investigated the transmission to early embryos of the (CTG)n repeat in the human dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene, which is expanded in dystrophia myotonica type 1 (DM1) and of heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). For each of these studies, single in-vitro cultured human or in-vivo generated mouse oocytes and embryos were genotyped for the specific DNA sequences of interest. Initially, genotyping was optimised at the single-cell level using different protocols and methods of product detection. Fluorescent-based PCR analysis of the mutation of interest multiplexed with a linked polymorphic marker was found to provide maximal efficiency and accuracy. Once standardised, these tests were applied to clinical preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and served as the experimental basis for further work presented in this thesis. This included two studies investigating the transmission of the DMPK repeat. In the first study, the objective was to determine whether transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in favour of larger normal-sized alleles ((CTG)19-37) was evident during early human embryogenesis. A statistically significant TRD in favour of DMPK (CTG)19-37 repeats was observed in embryos, which remained significant when female embryos were considered separately. This TRD was shown to be specifically due to the transmission of repeats in the (CTG)19-37 range. The developmental time-point of TRD of these alleles was suggested to occur around the time of fertilisation. In addition, instability in this repeat length was demonstrated during paternal transmission. The second objective was to further elucidate the timing and variability of the intergenerational enlargements observed in expanded DMPK alleles in early development. From our analysis, repeat expansion was found to occur in oogenesis, most likely before the completion of meiosis I. Furthermore, variable degrees of expansion were observed in each cohort of embryos, which are comparable to the phenotypic variability seen between DM1 siblings. In the final chapter, the segregation pattern of murine heteroplasmic mtDNA in oocytes and early embryos was examined in order to determine the feasibility of PGD for mtDNA mutations. This study demonstrated that the mean level of heteroplasmy in the polar body of an oocyte or a single blastomere of an embryo was representative of the level in the embryo as a whole and, therefore, PGD would be a viable option for women heteroplasmic for mtDNA point mutations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm89g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687m919</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xj53m"><dcterms:title>Biochemical characterization of the BVDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>D'Abramo, Claudia M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family, including the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is critical for viral replication. The major goal of this PhD study was to biochemically characterize the role of the polymerase during initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis, utilizing the BVDV RdRp as a model system. We showed that the BVDV polymerase efficiently incorporates chain-terminating nucleoside analogues, which ultimately arrest RNA synthesis. The incorporated chain-terminators, however, can be removed from the primer terminus in the presence of pyrophosphate (PPi). These results suggest that the phosphorolytic excision of incorporated chain-terminators is a possible mechanism that can diminish the efficiency of this class of compounds against viral RdRps. The chain-terminators then served as valuable tools in subsequent experiments to analyze the functional role(s) of the RdRp-associated GTP-specific binding site (G-site) and the consequences of GTP binding during the initiation of RNA synthesis. The results provide biochemical evidence for the existence of a G-site in the BVDV enzyme, and suggest that GTP binding controls template positioning during de novo initiation. Finally, through the development of a novel ribonuclease-based footprinting assay, it was determined that catalytically active complexes contact the newly synthesized RNA during elongation of RNA synthesis with approximately 6-7 base pairs. The polymerase moves along the template according to the position where RNA synthesis is arrested. Taken together, this study provides novel insight into mechanisms involved during initiation and elongation of RNA replication of viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The ability of RdRps to excise incorporated chain-terminators points to possible shortcomings of nucleoside analogue inhibitors that are under development as antiviral agents for the treatment of infection with HCV.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zf755.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xj53m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gh52c"><dcterms:title>Roles of insulin-like growth factor-I and muscarinic receptors in the regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor survival and proliferation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cui, Qiao-Ling, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objectives of this thesis were to investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-mediated oligodendrocyte progenitor survival and proliferation; as well as to assess whether activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) could support the survival of these cells and to characterize the underlying mechanisms. The main signaling pathways studied were the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1)-Akt, the MEK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Src tyrosine kinases. IGF-1 was found to protect oligodendrocyte progenitors from apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in a PI3K-dependent and MEK/ERK-independent manner. In addition, IGF-I activated Akt while inhibiting caspase-3 activation, and these effects were reversed by PI3K inhibition but not by inhibition of MEK1. Interestingly, PP2, a specific Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn and Lyn and activation of Akt stimulated by IGF-I, yet had no significant effects on caspase-3 activation or progenitor survival. Furthermore, while treatment with dominant negative Akt-mutants or a pharmacological inhibitor decreased Akt activity and reduced basal cell survival, IGF-I could partially rescue oligodendrocyte progenitors by decreasing caspase-3 activation. IGF-I promoted oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation through PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and Src tyrosine kinase pathways. Thus, IGF-I stimulated a transient phosphorylation of PDK1 and ERKI/2 and a rapid and sustained activation of Akt. Furthermore, inhibitors of PI3K, MEK1, and Src tyrosine kinases blocked ERK1/2 activation. Similar to IGF-I, activation of mAChR significantly protected oligodendrocyte progenitors from apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal. This action was reversed by inhibitors of PI3K, Akt and Src tyrosine kinases, but not by MEK inhibitors. Furthermore, the acetylcholine analog carbachol blocked caspase-3 cleavage and stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of Fyn, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family. Both Akt and ERK1/2 activation were dependent on the upstream action of the Src tyrosine kinases. In conclusion, we showed that PI3K/Akt promotes both survival and proliferation effects of IGF-I on oligodendrocyte progenitors, whereas MEK/ERK1/2 mediates only the mitogenic effect. Src tyrosine kinases act upstream of Akt and ERK1/2. Akt independent signaling downstream of PI3K is also implicated in IGF-I-stimulated cell survival. mAChRs play a role in the activation of Src tyrosine kinases and PI3K/Akt as well as in oligodendrocyte progenitor survival.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d570122r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gh52c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580r31k"><dcterms:title>The prostaglandin E₂ EP₄ receptor : the elucidation of agonist mediated receptor regulation and a novel therapeutic role for an EP₄ agonist in allergic lung inflammation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Slipetz, Deborah M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prostaglandin (PG) E2 is involved in a number of physiological and path op hysiologicaI events in many tissues. PGE2 mediates its actions through interaction with specific plasma-membrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR's). There are four subtypes of PGE2 receptors: EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, classified by their different pharmacological profiles and signal transduction pathways. EP4 agonists have potential therapeutic benefit in diseases such as osteoporosis (EP4 mediates the bone anabolic actions of PGE 2), but possibly in other areas such as asthma. A characteristic feature of GPCR's is their ability to undergo agonist-induced desensitization and this response may limit the therapeutic utility of agonists due to tachyphylaxis. This thesis outlines [1] the agonist-induced regulation of EP4 by PGE2; [2] the development of a novel selective agonist of EP 4 that also mediates EP4 desensitization; and [3] the discovery of a new role for EP4 in mouse models of allergic lung inflammation by employing this selective agonist. PGE2 challenge of EP 4 in human embryonic kidney cells results in desensitization of intracellular signalling responses (cAMP), phosphorylation independent of protein kinase A and sequestration. These events are mediated by sequences in the carboxyl-terminal tail of EP4. EP4 agonists were discovered by preparing analogues of PGE2 by replacing the hydroxycyclopentanone ring by a lactam. Optimized compound (19a) shows high potency at EP4 and is highly selective over the other seven prostaglandin receptors. In vivo stability was increased further by the addition of a gem di-fluro group on carbon 15 of the molecule. The resulting compound, EP 4_Ags, was employed to selectively elucidate the role of EP4 in mouse models of allergic lung inflammation. The EP4 agonist prevents ovalbumin (OVA)-induced inflammation, airways hyperreactivity (AHR) and T helper (Th) 2 cytokine increases. While interleukin (IL)-13-induced inflammation is not inhibited by the EP4 agonist, AHR is attenuated. These results demonstrate that an EP4 agonist has potent anti-inflammatory activity in a mouse model of allergen-induced lung inflammation. Additionally, EP4 may have effects on AHR independent of its anti-inflammatory activity. Interestingly, the rapid desensitization observed in-vitro did not appear to limit efficacy in-vivo. The role of EP4 in mouse models of allergic lung inflammation is a novel finding and the use of an EP4 agonist may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of asthma.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752m562.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580r31k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w345k"><dcterms:title>Contribution of the Trpv1 gene to the physiology of supraoptic neurons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sharif Naeini, Reza.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The release of vasopressin (VP) from magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei is essential to hydromineral homeostasis. This release is controlled by several physiological stimuli, including changes in the osmotic pressure of the extracellular fluid, and in core body temperature. The osmotic control of VP release is mediated by specific and highly sensitive 'osmoreceptors'. Indeed, VP-releasing neurons in the SON are directly osmosensitive, and this osmosensitivity is mediated by stretch-inhibited cation channels. The molecular identity of these channels, however, remains unknown. The thermal control of VP release, on the other hand, is largely unexplained. In this thesis, we demonstrate that the mouse SON is a valid model for investigating the molecular basis of osmotransduction. We show that hyperosmotically-induced increases in membrane conductance are blocked by ruthenium red (RR), a non selective blocker of TRPV channels. In addition, SON neurons were found to express an N-terminal splice variant of TRPV1, but not full-length TRPV1. Unlike their wild-type counterparts, SON neurons in Trpv1 knockout (Trpv1-/-) mice could not generate RR-sensitive increases in membrane conductance and depolarizing potentials in response to hyperosmotic stimulation. Moreover, Trpv1-/-mice showed a pronounced serum hyperosmolality under basal conditions and severely compromised VP responses to osmotic stimulation in vivo. These results suggest that the Trpv1 gene may encode a central component of the osmoreceptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VP neurons are intrinsically thermosensitive. In these neurons, thermal stimuli spanning core body temperatures activate a RR-sensitive non selective cation current. Interestingly, VP neurons isolated from Trpv1 -/-mice are significantly less thermosensitive. These results suggest that channels encoded by the Trpv1 gene can confer thermosensitivity in the physiological range. Overall, these data suggest that products of the Trpv1 gene in VP neurons may represent a molecular point of convergence for the detection of osmotic and thermal stimuli.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k654.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w345k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qn38m"><dcterms:title>The genetic dissection of the host immune response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection in the wild-derived mouse MOLF/Ei /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sancho Shimizu, Maria Vanessa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Salmonella infections remain a global health concern exacerbated by the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Host genetics have been demonstrated to influence the immune response to Salmonella infections. Adopting the susceptible wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice as a model of systemic Salmonella Typhimurium infection has previously identified a resistance locus Ity2 and a susceptibility locus Ity3. Both the Ity2 and Ity3 loci were validated through the creation of congenic mice and through linkage confirmation in a new segregating cross. Refinement of the critical intervals was achieved using subcongenic mice. Transcriptional profiling of the congenic mice identified differentially regulated candidate genes within the two loci that can be examined for potential relevance to Salmonella infection in MOLF/Ei mice. Previous studies proposed Tlr5 as a candidate for Ity3 based on the sequence variants and reduced expression in MOLF/Ei liver. Tlr5 function was characterized in vitro and in vivo using the Ity3 congenic strains. Both analyses pointed towards the exclusion of this gene as a candidate for Ity3 due to discordant functional responses between MOLF/Ei and the Ity3 congenics. Ncf2 was pursued as a candidate for the Ity3 locus based on its map position and its antimicrobial role in Salmonella infection. Sequencing of Ncf2 led to the identification of one non-conservative amino acid in a conserved domain of the protein. Functional analysis indicated a reduced response attributed to the MOLF/Ei allele, suggesting a potential involvement of Ncf2 in Salmonella pathogenesis of Ity3 congenic mice. Taken together, we have been able to narrow down the critical intervals and confirm the contribution of Ity2 and Ity3 to Salmonella infection. We have eliminated Tlr5 but highlighted the potential involvement of Ncf2 for the Ity3 locus. The genetic dissection of the host response in MOLF/Ei mice has captured the inherent complexity of the immune response towards Salmonella infection. Our findings have also revealed the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice. Furthermore, a complete genome scan of the additional informative cross as well as the validation of candidates identified here, should resolve of the intricacies of the susceptibility of MOLF/Ei mice and contribute to our understanding of Salmonella pathogenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s1619944.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qn38m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z7091372"><dcterms:title>Vessel driven correction of brain-shift</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Reinertsen, Ingerid R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The displacement and deformation of brain tissue is a major source of error in image-guided neurosurgery systems. This thesis presents the design, implementation and validation of an image registration algortithm to detect and correct brain-shift using pre-operative MR images and intraoperative Doppler ultrasound data. The registration algorithm uses segmented vessels from both modalities, and estimates the displacement using a modified version of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The least trimmed squares (LTS) was used to reduce the number of outliers in the point matching procedure. The selected points were first used to estimate a linear transformation between the two data-sets, and then used to drive a thin-plate spline transform to achieve non-linear registration. A deformable brain phantom was designed, constructed and characterized in order to serve as a gold standard in the validation of the registration algorithm. The reproducibility of the elastic deformation of the phantom was evaluated using MR imaging and surface measurements. The experiments showed that the phantom was well suited for MR and ultrasound imaging (B-mode and Doppler) with sub-millimeter reproducibility for the deformations. Validation of the registration technique was then completed in three parts. First, the technique was tested and validated using realistic simulations where the results were compared to the known deformation. The registration technique recovered 75% of the deformation in the region of interest accounting for deformations as large as 20 mm. Second, a phantom study was performed where both MR and ultrasound images of the phantom were obtained for three different deformations. The registration results based on MR data were used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of the ultrasound based registration. On average, deformations of 7.5 mm magnitude were corrected to within 1.6 mm for the ultrasound based registration and 1.07 mm for the MR based registration. Finally, the registration algorithm was validated using five retrospective clinical data-sets. Because the true displacement remained unknown, the method was validated using homologous landmarks identified in the original data, the exclusion of selected vessels, and finally manual segmentation of non-vascular structures in anatomical data. The tracking of homologous landmarks show that the registration algorithm was able to correct the deformation to within 1.24 mm, and the validation using excluded vessels and anatomical structures show an accuracy close to 1 mm. Pre-processing of the data can be completed in 30 seconds per dataset, and registrations can be performed in less than 30 seconds. This makes the technique well suited for intra-operative use.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p184m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z7091372</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wp023"><dcterms:title>Coordination of gaze and posture in young and elderly healthy adults</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Paquette, Caroline.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Little is known about the interaction and channeling of motor and sensory information in the control of balance with aging. The aim of this thesis was to study the mechanisms of equilibrium control and its effects on aging when large head and gaze shifts are executed under varying postural conditions. In a first study, the postural strategies used by young and elderly subjects were compared during standing and walking tasks while subjects executed a large and rapid rotation of the head. Elderly subjects restricted their body motions and velocities, likely to minimize the ensuing perturbation. An important aspect of the head turning tasks is the redirection of gaze, which must be coordinated with postural responses. Thus, in a second study we aimed to determine the mechanisms of large horizontal gaze shifts (saccades) when submitted to a support surface perturbation, in young subjects. The findings from this study revealed a saccadic facilitation mechanism, when the visual target shift stimuli was closely followed by a motion of the supporting surface, providing evidence for the need of a stable reference when all available sensors are perturbed. In a third study, the control of gaze shifts (pursuit and saccades) during surface perturbations (sequence of pseudo-random motions) and with aging was examined. As hypothesized, elderly subjects showed less precision in target tracking. As well, the surface perturbations resulted in increased tracking errors for both groups. However, gaze time lag in response to target was not affected by surface motions. This study provided evidence that gaze accuracy could be attributable for the segmental movement excursion restriction observed in elderly subjects of the first study. Moreover, the saccadic facilitatory mechanism observed in the second study is specific to the surface perturbation condition (discrete vs. sequence) and its timing relative to target shift. Therefore, the trainability of elderly subjects in executing complex tasks, as described in the present thesis, should be explored. Improved abilities in executing large head and gaze shifts under challenging postural conditions would be an important step in reducing the incidence of falls in the elderly and could guide rehabilitation interventions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207ts763.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wp023</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053k88q"><dcterms:title>The molecular characterization of inborn errors of vitamin B₁₂ metabolism : cblA, cblB and cblC</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lerner-Ellis, Jordan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work investigates the molecular basis of three genetic diseases of vitamin B12 metabolism: cblA, cblB and cblC. Two genes responsible for isolated forms of methylmalonic aciduria types cblA and cblB, called MMAA and MMAB respectively, were recently identified. We sequenced the coding sequence and flanking regions of the MMAA and MMAB genes from the gDNA of 37 cblA and 35 cblB patient cell lines and identified 31 novel mutations in total. The biochemical properties of these cell lines were examined in cell culture. Haplotype analysis was used to investigate the history of mutations. The occurrence of both rare and common mutations were identified. Attempts were made to make genotype-phenotype correlations and to understand the effects of mutations on protein function. In the MMAA gene 18 novel mutations were identified, eight of which were common to two or more individuals. One mutation, c.433C&gt;T represented 43% of pathogenic alleles and a common haplotype was identified. Diagnostic tests were designed for every mutation identified. In the MMAB gene, 13 novel mutations were identified. Most mutations were clustered in exon 7. One mutation, c.556C&gt;T accounted for 33% of pathogenic alleles, associated with disease presentation in the first year of life, was observed on a common haplotype and seen almost exclusively in European individuals. We used a combination of linkage, sibling pair, homozygosity mapping and haplotype analyses to refine the disease locus and identify the gene responsible for cblC disease on chromosome 1p called MMACHC. We examined the gDNA of 244 cblC patient cell lines and identified 42 different mutations. The large number of patient samples allowed for the identification of specific genotype phenotype correlations. Of the mutations with elevated frequency in the patients examined, the c.271dupA and c.331C&gt;T mutations were associated with early onset disease whereas c.394C&gt;T was associated with late onset disease. Other missense mutations were also associated with onset of disease later in life. Seven mutations showed clustering by ethnicity. Eight SNPs were identified spanning the gDNA of the MMACHC gene and allowing for the identification of specific haplotypes and the determination of recurrent vs common mutations. Infection of the wild-type MMACHC gene into cblC patient fibroblast cell lines showed correction of the cellular phenotype. Examination of EST databases and northern blot analysis demonstrated MMACHC is ubiquitously expressed in humans with higher levels in fetal liver. Multiple sequence alignment of genomic DNA in eukaryotes and of the polypeptide sequence demonstrated that MMACHC is well conserved in eukaryotes. Two functional domains were identified in the MMACHC gene product by comparison with bacterial genes involved in vitamin B12 related functions: a putative vitamin B 12 binding domain and a TonB-like domain. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the C-terminal region of the gene product folds similarly to TonB from E. coli and suggesting that the C-terminal region of MMACHC may function in a similar manner.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999b348.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053k88q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913t49m"><dcterms:title>Insights into the biological function 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, John, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Oligodendrocytes (OLs) produce myelin sheathes that wrap around axons, a critical component for saltatory conduction in nerve fibers. Myelin-afflicting diseases impair nerve conduction resulting in severe neurological symptoms. The myelin sheath is composed of a specific set of proteins and lipids that are expressed at high levels compared to other cell types. One such protein is 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP). Although the expression pattern is well-characterized, its functional role in myelinating cells is unknown. The work presented in my thesis aims to identify the physiological function of CNP. In vitro, CNP hydrolyzes 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2'-nucleotides, but the relevance in vivo is unknown. Mutational studies identified histidine and threonine residues in the C-terminal catalytic domain that are essential for enzymatic activity. Structural determination of the catalytic domain by NMR revealed striking similarities with RNA/nucleotide-processing enzymes in bacteria and plants, thereby placing CNP in the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily sharing two identical tetrapeptide HX(T/S)X motifs. Structural similarities and the evolutionary conservation of key active-site residues suggest a role for CNP in RNA/nucleotide metabolism. My thesis also examines the role of CNP in modulating the OL cytoskeleton for process outgrowth. Immunoprecipitation experiments and mass spectrometry identified tubulin as a major CNP-interacting candidate. In vitro, CNP binds preferentially to tubulin compared with MTs and induces MT assembly by copolymerizing with tubulin. CNP overexpression induces process outgrowth and dramatic morphology changes in different cell types due to MT and F-actin reorganization. These effects are attributed to CNP MT assembly activity. Formation of branched processes is abolished with the expression of loss-of-function CNP mutants, and cultured OLs from CNP-deficient mice extend smaller outgrowths with less arborized processes. CNP is likely an important component of the cytoskeletal machinery that directs process outgrowth in OLs. Lastly, my thesis examines the function of the larger CNP2 isoform. Although both isoforms are abundantly expressed in myelinating cells, CNP2 is expressed at low levels outside the nervous system. The functional role of CNP2, apart from CNP1, in myelinating cells and the significance for CNP2 expression in non-myelinating tissues are unknown. A mitochondrial targeting signal at the CNP2 N-terminus was identified to direct mitochondrial translocation. CNP2 distribution is regulated by phosphorylation of the targeting signal by PKC. Mitochondrial localization is inhibited upon phosphorylation, thus retaining CNP2 in the cytoplasm, whereas in the non-phosphorylated state, CNP2 is translocated and imported into mitochondria with subsequent cleavage of the targeting signal. The sole presence of CNP2 in its truncated form in embryonic brain and adult liver indicates that CNP2 is localized specifically to mitochondria in pre- or non-myelinating cells. This points to an additional, broader biological role for CNP2 in mitochondria.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515s01f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913t49m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar494vp61p"><dcterms:title>Expression and role of the orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 in mouse embryogenesis and female reproductive function</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Labelle-Dumais, Cassandre.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 is implicated in a multitude of biological processes including cholesterol homeostasis and development. Its role in cholesterol metabolism and cell proliferation is now well established in vitro and in vivo. Both in vitro and gene expression studies have suggested a role for NR5A2 in ovarian function. In this study, we provide in vivo evidence for its involvement in reproductive function by demonstrating that heterozygosity for a null mutation of NR5A2 leads to a reduction in female fertility. Furthermore, we showed that NR5A2+/- females display a severe reduction in ovarian progesterone production and that progesterone supplementation can rescue the NR5A2+/- subfertility phenotype. We also provide evidence that one of the mechanisms by which NR5A2 regulates ovarian progesterone production is through modulating the expression of SCAR, which controls one of the rate-limiting steps of progesterone synthesis. A targeted disruption of the NR5A2 gene in the mouse leads to early lethality in utero between embryonic days 6.0 and 7.5, showing that NR5A2 plays a crucial role during early embryogenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying this early lethality, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we used a morphological and marker gene analysis to characterize the NR5A2-/- embryonic phenotype and showed that although initial axis specification occurs in NR5A2-/- embryos, primitive streak and mesoderm fail to form. Using a chimeric approach, we demonstrated a requirement for NR5A2 function in the visceral endoderm (VE), an extra-embryonic tissue, for proper primitive streak morphogenesis and gastrulation. Our results also indicate a reduction in the expression of VE marker genes involved in the nutritive function of this tissue, suggesting that NR5A2 play a dual role in the VE, being implicated in the mediation of both its patterning and nutritive activity. Taking advantage of the LacZ knock-in approach used to inactivate the NR5A2 gene, we also demonstrated that NR5A2 is expressed during craniofacial and nervous system development, suggesting a novel role for NR5A2 in head formation and neural development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gh53n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp61p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wp03c"><dcterms:title>Cell growth regulation by TGF [beta] family members identification of novel antagonists</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ho, Joanne Wing Yee, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily comprises a large group of structurally and functionally related pluripotent polypeptide growth factors that regulate a variety of cellular processes including; proliferation, lineage determination, differentiation, motility, adhesion and cell death. Although diverse in their final effects, the basic intracellular signaling cascade governing responses initiated by TGFbeta family members is highly conserved throughout evolution, from nematodes to humans. Ligands of the TGFbeta superfamily bind heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors at the cell surface, which phosphorylate the primary intracellular mediator of the signaling cascade, the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). Phosphorylated R-Smads then form heterotrimeric complexes with the common partner Co-Smad, Smad4, and accumulate within the nucleus to associate with various coactivators or co-repressors of transcription, to either activate or repress the transcription of various target genes. The studies in this thesis were conducted to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating and regulating signaling by activin/TGFbeta. In the first study we examined the role of activin in inhibiting cell growth within human heptocarcinoma cells. This study revealed that activin-induced cell growth arrest within hepatocytes is mediated by the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p15 and Sp1. In the second study, we identified the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a novel activin/TGFbeta-inducible antagonist of activin/TGFbeta signal transduction, initially within hepatocytes, and then extended our finding to other normal and cancer cell types. In particular, we defined GRK2 mediated phosphorylation of the R-Smads to inhibit TGFbeta-mediated target gene expression, cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. In a subsequent study we examined, at a molecular level, the mechanism by which GRK2 targeted phosphorylation of the Smad linker region modifies the behavior of the R-Smads, leading to an inhibition of signaling, through the use of a mutant R-Smad to mimic the structural and electrostatic properties of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation. This study defines novel dominant negative forms of the R-Smads that antagonize activin/TGFbeta signaling. Together, our results indicate that GRK2 is a potent negative feed-back regulator of activin/TGFbeta signaling in a variety of cell types and has the capacity to block, in particular, activin/TGFbeta-induced p15 expression, leading to an inhibition of activin/TGFbeta induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the use of GRK2 phospho-mutant R-Smads, with the capacity to inhibit endogenous R-Smad signaling, may provide insights into the development of novel antagonists to the activin/TGFbeta signaling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074z74v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wp03c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515s02q"><dcterms:title>Genetics of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gros-Louis, François.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Diseases affecting motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gerhig's disease), hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease) form a heterogeneous group of chronic progressive diseases and are among the most puzzling yet untreatable illnesses. Over the last decade identification of mutations in genes predisposing to these disorders has provided the means to better understand their pathogenesis. The discovery 13 years ago of SOD1 mutations linked to ALS, which account for less than 2% of all cases, had a major impact in the field. However, despite intensive research effort, the pathways leading to the specific motor neurons degeneration in the presence of SOD1 mutations have not been fully identified. The research projects presented here aim to investigate the role of different cell types and tissues in the pathology of SOD1-linked ALS, and to identify new genetic factors involved in sporadic ALS cases. LoxP transgenic mice expressing mutated G85R SOD1, allowing transgene expression in cell and tissue specific manner, have been successfully generated. However, mice, up to 2.5 years of age, did not develop any motor neuron deficits or any developmental abnormalities. We concluded that this might be due to insufficient level of the transgene expression in our transgenic animals. Also, a number of candidate genes for ALS have been identified, such as ALS2, VEGF, PRPH, CHGA and CHGB, based on their pattern of expression and biological function. These genes have been screened for mutations in a cohort of ALS patients and, we have identified one basepair deletion in the ALS2 and in the PRPH genes, and we have also found a strong genetic association between the CHGA and CHGB genes with ALS. An in-vitro cell transfection approach has been used to investigate the biological effects of mutations within the PRPH genes and, of particular interest, this technique has revealed the first functional variants in a neurofilament associated gene ever describe in ALS.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nm86w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515s02q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60d1251"><dcterms:title>The impact of HIV-infection on thymic activity : unveiling a defect in intrathymic proliferation and its consequences on recent thymic emigrant homeostasis throughout disease and antiretroviral therapy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dion, Marie-Lise.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>HIV infection causes the progressive decline in total CD4 T cells, leading to immunodeficiency, failure of the immune system to control pathogens and ultimately death. This loss has been attributed to a number of factors such as direct viral CD4 T cell cytopathogenicity, increased immune activation resulting in T cell exhaustion, as well as a possibly impaired function of the thymus which would halt the input of new diverse T cells. This last element has, however, been disputed as the existing methods to measure thymic function have important technical and interpretational limitations. In order to circumvent these caveats, we have developed a novel non-invasive assay based on the ratio of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) which are episomal DNA molecules excised during TCR rearrangement: the sj/betaTREC ratio. More specifically, the sj/betaTREC ratio accurately monitors thymic activity by measuring the extent of intrathymic proliferation that occurs between the TCRB and TCRA rearrangements. Using this tool, we have uncovered an important thymic defect that occurs early in HIV infection and persists into the chronic phase. We reveal that this defect is characterized by a severe blockade within a key proliferative phase that occurs during the earlier phases of T cell development which impacts on the quantitative parameters of the sj/betaTREC ratio. We have also shown that, during the first months of infection, the failing thymus is counterbalanced by a peripheral compensatory mechanism maintaining recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) numbers, most likely by increasing their survival rate. As the disease progresses with a persistently weak thymus, this compensatory mechanism is lost, resulting in the loss of RTEs. This contributing to the total CD4 T cell decline observed in therapy-naive HIV-infected patients. Moreover, a functional thymus observed within a subset of patients is associated with the maintenance of CD4 T cells, further illustrating the role of the thymus in the outcome of HIV disease. Under successful antiretroviral therapy, the re-establishment of high levels of intrathymic proliferation is intimately linked to the rate of CD4 T cell immune reconstitution illustrating the important contribution of the thymus to an effective CD4 T cell repopulation. The elucidation of these HIV-induced perturbations within RTE homeostasis prompted us to seek out a specific phenotype that would permit subsequent functional analysis and comparison of these cells to other naive T cells. We found that high expression of CD31 on a subset of naive CD4 T cells identifies RTEs and discriminates these cells as a seemingly functionally distinct naive T cell population, with different cytokine (i.e. IL-2R) and chemokine (i.e. CXCR4) receptors expression patterns. In addition, chronic HIV infected patients have low counts of RTEs that are partially restored under highly active retroviral therapy, supporting our previous findings. Overall, this thesis exposes for the first time, using novel tools, the existence and the nature of a persistent thymic defect in HIV infection and the important repercussions on RTE homeostasis, both playing key roles in the HIV-induced CD4 T cell loss. The work also demonstrates that the administration of antiretroviral therapy partly reverses this impaired thymic activity which, once reestablished, contributes significantly to an effective immune restoration. Importantly, the findings presented in this thesis stress the need as well as provide the tools for the development of novel strategies aimed at enhancing thymic activity that will ultimately provide more efficient therapeutic means for treating immuno-compromised individuals.

The premise of this thesis is that motor neurons have an impaired ability to trigger these protective mechanisms, which may contribute to their preferential vulnerability in the neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The first objective was to study the involvement of metallochaperones in motor neuronal stress response, including their potential for rescuing motor neurons from toxicity conferred by a mutant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1G93A ) that causes a form of familial ALS. Motor neurons in dissociated spinal cord cultures failed to induce the metallochaperone, metallothionein (MT), in response to classical MT inducers, although overexpression of MT in motor neurons failed to protect them from SOD1G93A. A second response system, involving protein chaperones called heat shock proteins (Hsp), was more therapeutically promising, but was also impaired in motor neurons due to an inability to activate the regulatory protein heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). The remaining objectives were to examine if activation of Hsf1 in motor neurons would protect against SOD1G93A and to understand the mechanisms responsible for its impaired activation. A constitutively active form of Hsf1 induced multiple Hsps in motor neurons and nearly eliminated SOD1G93A toxicity and aggregation. Experiments also demonstrated that failure of stressed motor neurons to activate endogenous Hsf1 is not a result of inappropriate or insufficient activity of kinases that phosphorylate key residues of Hsf1 in nonneuronal cell lines with a competent heat shock response. Disruption of inhibitory Hsp90/multichaperone complexes is another important step in Hsf1 activation. Four different pharmacological inhibitors of Hsp90 induced multiple Hsps in motor neurons, although failure to observe the same response by targeting inhibitory complexes with activator of Hsp90 ATPase 1 (Aha1) or Daxx suggested other mechanisms were involved. A constitutively active form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase N induced Hsp70 in motor neurons, but not in fibroblasts and likely through an Hsf1-independent mechanism. These results provide further evidence for disparity between the stress response of motor neurons and other cells and suggest the possibility of a unique Hsp regulatory system in neurons.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dz978.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mb537</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r4780"><dcterms:title>Workability study for adiabatic shear band phenomenon in the steel cold heading process</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sabih, Amar.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The motivation behind this study is the lack of specialized analysis regarding internal failure caused by the adiabatic shear hand (ASB) phenomenon in the cold-headed products. Its aim was to present an integrated workability study to improve and assist cold-heading (CH) multistage design procedures to replace the current design rules of thumb, as they are neither effective nor adequate in fulfilling the needs of the new developments in the rapidly expanding CH industry. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive testing methodology and FE modeling, implemented within ABAQUS/Explicit, were established. This methodology includes an instrumented Drop Weight Compression Test (DWCT) tower equipped with a guided pocket die-set configuration capable of developing internal failure at different stages of ASBs and integrated metallographic inspection techniques. A validated FE model of the DWCT and guided pocket die-set configuration was a valuable tool in establishing the failure criteria and indicating the workability limits. A detailed experimental and FE study for the ASB stages in the CH process was introduced to uncover the affect of different parameters controlling the failure mechanisms within the ASBs in the CH process. This study investigated the effect of the thermal, geometric and the material flow softening and hardening mechanisms affecting ASB evolution. Moreover, a detailed metallurgical and FE study of the internal ductile and Transformed Adiabatic Shear Band (TASB) failures caused by the ASB phenomenon in DWCT was conducted. Three ductile failure criteria were introduced to predict the initiation and location of the internal ductile failure in the ASBs. One TASB failure criteria was introduced to predict the phase transformation to undesirable brittle martensite. These failure criteria were employed to establish integrated workability methodologies to indicate the objective workability limits. Applying these workability methodologies on multistage CH FE models showed that these methodologies are an efficient tool to predict the damage levels and failure initiation locations within the cold-headed bolts. Moreover, these methodologies were successful in optimizing the die designs in order to reduce damage levels.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w346v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r4780</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drawing (Metal-work)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel -- Cold working.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dies (Metal-working)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shear (Mechanics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bolts and nuts.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v222g"><dcterms:title>Identification of bacteria by infrared imaging with the use of focal plane array Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Prévost Kirkwood, Jonah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The application of infrared imaging employing focal plane array Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) instrumentation for the identification of bacteria was investigated. FPA-FTIR spectroscopy was shown to provide new opportunities for bacteria identification with unprecedented reliability and throughput by allowing 102--103 FTIR spectra to be acquired simultaneously from surface areas of 90 x 90 to 200 x 200 mum with a spatial resolution of ~6 mum. The combination of data redundancy and spatial resolution afforded by infrared imaging made it possible to acquire highly reproducible spectra from bacterial films. A protocol for enhancing the reliability of bacteria identification by transmission-mode FPA-FTIR spectroscopy was developed by optimizing spectral acquisition parameters, spectral processing and data analysis; using the differentiation of two Campylobacter species as a test case. The results for this test case were compared with those obtained from three alternate FTIR spectral acquisition modes. The optimized protocol was employed for the generation of a spectral database of foodborne bacteria, containing over 1,000,000 spectra acquired by infrared imaging of 36 species from 19 genera. The development of a modular hierarchical clustering (MHC) model, in combination with the use of a region selection algorithm, allowed all species in the database to be differentiated from each other down to the species level based on differences in their infrared absorption profiles. A validation study involving the identification of well-characterized isolates by comparison of their spectra to those in the database demonstrated the robustness of the MHC model. In a further study employing 44 strains of Clostridium botulinum, the discriminatory power of FPA-FTIR spectroscopy was compared with that of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the region selection algorithm was applied to identify growth medium-independent spectral regions that allowed for the differentiation of Group I and Group II C. botulinum strains in two blind validation studies. The research carried out also demonstrated the high-throughput potential of bacteria identification by infrared imaging when combined with the use of a microarray system for sample deposition.

In parasitoids, there is a paradigm to the effect that males are polyandrous, inseminate as many females as possible and express no optimization in their behaviours. In reality, sperm production incurs non-trivial costs. Because sperm are transferred in ejaculates and that their cost is greater than that of individual sperm, males can gain by carefully allocating their ejaculates. In this thesis I have investigated different aspects of males' reproductive strategies, mainly sperm and time allocation, in the egg parasitoid Trichogramma turkestanica Meyer (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). In T. turkestanica, mating mainly occur on the emergence patch. However, results show that mating opportunities are not distributed equally among males and 2.9% of successful males are sperm-depleted when they disperse from the emergence patch. Nevertheless, 97.1% of males disperse non sperm-depleted, suggesting off-patch mating potential. Male T. turkestanica have thus an insemination capacity higher than necessary to inseminate the females present on the emergence patch, a pattern that seems to be common among parasitic wasps. On the emergence patch, both virgin and mated females can be encountered. Males are able to discriminate between those mates and prefer virgin ones. This preference is stronger for energy- and time-limited males. Sperm competition risks and/or intensity are important for males that decrease their sperm investment when the number of rivals increases. Such response is optimal when the benefits from investing more sperm become lower than the costs of a low paternity assurance under intense sperm competition. Finally, male T. turkestanica express behaviours enabling them to optimize their patch time exploitation. Depending on their evaluation of the patch quality, males modify their patch residence time. This thesis shows that time- and sperm-limited male T. turkestanica are not simply maximizing the number of females inseminated, but rather maximize their lifetime fitness by optimizing sperm and patch time allocation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tc891.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g35w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Trichogramma -- Reproduction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m3081"><dcterms:title>Relations among blood pressure, pain sensitivity and sweet taste hypoalgesia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lewkowski, Maxim D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pain sensitivity is typically reduced in individuals with higher blood pressure although the nature of this relationship is poorly understood. Relatedly, the ingestion of sweet tasting solutions has been shown to reduce pain, possibly by an opioid mediated mechanism. The objective of the present research was to investigate the effects of blood pressure and sweet taste on pain sensitivity in healthy adults. The first aim was to test whether blood pressure interacts with sweet taste to affect pain sensitivity. The second aim was to test whether endogenous opioids mediate the effects of sweet taste and blood pressure on pain. In Study One, participants held sweet, bitter and plain water solutions in their mouths during exposure to a painful cold pressor test. Replicating previous research, individuals with higher blood pressure were found to have generally higher pain tolerance than those with lower blood pressure. Sweet taste was associated with an increase in pain tolerance but only in individuals with lower range blood pressure, increasing their tolerance to the level of those with higher blood pressure. In Study Two, participants held sweet solution, plain water or nothing in their mouths during cold pressors on two days. To test the involvement of endogenous opioids, participants were administered an opioid antagonist on one of the test days. Participants with higher resting blood pressure again showed increased tolerance and reduced unpleasantness ratings of the pain tasks, as well as dampened mood reactivity to the testing. In these individuals, the opioid antagonist reduced their pain tolerance and partially reversed their lower mood reactivity. As in Study One, sweet taste increased pain tolerance in participants with lower but not higher blood pressure, but this was unaffected by opioid blockade. Taken together these results suggest some overlap between non-opioid mechanisms of sweet taste and blood pressure related analgesia. These results are also consistent with work suggesting that endogenous opioid activity may play a role in the reduced pain sensitivity, and perhaps mood reactivity, of individuals with higher blood pressure and that multiple processes are involved in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301508s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m3081</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Blood pressure.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sweetness (Taste)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pain -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cp52t"><dcterms:title>Identification of functional genomic targets of ER [alpha] and ERR [alpha]</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laganière, Josée.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The biological activity of estrogens is mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors. ERs modulate gene transcription through binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) within regulatory regions of their target genes followed by recruitment of coregulator complexes that modify the chromatin structure and allow general transcription factors to activate transcription. The estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) alpha, beta, and gamma are orphan receptors that share sequence similarity with the ERs but are not activated by natural estrogens. ERalpha is a major player in breast cancer initiation and progression while ERRalpha is suspected as an important regulator of energy metabolism. Very few direct target genes of ERalpha and ERRalpha have been described to date. The goal of the present work was to use functional genomic tools in order to uncover which cellular pathways the receptors regulate. We utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based approaches since they allow the study of direct protein-DNA interactions occurring in vivo in a given cellular context. We first developed and used a ChIP-cloning technique to identify ERalpha cis-regulatory sequences. This approach indeed allowed the detailed characterization of one region in particular, which was revealed to be essential for estrogen regulation of the retinoic acid receptor alpha 1 (RARalpha1) gene. In addition, promoter arrays were used following ChIP (a technique called ChIP-on-chip or location analysis) to identified the pathways directly controlled by ERalpha. These genome-wide studies revealed novel mechanisms of action for ERalpha, in particular its dependence on another transcription factor, FOXA1, for its recruitment on a subset of targets. We next used a human genetic screen that led to the discovery of a polymorphic autoregulatory element located within the ERRalpha promoter. In promoter binding profiling, ERRalpha was shown to control sets of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis. Our studies suggest that ERalpha and ERRalpha control distinct genetic pathways despite their high structural and functional similarities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dz98j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cp52t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hg80w"><dcterms:title>The behavioral and neural correlates of bimodal selective and divided attention to incongruent audiovisual events /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Johnson, Jennifer Adrienne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Humans live in a world rich in multisensory information. Often information reaching one sense is completely unrelated to information reaching another sense; that is, they are spatially and temporally incongruent. The goal of the research presented in this thesis was to elucidate the behavioral and neural bases of attention to incongruent audiovisual information. Five issues were addressed: (1) developing an appropriate behavioral paradigm to test bimodal attention, (2) understanding the role of crossmodal suppression in unimodal attention, (3) exploring the interaction of auditory and visual sensory cortex during bimodal selective attention, (4) exploring the role of fronto-parietal networks in bimodal selective attention, and (5) exploring the neural correlates of bimodal divided attention. Two different behavioral paradigms demonstrated that attended information was remembered better than unattended information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed that crossmodal suppression of sensory cortex subserving a non-presented modality occurred consistently during unimodal attention tasks, and increased with attentional demand. During bimodal selective attention, activity was often enhanced in sensory cortex subserving an attended modality and suppressed in sensory cortex subserving an unattended modality, both compared to a bimodal passive baseline. This interaction depended in part on attentional demand and the nature of the stimulus information. No prefrontal regions were consistently activated by bimodal selective attention; however, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was recruited during one of the bimodal divided attention paradigms. Furthermore, temporary inactivation of the DLPFC using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) led to decreased bimodal divided attention performance using the same paradigm. However, using a different bimodal divided attention paradigm, DLPFC was not recruited and instead ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) showed task-induced deactivation. This divergence is explained by the unique requirements of the two bimodal divided attention paradigms. Overall, these findings provide improved understanding of how humans process and attend to multisensory information, and raise several questions for further investigation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nm875.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg80w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Attention -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Attention.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b9609"><dcterms:title>Investigation into the role of redox reactions in Maillard model systems : generation of aroma, colour and other non-volatiles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haffenden, Luke John William.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of redox reactions in the formation of aroma volatiles, colour and other non-volatiles in the Maillard Reaction was investigated. The electrochemical properties of individual reactants and Maillard model mixtures were monitored via ORP (oxidation-reduction potential) and oxygen electrodes. All models exhibited unique electrochemical activities represented by their corresponding ORP profiles. Investigation into the redox potentials of several model systems demonstrated that the increased negative value of a redox potential is not necessarily correlated with its browning potential. An optimal redox potential range, where browning is favoured, was found to represent a balance between carbonyl and hydroxyl moieties in the structure. Adjustment of this redox potential by introducing reducing or oxidizing species can shift this balance resulting in modifications in browning capacities. However, it was concluded that there is a clear relationship between browning ability and reducing capacity of the model systems. Furthermore, a novel oxidative pyrolysis technique was developed to study the role of oxidative environment on the product distribution during pyrolysis and to investigate the mechanism of formation of non-volatiles through 13C and 15N-label incorporation. Application of this technique to glucoselglycine model system have indicated that most non-volatile Maillard reaction products can arise from glucose oxidation intermediates such as glucosone, gluconic acid and deoxyglucosones. To study the specific role of redox reactions in the formation of non-volatiles, a post-pyrolytic derivatization technique was developed and optimized. Several non-volatile end products were identified and mechanistically confirmed to involve oxidation and reduction reactions for their formation, such as lactones, hydroxylated benzenes and hydroxylated pyrazine. The latter was identified and confirmed to be generated via the dimerization of glycine and subsequent oxidation. In addition, the formation of different volatiles such as pyrazole, imidazole and oxazole was mechanistically confirmed to depend on redox reactions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pr50n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b9609</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Maillard reaction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxidation-reduction reaction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z884n"><dcterms:title>Perception of the birth experience and its relationship to early postpartum parenting</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bryanton, Janet-A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between women's perceptions of their childbirth experiences and their early postpartum parenting behaviours and to determine the factors that predict the birth experience. Methods. Of all women giving birth on Prince Edward Island between October 27, 2004 and December 31, 2005, 652 women and their newborns were recruited from the postpartum units of two general hospitals. Initial data were collected at 12 to 48 hours postpartum using three self-report questionnaires and chart review. Women's childbirth perceptions were then scored, and a sub-sample of these mother-infant pairs (n=175) was assigned to cohorts based on positive (n=95) or negative (n=80) birth perceptions. They were visited at home at 1 month postpartum, where data were collected with three questionnaires using self-report, observation, and biophysical measurements. Results. Based on the results of linear and logistic regression, women's perceptions of their childbirth experience were not predictive of five parenting behaviours/indicators at 1 month postpartum: feeding score (representing attachment and responsiveness), exclusive breastfeeding, protection from harm, and maternal perception of infant health and contentment (representing infant health). Of the 20 predictors of women's childbirth perceptions, the strongest were: type of birth; degree of awareness, relaxation, and control; helpfulness of partner support; and being together with the infant following birth. Conclusion. Most women, even those who had negative experiences, were parenting effectively at 1 month postpartum. Of the predictors of a quality birth experience, most were amenable to nursing interventions. Thus there are important implications for nurses to enhance patient awareness, relaxation, and control; promote partner support; and provide immediate opportunities for women to be with their babies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dx066.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z884n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
