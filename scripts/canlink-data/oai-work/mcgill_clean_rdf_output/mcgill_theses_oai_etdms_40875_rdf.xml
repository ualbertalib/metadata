To accomplish this, two methods of analysis have been linked: the model of microeconomic equilibrium with the historical-structural perspective. A perceived opportunity for economic improvement can be identified as the primary cause provoked by development differentials on a regional scale. Quebec's economic history--distinguished by the dual development of industry and agriculture, as well as relative overpopulation, sustained by a religious ideology pertaining to ruralism and favouring an increasing birthrate--reveals delays which accelerate the incidence of out-migration. By contrast, rapid industrialization of Ontario, exploitation of natural resources, settlement by immigration and colonization of the North were inducement factors for the Quebec workers of peripheral regions. The transposition of humble origin, occupation and socio-economic status from place of origin to destination restricts occupational attainment. After migration, intergenerational mobility is limited and social mobility is weak. The beaten migration path between Quebec and Hearst consolidates the family and social networks, conferring on Hearst a French character which in turn further favours Quebec immigration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv42f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h434</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Emigration and immigration -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ontario -- Emigration and immigration -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadians -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tv89q"><dcterms:title>The monetary approach to the balance of payments : an analysis of the balance of payments of the major Arab oil exporting countries</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haifa, Said J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to apply the monetary approach to the determination of international reserve flows to major Arab oil-exporting countries. These are Iraq, Kuwait, Libya and Saudi Arabia. Well-defined and stable demand for and supply of money functions must exist for the monetary approach to have predictive power for reserve flows. This study found that the demand for real balances in the designated countries was a stable function of real income and the rate of inflation. In examining the money supply process, the main determinants of the monetary base and hence the money supply proved to be net foreign assets and government expenditures. This thesis extends the empirical analysis of international reserve flows by providing empirical tests of a two-area model for the small country case. Our empirical results supported the main propositions of the monetary approach to the balance of payments about the effect of the demand for and the supply of money on reserve flows. The growth in domestic price, domestic income and world money supply exerted a positive impact on the reserve flows, while the growth in world income, interest rates, money multiplier and domestic assets had negative impact. The results also supported the validity of the assumption concerning unified world goods markets.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397909k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv89q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Money supply -- Arab countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Balance of payments -- Arab countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monetary policy -- Arab countries.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gh18r"><dcterms:title>Modern languages as emerging curricular subjects in England, 1864-1918</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bayley, Susan Nancy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the curricular development of modern languages in the schools of England between 1864 and 1918. At the beginning of the period, modern languages were fringe curricular subjects; by the end of the period, they had achieved full curricular status in the secondary schools. The vehicles for investigating the curricular development of modern languages are the reports of the Royal Commissions and Board of Education. This thesis shows that modern languages became an integral part of the liberal curriculum and hence were taught chiefly in the secondary schools as instruments of cultural and mental formation for the upper and middle classes. Their definition as secondary school subjects was due largely to their promotion as liberal subjects by the Royal Commisions and Board of Education. The elitist views expressed in these reports were highly influential in determining the curricular status of modern languages, and the aims, methods, and content of their teaching.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq544.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh18r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Languages, Modern -- Study and teaching -- England -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- England -- Curricula -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d0559"><dcterms:title>Exchange market efficiency, currency substitution and exchange rate determination : issues, implications and evidence for the Asian currency market</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Eng, Yong Heng</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the empirical validity of the efficient market hypothesis, currency substitution, purchasing power parity theory, interest rate parity theory and the monetary approach to exchange rate for the foreign exchange markets of Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.

At one extreme of the plumage variation, there are a group of sub-adult males that are indistinguishable from the adult males. These birds can only be correctly aged by cloacal examination for the bursa of Fabricius in the autumn. At the other extreme, approximately 4% of the population are near perfect female-mimics. A simple scoring system based on the interspersion of dark feathers in the epaulet is presented, which permits classification of the sub-adult males into 1 of 6 plumage classes. These epaulet classes are significantly correlated with other traits of the plumage. Age when entering the prebasic molt, and the physical condition of the sub-adult male may influence the development of the varied plumage characteristics. The distribution of the plumage characteristics of a population of sub-adult males collected at a major blackbird roost in the province of Quebec is described for birds captured in the fall and spring. The spring plumage characteristics are more variable than the fall, a phenomenon which is not consistent with plumage wear as has been previously reported, but which may be related to a prealternate molt which the birds undergo. The prealternate molt is prevalent in some but not all of the contour feather tracts, and is restricted to females and the sub-adult male cohorts. An age- and sex-specific spring migration of red-winged blackbirds is examined. Adult males arrive to the spring roosts first, followed by yearling males and then females. A similar pattern of dispersal to the breeding territories is described. Within the subadult male cohort, the birds with the most adult-male like plumage traits arrive at the vernal roosts first. The characteristics of the prealternate molt and differential spring migration are discussed in relation to the pressures of sexual selection on the respective age and sex cohorts. The adaptive significance of variable sub-adult male plumages and delayed plumage maturation in passerines is evaluated. Several competing hypotheses have been advanced to describe the phenomenon of delayed plumage maturation. These hypotheses are reviewed, and a test is proposed which unequivocally differentiates between the various alternatives.

Such soil enrichments and pure cultures of the isolated Cytophaga (Is-11) reduced N(,2)O rapidly even in the presence of a normally inhibitory concentration of C(,2)H(,2) (4 kPa), providing S('2-) was present 8.0 umol (g soil)('-1) or 0.4 umol (mL culture)('-1) . The observed reaction appears to be unique to this soil Cytophaga since other organisms tested, using the same or similar experimental conditions, failed to show this response. The isolate was characterized, after extensive comparative studies with five Cytophaga johnsonae strains, as a pigmented, Gram-negative, non-motile, gliding filamentous bacillus. Although these features established a taxonomic link with the family Cytophagaceae, the inability of Is-11 to digest chitin and DNA base composition of about 42.5 mol% (G+C) make the organism's specific affiliation uncertain.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx40h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs85q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bacteria, Denitrifying.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sulfides.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acetylene.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cytophaga.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrous oxide.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v385p"><dcterms:title>The immunopathology of experimental amebiasis in the gerbil (Meriones unquiculatus) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chadee, Khrisendath.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A model for experimental cecal and hepatic amebiasis was developed and characterized in the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). Pathogenic and non-pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica strains were shown to cause damage in the cecum, proportional to their previous behavior in humans. Secretion of intestinal mucus, crypt hyperplasia and cytolysis of interglandular epithelium were prerequisites for amebic invasion. Ulcerative lesions with destruction of mucosal and submucosal tissues led to amebic dissemination to the liver. Formation of amebic liver abscesses followed subacute changes in the liver. Liver lesions resulted from the cytolytic effects of the enzymes of destroyed neutrophils. Growth of liver abscesses followed cytolysis of the fibrogranuloma walls. Immunodepression in amebiasis was confirmed by serologic findings and histologic alterations in the lymph nodes and spleen, and by a lowered antiamebic effect of lymphoid cells in vitro. A neutrophil stimulating and chemotactic factor from pathogenic amebic membranes was isolated and characterized. It was shown that both host and parasite factors are involved in the pathogenesis and pathology of amebiasis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk30w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v385p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Immunopathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerbils -- Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amebiasis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483k05p"><dcterms:title>Pareto optimality and beyond</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Cheuk Ming.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The problem of social choice is the central theme of this study. Our main objective is to prove the existence of a social welfare function in order to put to rest the doctrine of 'natural liberty.' We reject most of the recently suggested solutions to the problem on the basis that they are either incomplete or inconsistent. Our proposed social welfare function is along the utilitarian line. Ratio-scale interpersonal comparisons of cardinal utilities are used to prove its existence. If we are allowed to define utilitarianism more broadly, then our social welfare function will also be unique. Finally, the study argues strongly for more positive action on the part of the government to rectify social injustice.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r1748.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483k05p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Public welfare.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social justice.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public welfare administration.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
