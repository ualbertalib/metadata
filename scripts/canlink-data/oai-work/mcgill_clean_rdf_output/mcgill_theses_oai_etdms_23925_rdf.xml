A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis is performed to identify suitable causticizing metal oxides and process configurations. TiO$ sb2$ is found to be the only metal oxide which can be used for kraft black liquor recovery. Of two possible process configurations, the two-step combustion and reduction process is selected for further experimental study in the present work. The kinetics of the direct causticization reaction between Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ and TiO$ sb2$ in a mixture with Na$ sb2$SO$ sb4$ are studied in a tube furnace from 750 to 925$ sp circ$C. It is found that complete conversion of Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ can easily be achieved when using a TiO$ sb2$/Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ molar ratio of at least 1.25, leading to the formation of 4Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$5TiO$ sb2.$ The formation kinetics of 4Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$5TiO$ sb2$ are well described by a reaction model with product layer control. Insoluble Na$ sb2$ O$ cdot$3TiO$ sb2,$ obtained from hydrolysis of 4Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$5TiO$ sb2,$ can be recycled and reused for CO$ sb2$ release from fresh Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3.$ The influence of TiO$ sb2$ addition on kraft black liquor combustion is investigated using thermoanalytical techniques. The combustion of kraft black liquor is improved despite the large mass fraction of TiO$ sb2.$ The melting point of the combustion product of a mixture of kraft black liquor and TiO$ sb2$ is much higher than that of pure kraft black liquor. Similar to the experiments with the model mixtures, it is also found that complete conversion of Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ during kraft black liquor combustion can easily be achieved when the TiO$ sb2$/Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$, molar ratio is at least 1.25. The presence of TiO$ sb2$ reduces the sulfur loss during combustion. A high causticizing efficiency is obtained with recycled Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$3TiO$ sb2.$ The kinetics of the reduction of sodium sulfate mixed with sodium titanate by both CO and H$ sb2$ are studied in a thermogravimetric system. The H$ sb2$ reduction kinetics are described by the nucleation and growth model up to 60% conversion and by the shrinking core model for higher conversions. The CO reduction kinetics are described by nucleation and growth model up to 95%. Both the H$ sb2$ and CO reduction are accelerated by the initial presence of Na$ sb2$S and are catalyzed by iron oxide. The influence of H$ sb2$ and CO concentrations, H$ sb2$O and CO$ sb2$ concentrations and mass fraction of sodium titanate is also investigated. The combustion product of a mixture of kraft black liquor and TiO$ sb2$ is even faster reduced by H$ sb2$ and CO than the model mixtures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d982z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv17t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gd78w"><dcterms:title>Activity distribution and Michaelis-menten parameters of urease microencapsulated within polyamide membranes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Monshipouri, Mariam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Urease was microencapsulated via interfacial polymerization within polyamide membranes with high yields of protein (83.1%) and specific activity (92.5%) observed. Intracapsular urease concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and represented 6.2 mg/ml of microcapsule volume. The activity distribution analysis of urease microcapsules indicated that 94% of total intracapsular urease was in a soluble form. The balance (6%) was observed to be incorporated into the encapsulating membrane. The specific activities of microcapsule homogenate (131.7 IU/mg) were similar to that of the intact microcapsules (123.2 IU/mg) suggesting minimal mass transfer and diffusional limitations on the overall rate of urea conversion. Urease was co-encapsulated with hemoglobin with high yields of mass (91.5%) and specific activity (84%). The specific activity yield was 10% lover than that observed when pure urease was microencapsulated. Thus, the protective role of hemoglobin against urease interfacial denaturation did not appear to be significant. The pH activity profiles of both free and intracapsular urease were similar with pH optima of 6.0. Thus, effects of charge interactions between ammonia product and the encapsulating nylon membrane were not observed. Similar K$ sb{ rm M}$ values for free (7.6 mM) and intracapsular urease (8.4 mM) suggested that substrate diffusion through the encapsulating membrane did not affect initial rates of catalysis. This was further confirmed by application of the data to a model (Sundaram, 1973) considering the effects of diffusion and mass transfer on the overall reaction rate of intracapsular urease. Under the conditions examined, kinetic rates were slower than the mass transfer rate and thus rate limiting.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b421t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd78w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612p411"><dcterms:title>Cell interactions in abnormal neural tube and neural crest cell development of splotch mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moase, Connie E.

That Rubisco remains pyrenoid-localized at photosynthetically-saturating irradiance in the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa indicates a catalytic, rather than storage function for pyrenoid-localized Rubisco. This is further supported by the immunolocalization of Rubisco activase to the pyrenoids of two species of green algae. The exclusion of phosphoribulokinase from the pyrenoids of a red and a green alga indicates that pyrenoids do not possess the full complement of Calvin cycle enzymes. Thylakoid lamellae traverse the pyrenoids of many algae. The absence of light-harvesting phycoerythrin and of photosystem (PS) II activity, but not PSI activity, from the intrapyrenoid thylakoids of the red alga Porphyridium cruentum indicates a structural and functional heterogeneity between these lamellae and those located in the chloroplast stroma. In contrast, the intrapyrenoid thylakoids of cryptomonads, algae whose chloroplast is thought to have evolved from red algae, possess both PSI and PSII protein complexes. These results are discussed with reference to Rubisco being mainly pyrenoid-localized in these algae.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc577.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j6453</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Porphyridium cruentum.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chloroplasts.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chlorella pyrenoidosa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Algae -- Cytology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qm804"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of human highly repeated satellite II and III DNAs</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sol, Katia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have isolated, cloned, and sequenced, from the genome of human (HeLa) cells, a 1.797 Kb EcoR1 satellite II DNA fragment that displayed partial identity to the Drosophila melanogaster transposable P-element. The sequence analysis of this clone (pKS36) indicated that it has originated from the tandem amplification of pentameric repeats that were derived from satellite II and III canonical consensus sequence 5$ sp prime$ TTCCA 3$ sp prime$. A two-stage decay mechanism, based on the methylation and subsequent deamination of cytosine residues within the pentamers, was proposed to explain the non-random base substitutions that were observed in pKS36, as well as in other sequenced members of the satellite II and III DNA families. In addition, this two-stage decay model correlated with the Tag1 and Hinf1 polymorphisms that were observed between related satellite DNA members. Clone pKS36 also contains a region of 49 bp devoid of satellite sequences that was found, by southern hybridization, to be present in pKS36 closely related (pKS36-like) but absent from more divergent (pKS36-related) cloned satellite II and III DNAs. pKS36-related satellite DNAs represent up to 2% of the genomes of HeLa and MeWo cells, and are organized mostly in tandem arrays of 1.8 Kb EcoR1, Kpn1, and Sau3A DNA fragments. pKS36-like satellite DNAs represent less than 1% of the genome of HeLa cells, and are found mainly organized as 1.65 Kb, 1.95 Kb and 3.6 Kb EcoR1 elements, though their Kpn1 and Sau3A distributions resemble that of pKS36-related satellite DNAs. Cell specific organization of satellite DNAs, that may be the result of chromosomal translocations inherent to cultured cells, was observed in the two human (HeLa and MeWo) cell lines. The analysis, by southern hybridization, of satellite DNAs using field inversion gel electrophoresis revealed the presence, in HeLa cells, of satellite DNA clusters ranging from 150 Kb to 500 Kb in length. Using rodent-human hybrid cell DNAs, the members of the pKS36 satellite II DNA family were found to reside mainly on human chromosomes 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 22.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj02r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm804</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g0987"><dcterms:title>Concentration of black liquor to high solids</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ramamurthy, Pritham</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'evaporation d'eau d'une couche mince (film) de la liqueur noire a ete etudiee en utilisant l'injection par jet; d'air chaud ou de la vapeur.

Of 2500 clones of a genomic library of L. monocytogenes 81-861 generated in Escherichia coli cells, 5 clones were identified in which $ beta$-hemolytic activity was stably expressed. Testing by intraperitoneal injection showed that these clones were lethal to mice. Restriction mapping of the inserts of the recombinant plasmids showed that, apart from a 650-bp internal Hind III fragment in 2 inserts, there were no other common sites. No homology was demonstrated between the DNAs of the inserts when Southern blots of restriction digests of the 5 plasmids were probed, though homology was demonstrated between the L. monocytogenes listeriolysin O gene and the DNA of one insert. The evidence suggests that at least one additional $ beta$-hemolysin, other than listeriolysin O, exists in this strain of L. monocytogenes, and that it may be a virulence factor. Using a direct colony hybridization procedure on hydrophobic grid-membrane filters (HGMFs), the inserts of the recombinant plasmids were screened, and a DNA probe specific for L. monocytogenes was identified. After labelling with horseradish peroxidase and colour development of the chromogen, a commercial counter (HGMF Interpreter) was able to detect and count the organism electronically. When the efficacy of the chromogen-labelled DNA probe method on HGMFs was compared with the conventional method for three artificially-inoculated foods, there were no significant differences ($ alpha$ = 0.05) shown in the recovery of L. monocytogenes from the foods.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf59s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r461</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Listeria monocytogenes -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Listeriosis -- Pathogenesis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w309g"><dcterms:title>Resistance of maize silk to Fusarium graminearum</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Reid, Lana M.

The growth traits (asymptotic weight (A), rate parameter (k), inflection parameter (m), average lifetime absolute growth rate (AGR), average lifetime absolute maturing rate (AMR) and average lifetime relative growth rate (RGR)) were estimated by fitting the nonlinear equation, W$ sb1$ = A(1 $ pm$ be$ sp{ rm -kt}) sp{ rm M}$, to the observed weight-age data of 3076 individual females. Results from the analyses of growth traits indicated that the H line exceeded the A line in addition genetic effects for individual performance (a$ sp{ rm I}$) for both A and AGR. The H line also exceeded the A line in additive effects for maternal performance (a$ sp{ rm M}$) in trait A. Both dominance (d) and additive x additive (aa) epistatic effects were statistically important in most cases. Individual heterosis (h$ sp{ rm I}$ = d$ sp{ rm I}$ $-$ 0.5aa$ sp{ rm I}$) was positive for traits A and AGR, whereas maternal heterosis (h$ sp{ rm M}$ = d$ sp{ rm M}$ $-$ 0.5aa$ sp{ rm M}$) was negative for A and positive for AMR. Total heterosis (TH = h$ sp{ rm I}$ + h$ sp{ rm M}$) had positive effects on AGR and AMR. For all growth traits, heterosis retained in advanced crossbred generations was statistically irrelevant. The overall conclusion was that crossbreeding systems designed to capitalize on TH would produce faster growing and earlier maturing animals. The analyses of production traits found the additive effect of the H line for individual performance to be a major factor to increase yields of milk, protein and fat. On the other hand, line maternal and cytoplasmic source tended to favour the A line, but none reached statistical significance in any of the traits. Results indicate that two-line specific crosses or synthetic development would be sound breeding strategies for taking advantage of first cross heterosis or of line additive differences, respectively. Estimates of crossbreeding parameters from mixed-model analyses, were found to be more reliable than those from ordinary least squares analyses.

Reduction in the average energy because of using the region ${ cal C}$ as the boundary instead of a hypercube is called the shape gain of ${ cal C}$. The price to be paid for shaping is: (i) an increase in the factor CER$ sb{s}$ (Constellation-Expansion-Ratio), (ii) an increase in the factor PAR (Peak-to-Average-power-Ratio), and (iii) an increase in the addressing complexity. In this thesis, the structure of the region which optimizes the tradeoff between the shape gain and the CER$ sb{s}$ and also between the shape gain and the PAR in a finite dimensional space is found. Analytical expressions are derived for the optimum tradeoff. The optimum shaping region can be mapped to a hypercube truncated within a simplex. This mapping has properties which facilitate the addressing of the signal points. We introduce several addressing schemes with low complexity and good performance. The concept of the unsymmetrical shaping is discussed. This is the selection of the boundary of a constellation which has different values of power along different dimensions. The rate of the constellation is maximized subject to some constraints on its power spectrum. This spectral shaping also involves the selection of an appropriate basis (modulating waveform) for the space. Finally, we discuss the selection a signal constellation of signaling over a partial-response channel. In the continuous approximation, we introduce a method to select the nonempty dimensions. This method is based on minimizing the degradation caused by the channel memory. In the discrete case, shaping and coding depend on each other. In this case, a combined shaping and coding method is used. This concerns the joint selection of the shaping and coding to minimize the probability of the symbol error.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mw01j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903080m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp48w"><dcterms:title>Liquid chromatographic separation of enantiomers and structurally-related compounds on b-cyclodextrin stationary phases</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Song, 1957-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The retention behaviour of 16 phenothiazines and structurally-related drugs on a $ beta$-cyclodextrin-bonded phase column was studied with respect to pH, mobile phase composition and column temperature.

A novel tellurium reagent, bis(triphenylstannyl)telluride, for organic synthesis was developed. Its application in the preparation of organotellurium compounds, reduction of vic-dihalides and $ alpha$-halo ketones, desulfurization of organic trisulfides and cleavage of organic disulfides was studied. All the reactions with this reagent proceeded under very mild conditions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd16p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw64g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t004k"><dcterms:title>Responding to intergroup discrimination : an analysis of tokenism</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wright, Stephen C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis describes a program of research aimed at delineating an important concept in the social psychology of intergroup relations: tokenism. A series of experiments first established that disadvantaged group members faced with open access to an advantaged group (meritocracy) choose either inaction or attempts at individual upward mobility. Conversely, those faced with an advantaged group that is closed (complete discrimination) engage primarily in collective nonnormative action. However, when faced with severe, but not total, discriminatory restrictions (tokenism), disadvantaged group members consistently prefer individual nonnormative action. This preference is unaffected by increases in ingroup identification, increased prior ingroup interaction, and removal of direct self-interest. Some support was found for the role of situational ambiguity in maintaining the preference for individual action in conditions of tokenism. In two final experiments the behavioral responses of "successful tokens" were investigated. These experiments show that successful tokens shift their allegiance from the disadvantaged group to the advantaged group and choose action in support of this new high-status ingroup at the expense of the disadvantaged group.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t005v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t004k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Group identity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discrimination.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gd795"><dcterms:title>British intelligence and guerrilla warfare operations in the Second World War : Greece 1941-1944, a case study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gerolymatos, André</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the thesis is to analyze the relationship between British guerrilla warfare and espionage operations as well as their impact upon the Greek resistance.

It was found that the transport of macromolecules, including low density lipoproteins, from flowing blood to a semi-permeable vessel wall is greatly enhanced in regions of disturbed flow with a local maximum locating around the reattachment (stagnation) point. The surface concentration of macromolecules increases with increasing the filtration velocity and decreasing the flow rate. The disturbed flows also facilitated the transport of low molecular weight substances such as biochemicals but not macromolecules from arterial walls to flowing blood. These results strongly suggest that disturbed flows with slow recirculation flow provide favorable conditions for the genesis and development of atherosclerotic lesions by affecting local mass transport phenomena at the blood-vessel wall boundary.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr96n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161699w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr171z009"><dcterms:title>Lattices and theta functions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gannon, Terry</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The gluing and tensor product constructions of lattices are reviewed.

The mechanisms of copper activity linked to neovascular and neoplastic growth are largely unknown. Copper ion was shown to be a cofactor for angiogenesis. We tested the effect of copper depletion achieved by a low copper diet and a copper chelator D-penicillamine, on the intracerebral growth of two experimental brain tumors. We developed in in vivo brain tumor model using the VX2 carcinoma. Implantation of 5 $ times$ 10$ sp5$ VX2 carcinoma cells into the parietal lobe of normocupremic rabbits consistently yielded large hemorrhagic, necrotic, vascularized tumors. The cortical surface revealed numerous, hypertrophied, tortuous new vessels with feeding arteries and draining veins similar to the angioarchitecture of malignant human brain tumors. We report here that copper depletion prevents tumor neovascularization and restricts tumor growth of the VX2 carcinoma in the rabbit brain. Low copper diet and penicillamine are both necessary to achieve angiogenic inhibition. We also tested the effect of copper depletion on the 9L gliosarcoma. We observed that invasive growth of the tumor was blocked in rats depleted of copper. Electron microscopy revealed the absence of cytoplasmic extensions, including pseudopodia, by contrast, in normocupremic controls, cytoplasmic extensions, typical of mobile cells, invaded the surrounding neuropil. Our findings link the activity of copper in vascular and neoplastic growth. We found an increase in the peritumoral brain water content in the copper depleted animals and that copper depletion by itself in nontumor implanted animal has no effect on brain water content. Because of the ability to pharmacologically suppress capillary growth induced by the VX2 carcinoma, we could test the relative contribution of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier compared with that of angiogenesis in the appearance of contrast enhancement in computed tomographic examinations. We conclude from our data that tumor neovascularization, in our brain tumor model, is the key determinant for the appearance of contrast enhancement. The same protocol used in the brain failed to prevent tumor neovascularization and growth of the VX2 carcinoma in the muscle of the rabbit thigh indicating the crucial role played by the milieu (muscle versus brain) for the growth of malignant tumor. In the same manner, lung metastases were not prevented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nh868.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r178c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brain Neoplasms.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Angiogenesis Inducing Agents.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Copper -- deficiency.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w312s"><dcterms:title>Benzimidazole (BZ) resistance in Haemonchus controtus : specific interactions of BZs with tubulin</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lubega, George W.

Our first attempt at obtaining such strains was made by using an in vitro approach in which a lymphoid cell line, chronically infected with HIV-1, was exposed to various drug concentrations. Although this system has never generated such mutants, we found that the progeny virus population, present in the culture fluids of these chronically infected drug-treated cells lost infectivity. These results suggest a potential post-integrational role for zidovudine, possibly acting at the level of viral assembly or budding. However, we were successful in isolating zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 strains from the blood of patients undergoing AZT treatment. Our work shows that a minimum of 27 weeks of treatment is necessary for the appearance of the resistant phenotype and that the majority (75%) of patients treated with AZT for more than one year will generate such resistant strains. No correlation between the clinical status of the patients and the occurrence of resistant variants can be drawn from our work. However, in vitro experiments have shown that the resistant isolates are more cytopathic, although less infectious, than the sensitive strains. Reverse transcriptase enzymes from both AZT-resistant and -sensitive strains were virtually identical when their respective enzymatic activities or their affinity for the substrate or the inhibitor were compared. Finally, some zidovudine-resistant isolates demonstrate cross-resistance to other nucleoside analogs with potential clinical applications.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z866f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333309j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>HIV-1.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zidovudine.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak35695320"><dcterms:title>Transcriptional regulation of rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lagacé, Monique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The promoter region of the rat gene encoding the enzyme carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS) has been cloned and characterized.

An explanatory scheme (or general theory) was developed to organize strategies for overcoming institutional barriers using an efficiency--substitution--redesign framework. Efficiency strategies involve minor changes to existing activities, resulting in more efficient resource use. Substitution strategies involve replacing one product, technique or activity with another. Redesign strategies require solutions and institutional activities that mimic ecological processes.

The Eu$ sp{3+}$ ions were found to exhibit spectra which could be categorized into three types of emitting centres. These emitting centres are related to the crystallographic sites available for Eu$ sp{3+}$ in $ beta sp{ prime prime}$-alumina, namely the mid-Oxygen and Beevers-Ross sites. The fluorescent lifetimes were measured and were found to be consistent with the site assignments, particularly in the variations possible in the Eu$ sp{3+}$ coordination in mid-Oxygen sites. Analysis of the emission intensities reveals that the calculated site populations are in agreement with previously published X-ray results. Crystal-field analysis of the spectra indicates that the different types of centres are subject to different crystal-field strengths and that effects such as J-mixing play an important role in the observed spectra. Point-charge lattice sum calculations on an idealized structure of the $ beta sp{ prime prime}$-alumina crystal are in qualitative agreement with the crystal-field analysis and also provide a model for the observed inhomogeneous linewidths based on the number of residual sodium atoms in the unit cell.

The asynchrony is modelled by a time-varying delay. This delay has to be estimated and compensated. This is accomplished by designing and investigating joint delay estimation and adaptive filtering algorithms. First, joint maximum likelihood estimator is derived for input Gaussian signals. It is used to define a readily implementable joint estimator, composed of an adaptive delay element and an adaptive filter. Next, two estimation criteria are investigated with that structure. The minimum mean squared error criterion is used with a joint steepest-descent adaptive algorithm and with a joint least-mean-square adaptive algorithm. The general convergence conditions of the joint steepest-descent algorithm are derived. The joint LMS algorithm is analysed in terms of joint convergence in the mean and in the mean square. Finally, a joint recursive least squares adaptive algorithm is investigated in conjunction with the exponentially weighted least squares criterion. Experimental results are obtained for these different adaptive algorithms, in order to verify the analyses. The results show that the joint algorithms improve the performance of the conventional adaptive filtering techniques.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860782b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t715p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dg548"><dcterms:title>Testosterone and cognitive aspects of sexual behavior in women and men</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Alexander, Gerianne M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two prospective investigations of periodicity of sexual behavior, well-being and testosterone (T) levels in women using and not using oral contraceptives (OCs) found no relationship between daily ratings of sexual desire and well-being across one pill and menstrual cycle.
