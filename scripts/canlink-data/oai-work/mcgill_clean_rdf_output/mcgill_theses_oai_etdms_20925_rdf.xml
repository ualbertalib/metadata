A group of polypeptide antibiotics was found to have surface activite properties. One of them, gramicidinS, produced a minimum in the surface tension curve, which was attributed to instabilities in the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. Biosurfactants were found to have a great effect on the two phase hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulase. Seven times as much sugar was produced by the hydrolysis of Sigmacell 100 when the biosurfactant sophorolipid was present. The surfactant affects the adsorption of cellulase onto cellulose, and prevents the cellulase from binding irreversibly to the cellulose and becoming inactive.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806089v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w97d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d093q"><dcterms:title>Investigating the efficacy of coping styles of men with HIV infection</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bensoussan, Stephane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigates the coping methods, styles and strategies of 35 homosexual men who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but remain asymptomatic. Subjects were recruited from a Montreal AIDS clinic and support groups for men with HIV. The effectiveness of the coping mechanisms were evaluated by correlating these to measures of depression, state and trait anxiety, psychosomatic symptomatology, perceived social support and global health. Data analyses revealed that men with HIV infection were generally well-adjusted and employed a variety of coping techniques. Cognitive attempts at coping were the most frequently used and were related to elevated levels of state and trait anxiety and poorer global health. Perceived social support proved to be an important determinant of global health, and a buffer for anxiety. Religious identity was related to an enhanced perception of social support, while individuals who had sought counselling were reported to be more anxious and in poorer health. Finally, education level was related to the development of effective and diverse coping methods, styles and strategies. The implication of these results and suggestions for further research are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128b965.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d093q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>HIV infections -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x2477"><dcterms:title>Henry-Emile Chevalier et le feuilleton canadien-français (1853-1860)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beauchamp, Claude</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Henry-Emile Chevalier was forced in exile by the December 1851 Coup d'Etat in France.

The professional literature provides both a conceptual and methodological basis for defining what constitutes a public policy and the means to carry out different types of analysis. Using such a framework, this study analyzes the policy of the Government of Quebec with respect to the education of exceptional children. More specifically, the study focuses on the policy goals and legislative action of the Government. Three separate research questions are each addressed by a systematic analytical framework using a form of qualitative content analysis. The methodology consists first of summarizing all policy data in a computerized database and then scrutinizing these summary statements to search for and analyze emergent themes and the content of policy objectives and standing decisions. The relation between these elements is then determined on the basis of specified decision rules. This analysis has also been subjected to an inquiry audit to test for the dependability and trustworthiness of the results. The analysis reveals three emergent policy themes, over eighty specific objectives and almost 100 standing decisions, which are found in statutes, regulations, ententes and administrative documents. Various incongruencies between the goals and the legislative action are identified and discussed; implications for further research are presented, with reference to the literature.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr49m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mw386</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gifted children -- Education -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education and state -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m5230"><dcterms:title>Civil aviation in SADCC countries : a new type of co-operation?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Deus, Delfim de, 1942-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The 1st of April, 1980 is a landmark date for the peoples of Southern Africa, for the SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION CONFERENCE--SADCC--came into being on that day in Lusaka.

However, although it can be compared with others in terms of objectives and organisation, new elements have emerged since its inception: modest short-term objectives, and ambitious long-term ones; a light organizational structure, and a commitment of the Governments involved to achieve the goals. One can ask what the trends in Civil Aviation are, given this background. This thesis presents a study not with the aim to fully respond to the question above, but to identify the path followed by Civil Aviation as a component of the integrated development sought by SADCC countries.

Cationic surfactants preferred the bottom phase, while anionic surfactants were attracted to the top phase. Increasing the phosphate molarity, the pH, the polymer concentration or molecular weight all resulted in a more one-sided surfactant partitioning. Biosurfactant partition was weaker than synthetic surfactant partition due to their weaker effective charge and lack of strong specific affinity for one of the polymers. Bacillus subtilis cells partitioned very strongly to the bottom phase. Its biosurfactant, surfactin, was found in slightly larger quantities in the top phase. Batch fermentations were carried out in an aqueous two-phase system. Bacterial growth was not inhibited by the high polymer concentration.

A larger data base and a greater area of study than that used in previous studies significantly increases our understanding of the sedimentation and deglaciation processes that have occurred in the area since the last deglaciation. Based on the seismic records and piston cores, four stratigraphic units overlying the Proterozoic bedrock (unit 1) were defined and interpreted: unit 2, glacial till deposited by a westward flowing ice sheet; unit 3, glaciolacustrine stratified muds deposited in glacial Lake Ojibway; unit 4, postglacial marine muds deposited in Tyrell Sea; unit 5, distal fluvio-deltaic sediments from the Great Whale River. Textural and geochemical analyses of individual laminae suggest that unit 3 rhythmites are true varves; dark "summer" laminae were deposited mainly by underflows during the open water season, and light "winter" laminae were deposited by overflows-interflows under a seasonal ice cover. Unit 5 covers approximately 400 km$ sp2$ and occurs as a deltaic constructional wedge which reaches 11 km offshore of the Great Whale River entrance. It was deposited between 3500 BP and 2800 BP from material supplied by the erosion of the Sakami Moraine and of glaciolacustrine and marine muds exposed along the river banks.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg86j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r216k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rf65f"><dcterms:title>Malignant transformation and differentiation of adult rat pancreatic duct cells in vitro</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shepherd, Jessica</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of animal models for pancreatic cancer has magnified the controversy regarding the cell of origin of the tumor in animals and man. In rats, most pancreatic tumors have an acinar histology. By contrast, tumors in hamsters have a ductular morphology, resembling the predominant type of human exocrine pancreatic cancer. While some workers advocate a ductular origin for hamster tumors, others insist that the progenitor is an acinar cell. With the use of normal adult rat pancreatic ductular cell lines, this work shows that four representative pancreatic carcinogens all display dose-related genotoxicity to rat pancreatic ductular cells in vitro. Further, repeated exposure to sublethal doses induced anchorage-independent growth. Transformed cells, injected subcutaneously into isogeneic newborn rats, produced malignant tumors with ductular morphology. A novel achievement of this work was the production of ductular adenocarcinomas using streptozotocin, previously reported as only inducing islet cell tumors.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x249s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf65f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fj19p"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of the ADOM cloud module</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Glazer, Anna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Acid Deposition and Oxidant Model (ADOM) is an Eulerian long-range transport and deposition model.

As a means of gaining insight into the cloud module, results from simulations with the module are compared with the results of simulations for equivalent conditions with a three-dimensional dynamic cloud chemistry model. Comparisons of results for a variety of initial conditions show that wet-deposition of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium ions tend to be underpredicted by the cloud module and that the pH of the rain is overpredicted. However, the differences are for the most part not large. Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide deposited at the surface are significantly smaller in the ADOM module than in the cloud chemistry model.

The first experimental examined the flock feeding behaviour of juvenile ringdoves foraging in a small aviary flock composed of kin and non-kin; frequencies of local enhancement, food begging and aggression were recorded, as well as the individuals that the juvenile associated with while searching for food. Juvenile ringdoves foraged significantly more often with their kin and were aggressed more by non-kin. The last three experiments tested juveniles on three components of foraging: novel food type, environmental colour cues associated with food and novel food-searching techniques. All three involved a choice-test where the juveniles had their father and an unrelated flock member as demonstrators. All three choice-tests showed there was no preference for selecting either demonstrator's solution. Juvenile doves in the field may appear to learn from their parents simply because they associate more with them.

Surface wetness could also contribute to the reduction of transpiration and enhance pesticide effectiveness. For these reasons, field and laboratory performances of commonly used electrical resistance (ER) sensors were compared with a beta-ray gauge (BRG). The BRG provided the most accurate measure of surface wetness duration which agreed favourably with visual observations since it uses a real leaf as a sensor. A commercially available electric grid sensor (Model 237, Campbell Scientific), which employs a hard epoxy-fibreglass board, was found to be accurate in the determination of wetness duration for tobacco but not for soybean leaves. A second cotton cloth ER sensor was found to record accurately wetness duration on tobacco leaves. The data indicated that the choice of an ER sensor for best results depends on the density of the crop canopy. If accurate measurements of leaf surface wetness are critical it is suggested that the BRG system be used.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j96021922.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh13v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Agricultural.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57ns17z"><dcterms:title>The effect of presentation rate on the comprehension and recall of speech after anterior temporal-lobe resection /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Johnsrude, Ingrid S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Abnormally slow processing of language may be a factor contributing to the poor verbal memory seen in many patients with lesions of the anterior temporal region in the left hemisphere.

An additional question examined in this study is the extent to which social, cultural and political factors had an impact on the shaping of this tradition and the various arguments employed within it.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px125.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv12b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ismailites -- Controversial literature -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ismailites -- Doctrines</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tw286"><dcterms:title>Power output and lactate concentration following repeated 10 s intervals using varying recovery patterns</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mancini, Wendy F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Blood lactate concentration and mean power output were examined over a series of maximal intermittent exercise bouts with varying recovery patterns. Thirteen elite male cyclists completed four randomly assigned experimental conditions. Each exercise/recovery condition consisted of twelve 10 s maximal exercise bouts on a Monark cycle ergometer. Four different recovery patterns (30, 60, 90 and 120 s) followed the repeated 10 s all-out efforts. Results revealed that the mean power output averaged over the 12 trials was 12.7, 13.0, 13.2 and 13.4 W/kg, for the 30, 60, 90 and 120 s conditions, respectively. Blood lactate concentration during exercise were 9.9, 9.2, 6.5 and 6.0 mmol/1, for the 30, 60, 90 and 120 s conditions, respectively. The 30 and 60 s conditions yielded significantly lower mean power output values compared to the 90 and 120 s conditions. Following the repeated maximal 10 s efforts, blood lactate concentration was significantly greater in the 30 and 60 s recovery conditions compared to the 90 and 120 s conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st810.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw286</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Blood lactate.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical fitness -- Testing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cycling -- Physiological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mg658"><dcterms:title>The Montreal Repertory Theatre, 1930-1961 : a history and handlist of productions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Booth, Philip, 1937-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Montreal Repertory Theatre mounted a regular series of play productions every year from 1930 to 1961. They deliberately set out to follow the Little Theatre tradition of Antoine while profiting from later developments in England, Ireland and the United States. At a time when no alternatives existed in Montreal they provided theatre education at a high level and helped in the formation of many distinguished careers. This study examines the work of MRT in a historical context, and as revealed in the company's surviving documents and in contemporary reports. The written record is supplemented by interviews with persons who worked with MRT. A number of these have made contributions on a national scale to Canadian theatre.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n468.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg658</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Theaters -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Montreal Repertory Theatre -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Little theater movement -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw95051623"><dcterms:title>Sayyid Aḥmad Khān and the ʻUlamāʾ : a study in socio-political context</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Azizalam, Shaista</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the relationship of Sir Sayyid Ahmad $ underline{ rm Kh}$an with the Indian $ sp{ rm c}$ulama'.

It will likewise be demonstrated that the characters trapped in this system are subjected to one single possible interpretation of individual and social realities. We will then examine the role played by the two protagonists, Santiago Bonday and Renata, in the closed world of Ultimos dias, as well as study the possibilities that these two main characters have of escaping the big lie of the official discourse. We will therefore see that the character's role as writers is fundamental.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t745d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm622</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kociancich, Vlady.

There is therefore the need to forecast these commodities prices as accurately as possible for proper planning and execution of major policies, since the prices have been notoriously volatile during the past two decades and attempts to stabilize especially the price of the beans (which contributes about 60% of the country's foreign exchange) through the system of buffer stock and export restrictions have not been successful. In this regard, autoregressive integrated moving averages models are built and used to generate short run forecasts for the beans and the precious metal price series. These models are simple to build and appear not only to describe the behaviour of the series but provide good forecasts of the prices.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kb85n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dn54q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cocoa -- Prices -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gold -- Prices -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prices -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430588v"><dcterms:title>Shibboleth into silence : a commentary on presence in the Hebrew Bible</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Paul, Eddie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the Hebrew Bible, literary patterns of revelation and concealment are based on humanity's initial encounter with God in the Garden of Eden. God asks the question "Where are you?" Adam and Eve reveal themselves by articulating their concealment behind the fig leaf. This paradox effects their exile from Eden, and their progeny must henceforth mediate this paradox in their future verbal intercourse with God. It is the intention of this work to suggest how in certain textual passages, this paradox is defined and structured according to a literary dichotomy of language and silence. After the exile, biblical characters proclaim their presence before God by uttering a password ("Here I am") which is, in effect, an existential utterance of dialogic reconstruction. Through various literary devices, I hope to show how this "vertical" dialogue is re-established by Adam and Eve's progeny, and how the biblical narrator(s) uses language to show silence as a "phenomenon" of the word.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f4608.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430588v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Silence -- Religious aspects -- Judaism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Silence in the Bible</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752h79r"><dcterms:title>Firm size differentiation in Japan</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chrisanthopoulos, Themistoklis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Japanese labour market is analyzed within a dual labour market context and an emphasis on firm size differentiation. Labour market segmentation theories are presented for the purpose of understanding the differences that can exist between industries, or in this case, between firm sizes. Data on labour market variables such as wages, unionism, and promotion illustrates the different employment package that employees face in small firms as compared to workers in large companies. Unique Japanese labour market traits such as the expectation of lifetime employment, enterprise unionism, and seniority-based wages are also observed to evaluate their application in different company sizes. Japan's labour market segmentation is primarily a study of differences between firm sizes. The dissimilarities in employment characteristics between small and large firms are thoroughly examined and evaluated for a solid understanding of Japan's duality in the labour market.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n4487.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752h79r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Labor market -- Japan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Business enterprises -- Japan</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vp68b"><dcterms:title>Professional environmentalism in Canadian chemistry : the greening of a discipline?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bourdeau, Jean Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research focuses on the involvement of chemists in professional Canadian environmentalism.
