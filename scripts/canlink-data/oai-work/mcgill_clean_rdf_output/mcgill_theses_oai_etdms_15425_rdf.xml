Aside from their intrinsic worth as experimental contributions, there are two additional reasons why these pioneering studies are of importance. On the one hand it is interesting to note that the technical developments took place in the heyday of post-Watsonian behaviourism, at a time when Guthrie (1930; 1935) and Hull (1934; 1943) were developing stimulus-response theoretical accounts of the learning process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Malmo, R.

Preserved relies of prehistoric times reveal wide geographic and zoologic distribution of malignancy. Dinosaurs of the Mesozoic period are said to have shown signs of cancer, and other evidence of its antiquity (Sambon cited by Haddow) (68) are to be found in the treasures of the pyramids, from the Etruscan tombs, from Peruvian mummies and from the cuneiform tablets of the library of Nineveh. The earliest medical record known to man (94) is the "Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus". This anonymous relic of antiquity is generally regarded by historians as having been originally written in the Egyptian Pyramid Age in the Old Kingdom (3000- 2500 B.C .), although speculation by Breasted and Cooper (16) suggest that this document may form part of the teachings of the oldest known physician, Imhotep, the 'patriach and sage of primitive medicine' (94) who lived in the thirteenth century B.C.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henderson, L.

It is generally recognised that although a very wide range of theory has been propounded to explain the nature and origin of savannas, no one has yet brought forward a single convincing viewpoint which has met with universal acceptance. One reason for this is that the majority of theories extant are based upon inadequate field data with almost a total lack of experimental evidence. The McGill University Savanna Research Project was set up for the purpose of initiating an experimental and observational field programme which it was hoped would shed light upon the ecological relations of the savanna, and would ultimately enable an explanation to be made of the nature and distribution of the savanna vegetation of the region.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hills, T.

These lung buds grow into dense mesenchymal tissue which forms the pleural coverings and part of the lung parenchyma. The tubular system develops by branching and re-branching to form a system of tubes in parallel, which averages about 23 generations in the human (131). The structure of the lungs is conventionally divided into the conducting and the respiratory parts.

Spectra were plotted for the d-c magnetic field rotated in the {100} and {011} planes and twelve resonance lines were observed. By considering a model of twelve magnetic complexes, three different g-factors have been determined, 1.895 +/- .002, 1.715 +/- .002 and 1.767 +/- .002, which result from a crystal electric field of orthorhombic symmetry. Through the application of group theory and quantum mechanical perturbation methods, crystal field energy levels have been calculated to be 1050 cm.-1, 1320 cm.-1 and 20,300 cm.-1 above the ground state, with the last value fitting the result of an optical spectroscopic experiment with Ti3+ in a similar environment. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements were made between 4. 2 °K and 1.6 °K and the relaxation time T1 was found to vary from 3. 3 msec. to 63 msec. over this temperature range. From the nature of the temperature dependence, it is evident that the Raman process is dominant at 4.2°K, as theoretical calculations have predicted. The concentration of titanium substituted for aluminum in the crystals studied has been estimated to be 0.02 per cent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.

This conflict can be divided into four distinct periods, beginning with the reaction of critics like Camille Roy and Louis Dantin to Emile Nelligan's poetry in 1904 and going up to the "canadianisme integral" of 1930. The argument concerned much more than literature, having important ideological implications related to French-Canadian nationalism at the beginning of the twentieth century.

However, a complete picture of the many aspects of this field has not yet been formed. The intention of this thesis is an evaluation and critical presentation of the overall picture rather than another fragmented analysis of one or two aspects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bland, J.

Each section of the double instrument has a maximum transmission in excess of 1.5% of 4π stereradians and a beat resolving power of about 1/R = 1%. The spectrometer is well suited to operation in the external beam of the McGill Synchrocyclotron. Several experiments have been performed using this spectrometer. In particular, the discovery of the 13 minute radioisotope Nb88 is reported and a 70 minute isomeric transition in Nb89 has been observed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, R.

The first part of what is known as Herbrand's Theorem states that, given an integer p such that R(p,F) is valid, then we can find a proof of F. In this work, we describe an effective procedure to generate such a proof of F in a Gentzen's type formulation. In fact, we describe an effective procedure to generate what is called a pseudo-proof of F but we show afterwards that this pseudo-proof is a proof. This effective procedure terminates and thus it generates from F, through intermediate formulas, some “ultimate" formulas. We show that these formulas are axioms and, from the way the pseudo-proof is defined, the intermediate formulas and finally F follow from them by rules of inference. The procedure generating a pseudo-proof of F is then an effective procedure generating a proof of F.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denton, J.

The temperature of recrystallization and grain growth ascribed to the hexagonal ~ cubic inversion, at sulphur vapour pressures much less than one atmosphere, was determined at 465 +/- 5°C with annealing time of 2 1/2 hours. In experiments involving differentiai pressures of 8,000 p.s.i., chalcocite in the solid state becomes considerably more mobile above 563 +/- 10°C and can readily be injected as a plastic mass to form veins without preservation of deformational textures.

These defects are often biologically important and, in spite of the difficulties involved in their analysis, deserve more intensive study. The studies which have been done, such as those of Wright (1934a, 1934b), Reed (1936), Gruneberg (1952), Lerner (1954), and Landauer (1957), attempt to explain the apparently non-Mendelian behaviour of the trait in question by invoking either reduced penetrance or multigenic inheritance, or both.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fraser, F.

Reactive sites in the lignin, which normally promoted condensation to insoluble Klason lignin in the strong acid, appeared to be preferentially substituted by formaldehyde in such a way that the formaldehyde lignin was soluble in water and other liquids. The object of the present work was to degrade the formaldehyde lignin in the hope of identifying some molecular fragments indicative of its structure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.
