An implicit objective is to provide NGOs with the conceptual tools to make their development activities effective. The basic premise is that a flagrant abuse of basic human rights by governments in the Horn has lain at the root of much of its people's misery, and that existing international as well as regional human rights instruments provide adequate standards which--if effectively promoted and implemented with the help of NGOs--would secure human dignity. Evidence in support of this basic line of reasoning, as well as an analysis of the new conception of development advanced by, and a detailed examination of how, NGOs have thus far related their development work to human rights, is presented. The concluding chapter attempts to chart a future course in the Horn of Africa through envisioning the work of a new type of NGO, one which would link human rights with development, in theory and practice.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cm158.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf66q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3012416"><dcterms:title>The Mareva injunction : a comparative and critical analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Harrison, John Conacher</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis charts the progress of the Mareva Injunction from its inception in 1975 in England, to the present day.

Chapter II looks at the evolution of the Mareva Injunction and Chapters II to VIII analyse certain legal consequences flowing from the Mareva Injunction which the author considers are of particular interest. Section B of the thesis is a critical analysis and historical survey of the Mareva Injunction in Canadian law. It attempts to compare and contrast English and Canadian jurisprudence on this topic.

In the theoretical section of this thesis we have analyzed the importance of the multiple voices in the collection, an importance that has been stressed by the author herself, as well as by numerous critics. This multiplicity of voices is examined in the light of Bakhtin's concept of polyphony in order to determine if it can be useful to the critic and the translator. We therefore analyze the various voices and types of discourse that are to be found in the collection, in order to show their complexity as well as to permit a better understanding of some of the translation choices that were made.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz66j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n155</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shields, Carol.

Three episodic conversations in particular are discussed: for Stephen, Scylla and Charybdis; for Bloom, Cyclops; and for Molly, Penelope. These conversations, it is suggested, parallel Joyce's evolving novelistic theories, and mark a movement from a metaphysical, to a scientized, and eventually to an ironist understanding of selfhood and society.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx71r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b131</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Joyce, James, 1882-1941.

Bossuet and Pascal, in a classical religious perspective, concentrate on what follows death. Eternal life is their main preoccupation at the expense of life on earth. Within the classical space, death is celebrated as the door to eternity. The fiction entitled "Oraison funebre" tells the story of a death and the questioning it evokes.

Using the home as a category of analysis, I show how Morrison's constructions of home are located within specific socio-economic, racial, and political contexts which mold the novels' characters. Both feminist standpoint theory and the novels develop a notion of "positionality"--one's location within a larger social and historical network. Differences in focus do exist, however, which stem from their respective developmental and experiential contexts--one being primarily theoretical and scholarly, and the other being the complex literary and fictional mediation of a political experience. Unlike the theoretical articulation of concepts of the standpoint, fiction offers a complex perspective that may, in turn, be used to inform discussions of political and epistemological concepts.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838169g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f244s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Morrison, Toni.

There appear to be at least two types of principals insofar as Intech use and application are concerned. The "enabling" principal provides a supportive environment to school staff for the proper use of Intech for administration purposes.

Resistant strains were easily isolated following a single passage in chloramphenicol at 150 $ mu$g/ml to 500 $ mu$g/ml. Drug detoxification or altered sensitivity of the target site could not be the mechanism of resistance. This resistance to chloramphenicol was correlated with the addition of an outer membrane protein with a molecular weight of 49 kDa and the loss of two outer membrane proteins, one with the molecular weight of 19 kDa and the other of about 10 kDa. The highly specific requirement of the resistant strains for Ca$ sp{2+}$, Mg$ sp{2+}$, Mn$ sp{2+}$ or Sr$ sp{2+}$ described by Irvin and Ingram (1982) was confirmed by the observation that the outer membrane of the resistant cells contained twice as much Mg$ sp{2+}$ cation as the sensitive cells. Many other experiments designed to observe the effects of chloramphenicol on the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa failed. It was concluded that the observations made in this study strongly suggested a "re-structuring" of the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa, rendering the resistant cells more impermeable to chloramphenicol.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r421k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf14j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drug resistance in microorganisms.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chloramphenicol.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z9031104"><dcterms:title>The role of intercellular communication in follicular development /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Ben</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the gonadotropins are necessary for follicular development, the spatio-temporal specific differentiation of the constituent granulosa cells and the process of selection for ovulation may be regulated by other intrafollicular mechanisms. Gap junction-mediated intercellular communication between granulosa cells has been previously reported and may play a role in spatio-temporal differentiation and/or follicular selection. In order to elucidate the function of intercellular communication in follicular development, granulosa cell cultures were treated with agents known to disrupt gap junctions (uncouplers): the retinoids and the alkanols. Retinoic acid, heptanol annd octanol inhibited the expression of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors and the accumulation of progesterone in the culture. The expression of LH receptors and the production of progesterone are crucial follicular functions. Thus, the inhibition of these functions by uncouplers provides the first evidence that the establishment of gap junctional communication may be an integral component in follicular development.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rj115.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9031104</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773w886"><dcterms:title>Physically based stochastic modelling of rain and cloud fields</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Early scaling stochastic models of cloud and rain fields were designed to obey the simple scale invariance symmetry.

We consider stochastic models corresponding to coupled cascade processes, non linearly conserving the fluxes of energy and concentration variance. Multiplicative processes, previously based on discrete cascade procedures, are generalized to their continuous limit using a dynamical generator of the cascade characterized by only two parameters which determine the full multifractal spectrum of dimensions. We show how to numerically simulate such multifractal processes with both gaussian and Levy generators, and how to perform a scale invariant "zooming" procedure in the case of clouds passively advected by a turbulent velocity field.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117q07v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w886</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kh508"><dcterms:title>Effects of eutrophication on juvenile scleractinian corals</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wittenberg, Mark</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigates effects of eutrophication on settlement, abundance, mortality and community structure of soleractinian corals on fringing reefs on the west coast of Barbados, W.I.

Further research is required to examine the relationship in other elderly populations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt271.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d68g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gerontology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c91m"><dcterms:title>Parental grief reactions and marital intimacy following infant death</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lang, Ariella</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The grief reactions of bereaved mothers and fathers and their perception of their marital relationship following the death of their infant were examined and compared with nonbereaved couples. The correlation between bereaved parents' grief reactions and their marital intimacy was also explored. A total of 114 couples participated in the study, 57 bereaved couples and 57 nonbereaved. Bereaved couples had lost an infant ($&gt;$20 weeks gestation and $&lt;$1 year of age) within 24 months of the home visit. Bereaved women rated their grief reactions higher than their spouse. Bereaved women also differed in their perceptions of their marital intimacy compared to their husbands. Although no differences were found between bereaved and nonbereaved couples' ratings of their marital intimacy, aspects of the marital relationship emerged as predictors of mothers' and fathers' grief reactions. Thus, it would appear that the expressions of grief of bereaved parents and their relationship with each other are closely linked following the death of their infant.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g4020.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c91m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g626q"><dcterms:title>Genotoxicity in water and sediment extracts from the St. Lawrence river system, using the SOS chromotest</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Langevin, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Surface water and sediments from the St. Lawrence River system (Quebec region) were analysed for genotoxicity using nonlinear SOS Chromotest parameters, as well as for their chemical concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals.

Organic contaminants were extracted dichloromethane. For surface water, fifteen extracts of filtered water and seven of particulates, and for sediments, one extract of pore water and three of particulates proved to be weakly genotoxic. All but one of the genotoxic responses observed in the surface water were obtained from samples taken from the highly industrial portion of the St. Lawrence River system, with the strongest responses observed in Lake St-Louis. Surface water genotoxicants partitioning favors the particulate fraction. Bottom particulates genotoxicity was one thousand fold weaker than suspended particulates. Additionally, whole sediments were extracted with a 10% dimethylsulfoxide-saline solution. Genotoxicity of hydrophilic contaminants was detected in all extracts. The observed distributions of genotoxicity values did not correlate with observed concentrations of demonstrated SOS inducers, mutagens and/or carcinogens, nor with the presence of other toxic chemicals.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh77t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g626q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Genetic toxicology -- Saint Lawrence River.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water -- Composition -- Saint Lawrence River.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Water -- Pollution -- Toxicology -- Saint Lawrence River.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajw827c87s"><dcterms:title>The regulation of platelet aggregation by glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor and fibrinogen /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mooney, Robert Francis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We compared both the rate and extent of platelet aggregation with the extent of fibrinogen receptor expression and specific Fg binding to activated platelets, as a function of ADP concentration. Human citrated platelet-rich plasma (diluted ten-fold) was maximally pre-activated by incubating with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at room temperature and then stirred. Platelet aggregation was determined from the decrease in the total number of particles. The number of fibrinogen receptors or bound Fg was measured from mean fluorescence values obtained with FITC-labelled IgM monoclonal antibody PAC1, and the IgG monoclonal antibody, 9F9, respectively, using flow cytometry. The expression of fibrinogen receptors occurs within seconds of activation. The fraction of platelets with fluorescence values above one critical threshold value increased with increasing activator concentration and correlated linearly with the fraction of platelets recruited into aggregates for ADP (r $&gt;$ 0.9). Aggregation was not rate-limited by fibrinogen receptor expression nor by Fg binding. It appears that each platelet expresses $&gt;$90% of its maximal Fg receptors at a critical ADP concentration i.e, occupancy of ADP receptors. This, in turn, leads to rapid Fg occupancy and platelet aggregation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns0647049.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c87s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q751t"><dcterms:title>Morphology and development of mesocerebrum neurons in Helix aspersa maxima</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laberge, Shelley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The neurons in the mesocerebrum of the right cerebral ganglion control the sexual behaviour of Helix aspersa maxima. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between reproductive development and the development of these neurons. The growth of right mesocerebrum neurons was quantified by filling cells with hexamminecobalt chloride at different ages. The neurite growth phase preceded that of the penis by about four weeks. Total neurite length was linearly correlated with soma diameter as measured in wholemounts. Diameter measurements from sectioned material showed that postembryonic growth in three CNS populations was expressed as increases in soma diameters but not in neuron numbers. The growth rate of right mesocerebrum cells between 5-20 weeks of age was significantly greater than that of the other two populations. Right mesocerebrum development was unaffected by male reproductive tissue ablation. this study shows that growth and development of the right mesocerebrum neurons of H. aspersa maxima occurs relatively late, but is complete prior to the initiation of reproductive behaviour.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q7523.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q751t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neurons.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Reproduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Sexual behavior.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s596w"><dcterms:title>Nifedipine inhibits cholecystokinin induced gallbladder contraction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Clas, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to show that nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, can decrease gallbladder contractility in guinea pigs and in man.

Taking this as a point of departure, the thesis explores the relationship between architecture and speculative thought, and shows how the latter is grounded in the former. A detailed examination of the Anaximander fragment, the earliest surviving record in Western philosophy, is considered in relation to Anaximander's built work. This three-part cosmic model which included a celestial sphere, the first map of the world, and a sun clock (the gnomon), reveals the fragment to be a theory of the work in that the cosmic order Anaximander was the first to articulate was discovered through the building of the model. The model is seen as comparable to a daidalon, a creation of Daedalus, whose legend reflects the importance of craft in the self-consciousness of archaic Greece where the kosmos (order) of civilization were seen as having emerged with the kosmos allowed to appear through the making of the artifact. Archaic self-consciousness is further examined through the emergence of the Greek city-state (the polis) and in the building of the first peripteral temples, both of which are revealed as necessary antecedents to birth of theory, understood as the wondering admiration of the well-made thing.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k28h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q40c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Ancient -- Greece</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Greece</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708x823"><dcterms:title>Impressionism and the writing of Audrey Thomas</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Denisoff, Dennis, 1961-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores Audrey Thomas's adaptation of Impressionist methodologies to analyse verbal discourse. It confirms that Impressionism is the major visual influence on Thomas's work, and clarifies the complex relationship between the tenets of the movement and Thomas's literary concerns. Since the author's intentions in using visual methodologies are most clearly and thoroughly formulated in Latakia and Intertidal Life, the principal analytic focus of this study is these two texts. First Thomas's critical understanding of Impressionism is verified, and the tenets of the movement which are central to Thomas's writing are defined. Once the sociopolitical issues backgrounding Thomas's adaptation of Impressionism are clarified, the author's actual application of the visual methodologies to challenge both social alienation and the alienating characteristics of verbal communication are analysed. This thesis proves that an understanding of Thomas's adaptation of Impressionism is necessary for a thorough comprehension of her struggle against the sociopolitical infringements of her own artistic medium.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px17j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x823</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Thomas, Audrey Callahan -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182m351"><dcterms:title>Gender and work in the Maquiladoras of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mills, Virginia S.

Thousands of Mexican women have since entered the industrial export sector as maquiladora workers, and make up the majority of unskilled and semi-skilled assemblers in electronic and apparel maquila plants. This paper agues that maquiladora managers' preference for women is the result of an unquestioning belief in the gender-specific traits of women--such as dexterity, docility, patience--and well-calculated hiring and personnel policies, which have been designed not only to take advantage of the patriarchal system in Mexico and women's weaker social, political and economic position, but to maintain and control women's qualities of "cheapness", "docility", and "productivity", to the advantage of business.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v066.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182m351</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women offshore assembly industry workers -- Mexico</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
