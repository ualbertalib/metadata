Until recently, hydroxide precipitation was considered the ideal choice for handling metallurgical effluents. Metal hydroxides are stored in landfills, although they are not ultimately stable and may redissolve into groundwater with slight changes in pH. An alternative is to adsorb dissolved metals onto stabilized silica sols ("activated silica"), which are colloidal polymers produced by acidifying silicate solutions. Metal-loaded sol may subsequently be desorbed with concentrated acid. The products are a potentially valuable concentrated metal solution and recyclable sol. Dissolved metal adsorption with silica sols was compared with precipitation, either with lime or sodium hydroxide. Optimum adsorption and desorption conditions were determined for cobalt. Dissolved metals separation by selective adsorption was demonstrated for cobalt/copper and cobalt/iron (ferric) combinations. A cadmium ion selective electrode was used to examine the adsorption/desorption process "in situ".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Distin, P. A.

Most industrial applications require the treatment of a combination of streams from various processes. The composition of the combined stream varies since shock loadings and spills may occur. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of these variations on the microbial community and, ultimately, on the kinetics of the reduction of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). This will improve the understanding of control requirements for the process. Effluents from two mills in Quebec were examined. Initially, effluents from a chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) mill were used in this research. The objective was to study the effect of six different waste streams mixed with total mill effluent (0--100%) on the reduction of COD and on the microbial population. The remainder of this research focused on treating effluents from a Kraft mill and investigated the effect of hydraulic residence time (HRT) and step inputs of 1%, 2.5% and 5% black liquor on the reduction of COD and BOD5 and on the microbial population.

The gaze controller, based on existing biological gaze control systems, is capable of tracking a moving target by integrating smooth pursuit and saccadic modes of operation. Furthermore, the controller is able to gracefully fuse eye and head movements without the need for a separate head controller. This work represents the first time a head platform has been implemented with the bilateral gaze controller. Experiments and simulations that yield the dynamic structure and performance of the eye-head system are presented. Although severely limited by spatial quantization and a low sampling rate, the gaze controller is able to adequately follow a moving target. Results also indicate that the addition of a head platform improves the overall performance of the system, as expected.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, H. L.

Although the thermodynamics for this reaction are favourable, kinetic barriers to cobalt reduction render the method impractical unless activators such as antimony or arsenic in conjunction with copper are used. There is a large body of work studying the effect of these additives, yet the mechanism by which they act is still poorly understood. Moreover, regardless of the beneficial effect of the activators, from time to time the process fails to meet the target level of 0.1 mg/L cobalt in the purified electrolyte, with negative consequences in the electrowinning operation. Even when the target conditions are met, zinc dust consumption is excessively high: satisfactory operation requires up to 300 times the stoichiometric amount of zinc dust. In the present work the role of the antimony/copper activators was investigated in a batch cementation process using synthetic electrolyte. The objectives were to study the fundamentals of cobalt cementation in zinc sulfate electrolyte with conventional additives, to clarify the action of additives and their role in cementation, and to identify and test novel additives.

Moreover, the use of these mechanisms is quite common in robotic and mechatronic systems when complex motions are to be produced with rotational actuators. However, the velocity ratio of the slider-crank mechanism is configuration-dependent and thus, elaborate algorithms are required to precisely control its performance. In this thesis, a planar cam mechanism with an oscillating follower is proposed as a device that renders the velocity ratio of the slider-crank mechanism constant, an operation that is termed here velocity-ratio rectification ; it is expected that the rectification will ease the feedback control of the slider-crank mechanism in mechatronic applications. A methodology for the optimization of this mechanism is developed. First, the performance of the slider-crank mechanism is analyzed and optimum geometric parameters are obtained. Then, an expression for the input-output relation of the cam mechanism at hand is derived, and the corresponding displacement program of the follower is produced. In addition, an approach for the optimization of planar cam mechanisms with an oscillating follower is introduced, to minimize the overall size, while maintaining an acceptable force-transmission performance based on bounds on the pressure angle. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed to allow for the above-mentioned optimization in an interactive mode; the GUI is successfully used in an example of the design of a reducer-rectifier cam mechanism that rectifies the velocity ratio of the actuator of a robotic quadruped.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps681.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj90k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m618b"><dcterms:title>Modeling and performance of microwave radio links in rain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nader, Joe.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Microwave radio links, operating in the millimeter wave region, must account for the effects of rain when considering transmission loss.

The affect of intercrystalline volume, entry surface roughness, cathodic charging current density and different cold working conditions on hydrogen diffusion through polycrystalline metals was tested. Nanocrystalline specimens of pure nickel and of 80%-Nickel 20%-Iron were tested to determine the affect of intercrystalline volume on hydrogen breakthrough diffusion. Specimens of pure palladium were tested to determine the influence of entry surface roughness, cathodic charging current density, different cold working and texture conditions on hydrogen permeation. A series of permeation tests performed on nanocrystalline nickel were used to optimize the measurement conditions. Experiments performed on 80/20 Ni-Fe thin foils determined that the hydrogen breakthrough diffusion coefficient drops dramatically with increasing grain size in the range of 20--40 nanometers. Above 40 nanometers, the breakthrough diffusion coefficient reaches a steady-state level. This decrease in breakthrough diffusion coefficient is thought to be due to a decrease in intercrystalline volume. Tests performed on palladium showed that the hydrogen effective diffusion coefficient increased logarithmically with increasing cathodic charging current density. These experiments also demonstrated that the optimum charging current density for palladium is 0.1 mA/cm2. Other tests on palladium determined that the surface roughness, on the entry side of the specimens, had no influence on the effective diffusion coefficient, processing efficiency or hydrogen subsurface entry concentration. Experiments on cold rolled palladium sheets determined that cold working dramatically lowers both the hydrogen subsurface entry concentration and effective diffusion coefficient.

In order to be able to compare the performance of the various enzymes, a technique for the evaluation of the kinetic constants governing the reactions was developed. In order to do so, the reactions which occur between horseradish peroxidase, phenol, peroxide and aminoantipyrine in an assay were first defined then mathematically modeled. The kinetic model was applied to reactions conducted under a range of initial concentrations of peroxide and phenol. The model was calibrated against experimental data using a genetic algorithm. Based on this approach, an optimal set of kinetic parameters was determined which accurately reflect the trends in experimental data. Due to assumptions used in the development of the model and observations made on the laboratory and modeled data, it was found that the model was applicable to reactions in which the initial phenol concentration was above 1 mM and the peroxide concentration over 0.15 mM. These conditions can now be used to extend the application of the model to evaluate the kinetic parameters associated with other peroxidase enzymes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicell, J. A.

Paraffin wax is a solid mixture of hydrocarbons including n-alkanes ranging from C18H38 to C37H 76. Of the nineteen bacteria tested, four bacteria (Arthrobacter paraffineus ATCC 19558, Mycobacterium OFS, Pseudomonas fluorescens Texaco and Rhodococcus IS01) grew well on paraffin wax. However, only one, Rhodococcus IS01, was found to rapidly and completely degrade a mixture of paraffin wax liquefied with hexadecane using the Self-Cycling Fermentation (SCF) technology. This strain was able to degrade n-alkanes ranging from dodecane to heptatriacontane as well as highly branched hydrocarbons such as pristane and hepta-methyl-nonane. Kinetic studies performed with Rhodococcus IS01 growing on mixtures of n-alkanes showed that the hydrocarbons were degraded in ascending order of chain length: shortest to longest chain. The short lag period between the biodegradation of the different n-alkanes suggested that the growth of Rhodococcus IS01 on mixtures of n-alkanes followed some form of diauxie. Further kinetic studies were conducted growing Rhodococcus IS01 on individual and various mixtures of n-alkanes; these showed that the initial first-order oxidation constant decreased with increasing chain length. This trend is suspected to be due to an enzyme specificity constraint rather than to a mass transfer limitation. In addition, it was also observed that the maximum specific growth rate constant (mumax) increased with increasing n-alkane chain length. Rhodococcus IS01 was also found to produce a cell-associated biosurfactant.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, D. G.

The research is a comparison of industrial bubble generating devices in a pilot and laboratory column using water/Dowfroth and pulp sampled on-line from a local deinking plant. The pilot column tested combinations of 6, 4 and 2 stainless steel (ss) porous spargers, and filter cloth and jetting sparger; the lab column used a single ss porous sparger. Long term tests on the pilot column were also done to evaluate maintenance issues. Trends from the water/Dowfroth tests were used to predict results using pulp. Six ss spargers outperformed the other spargers in all cases. The performance of the lab column sparger matched 4 spargers, with the filter cloth performing marginally better than the jetting sparger or 2 spargers. Gas holdup (Eg) and bubble surface area flux (Sb) gave good correlation with ink removal with all spargers failing within a narrow range. Surface area flux is suggested over Eg unless bubble diameter or superficial gas velocity are indeterminable. Sb &gt; 100 s-1 gave ink removals equal to the plant Voith cells. An Sb below 40 s-1 gave zero ink removal. The lab and pilot column followed slightly different trends which was attributed to column diameter (i.e., wall effects). The ss and filter cloth spargers present long term maintenance issues due to plugging. The performance of the 6 ss spargers decreased more quickly than any other during the long term tests, attributed to lower air velocities per pore.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J. A.

The specimen tested in this thesis was constructed with high-strength concrete and designed with a circular column. All the specimens were designed as ductile moment-resisting frames and tested under reversed-cyclic loading. The Canadian Standard, CSA A23.3-94, limits the concrete compressive strength used in seismic design to 55 MPa.

The hysteretic behaviour of each specimen was analysed in order to investigate energy dissipating characteristics as well as attainable ductility levels.

To enhance the heat transfer rate during melting in horizontal annular containers various innovative passive methods were examined. Eccentric annular configurations are identified as superior to concentric tubular geometries due to the vertically upward orientation of the buoyancy force in the melt phase at higher Rayleigh numbers.

These models often require a large number of variables and parameters in order to accurately describe, the complex relationships between rainfall, runoff and watershed characteristics. This requirement has often become a barrier to the use of such models, because of the difficulties involved in the estimation of these parameters. Hence, there is a great need to develop a robust and reliable automatic calibration procedure to assist in the identification of the best set of optimal parameters for a CUR model. The present study is therefore concerned with the automatic calibration of a typical and well-known CUR model, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model, or SWMM. In this study, two automatic calibration methods were considered based an two different optimization algorithms: the Downhill Simplex (DHS), a popular local optimization technique, and the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE), a global optimization procedure. The consistency of SCE in estimating the SWMM model parameters was assessed under two different scenarios: (1) using "error-free" synthetic data, and (2) using observed data available an the Upper Bukit Timah catchment in Singapore.

The maximum catalytic activity was observed at pH 7; however, significant activity was observed at pHs ranging from 5 to 8. Tyrosinase was unstable under acidic conditions and at elevated temperatures. The activation energy for thermal inactivation of tyrosinase was determined to be 1.85 kJ mol-1 at pH 7. The transformation of phenols catalysed, by tyrosinase was investigated as a function of pH, initial phenol concentration, and additives. Phenol was transformed successfully with tyrosinase, over a wide range of pH (pH 5--8) and a wide range of initial concentrations (0.5 mM--10 mM). Some chlorinated phenols were also successfully transformed with tyrosinase. Polyethylene glycol and chitosan did not improve the transformation efficiency of phenol. However, chitosan was successfully used to remove coloured, products resulting from treatment Since coagulation with aluminium sulfate failed, the colour removal induced by chitosan addition appeared to be the result of simultaneous coagulation and adsorption mechanisms. Minimum doses of chitosan required to achieve 90% of colour removal were logarithmically related to the quantity of phenol treated. All solutions of phenol and chlorophenols treated with tyrosinase, had substantially lower toxicities, than their corresponding initial toxicities. Chitosan addition enhanced the reduction in toxicity very effectively. The toxicities of the phenol solutions treated with tyrosinase were markedly lower than previously reported toxicities of solutions treated with peroxidase enzymes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicell, James A.

The laboratory basin is modeled after a full scale aerated lagoon system operating in Saint-Julie, Quebec. Three experimental techniques are used to reach the objectives: (i) video flow visualization, (ii) tracer studies and (iii) two-dimensional flow measurements using hot-film anemometry. Experiments are conducted on non-aerated basins, as well as on artificially aerated basins. The flow visualization and flow measurements show that the hydraulic behavior of non-aerated wastewater basins is very complex, due to the formation of flow patterns such as stagnant zones and recirculation. The location and size of these flow patterns are determined using the measured velocity flow field and the flow visualization images. Mixing in these basins is highly non-uniform since flow is clearly segregated into high-velocity and low-velocity areas. The exchange between these areas is very low, affecting the distribution of solids and contaminants. When artificial aeration is introduced, mixing becomes more uniform. Flow measurements and visualization indicate that the size of stagnant zones and the extent of recirculation decreases. The tracer studies show that, in general, aeration tends to decrease the actual residence time of the waste material. Calculation of the dispersion number, d, and the dead volume, Vd, are not sufficient to characterize the effect of aeration on mixing. The understanding of mixing and transport mechanisms in wastewater basins is important, because such basins are often used in applications which require settling or mixing of solids and contaminants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Babarutsi, Sofia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75df67c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sc419</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk938"><dcterms:title>Digitally programmable analog log-domain filters</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hematy, Arman.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Frequency filtering networks have numerous applications in consumer products. For high-speed and low-voltage systems, continuous-time filters are the preferred choice---these filters have become very popular with the wireless industry. Unfortunately, continuous-time filters have a high production cost since they are not geared toward mass production. This thesis proposes an analog filter structure that can be both mass produced and customized for a particular application. Such a structure is possible through the use of a state-space approach, and log-domain filtering. First, a general state-space formulation is presented; a method of obtaining the state-space coefficients from an equivalent LC ladder network is described. Such a set of coefficients results in a realization with low noise and low sensitivity properties. Next, the effects of coefficient quantization on a state-space filter's response is examined. An optimization procedure is outlined to obtain the best approximation to the desired transfer function. In order to implement the proposed filter structure, a universal log-domain cell is presented. Such a cell can be used to produce the stages required by any filter design (input, output, and integrator stages). Using the universal log-domain cell, a systematic approach to realizing any arbitrary-order filter is described. Next, the peripheral components needed to complete the filter are presented. Included are a novel 8-bit DAC, used to implement the programmable current sources that bias the filter, and V-to-I and I-to-V converters, used to interface the current-mode filter with voltage-mode instruments. Finally, experimental results from several prototype boards are used to verify the feasibility of the proposed filter structure. These boards make use of ICs fabricated in a 0.8 mum BiCMOS technology; included are an IC with stand-alone programmable current sources, an IC with a third-order filter, as well as one with a fifth-order filter. The results from the test boards clearly demonstrate the programmability and functionality of digitally programmable state-space filters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon W.

The goal of this thesis is to address the throughput component of a mobile wireless digital data communication system with a novel design approach. This thesis explores the incorporation of simple software agents into a mobile wireless digital data communication system. The receiving software agent monitors the quality of the wireless channel and the retransmission statistics of the communication system. Based on these observable states from the channel and the recommendations of the software agent's knowledge bases, the agent takes the appropriate actions in the expectation of realizing the greatest possible throughput for the wireless digital data communication system. This thesis utilizes the GSM standard mobile wireless digital data communication platform model. Within the context of this model, the construction and integration of necessary components, such as error-control algorithms and software agent entities, are described in detail.

Today, it is recognized that the flotation deinking process is one of the most important processes in waste paper recycling. This is demonstrated by the numerous variety of industrial flotation cell technologies currently available. Column flotation, developed in the mineral processing industry, is proposed as an alternative to other flotation technologies due to its low capital costs and improved separation performance. The flotation column requires an air sparging device to produce bubbles. Previous experimentation has shown that columns run with internal porous spargers initially produced excellent ink recoveries and low organic losses but eventually the sparging system plugged and performance deteriorated. In this work, an air sparging technique, based on a static inline pipe mixer was compared to a porous sparger. Both air sparging systems were evaluated in-plant on a lab scale flotation column to determine their relative merits, confirm previous work and compare to a circuit of full scale deinking cells. The effects of gas rate, retention time, wash water rate, froth height were investigated. It was found that the static mixer sparger was an excellent alternative to conventional porous spargers due to its stable operation and ability to control bubble size. As with porous spargers, the bubble surface area rate produced by the sparging system was found to be an important parameter in determining ink recovery. Two flotation circuits based on columns with the two competing sparging systems were scaled up using long term test data and compared. Operational boundaries for the static mixer sparger system were also defined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, James A.

It is capable of simulating a wide range of industrial papermaking conditions and can generate a pressure profile very close to that of an industrial machine. The machine has three components: the headbox section, the drainage section and the sheet pick-up section. All three sections are activated and brought up to operating speeds independently, with the headbox flow being diverted back into a reservoir. Once all systems are running at their operating conditions, the headbox flow is diverted to form a jet and steady-state sheet forming occurs for a certain period. The sheet and seven white water streams are collected during operation. The system is currently able to simulate the papermaking process up to the beginning of the vacuum drainage section; the sheet which it creates has a consistency in the vicinity of 11%. Mass balances of better than 95% have been achieved for both water and fibre. The magnitude of the pressure profiles generated has been measured or calculated. Continuing work will bring the sheet consistency into the 15% to 20% range; once this is attained, an efficient tool to optimize wet-end chemistry will be available.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Garnier, Gil (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd80t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h1671</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture, Wood Technology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n246"><dcterms:title>An integrable mixed-signal test system /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hajjar, Ara.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The growing need for integrable test solutions has prompted the creation of various test bus standards. A mixed-signal test core is an ideal complement to these standards. This work presents the design and implementation of an integrable test system. The design consists of two major components: a stimulus generator, and a waveform extractor. A memory-based generator is used to construct the stimulus generation component. Such a circuit repeats a finite portion of an infinite-length PDM sequence in order to produce any arbitrary analog waveform. The circuitry is simple to design---it is comprised of a scan chain, and a 1-bit DAC; it is also area-efficient and robust (mostly digital design). Furthermore, since the analog signal is generated from a digital bit-stream, it is both stable and repeatable. The extraction component of the test system focuses on the capture of steady-state type responses. A novel A/D algorithm is presented: the Multi-Pass technique. By taking advantage of repetitive waveforms, the Multi-Pass convertor achieves both area-efficiency and high-speed performance. A single on-chip comparator and sample-and-hold circuit is sufficient to extract analog waveforms. In addition, a novel, area-efficient, integrable, and highly-linear voltage reference design is presented. Experimental results from two prototype boards serve to validate the proposed test system design. The first board implements the system using discrete components; the second makes use of a custom IC fabricated in a 0.5 mum CMOS process. The work presented in this thesis provides the groundwork for obtaining a practical and fully integrable mixed signal test system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon W.

This model generates saccades (rapid eye movements) of various amplitudes, and it is able to exhibit various saccade-related phenomena, including multiple and interrupted saccades. The model differs from those in the literature in some of its hypotheses about the roles of the classes of neurons investigated here, but it remains largely in line with the current knowledge about saccade generation. The Superior Colliculus (a layered structure in the midbrain) plays a particularly important role in the model, and it is represented by three different layers: visual, burst, and buildup. The burst layer includes neurons that encode initial motor error, while the buildup layer houses cells whose shifting activity during a saccade provides an estimate for dynamic motor error. Collicular fixation neurons are also modeled, and they are characterized by a Winner-Take-All competition with burst neurons. Such a competition dictates whether a saccade is generated or not. Other saccade-related brainstem, structures, including omnipause neurons, medium-lead burst neurons, and the neural integrator, are also modeled.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, James J.
