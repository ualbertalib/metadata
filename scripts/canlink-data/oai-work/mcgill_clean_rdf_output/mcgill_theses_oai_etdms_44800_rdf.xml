The study was commissioned by the company to confirm or refute a previous observation (Vobecky et al., Cancer 54:2537-2542, 1984) that there were higher mortality rates from colorectal cancer among male employees of the textiles unit, the cellulose acetate fiber manufacturing unit, and the cellulose triacetate and polypropylene extrusion units and to investigate whether mortality rates for other sites of cancer were associated with employment in each area of the plant and with occupational exposures. Workers with more than one year experience at the plant were eligible for study if they were employed on January 1, 1947 or if they were newly hired between that date and December 31, 1977. Vital status as of December 31, 1986 was ascertained for 7,422 men and 2,720 women through a probabilistic record linkage to the Canadian Mortality Data Base. Among men, there were about 220,000 person-years of observation and 1,738 deaths and, among women, there were about 89,000 person-years of observation and 241 deaths. Three reference regions were used to derive standardized mortality ratios (SMR): the entire Province of Quebec, semi-rural regions of the Province, and the area in which the plant is located. Results based on rates for these regions were generally similar. For men, the SMR for all causes of death was significantly less than unity (SMR = 0.71, 95%CI:0.68-0.74), as were the SMRs for most sites of cancer (SMR all neoplasms = 0.73, 95%CI:0.66-0.80). The SMR for colorectal cancer was 0.68 (95%CI:0.51-0.91). Of the 20 cancer sites examined in men, reticulum cell sarcoma was the only one having a significantly elevated SMR, and this occurred only among the subcohort of men hired prior to 1947 (SMR = 2.84, 95%CI:1.04-6.18, 6 deaths). For women, the SMR for all causes of death was 0.75 (95%CI:0.66-0.85) and there were moderately elevated SMRs for a number of sites of cancer, but none were significantly greater than expectation (SMR all neoplasms = 0.97, 95%CI:0.80-1.17). SMRs were also calculated according to employment in each processing unit and exposure to occupational agents, and case-control analyses were carried out within the cohort for selected sites of cancer. Of the scores of associations tested, very few were significantly elevated. There were excesses of biliary cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas among workers in the cellulose acetate fiber manufacturing unit. There were also significant associations between stomach cancer and exposure to cutting oils, and between prostate cancer and exposure to glycol monobutyl ether. However, none of these associations were persuasive. With regards to colorectal cancer, there was a nonsignificant elevation in risk among workers who had ever worked in the polypropylene and cellulose triacetate extrusion unit (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 2.3, 95%CI:0.5-9.9) but there was no apparent increase in risk with increasing duration of employment. Thus, the evidence for an association was not convincing. For the cellulose acetate fiber manufacturing unit, the evidence of an increase, although based on few cases, was slightly more persuasive (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 1.9, 95%CI:1.0-3.6), but no trend was observed with duration. No association was observed with employment in the textiles unit (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 1.1, 95%CI:0.6-2.2) nor were there any noteworthy associations between colorectal cancer and any of the agents evaluated in the case-control analyses.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967450h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296wz83k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak06988285"><dcterms:title>Effect of physical environment on cercospora carotae and development of a model to predict cerscospora blight of carrot</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carisse, Odile</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of interrupted leaf wetness (IWP) and %RH on infection by Cercospora carotae (Pass.)

IWP significantly reduced infection as compared to CWP. Infection was optimal under leaf wetness and decreased with decrease in percent RH. The effect of temperature and duration of moist period on sporulation of C. carotae was studied on carrot plants under leaf wetness, 96%RH, and 96%RH with an initial 12 hr of leaf wetness. For all types of moisture conditions, sporulation increased with the increase in temperature up to the optimum (28$ sp circ$C) and then declined. Logistic and polynomial models were used to describe the effect of temperature and time on sporulation under these moisture conditions. The incubation period of Cercospora carotae was studied in the field. First lesions were observed 6 to 8 days after inoculation and new lesions appeared until the 10th to 14th day. The beginning, mean, and end of incubation period was modelled as a function of mean daily temperature and mean daily RH $ ge$ 90%. A model describing lesion appearance as a function of time was developed using a logistic function (R$ sp2$ = 0.84). A prediction model containing series of equations that described mathematically the interaction among predicted inoculum, infection and sporulation equivalents for the environment was developed and validated. In general, the model predicted adequately Cercospora blight progress. A weather-based forecasting system was developed to time the first fungicide spray to manage Cercospora blight of carrot based on the accumulation of critical number of disease severity units.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h272v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06988285</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carrots -- Diseases and pests.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerospora</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hj94t"><dcterms:title>Fate of the transferrin receptor during in vitro maturation of sheep reticulocytes and post-translational modifications of the transferrin receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Adam, Mohammed A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The transferrin receptor is a membrane protein which is involved in the binding and endocytosis of transferrin, the main Fe$ sp{3+}$ carrying protein. The receptor and transferrin function to provide cells with iron, an essential nutrient. As red cells mature and lose their ability to make hemoglobin, they also lose their capacity to bind transferrin and take up iron. The transferrin receptor in sheep reticulocytes has been shown to undergo externalization in vesicular form during maturation of sheep reticulocytes in vitro. Microscopic studies show that the receptor is internalized into endosomes and externalization, in vesicular form, occurs via formation of multivesicular elements (or bodies), which ultimately fuse with plasma membranes releasing the inclusion vesicles bearing the transferrin receptor. The released receptor seems intact, having the same molecular weight and $ sp{125}$I-iodo-tyrosyl tryptic peptide map as the native receptor. The externalized receptor can also bind transferrin and the anti-receptor antibody. The transferrin receptor can be fatty acylated and phosphorylated in intact cells and in isolated plasma membranes. The phosphorylation of the receptor is not affected by the binding of transferrin or anti-transferrin receptor antibody. However, $ beta$-phorbol esters can stimulate the phosphorylation of the receptor suggesting that protein kinase C may be responsible for receptor phosphorylation. During reticulocyte maturation, the externalized transferrin receptor is not phosphorylated. Furthermore, the ability of this externalized receptor to undergo phosphorylation by protein kinase C is also lost, suggesting a maturation induced change in the receptor compared to the cell associated receptor. This change may be a signal which determines whether the transferrin receptor is to be segregated for externalization during red cell maturation or recycled for iron delivery.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m79h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj94t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w562t"><dcterms:title>The role of microscopic mixing in the description of turbulent diffusion in fluid continuum /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guo, Ya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of molecular mixing (as opposed to molecular-collision transport) in the description of turbulent diffusion in continuum framework is examined. This is done by comparing a new virtual fluid parcel treatment with the classical fluid particle treatment of the BMDFE (Basic Macroscopically Describable Fluid Element). It is found that the classical fluid particle treatment conceptually excludes molecular mixing between different BMDFEs, due to its postulated constraint that individual BMDFEs maintain their integrities in motion. The new virtual fluid parcel treatment, on the other hand, conceptually incorporates molecular mixing between different BMDFEs, by relaxing this constraint to permit disintegration of individual BMDFEs. The main improvement made by the new virtual fluid parcel treatment lies in the introduction of a feedback mechanism in the form of physically coupled disintegration and integration of the BMDFEs. This improvement suggests that molecular mixing is a controlling agent of the mixing mechanism in every time-step of turbulent diffusion, whose significance would increase cumulatively. By applying the two treatments to the evolution of the diffusion cloud on the level of single time-step diffusion redistribution, it is shown that molecular mixing persistently and cumulatively influences the evolution of the diffusion cloud by reducing the diffusion distribution variance. This indicates that the exclusion of molecular mixing in the classical fluid particle treatment would lead to a potential mathematical-physical inconsistency in the description of turbulent diffusion by exaggerating the diffusion distribution variance. The results of this analysis are qualitatively supported by experiments of passive scalar diffusion in water flow with moderate turbulence intensity. As a preliminary test, a simplified numerical modeling of scalar diffusion based on the virtual fluid parcel treatment is executed in two wind tunnel models.

A French Canadian center, specializing in cancer treatment, was the main source of information for this study. Facts obtained from this setting served for the analysis. The first step in the proposed method, consisted of an ethnographic description of the clinical milieu observed. Next, five additional steps in the analysis indicated the principal elements of this cultural encounter with cancer. These steps included: (1) An analysis of the staff exchange; (2) An analysis of the patient's exchange; (3) An analysis of the documents on Terry Fox and Johnny Rougeau, heroic victims of cancer; (4) An exploration of the patients' lay knowledge on cancer; (5) A life story of a cancerous patient where by the dialectic trends between exchange, knowledge and experience are analysed. The resultant three hypotheses deal with the emergence of a new exchange on cancer with an emphasis on hope and god morale, the homology of cancer exchanges in the clinical and social spheres, and finally concerning the nature of the layman's knowledge on cancer as making sense out of a troubling experience of liminality and alienation as well as the more open and dynamic character of the layperson's knowledge of cancer.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977v693.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rh836</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cancer -- Patients -- Hospital care -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cancer -- Hospitals -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cancer -- Social aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr171x99r"><dcterms:title>Dynamic viscoelastic properties of melts and plasticized systems of ionomers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bazuin, C.

The ionic units in quaternized poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) mildly retard chain diffusion. In contrast, the rubbery plateau of blends of poly(styrene-co-styrene-sulfonic acid) and poly(ethyl acrylate-co-4-vinylpyridine), compatible above ca. 4 mol % co-unit content, is greatly extended, independent of co-unit content. It is postulated that the kinetics of ion dissociation and reassociation in the blends are faster than chain diffusion, effectively trapping chain entanglements for comparatively long times. Time-temperature reducibility applies to both the cationic ionomers and the blends. It fails at high plasticizer contents for poly(styrene-co-sodium methacrylate), of 5 mol % ion content, plasticized by a styrene oligomer. Two relaxation processes are evident in this system. Nonpolar diluents plasticize the ionic regions of carboxylated more than sulfonated ionomers. Polar diluents destroy the effect of ionic associations in the transition and rubbery zones.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w697.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171x99r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Viscoelasticity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ionomers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vc21q"><dcterms:title>Electromagnetic radiator characterization and modeling through planar near-field measurements</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Mahdawi, Tareef Ibrahim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the use of planar near-field measurements for characterizing and modeling general electromagnetic radiators, particularly non-directive ones.

These were used to determine the resolution with which these currents can be mapped. The equivalent currents then serve as a model from which the radiator external field can be calculated. It was shown that significant filtering of measurement errors results from the utilization of such a model. The consequent reduction in errors was estimated. The behavior of the measurement probe was studied in depth. The two general probe types, wire and aperture, were analyzed, and field extraction formulation and procedure were established. The techniques developed were applied to the experimental study of three different radiators leading to new information about their behavior.

Among semiprime rings two classes are singled out, fully symmetric semiprime and right noetherian semiprime rings; these two kinds of rings have the desirable property of yielding "nice" stalks for the above sheaf.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3333070.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv35s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rings</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sheaf theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Commutative rings</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gp05w"><dcterms:title>Leaf number and maturity studies in Zea Mays L.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1971</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agronomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bonaparte, Ebenezer Eric Nii Adu.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h271k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp05w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hybrid corn</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wk041"><dcterms:title>Specific DNA binding by polyomavirus large T antigen</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sunstrom, Noëlle-Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To define the DNA binding domain of polyomavirus large T antigen, systematic deletion mutagenesis was carried out on large T antigen. A set of plasmids coding for unidirectional carboxy- or amino-terminal deletion mutations in large T antigen were constructed. Deleted proteins were expressed by plasmid transfection of Cos-1 cells. Analysis of origin-specific DNA binding by mutant proteins revealed that the C-terminal boundary of the DNA-binding domain is at or near Glu 398. Fusion proteins of large T antigen lacking the first 200 N-terminal amino acids bound specifically to polyomavirus origin DNA; however, deletions beyond this site resulted in unstable proteins which could not be tested for DNA binding. Testing of point mutants and internal deletions by others suggest that the N-terminal boundary of the DNA-binding domain lies between amino acids 282 and 286. Taken together, these results locate the DNA-binding domain of polyomavirus large T antigen to the 116- amino acid region between residues 282 and 398. Polyomavirus large T antigen binds to four discrete regions within the regulatory region of the viral genome. The relative arrangement of these binding sites may be important for the distinct regulatory functions performed by the protein. Each of the four large T antigen binding sites was separately cloned into a test plasmid by the use of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The binding affinity of large T antigen was analyzed for each individual site and for combinations of sites. The results of this analysis showed that there exists an hierarchy of binding strength among individual and combinations of large T antigen binding sites as measured by DNA immunoprecipitation. In addition, the DNA binding of large T antigen involves cooperative interaction of protein molecules between adjacent binding sites, and the integrity of the amino terminus is required for cooperativity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc85n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wk041</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bq10n"><dcterms:title>Isoenzyme studies and tissue culture of raspberry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cousineau, Johanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Starch gel electrophoresis and isoenzyme staining were studied in raspberry (Rubus idaeus L., R. X neglectus Peck, and R. occidentalis L.). Seven isoenzymes could be separated using one of two gel-electrophoresis buffers: tris-citric acid at pH 7.1 for aconitase (ACO), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), phosphoglucomutase (PGM), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) and histidine-citric acid at pH 5.7 for malate dehydrogenase (MDH), phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), and shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH). There were no variations detected between samples obtained from micropropagated shoots, greenhouse-, or field-grown plants. Tissue type and age had no effect on isoenzyme banding patterns except for PGM where this affected the relative densities of the bands. Fifty-five out of 78 raspberry cultivars could be uniquely characterized using the above isoenzymes. Analysis of cultivars obtained from multiple sources detected occasional mislabelled plants. The mode of inheritance of raspberry isoenzymes was studied and analysis of co-segregating loci revealed two possible linkage groups: Mdh-2/Tpi-2/Pgm-1 and Idh-1/widh. A high rate (70%) of adventitious shoot regeneration was observed from leaf-petiole explants of micropropagated shoot cultures of 'Comet' red raspberry cultured on modified Murashige-Skoog medium containing 1 mg/l thidiazuron (TDZ) and 0.5 mg/l 1H-indole-3-butanoic acid (IBA). Variation in the agar concentration or incubation temperature, orientation or scoring of the leaf-petiole explants and use of separate leaf or petiole explants had no effect on shoot regeneration while incubation in the dark for 1, 2, or 3 weeks prior to growth in the light depressed the number of adventitious shoots formed. Only 8 of 22 raspberry cultivars were capable of regenerating from leaf explants of greenhouse-grown plants.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s563b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bq10n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Isoenzymes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Raspberries -- Breeding.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pb224"><dcterms:title>Bioelectrocatalysis at organic conducting salt electrodes : mechanism and biosensor development</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhao, Shishan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A detailed, unified description of electrocatalytic mechanisms at organic conducting salt (OCS) electrodes, tetrathiafulvalene tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTFTCNQ) and hexamethylenetetratellurafulvalene tetracyanoquinodimethane (HMTTeFTCNQ), has been presented. A wide spectrum of behavior is observed depending on the electrochemical and kinetic characteristics of the analyte of interest, the nature of the OCS, and the applied potential. Both direct electron transfer and indirect (homogeneous and heterogeneous) mediation mechanisms are shown to arise, depending on the experimental conditions. The redox chemistry of the coenzyme, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), has been investigated in detail as a function of metal complex formation and pH. The characterization of PQQ and its metal complexes provides insight into the redox chemistry of the 15-lipoxygenase active site. A biosensor involving the coupling of a PQQ-enzyme, methanol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.8.), to a TTFTCNQ electrode has been developed. Characterization of this enzyme membrane electrode shows that the substrate-reduced enzyme is rapidly turned over at the TTFTCNQ electrode whereas no turnover is evident at a conventional electrode. Enzyme properties (K$ sb{ rm me},$ stability, T$ sb{ rm sensitivity},$ pH dependence, substrate selectivity), when interfaced to the electrode, are reported.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3333088.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pb224</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v388h"><dcterms:title>Hudson Bay platform : silurian sequence stratigraphy and paleoenvironments</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Suchy, Daniel R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Trends in relative sea-level change, shown by curves drawn from drill core and outcrop sections in Llandoverian carbonates of the Hudson Bay Platform, were used to correlate individual parasequences among widely separated localities. Two sequences, bounded by regional disconformities, include: (1) the Severn River Formation, and (2) the Ekwan River, Attawapiskat, and Kenogami River Formations. Initial onlap of marine facies at the base of the Severn River Formation progressed from north to south, occurring first in the Hudson Bay Basin, then in the Moose River Basin; final retreat of the seas at the end of Attawapiskat time was in the opposite direction. The most extensive inundations occurred during Ekwan River and Attawapiskat depositional times. Large-scale trends in the curves delineate four major Early Silurian sea-level highstands also recognized in other basins. Reefs in outcrops along the Attawapiskat River represent one interval of reef growth, had a syndepositional relief of 8-10 meters, and were terminated by a relative sea-level fall. Their present distribution is controlled by variously uplifted fault blocks. The most important diagenetic processes were early marine cementation and shallow burial diagenesis, and in the southwestern Moose River Basin early secondary dolomitization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn194.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v388h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn051"><dcterms:title>Mother-child interaction : scaffolded instruction and the learning of problem-solving skills in children with Down syndrome</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>D'Amico, Miranda</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines the effects of maternal teaching style on the developing problem-solving abilities of children with Down Syndrome. Mothers were divided into two groups of three each, mothers with positive expectations versus mothers with negative expectations. Mothers and children were videotaped while the mother taught the child to construct a small pyramid from 21 interlocking blocks and again when the child attempted the task independently. The tapes were coded and analyzed to examine maternal instructional style and subsequent independent child performance. Mothers who were considered to have positive expectations towards their children used appropriate scaffolding behaviors significantly more often than the mothers who were considered to have negative expectations towards their children. The children of mothers who were effective scaffolders were significantly more adept and independent problem-solvers than the children whose mothers were not effective scaffolders. The more contingent the mother's instructions were, the more independent and successful the child appeared. Scaffolding is discussed in terms of its benefits for instructing children with Down Syndrome.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh25x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn051</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Down syndrome</dc:subject><dc:subject>Problem solving in children</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mother and child</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161698m"><dcterms:title>Aphasic comprehension of French causative constructions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gendron, Jo-Ann</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Independently proposed linguistic analyses permit us to characterize function words and inflectional morphology as one class. These elements are hypothesized to constitute heads of functional projections. In this thesis, the Head Accessibility Hypothesis is proposed to account for the representations aphasics have of lexical and functional projections. It maintains that, as a consequence of the interactional nature of the modular grammar embodied in the principles and parameters version of Government-Binding theory (Chomsky 1982, 1986), syntactic deficits may be due to problems at the level of access to the Mental Lexicon. The implications of this hypothesis for syntactic comprehension in general and for the comprehension of causatives by aphasic patients are tested in a series of batteries administered to nine French aphasics and ten controls. The results support the proposal that the Head Accessibility Hypothesis correctly accounts for the patterns of present and absent linguistic elements in the representations computed by all types of aphasics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb23d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161698m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aphasia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z161f"><dcterms:title>Free field realization of extended conformal field theories</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bougourzi, A.
