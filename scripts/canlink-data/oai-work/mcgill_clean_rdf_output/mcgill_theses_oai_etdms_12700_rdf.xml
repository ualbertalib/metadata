Higher digestion values were obtained for cooked egg than for raw egg with both species. Rats digested all fractions of the basal diet but ether extract to a lesser extent than did humans.

This minor folding has caused considerable plastic flowage in a thick limestone member of the series. As a result of the flowage, the limestone beds are intricately folded and have developed a distinctive layered structure. The origin of this layering by metamorphic differentiation is discussed. A series of quartz veins, containing small amounts of gold, occurs along the crest of the major anticline principally within the uppermost quartzite member.

The results indicated that the individual grains and their admixtures have characteristic digestibilities.

While there numerous cases of infectious mononucleosis were studied, and the Paul-Bunnell reaction was seen as a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis of this disease, especially where the blood picture suggested that of lymphatic leucemia. It was our experience, however, that roughly one serum out of ten from cases diagnosed on a clinical basis as infectious mononucleosis and exhibiting the typical mononuclear blood picture seen in this disease, failed at any time during the course of infection to give a significant Paul-Bunnell test.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, E.

This will explain why certain subjects have not been dealt with in the following pages and why the bibliography does not list some material which would certainly have to be consulted in a general study of the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution. This thesis deals with the period 1760-1810. In the greater work, the thesis presented here will be preceded with a discussion of machinery introduced in England before the Industrial Revolution, and followed with discussions on the Luddite disturbances, the introduction of agricultural machinery and of the power loom, and the impact of machinery on politics, on early socialist thought and on economic theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Usher, A.

The object is to carry the analysis of indifference curves and isoquants to a logical conclusion. This entails a detailed consideration of areas of the contour maps not required for ordinary discussions of demand and production problems. Three preliminary arguments may be advanced for extending the analysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weldon, J.

The problem of the re-settlement of displaced persons in Canada is one of rehabilitation of lives which have undergone unusual strain and unnatural experiences. When we invite displaced persons to settle here we undertake the obligation of so providing for their re-education and for their adaptation to Canadian life that they will become useful and happy citizens. This study has inevitably turned its attention towards many and different aspects of the background of these displaced persons and of the problems which face them on becoming established here in Canada.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jefferis, J.

Many of the possible roads of investigation have been blocked waiting for progress in special fields. However, much investigation can be done using the present knowledge to help elucidate the extremely difficult but important problems. Any advancement in the knowledge of gastric secretion would be a valuable step forward in the understanding of this complex function and might be used to great value in many important problems including that of peptic ulcer and combined systems disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, G.
