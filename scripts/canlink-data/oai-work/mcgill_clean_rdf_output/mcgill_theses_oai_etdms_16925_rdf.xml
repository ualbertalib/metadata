Cellulose is the chief constituent of the cell wall of all land plants and is composed of D-glucose residues linked by (1-&gt;4)-B-glycosidic bonds to linear macromolecules of considerable length (2.5 u). Lignin is a three-dimensional polymer based on phenyl propane units, which are connected in a number of different ways and whose structure is still not known in detail. The hemicelluloses are the polysaccharides which accompany cellulose and which are easily hydrolyzed by dilute mineral acids.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Timell, T.

However, it is now possible to free lignin of all carbohydrate without any apparent damage to its solubility in pulping liquors. By cooking this lignin with aqueous sodium sulphide solution, and studying the yields and the sulphur contents of the residual and dissolved portions at different stages, some light has been thrown on the mechanism by which sulphide exerts its beneficial effect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Stress-corrosion cracking is currently defined as the cracking resulting from the combined effect of corrosion and stress (1). Cracks so produced are of a brittle nature and may be intercrystalline or transcrystalline depending upon the alloy and corrosive atmosphere involved. Frequently the amount of corrosion associated with the cracking is extremely small. The types of alloys that may be made to stress corrosion crack are numerous. In fact it seems probable that every alloy will so fail given the correct conditions. It is fortunate that the corrosive atmospheres that cause such cracking are relatively few.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacEwan, J.

This material includes countrymen's proverbs, folk-magic, seasonal festivals, and rites descended from primitive religions. Some of the legends are connected with Angle-Saxon and Roman relics -- barrows, roads, burial grounds, fortifications ethers with old country families. Witchcraft and many sorts of superstition become important themes in several of the novels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lucas, A.

Such a description has been called an ‘ethogram’ (1), and utilises the methods and teaching of contemporary ethologists such as Tinbergen(2), Thorpe (3), and Lorenz (4). Secondly, in pursuit of the primary aim, it is hoped to show the validity of what may be called 'the naturalistic approach'.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunbar, M.

This is achieved by operating the relays in this region under the control of a linearizing carrier signal. The experimental investigation is carried out on a model using ordinary servo components such as a two-phase motor, an induction tachogenerator, and associated components which are common to instrument servos.. This has the advantage of showing the effect of noise and second-order non-linearities such as backlash and static friction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pavlasek, T.
