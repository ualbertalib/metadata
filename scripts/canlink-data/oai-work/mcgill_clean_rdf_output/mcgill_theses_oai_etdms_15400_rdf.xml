The scope is limited to the exploration of a few major questions, e.g., language ability, employment and economic situation, and social and cultural adjustment. The project is limited by the small number of subjects and by the selection of questions from the original larger schedule.

It examines the assignments undertaken by non -professional personnel in two test periods covering a span of five months. The study includes a description of the research setting, and of the problems that press for the use of non-professional personnel. The work loads and responsibilities of the professional and non-professional staff members who participated in the study are systematically examined, also the general characteristics of assignments undertaken by non-professional personnel. It was found that professional social workers differed dramatically in their acceptance of, or resistance to, the use of non-professional personnel. It was also found that despite these mixed reactions, non-professional personnel could carry a substantial proportion of the work normally carried by professional social workers, and that in most areas of service the professional status of the Social Service Department was safeguarded by the supervision of professional staff.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, V.

The results are presented for each term of the energy budget and for the net outgoing energy flux, in the form of maps.

A technique has been developed for the determination of reactive membrane sulfhydryl content in intact erythrocytes, utilizing subhemolytic concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate (PMB). The erythrocyte membrane of 52 healthy subjects contained 2.50 - 2.85 x 10^-16 moles of reactive SH groups (mean 2.50 +/- 0.20) per erythrocyte, when determined by this method. A 27-36% reduction of erythrocyte membrane SH content was observed in various conditions characterized by accelerated red cell destruction, including glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, drug-induced, autoimmune and other acquired hemolytic anemias and congenital spherocytosis. Normal membrane sulfhydryl content was found in iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia in relapse, and in other miscellaneous hematological conditions. Inhibition of membrane SH groups with PMB caused marked potassium leakage from the otherwise intact cells. The possible role of membrane sulfhydryl groups in the development of certain types of hemolytic anemias, and in the maintenance of active transmembrane cation transport in the erythrocyte is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shapiro, L.

The purpose of the study was to measure the mechanical properties of copper sheet produced by two different methods, and to compare the data in order to see if one method had any clear advantages over the other. The first method of sheet production, which we may call temper rolling, is the one that is used almost exclusively in industry. This is the method discussed immediately below. The other sheet production method, which may be called partial annealing, has been used only in isolated cases.

Accordingly it has been contended that certain portions of the duct system in the adult gland are associated with one or the other primordium developmentally. Many variations in the patterns displayed by the intraparenchymal duct system have been described but little attention has been given as to how such a wide range of variation might be explained from a developmental point of view. By studying the spatial arrangements of the ducts in a representative number of specimens, enabled by careful preparation of precise stereoradiographic pancreatograms in each instance, the reflections these arrangements and their variants could be considered to throw upon the formation of the gland during its development are critically examined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Banfill, S.

However, prior to the exposition of the present administrative and planning systems we shall attempt to present to the reader the highlights of the evolution of these systems. For that purpose we shall concentrate on some of the aspects of the development of the centralized planning system in Poland after World War II through the Three-Year Plan of reconstruction and the Six-Year Plan of intensive industrialization, with particular stress on the latter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Armstrong, D.

Some interest has recently been shown in disjunctive RT tasks in which successive trials follow each other in a continuous series (Sa-Ra, Sb-Rb, Sb-Rb, Sa-Ra, etc.). This type of experimental paradigm has made it possible to study the way in which various properties of the series affect speed of discriminative responses. Three such serial performance affects on DRT are explored in the present study: (a) vigilance affect, (b) relative frequency effect, and (c) a proactive effect. Some Serial Performance Effects In this section previous experiments bearing on the three serial performance affects that are of particular interest in this thesis are reviewed and certain experimental and theoretical issues are defined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.

That it is not necessary for the two to coincide is based on the premise that the performance of a plant is directly associated with its own genotype and not on conditions under which the seed was produced. McFadden (1963) has cast serious doubt on the validity of this premise with the discovery that the same variety of barley would produce different yields in the same yield trial if the seed were grown in different geographical locations. He found, for instance, that the variety Montcalm grown from seed produced at Guelph (Ontario) gave a higher yield than Montcalm grown from seed produced at Beaverlodge (Alberta), when planted the following year at Guelph (Ontario), Brandon (Manitoba), Lethbridge and Lacombe (Alberta). According to McFadden (1963), it would appear logical to select potentially suitable locations as seed increase centers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brawn, R. I.

Its position, 13° North, 59° West, places it to the east of the Antilles, from which it is separated by the Tobago Trench. While located in the North Equatorial Current, it is on the northern edge of the influence of the South Equatorial Current, and is the first island of the West Indian group that these currents pass before entering the Caribbean Sea travelling westward parallel to the shores of South America. The island has an area of 166 square miles, and is roughly triangular in shape, twenty-one miles long and eleven miles wide. The nearly 300,000 people living there make it one of the most heavily populated countries in the world.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunbar, M.

The total nitrogen present in most soils is relatively small, and is constantly undergoing many transformations, both chemical and microbiological. However, only a significantly small fraction of the total soil nitrogen is in a form that is available to plants. The ease with which available inorganic nitrogen compounds may be lost from the soil through leaching, erosion and crop removal is an indication of the importance of the study of nitrogen in soils.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Steppler, H.

Changes in the ethanol-soluble and ethanol-insoluble derivatives of these acids during growth and development were determined. A new phenolic acid, orthoferulic acid, was isolated from wheat. C14-labeled compounds were administered to wheat shoots and their incorporation into lignin and into hydroxycinnamic acids was measured. Labeled CO2, phenylalanine or tyrosine were incorporated more readily into the insoluble derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids than into ethanol-soluble derivatives whereas the reverse was true for labeled precursors such as cinnamic and the hydroxycinnamic acids. Time-course studies with 14CO2 suggested the sequence: CO2 -&gt; aromatic amino acids -&gt; ethanol-insoluble derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids -&gt; lignin. A scheme is suggested to explain these complex relationships.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Towers, G.
