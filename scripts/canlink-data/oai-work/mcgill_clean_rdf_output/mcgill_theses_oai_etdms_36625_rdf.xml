Ubiquitin conjugation is activated and histones are ubiquitinated at this stage, suggesting that histone degradation may be mediated by ubiquitination. The activation of ubiquitin conjugation during spermatogenesis is dependent on the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) UBC4. We therefore studied whether histones are ubiquitinated by a UBC4 dependent ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) during spermatogenesis. E3Histone was identified by a biochemical screen and purified to near homogeneity. Mass spectrometry identified E3Histone as LASU1, a 482 kDa HECT domain protein and E3Histone conjugates ubiquitin to all core histories in vitro. UBC4-1 and UBC4-testis were the preferred E2s for E3Histone-dependent ubiquitination of histones. E3Histone was the major UBC4-1 dependent histone ubiquitinating E3 in testis. Anti-LASU1 antibody immunodepleted E3 Histone activity. Immunohistochemistry showed that E3Histone /LASU1 was predominantly expressed in nuclei from spermatogonia to mid-pachytene cells, but not detectable in spermatids. Histones are also ubiquitinated in spermatocytes. E3Histone/LASU1 was widely expressed in different mouse tissues. It was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm in most tissues, except in neurons of the brain and in early germ cells of the testis where it was expressed in the nucleus. In most tissues, E3Histone/LASU1 was expressed in epithelia. The wide expression of E3Histone/LASU1 suggests the existence of substrates of this E3 other than histones. Indeed, our assays showed that in vitro purified E3Histone stimulates polyubiquitination of Mcl-1, a BH3 region containing antiapoptotic protein. E3Histone may therefore regulate cell apoptosis by mediating degradation of Mcl-1. Since E3Histone/LASU1 was found previously to affect gene transcription and histone monoubiquitination is known to regulate gene transcription, we also evaluated the role of E3 Histone/LASU1 in histone ubiquitination in somatic cells. Depletion of E3Histone/LASU1 protein by siRNA did not affect the levels of free or ubiquitinated histories. In summary, E3Histone /LASU1 is a novel multi-functional protein that may mediate histone ubiquitination during meiosis and may be involved in apoptosis by triggering Mcl-1 degradation. Its wide expression and large non-catalytic region indicate that there are likely many other substrates of E3Histone/LASU1.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612s82w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz76c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A794082291"><dcterms:title>Identificaton of protein binding sites involved in AChR localization at the developing neuromuscular junction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Young il Matthew, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the developing vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synaptic localization of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is regulated by a motoneuron-derived factor called agrin, and also requires an intracellular scaffolding protein called rapsyn. Rapsyn is thought to bind and cluster the AChR in the postsynaptic membrane; however, it is unclear where rapsyn binds on the AChR and if other proteins also contribute to receptor localization. To define the protein interactions that localize the AChR at the synapse, we utilized chimeric proteins consisting of CD4 fused to each of the AChR subunit large intracellular loops. First, by expressing the CD4-loop chimeras in cultured myotubes, we identify a motif in the beta subunit loop that is sufficient for agrin-induced clustering. Agrin induced rapid phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine (Y390) in this motif and mutation of this site abolished clustering. Moreover, overexpression of the beta-subunit motif inhibited agrin-induced clustering of the endogenous AChR. Next, by co-expressing rapsyn and the CD4-loop chimeras in heterologous cells, we show that rapsyn clusters and cytoskeletally anchors the large intracellular loop of the AChR alpha, beta and ε subunits. This interaction was mediated by rapsyn binding to an alpha-helical domain conserved between the subunit loops, and occurred independent of agrin signaling in cultured myotubes. These findings suggest that at least two distinct interactions contribute to AChR localization at the NMJ: (constitutive) rapsyn binding to the alpha-helix of one or more subunit loops, and regulated binding of an additional protein to the beta-subunit motif. As the second interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, it likely serves as an important regulatory step in the agrin signaling pathway localizing the AChR at the synapse. In addition to its structural role, rapsyn is required for agrin-induced phosphorylation of the AChR. By expressing a series of rapsyn deletion mutants together with MuSK and AChR in heterologous cells, we find that deletion of just the rapsyn RING domain abolishes MUSK-induced AChR phosphorylation. Moreover, we find that the rapsyn C-terminal region is both necessary and sufficient for tyrosine kinase activation. Together, these findings suggest that rapsyn facilitates AChR phosphorylation by activating tyrosine kinases via its C-terminal domains.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d4066.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/794082291</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50h158b"><dcterms:title>Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms in asthma and their molecular mechanics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Léguillette, Renaud.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two smooth muscle (SM) myosin heavy chain isoforms, generated by alternative mRNA splicing, differ by the presence (SM-B) or absence (SM-A) of a 7 amino acid insert in the motor domain. The rate of actin filament propulsion (nu max) of SM-B, as measured in the in vitro motility assay, is 2-fold greater than that of SM-A. I investigated the expression and function of these isoforms in healthy SM and in asthma. First, I determined the sequence of the SM-B isoform in human SM and quantified its expression at the mRNA and protein levels in several human organs. The SM-B isoform was mostly expressed in rapidly contracting phasic SM. I then purified myosin from multiple rat organs and found a rank correlation between SM-B content and numax. I then quantified the expression of SM-B and several other contractile protein genes in endobronchial biopsies from normal and asthmatic subjects. SM-B, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which is responsible for myosin activation, and transgelin, a ubiquitously expressed actin binding protein but whose function is unknown, were overexpressed in the asthmatic biopsies. The increased SM-B expression and myosin activation, due to the increased MLCK expression, both contribute to the increased rate of shortening of the asthmatic airway SM. In addition, I showed that beyond its enzymatic effects, MLCK mechanically enhances numax. The binding of SM22 to actin, however, did not alter numax. Finally, I addressed the mechanisms behind the unique capacity of SM to maintain force at low energy cost, namely the latch-state. This property is mostly observed in SM-A containing, tonic muscle. Using a laser trap, I measured the binding force of unphosphorylated (non-active) SM-A and SM-B myosin isoforms and found that they can both attach to actin and maintain force. I also measured numax at different MgADP concentrations and found that SM-A has a greater affinity for MgADP. Because MgADP must be released before myosin can detach from actin, these results suggest that the SMA isoform remains attached longer to actin, allowing it to get into the latch-state. These findings explain the greater propensity of tonic muscle to get into the latch-state.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk787.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50h158b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abc386p736"><dcterms:title>Studies of interleukin-9 receptor expression and function on human tonsillar B cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fawaz, Lama Mustapha.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Interleukin-(IL)-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by activated Th2 cells. Interleukin-9 and the α-chain of the IL-9 receptor (IL-9Rα) have been shown to affect the differentiation pathway of various cell types including human T cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, all key players in allergic inflammation. However, there is little information regarding the differentiation effect of IL-9 on B cells. Specifically, there are no reports describing the expression of the IL-9Rα on human B lymphocytes. To gain a better understanding of the effect of IL-9 on human B lymphocytes and its role in the B-Th immune synapse in the germinal center, we sought to determine the expression of the IL9Rα on human tonsillar B cells. This allows us to study the expression of the IL-9Rα on B cells at different stages of their antigen-driven maturation, in the context of B-T cell interactions. Human tonsillar B cells were fractionated, using a discontinuous Percoll density gradient, into three populations representing different stages of B lymphocyte maturation: low density (LD) (recovered in the 30-50% Percoll fraction), which represents follicular mantle (FM) B cells and germinal center (GC) B cells, medium density (MD) (50-60%), which are primarily centroblasts and centrocytes, and high density (HD) (&gt;60%) or more mature B cells. We have determined the expression of the IL-9Rα chain by immunocytochemistry, FACS analysis and immunohistochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed on fresh1y isolated purified human tonsillar B cells using a monoclonal antibody to the α chain of the IL-9R. This clearly demonstrated the presence of the IL9Rα protein on tonsillar B cells. Using FACS analysis, unfractionated as well as fractionated B cells showed positive immunoreactivity. However, IL-9Rα expression was predominantly higher in the LD fraction of the B cells (39%), as compared to the MD (22%), and HD fractions (16%). These findings prompted us to further investigate the precise localization of the IL-9Rα positive B cells within the germinal centers. For this purpose, immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of human tonsils. Using double staining with anti-IL-9Rα and anti-CD20 (Alkaline Phosphatase anti-Alkaline Phosphatase APAAP) as well as with anti-IL-9Rα and anti-CD19 (immunofluorescence), we found that CD20+/CD19+ B cells within the secondary lymphoid follicles, and especially cells on the edge of these follicles, displayed IL-9Rα. Furthermore, analysis of CD38 and IgD expression on IL-9Rα positive cells by three color flow cytometry showed that IL-9Rα was expressed on FM B cells (CD38-IgD+) and GC cells (CD38+Igb+). Upregulation of phosphotyrosine levels in LD cells stimulated with IL-9 as well as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting and flow cytometry respectively. The results show a specific upregulation of STAT-5 and STAT3 phosphorylation in LD cells and not in total B cells, MD or HD cells. In order to better define the effect of IL-9 on follicular B cells, we hypothesized that IL-9 played a role in the B-Th immune synapse in GC by promoting germinal center isotype switching, and affecting IgE production consequently. In order to directly assess the effect of IL-9 on IgE production, LD cells, which are germinal center cells expressing the highest level of IL9Rα in our analysis, were stimulated with an antibody to CD40 and IL-9 in the presence or absence of IL-4 and IgE production was measured by ELISA. Although IL-9 was unable to induce IgE secretion by itself, it potentiated IgE production mediated by IL-4. This suggests a synergistic role for IL-9 with IL-4 in modulating IgE production and B cell differentiation. This was accompanied by an upregulation of IL-9R and CD27 expression on LD cells throughout the culture period specifically following CD40 and IL-4 stimulation. No further increase in expression levels was observed in the presence of IL-9. Furthermore, CD27 upregulation occurs almost entirely on IL-9R positive cells, pointing to an important role for IL-9 downstream of CD40 and IL-4 signaling in B cell differentiation. The observed increase in IgE production was not due to an increase in cell number as IL-9 was not able to potentiate IgM-activated LD B cell proliferation, nor anti-CD40-activated LD B cell proliferation. Moreover, no synergistic effect for IL-9 on IL-4 induced LD B cell proliferation was observed. However, IL-9 protected LD B cells from Fas-induced apoptosis, suggesting an important role for IL-9 in B cell survival. In summary, IL-9 synergizes with IL-4 to augment IgE production in LD cells, it does so by enhancing cell survival rather than by increasing cell number. These data show for the first time that a functional IL-9Rα chain is expressed on human follicular germinal center B cells. Taken together, our studies establish a new understanding for the role of IL-4, a cytokine linked to increased susceptibility to allergy and asthma, in B cell maturation and IgE production.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wv78n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386p736</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rt100"><dcterms:title>The effect of activin/TGF [beta] signaling in mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cocolakis, Eftihia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Activin and TGFbeta, members of the TGFbeta superfamily, are pluripotent cytokines that are expressed in virtually every cell of the body. These factors play diverse roles in the body such as regulating early development of the embryo, differentiation, extracellular matrix formation, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and immune functions. TGFbeta superfamily signaling is transduced by heteromeric serine/threonine kinase receptors at the cell surface and the intracellular mediator, the Smad complex. Following activation of the receptors, there is recruitment and phosphorylation the Smads. As a result the Smad proteins accumulate in the nucleus, bind co-activators or repressors and elicit or suppress transcription of target genes. To date, the molecular signaling mechanisms for activin/TGFbeta in mammary gland growth and differentiation have not been fully elucidated. Our data identify a novel regulatory crosstalk mechanism by which activin/TGFbeta induced Smad signaling acts to antagonize Stat5 transactivation in mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate an inhibitory effect of activin/TGFbeta on milk protein expression, specifically betacasein. We further show that activin/TGFbeta inhibitory effect upon betacasein expression is not due to changes in either Stat5 phosphorylation, translocation to the nucleus or binding on the Stat5 response element. We finally demonstrate that the Smads are required to block Stat5 transactivation by activin/TGFbeta and show that they are important mediators in activin/TGFbeta inhibitory response upon Stat5 target gene expression, in particular betacasein and cyclin D1. Finally, we unveil the mechanism by which these two signaling cascades antagonize their effects and find that activated Smads inhibit Stat5 association with its co-activator CBP, thus blocking Stat5 transactivation of its target genes. Thus, we define a novel crosstalk mechanism between two divergent signaling pathways that are involved in regulating mammary gland growth and differentiation. Whereas the role of TGFbeta signaling in breast cancer has been well characterized, we sought out to study the role and mechanism of action of activin in the human breast cancer T47D cells. We found that activin treatment of T47D cells leads to a potent inhibition of cell growth. We further show that activin induces the Smad, the p38-mitogen activated kinase pathways and the p38 downstream target ATF2. Finally, using specific inhibitors to block p38 MAPK, activin-mediated cell growth inhibition is completely abolished. Together, these results define a novel signaling mechanism induced by activin in breast cancer cells. Finally in an attempt to identify genes regulated by activin in breast cancer cells, we discover the death adaptor molecule RAIDD as a novel target of activin signaling. We show that RAIDD mRNA and protein levels are potently upregulated by activin. Using antisense-oligos directed against RAIDD, we show that RAIDD expression is necessary in mediating activin inhibition in breast cancer cells. Hence, we define the involvement of a new player in activin mediated cell growth inhibition. Collectively, these studies reveal novel mechanisms of the activin/TGFbeta signaling cascade in normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4308922.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rt100</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qv11x"><dcterms:title>Differential antigen expression among strains of Bacille Calmette-Guérin</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Charlet, Danielle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) strains are live attenuated vaccines. These strains are genetically heterogeneous and the accumulation of deletions and mutations, particularly those affecting regulatory and antigenic proteins, has been proposed to have contributed to overly-attenuated vaccines. To examine this possibility, the effects of the two mutations incurred by BCG vaccines was formally studied through gene-deletion and complementation studies. First, the effect of deletion of the RD2 region was examined by over-expressing the antigenic protein MPB64 in a late strain of BCG and by creating an RD2-knockout strain in M. tuberculosis. These two approaches revealed minimal changes attributable to the RD2 region, but stimulated further investigation for other differences contemporaneous with the loss of RD2. By examining differences in gene expression between RD2+ and RD2- strains of BCG, two regions, in addition to the RD2 region itself, that were significantly down-regulated in the latter strains were identified. One region contained genes encoding the highly antigenic proteins MPB70 and MPB83, and the second region contained the gene encoding the extracellular function (ECF) sigma factor, sigK. Sequencing of sigK across all BCG strains revealed a start codon single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in strains with low production of MPB70 and MPB83. Complementation of BCG Pasteur with wild-type sigK resulted in up-regulation of mpb70/mpb83 and increased production of MPB70 and MPB83 proteins. Further studies revealed that the in vitro growth rate of BCG Pasteur::sigK was slower than that of BCG Pasteur::pMV306 and that cytotoxicity to macrophage-like THP-1 cells was greater following infection with BCG Pasteur::sigK than with BCG Pasteur::pMV306. Infection of C57BU6J mice demonstrated differences between BCG Pasteur::sigK and BCG Pasteur::pMV306 in initial deposition, growth rates and persistence. Vaccination of C57BU6J mice with BCG Pasteur::sigK stimulated an MPB70-specific immune response, indicating that restored protein production resulted in increased immunogenicity. Finally, in challenge experiments, mice vaccinated with BCG Pasteur::sigK demonstrated equal, or slightly greater, protection than vaccination with BCG Pasteur::pMV306 against subsequent challenge with M. tuberculosis. Together, these findings provide an explanation for the loss of MPB70 and MPB83 production by BCG vaccines during prolonged in vitro passaging, and provide the oasis for further studies aimed at understanding the role of the sigK-mpb70 regulon in tuberculosis pathogenesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qr28q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qv11x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214t390"><dcterms:title>The impact of the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide on rat spermiogenic chromatin remodeling /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Codrington, Alexis.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Male reproductive health is of growing concern, as male toxicant exposure can affect progeny outcome; sperm chromatin structure integrity may be a contributing factor. The formation of mature sperm involves the expression of numerous proteins involved in organizing and packaging the chromatin in a specific manner; this ensures transmission and participation of the paternal genome in embryogenesis. Exposure of male rats to cyclophosphamide as spermatid chromatin is remodeled has an adverse effect on embryo development. The hypothesis of this thesis is that cyclophosphamide exposure causes genetic damage and alters the sperm proteome, thus disrupting components of chromatin condensation and organization during spermiogenesis. The first objective was to assess the phase specificity of the susceptibility of spermiogenic germ cells to cyclophosphamide-induced DNA damage. Spermatozoa were analyzed for DNA strand breaks using the comet assay. Cyclophosphamide-induced DNA damage was dose-related and accumulated over time. Germ cell phase-specific damage was maximal during midspermiogenesis; this reflects an increased susceptibility of step 9-14 spermatids at a key point in sperm chromatin remodeling, the histone-protamine exchange. The second objective was to examine the sperm chromatin structure and basic proteome. Multiple assays demonstrated that the effects of cyclophosphamide on sperm chromatin structure were also germ cell-phase specific; midspermiogenic spermatids were most sensitive. Sperm were less condensed with reduced total thiol and protamine contents. The sperm basic proteome was also altered; identified proteins are involved in a variety of spermiogenic and fertilization events. The nuclear matrix organizes chromatin into loop domains, and various components of somatic cell matrices are targets for chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore the last objective of this study was to assess the effect of cyclophosphamide exposure on the protein profile of the sperm nuclear matrix. The expression of several nuclear matrix protein components, a number of which were identified for the first time, was altered following drug exposure. Together these results show that cyclophosphamide alters male germ cell chromatin remodeling at both the DNA and protein level; this could alter sperm function and thus explain the adverse effects on early embryo development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cz46s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214t390</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hf02m"><dcterms:title>Thermal and rheological properties of batter systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Xue, Jun, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Batters are highly complex systems with wide ranging ingredients including flours, water, flavorings, and spices. Interactions between the ingredients determine the performance of batters and the final quality of coated products. Addition of hydrocolloids into batters of different types of flour provides special effects on batter performance. The functionalities of hydrocolloids-flour mixtures in terms of the thermal and rheological properties of the resulting batter systems were investigated in this study. The rheological properties of the batter were determined using a strain/stress control rheometer. A steady state method was used to measure the viscosity as a function of the shear rate varying from 0.5 to 150 s-1 at 15°C. The resulting data was then fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley Model. The viscoelastic properties were monitored as a function of temperature and were determined using a dynamic oscillatory test. Two different temperature profiles were used to simulate cooking and storage processes. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine thermal properties (namely glass transition temperature, gelatinization temperature, ice melting temperature, and enthalpy) and to describe the phase transitions that occur during heating and cooling processes. The rheological and thermal properties varied for different types of flours and their combination ratios, as well as different types of hydrocolloids at different concentrations. The replacement of corn flour greatly altered the viscosity and viscoelastic properties of wheat based and rice based batter systems. Using 100% corn flour based batter showed highest yield stress, whereas 100% rice flour based batter did not show any yield stress. Higher temperatures and longer times were required to gelatinize starch at the higher levels of rice flour for each batter system flour mix combination. The various combination ratios of the flours apparently did not significant influence the gelatinization temperatures of the batter systems. However they significantly influence the total enthalpies (DeltaHG) of the various samples. Wheat flour based batters showed the lowest glass transition temperatures. Thermal properties of wheat-based batters were influenced by the replacement of wheat with rice or corn flours. Corn flour based batters required considerably more energy for gelatinization during the cooking process. Hydrocolloids lowered flow behavior index (n) and increased the consistency index (k) of all batters. The gums also changed the onset temperature of structure development and the storage and loss moduli of the batter systems. Hydrocolloids greatly influenced the thermal properties of batter systems. The gums shifted gelatinization temperature and depressed glass transition temperature of resulting batter systems. Further, MC increased the melting temperature (Tm) for the test batter systems as compared with the values for the control system without methylcellulose (MC). Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) did not show statistically significant effects on the total enthalpies of ice melting for all samples. However, MC and CMC showed more pronounced effects on rice, corn, and their combined flour based batters than it did on wheat flour based batters. However, this characteristic does not show in batter systems containing xanthan gum.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053m53t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf02m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hydrocolloids.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Batters (Food)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breading.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53x110x"><dcterms:title>Primary effusion lymphoma : disruption of the B cell transcriptional program and overexpression of inflammatory molecules</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Arguello, Meztli.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) is a lymphoproliferative disease of B cell origin associated with HHV-8 infection and characterized by migration of tumor cells to serous body cavities. PEL cells originate from post-germinal center B cells yet harbor a non-B, non-T phenotype, a characteristic that has not been fully explained. In the present study we demonstrate that PEL cells have an impaired expression of B cell-specific transcription factors and this results in a decreased activity of promoters regulating essential B cell genes. PEL cells lack PU.1 expression, although its transcription partner IRF-4 is highly upregulated, leading to decreased activity of the immunoglobulin lambda and kappa light chain ETS-IRF enhancers. Expression of the B cell specific transcription factor Oct-2 and the B cell specific co-activator of octamer factors (Bob-1), which are known to regulate PU.1 expression, was also impaired. Ectopic expression of Oct-2 was able to fully restore PU.1 promoter activity in the PEL cell line BCBL-1, while PU.1 expression also reconstituted the activation of the lambdaB Ets-IRF site. In addition, protein levels of BSAP/Pax-5 and IRF-8/ICSBP were undetectable in PEL cells. The pattern of transcription factor ablation observed in PEL was found to be comparable to that observed in classical Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines, which also lack B cell specific surface markers. Comparative analysis of gene expression by cDNA microarray of BCBL-1 cells (PEL), L-428 (cHD) and BJAB cells revealed a subset of genes that were differentially expressed in PEL cells. Among these, four genes involved in cell migration and chemotaxis were strongly upregulated in PEL cells: LTA4H, IL-16, TSP-1, and selectin-P ligand. Upregulation of LTA4H was investigated at the transcriptional level. The LTA4H promoter exhibited 50% higher activity in BCBL-1 cells than in BJAB or L-428 cells. Deletion analysis of the LTA4H promoter revealed a positive cis regulatory element active only in BCBL-1 cells in the promoter proximal region located between -76 to -40 bp. Formation of a specific DNA-protein complex in this region was confirmed by Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA). Co-culture of BCBL-1 cells with ionophore-stimulated primary neutrophils lead to an increased production of LTB4 by transcellular biosynthesis compared to L-428 cells, demonstrating the functional significance of LTA4H upregulation. BCBL-1 cells also demonstrated increased migration even in the absence of chemotactic stimulus compared to L-428 cells. These observations indicate that (1) disruption of the B-cell specific transcriptional program is likely to contribute to the incomplete B cell phenotype characteristic of PEL cells and (2) upregulation of factors involved in cell migration and chemotaxis constitute a unique characteristic of PEL cells that may contribute to the localization of this lymphoma to serous body cavities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gq108.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53x110x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Virology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n737b"><dcterms:title>Reciprocal regulation of DNA binding of the paired domain and homedomain of Pax3</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Apuzzo, Sergio.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pax3 is a gene that encodes for a transcription factor involved in embryogenesis. Pax3 heterozygote mutants in mice (Splotch) and humans (Waardenburg Syndrome) exhibit pigmentary disturbances. Also, neural tube defects (spina bifida) develop in homozygous splotch mice. Pax3 has 2 DNA binding domains, a paired Domain (PD), and a paired-type homeodomain (HD). We have used site-specific modification of single Cys Pax3 mutants (in a Cys-less backbone) to probe structure: function relationships. N-Ethyl maleimide (NEM) modification of a single Cys in the PD (C82) abrogates DNA binding by the PD but also by the HD. Likewise, NEM modification of V263C in the HD abrogates DNA binding by both the HD and the PD. These results demonstrate that the PD and HD do not function as independent DNA binding modules in Pax3, but are functionally interdependent. Pax3 was also modified by insertion of Factor Xa protease sites in either the PD (Xa100) or the HD (Xa216). The effect of DNA binding by the PD and HD on conformational changes in the other domain was monitored by accessibility of the Factor Xa site. Binding by the PD causes a structural change not only in the PD but also in the HD; similarly, DNA binding by the HD causes a conformational change in the PD. These results provide a structural basis for the functional interdependence of the PD and HD in Pax3. Site-specific modification of single Cys mutants was further used to identify a cluster of solvent exposed residues in the beta-hairpin structure and in the first 2 helices of the PD, which when modified (with NEM) impair DNA binding by the HD. Three-dimensional modeling shows that these residues form a hydrophobic pocket possibly defining the site of interaction of the HD. Pax3 double cysteine mutants were also generated and used with bifunctional cysteine specific reagents to monitor proximity relationships in Pax3. We have observed that cysteines placed in the N-terminal portion of the HD can be crosslinked with cysteines placed in the putative HD interaction pocket in the PD, suggesting proximity of the two segments. Taken together, these results suggest that residues in or close to the PD helix 2 and those in or close to the N-terminal arm of the HD undergo direct physical interaction, which we postulate is responsible of the functional interdependence we observe between the PD and HD of Pax3.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712mc062.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n737b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290f765"><dcterms:title>Investigation of photomechanical surface patterning in azobenzene materials</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yager, Kevin G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Detailed modeling and experiments were conducted in order to elucidate the nature of photo-induced surface patterning in azobenzene materials. Using a cellular automaton simulation, it was established that both the absolute temperature rise, and the thermal gradient, in a film during patterning are negligibly small. These results, confirmed experimentally by patterning samples on substrates of differing thermal conductivity, eliminate purely thermal mechanisms as candidate explanations for mass transport. The length-scale of patterning was probed by monitoring the formation and thermal erasure of gratings as a function of film thickness. In both cases, film dynamics deviate from bulk behavior when film thickness decreases below ~150 nm. Moreover, mass transport is completely hindered below 40 nm. This deviation of polymer dynamics implies that photo-induced mass transport involves the coordinated motion of many polymer chains in the depth of the material, and not merely surface diffusion of individual chains. Neutron reflectometry was applied to measure in detail the photomechanical response of azobenzene materials. A significant photo-expansion effect, up to 17%, was observed at 25°C, attributed to the molecular free volume requirement of azo isomerization. Above a well-defined crossover temperature, which occurs at ~50°C for poly(disperse red 1 acrylate), the material response is inverted. At these elevated temperatures, photo-contraction effects, of more than -15%, were instead measured. In this case the combination of photo-induced motion and thermally-enabled mobility enables aggregation, aromatic stacking, and crystallization of the azobenzene dipoles. Using localized surface patterning experiments, it was confirmed that the mass transport phenomenon exhibits the same trend and phase relationship as the photomechanical effect. It is argued that the fundamental origin of surface mass transport in azo materials is in fact this newly identified photomechanical effect. This suggestion enables explanation of a variety of previously contradictory results in the literature.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dr329.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290f765</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Physical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712mc07b"><dcterms:title>Simulation of odour dispersion around natural windbreaks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lin, Xing Jun, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The research objective was to calibrate a model to simulate odour dispersion downwind from natural windbreaks and then, use this model to observe the effect of windbreak characteristics and climatic conditions on the size of the odour dispersion plume. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models were used for the simulations because of their capability in reproducing turbulent wind conditions. The model was initially calibrated to ensure the proper velocity recovery ratio (VRR), and then to reproduce odour plumes measured in the field by three groups of four panellists. The visual and statistical analysis of the field panellist observations indicated that a windbreak with an optical porosity of 0.35 could reduce by 21% the length of the odour dispersion plume, as compared to a site without a windbreak. Also, these analyses indicated that the site with a windbreak offering an optical porosity of 0.55 had no significant impact on the length of the odour plume, as compared to the site without a windbreak. The models selected for the simulations were the Fluent 6.2 standard k-epsilon and SST k-o models. Their odour dispersion calibration indicated that both models can accurately reproduce the field measured odour hedonic tone and odour concentration by transforming the odour mass fraction computed by the models into the hedonic tone with a power function, and then into the odour concentration with an exponential function. The correlations between the simulated and measured absolute HT and between the simulated and measured odour concentrations were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). However, the SST k-o was preferred over the standard k-epsilon because it could physically better reproduce the high turbulence conditions created by the windbreak. The SST k-o model simulations indicated that odour plume length was mostly affected by windbreak porosity and height, as well as distance from the source. In terms of climatic conditions, odour plume size was mostly affected for atmospheric stability conditions which generally established ambient wind speed and rate of change of temperature. Wind direction has an impact on the length of the odour plume and the formation of a fin intensifying odour concentration near the windbreak, where an angle of 45º produces the shortest odour plume and the largest fin.

The bilaterally paired Ascending Neurons 1 and 2 (AN1 and AN2) of crickets receive inputs from the auditory receptors on one side and carry the information to the brain. We used stimuli with either conspecific-like or predator-like (i.e. bats) carrier frequency to quantify the accuracy with which the interneurons code the information contained within the amplitude modulation (AM) envelope of the stimulus. AN1, which is tuned to the dominant carrier frequency of cricket songs, selectively codes the limited range of amplitude-modulation frequencies that occur in these signals. AN2, which is most sensitive to ultrasound, serves as a "bat-detector" and codes a broader range of AM frequencies, as occur in bat calls. A striking characteristic in AN2's responses to ultrasound is the presence of bursts of high-frequency spiking separated by relatively sparse spikes. We examined the relative importance of isolated spikes and bursts in the processing of ultrasound. We showed that bursts reliably signal the occurrence of salient amplitude increases. Furthermore, we showed that burst, but not isolated spikes, reliably predict behavioural responses. We suggest AN2 encodes behaviourally important information with bursts. The Omega Neuron 1 (ON1) responds to conspecific signals and to the ultrasonic echolocation sounds. ON1's temporal coding properties vary with carrier frequency, allowing it to encode both of these behaviourally important signals. Furthermore, the temporal coding properties of ON1 in response to cricket-like sound and bat-like sound match those of AN1 and AN2 respectively. ON1 is a source of contralateral inhibition to AN1 and AN2, enhancing binaural contrast and facilitating sound localization. We used dichotic stimulation to examine the importance of the temporal structure of contralateral inhibition for enhancing binaural contrast. Contralateral inhibition degrades the accuracy with which amplitude modulation is encoded by AN 1 and AN2, but only if the temporal pattern of inhibitory input matches that of excitation. Our results show that the CF-specific coding properties of ON1 allow this single neuron to enhance localization cues most effectively for both cricket-like and bat-like acoustic signals.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fn34d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720j03q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auditory pathways.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oceanic field cricket.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33s162b"><dcterms:title>Sequence and gene expression variability in cultivars of oat (Avena sativa L.)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lÿbaert, Anissa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many traits of economic importance in crop plants are quantitative, complicating the selection for desirable characteristics. Recent studies suggest a complex relationship between genotype and phenotype, with genetic variability often appearing as differences in gene expression rather than structural changes in proteins. In oat (Avena sativa L.), lipid and protein content are economically important traits. In the first of four studies reported here, partial sequences for eight genes involved in lipid or protein biosynthesis were obtained from ten oat cultivars with varying lipid and protein content. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences clustered into families possibly corresponding to homeologous genes. Some cultivar- and family-specific polymorphisms were identified. In the second study, we surveyed differential gene expression between developing kernels of cultivars Kanota and Ogle by constructing reciprocal subtractive libraries. Of the 195 contig sequences obtained, only a minority had homology to characterized sequences. Grouping these sequences in categories based on gene ontology of their BLAST hits showed different profiles of expression for each cultivar. In the third study, we tested a method for transforming macroarray data consisting of dividing spot signal by the median array background. This reduced variation due to array exposure time. In the fourth study, gene expression levels were considered as quantitative traits in the Kanota x Ogle mapping population. Macroarrays featuring oat clones differentially expressed between both parents were hybridized with cDNA from the population lines. Among the 33 significant expression quantitative trait loci detected, most clustered to linkage group 29--43, a possible "hot-spot" of gene expression regulation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf80d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s162b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Oats -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pf75s"><dcterms:title>STACEE observations of BL Lac objects</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lindner, Thomas, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>STACEE is an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope that was built to detect gamma-rays of cosmic origin.

The research included 3 studies: (a) study of the kinetics and mechanism of CaSO4 dehydrate (DH) conversion to hemihydrate (HH) and anhydrite (AH) in variable composition CaCl2 -HCl media; (b) reactive crystallization of alpha-hemihydrate in a semi-batch reactor configuration following the LaMer Diagram concept; and (c) the study of crystal growth and metal uptake by seeded crystallization with and without the presence of several metal chloride salts. According to the first study, AH is the only stable phase in the range of electrolyte concentration and temperature investigated with DH and HH being either metastable or unstable. In the absence of CaCl2 and at 3M HCl concentration or higher DH converts directly to AH. Maintenance of 0.3M or higher CaCl2 concentration was found to render hemihydrate metastable hence making its production feasible. Solubility estimation of three CaSO4 phases with the aid of OLI Stream Analyser software helped to explain the observed phase transition sequence. SEM characterization further revealed the transition from DH to HH to be governed by the topochemical mechanism. In the reactive crystallization study H2SO4 was the limiting reactant added to the CaCl2 solution up to 0.8 SO 4/Ca molar ratio. The nucleation and growth stages were successfully separated via supersaturation control achieved by regulated addition of the limiting reactant in multiple steps. This separation permitted the growth of the homogeneously nucleated crystals within the metastable zone to needle-shaped hexagonal crystals (acicular habit). Upon recycling (seeding) of the product further growth was achieved, producing crystals with 80 mum - volume based mean crystal diameter- or 100-120 mum length and 10-15 mum diameter. Growth of the seed crystals appeared to follow an agglomeration mechanism. However, in the presence of foreign metal cations (in particular divalent, Mg 2+, Fe2+, Ni2+ and trivalent, Al 3+, Fe3+) crystal growth was severely retarded via their apparent adsorption. Some of the metal cations, namely Na+, Ni2+, Al3+ were found to incorporate into the hemihydrate crystal structure to a variable extent from 0.3g/t for Na to 7g/t for Ni and 11g/t for Al. The chloride uptake was less than 10 ppm.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579x61h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qp015</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jz62j"><dcterms:title>Concentration-dependent effects of waterborne zinc on the interactions between Gyrodactylus turnbulli (Monogenea) and the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gheorghiu, Cristina.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research investigated the effects of waterborne zinc (Zn) on the interactions between guppies, Poecilia reticulata (Peters), and Gyrodactylus turnbulli Harris, 1986, a monogenean parasite of its skin and fins. The first objective was to determine if sublethal concentrations of waterborne Zn (up to 240 mug/L added to artificial freshwater) exerted a concentration-dependent effect on the population dynamics of Gyrodactylus on isolated guppies. Whereas survival of uninfected fish was unaffected, mortality of infected fish increased linearly with increasing Zn concentration. In addition, the improved parasite population growth at concentrations up to 120 mug Zn/I suggested either that the elevated Zn promotes survival and/or reproduction of the parasite, or impairs host defense mechanisms. Analysis of lifetime survival and reproduction of individual parasites on and off the fish revealed Zn toxicity to the parasite as survival of detached parasites decreased linearly with increasing Zn concentration and parasite survival on the host was also lower at the highest Zn concentrations. Also, all morphological parameters decreased linearly in response both to increasing concentration and duration of exposure to waterborne Zn. The guppy epidermis responded rapidly to both infection and waterborne Zn, and the cumulative effects of these combined stressors were synergistic for epidermal thickness and mucous cell numbers, but antagonistic in terms of mucin composition. Both Zn and infection induced mucous production, but at elevated Zn concentrations and/or at high parasite burdens, the capacity for continued mucous production was apparently exceeded. I hypothesize that this condition is favorable for parasite survival because of the impaired host response; but unfavorable for host survival because of the high numbers of pathogenic parasites and the inability to control entry of Zn into host tissues. In conclusion, sublethal concentrations of waterborne Zn are more detrimental to the infected host than to the parasite.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hp58s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jz62j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Monopisthocotylea -- Effect of water pollution on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zinc -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guppies -- Effect of water pollution on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guppies -- Parasites.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d408r"><dcterms:title>Techniques for the analysis of event timings and strengths</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fok, Carlotta Ching Ting, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Event response data that record the timings of randomly occurred events and the strengths of these events are becoming increasingly important in psychology. Although previous researchers such as Kass et al. and Rathbun et al. have developed techniques to model event timings, and that there are social science literature for modeling event times, few researchers have developed techniques to model the event times as well as the strengths of the events. Thus, the present thesis describes a new model that incorporates the use of functional data analysis to estimate a joint occurrence of event intensity, or the instantaneous rate of occurrence, as well as the strengths of the events. The compound log-likelihood model, which is derived by the sum of the event and the response log-likelihood functions, estimates the intensity function and the smoothed function for the response variable simultaneously. In this thesis, we will discuss the incorporation of covariates into the model, and we will also discuss in detail the positive bounded model, which imposes a constraint to the upper bound of the intensity function, as well as the positive model, where no such constraint is imposed. The model is applied to a set of lupus data that involve the medical histories of 300 lupus sufferers over 20 years to examine the flare intensity and severity of lupus symptoms of each patient. Results of patients 15 and 148 are discussed in this thesis, which reveal that there might be some linear relationship between the patients' intensity rate and the severity of their flares. Finally, the extent to which the maximum likelihood estimation for the model is accurate is tested using simulated data. Results from the simulation show that the model requires a large sample size for a precise estimate.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580r80h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d408r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Event history analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lupus.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784q62q"><dcterms:title>Roles of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala and fimbria-fornix in a spatial discrimination on the radial maze</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gaskin, Stephane.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of the dorsal hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala and fimbria fornix in spatial discrimination was investigated using temporary inactivation and lesioning methods.

In the first phase (pre-exposure) rats were given unreinforced pre-exposure trials in which they were free to move on two adjacent arms of the maze on three consecutive days. Rats were then alternately confined to the ends of the arms for eight days (training), one arm that contained food (Paired-arm) and one that did not (Unpaired-arm). The rats were then given a choice between the two arms with no food present. Only when given unreinforced pre-exposure trials did rats spend more time in the Paired-arm than in the Unpaired-arm, a CCP. Rats with muscimol induced inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus during unreinforced pre-exposure acquired a CCP for the Paired-arm but were impaired with hippocampal inactivation during training or testing. Inactivation of the entorhinal cortex resulted in impairment in all phases of the paradigm. Inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus in the Unpaired but not Paired-arm only resulted in impairment. The effects of dorsal hippocampus inactivation in either the Paired or Unpaired arms were reversed in rats with combined amygdala lesions\dorsal hippocampus inactivation. Rats with fimbria fornix\entorhinal cortex disconnections during pre-exposure were also impaired.

We found that copper catalysts were compatible in cross-coupling of a range of mild organometallic reagents, providing simple, efficient routes to alpha-substituted amides and amines. Chapter 2 of this thesis describes a new copper-catalyzed multicomponent synthesis of alpha-substituted amides. This reaction was developed based upon previous work in this laboratory, which showed that palladium catalysts were competent in Stille-type cross-coupling of imines, acid chlorides, and organostannanes. While providing a mild method of generating the amide products, a more general procedure able to incorporate a wider range of organostannanes was sought. This chapter details the development of a copper-catalyzed protocol, which, as well as performing the cross-coupling under mild reaction conditions, proceeds with a diverse range of aryl-, heteroaryl-, and vinyl-substituted organostannanes and employs an inexpensive and readily available catalyst. Through this system, control over regioselectivity of addition to alpha,beta-unsaturated imines is also possible. Chapter 3 demonstrates that, in addition to organostannanes, other substrates are viable in copper-catalyzed cross-coupling with imines and acid chlorides. Herein, the coupling of terminal alkynes with imines and acid chlorides is described, leading to an efficient synthesis of tertiary propargylamides directly from simple starting materials. This synthesis incorporates a wide variety of substituted imines, acid chlorides/chloroformates, and terminal alkynes, providing a rapid synthesis of these useful building blocks (reaction completion in only 15 minutes). In addition, the process is shown to work with aza-aromatic heterocycles, such as pyridine, where the alkynylation occurs exclusively at the 2-position. Chapter 4 describes the utility of these rapid multicomponent reactions, where the products are directly converted into oxazole heterocycles. Copper-catalyzed- and zinc-catalyzed protocols are developed for the synthesis of secondary propargylamides from silyl-imines, acid chlorides, and terminal alkynes. The secondary propargylamide products are then, in a one pot sequence, transformed into trisubstituted oxazoles. Chapter 5 describes the development of an atom-economical, non-toxic alternative to the organotin coupling described in Chapter 2. This involves the use of tri- and tetraorgano-indium reagents, which can transfer all of their organic groups in a copper-catalyzed coupling with imines and acid chlorides. This reaction shows good functional group compatibility and further expands the scope of alpha-substituted amides and N-protected amines that can be synthesized through mild copper catalysis. Chapter 6 explores the enantioselective alkynylation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. As described in Chapter 3, heterocycles such as pyridine can undergo copper-catalyzed 1,2-addition with terminal alkynes upon activation by chloroformates. As this process generates a stereocenter, it is possible to introduce enantio-control into the reactions by using a chiral copper catalyst. With ligands from the PINAP series, enantioselectivities of up to 84% can be induced in the coupling of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., quinoline), chloroformates, and terminal alkynes. This provides a mild and simple synthesis of chiral 2-alkynyl-1,2-dihydroquinolines directly from simple starting materials.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042z358.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d570170d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Imines.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Copper catalysts.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organic compounds -- Synthesis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s444r"><dcterms:title>Camera-independent learning and image quality assessment for super-resolution</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bégin, Isabelle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An increasing number of applications require high-resolution images in situations where the access to the sensor and the knowledge of its specifications are limited. In this thesis, the problem of blind super-resolution is addressed, here defined as the estimation of a high-resolution image from one or more low-resolution inputs, under the condition that the degradation model parameters are unknown. The assessment of super-resolved results, using objective measures of image quality, is also addressed. Learning-based methods have been successfully applied to the single frame super-resolution problem in the past. However, sensor characteristics such as the Point Spread Function (PSF) must often be known. In this thesis, a learning-based approach is adapted to work without the knowledge of the PSF thus making the framework camera-independent. However, the goal is not only to super-resolve an image under this limitation, but also to provide an estimation of the best PSF, consisting of a theoretical model with one unknown parameter. In particular, two extensions of a method performing belief propagation on a Markov Random Field are presented. The first method finds the best PSF parameter by performing a search for the minimum mean distance between training examples and patches from the input image. In the second method, the best PSF parameter and the super-resolution result are found simultaneously by providing a range of possible PSF parameters from which the super-resolution algorithm will choose from. For both methods, a first estimate is obtained through blind deconvolution and an uncertainty is calculated in order to restrict the search. Both camera-independent adaptations are compared and analyzed in various experiments, and a set of key parameters are varied to determine their effect on both the super-resolution and the PSF parameter recovery results. The use of quality measures is thus essential to quantify the improvements obtained from the algorithms. A set of measures is chosen that represents different aspects of image quality: the signal fidelity, the perceptual quality and the localization and scale of the edges. Results indicate that both methods improve similarity to the ground truth and can in general refine the initial PSF parameter estimate towards the true value. Furthermore, the similarity measure results show that the chosen learning-based framework consistently improves a measure designed for perceptual quality.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h5848.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s444r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Resolution (Optics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer vision.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hk79h"><dcterms:title>Estimating and modelling rates of evolution with applications to phylogenetics and codon selection</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bevan, Rachel Bronwen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis addresses two problems that have applications in evolution and phylogenetics: (i) estimating and accounting for evolutionary rate heterogeneity in a phylogenetic context (Chapters 2 and 3); (ii) detecting synonymous selection upon a set of codons (Chapter 4). Chapter 2 presents a fast algorithm (DistR) to estimate gene/protein evolutionary rates based on pairwise distances between pairs of taxa derived from gene/protein sequence data. Simulation studies indicate that this algorithm accurately estimates rates and is robust to missing data. Moreover, by including evolutionary rates estimated by the DistR algorithm as additional parameters into a phylogenetic model, a significantly improved fit over the concatenated model is obtained as measured by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). However, allowing every gene/protein to have its own evolutionary rate - termed the n-parameter approach - is only one method of accounting for gene rate heterogeneity in phylogenetic inference. Under the alpha-parameter approach, a Gamma distribution is fit to the gene rates in order to account for rate heterogeneity, a method that is much slower than the n-parameter approach. Comparison of the n-parameter to the alpha-parameter approaches (Chapter 3) indicates that the n-parameter method provides a better fit over the concatenated model than the alpha-parameter approach. Interestingly, improved model fit over the concatenated model is highly correlated with the presence of a gene that has a slow relative rate. Chapter 4 addresses the question of detecting synonymous selection on sets of codons using parametric codon models. Parametric codon models are used to simulate data under the null hypothesis that there is no synonymous selection on a particular codon; codons that have unexpected synonymous usage in empirical data, compared to the null distribution, are classified as Highly Selected Codons (HSCs). Two different data sets are analyzed to identify HSCs: nuclear genes of various Saccharomyces species that are well-known to undergo translational selection; mitochondrial genes of several Reclinomonas species that are highly A+T biased. Eleven Saccharomyces codons are determined to be under synonymous selection (HSCs). Nine of these codons were previously identified as undergoing translational selection. Similarly, 10 Reclinomonas codons are identified as undergoing synonymous selection. Comparison to traditional nonparametric approaches shows that these methods do not identify any Reclinomonas codons as under synonymous selection due to the high A+T bias of the genes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q121x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk79h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25xd76x"><dcterms:title>Covariates and length-biased sampling : is there more than meets the eye ?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bergeron, Pierre-Jérôme.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is well known that when subjects with a disease are identified through a cross-sectional survey and then followed forward in time until either failure or censoring, their estimated survival function of the true survival function from onset are biased. This bias, which is caused by the sampling of prevalent rather than incident cases, is termed length bias if the onset time of the disease forms a stationary Poisson process. While authors have proposed different approaches to the analysis of length-biased survival data, there remain a number of issues that have not been fully addressed. The most, important of these is perhaps that of how to include covariates into length-biased lifetime data analysis of the natural history of diseases, that are initiated by cross-sectional sampling of a population. One aspect of that problem, which appears to have been neglected in the literature, concerns the effect of length-bias on the sampling distribution of the covariates. If the covariates have an effect on the survival time, then their marginal distribution in a length-biased sample is also subject to a bias and is informative about the parameters of interest. As is conventional in most regression analyses one conditions on the observed covariate values. By conditioning on the observed covariates in the situation described above, however, one effectively ignores the information contained in the distribution of the covariates in the sample. We present the appropriate likelihood approach that takes into account this information and we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. It is shown that by ignoring the information contained in the sampling distribution of the covariates, one can still obtain, asymptotically, the same point estimates as with the joint likelihood. However, these conditional estimates are less efficient. Our results are illustrated using data on survival with dementia; collected as part of the Canadian Study of Health an Aging.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h385c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xd76x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akh04dt63g"><dcterms:title>Student teachers' understanding of inquiry instruction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Syer, Cassidy A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Curriculum reform emphasizes the importance of inquiry instruction for learners. For inquiry-oriented curriculum to occur, attention must be focused on teacher education. Using a mixed-methods design, I investigated if and how groups of student teachers who receive different types of exposure to inquiry differ in their understanding of inquiry instruction. Preservice teachers' descriptions of inquiry experiences in their teacher-preparation program contextualized the results. Considerable effort was given in the first phase of this study to establish the reliability and validity of the Strategic Demands of Inquiry questionnaire. Participants were from McGill University, Montreal, and included preservice teachers in the Bachelor of Education program, Continuing Education students enrolled in an inquiry-based course, and Honours Psychology students engaged in research. Data sources included the Strategic Demands of Inquiry questionnaire and an interview schedule. Groups who had different types of exposure to the inquiry approach varied in how they understand inquiry instruction. Fourth-year Elementary preservice teachers held more sophisticated conceptualizations of the inquiry approach and greater appreciation for the components involved in carrying out an inquiry curriculum compared to first-year Elementary preservice teachers. After the completion of an inquiry-oriented course, Continuing Education students (including experienced teachers) were similar to fourth-year Elementary student teachers in conceptualizing and identifying important components of inquiry instruction. First-year Elementary and Secondary student teachers were different in their views of inquiry instruction. Finally, Honours Psychology students, who were engaged in scholarly research, held sophisticated conceptualizations of the inquiry approach. However, they did not use this knowledge of the inquiry method as extensively as fourth-year preservice teachers to identify important aspects of inquiry instruction. Therefore, although experience with the inquiry method may be necessary for conceptualizing inquiry as a pedagogical approach, it is not sufficient to enable undergraduates to identify important aspects of planning, enacting, and evaluating an inquiry curriculum. These findings point to the importance of the Bachelor of Education program in advancing knowledge about inquiry instruction. Fourth-year student teachers reported experiences with the inquiry approach that influenced their understanding of this method. This study also provided evidence for the construct validity of the Strategic Demands of Inquiry questionnaire.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945w110.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt63g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teachers -- Training of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Active learning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b536z"><dcterms:title>Divine law of ribā and bay' : new critical theory</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Subhani, Azeemuddin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The notion of usury/interest, subsumed under the Arabic term riba and Hebraic neshekh/marbit, has been the center of human attention throughout recorded history, but only as an exclusive economic paradigm subject to toleration, limitation or prohibition. Yet, in a clearly disproportionate treatment, all pristine major world religions consider this "economic act" as the greatest of sins, which, in Islam, additionally attracts the most graphic other-worldly punishments at the extremes of the spectrum. Economic usurpation of greater severity, e.g., theft by stealth and robbery by force do not attract as severe a Scriptural punishment as does "interest-taking" by consent, clearly implying, both scripturally and linguistically, that this seemingly exclusive "economic act" is in fact a sin of greater theological proportions. Yet, casuistry and a non-philosophical approach have so far prevented the extant Judaic, Christian and Islamic scholarship from assessing the depth and breadth of the theology at stake here. Utilizing a semiotic methodology and a philosophical/theological approach, and drawing out the glaring deficiencies of the current scholarship, this work posits that the Arabic riba /Hebraic marbit (growth), by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic of intra-activity as against its binary opposite of inter-activity inherent in bay' (exchange), causes self-emanation, self-subsistence and ex-nihilo creation, which, being exclusive Divine attributes, not only render marbit/riba an act of idolatry/polytheism (Arabic: shirk), but also thereby extend it to all spheres of human action. This diagnosis not only harmonizes the severe ordained punishment with the gravity of the sin, it also bestows perfect hermeneutical calibration to the whole riba paradigm for all monotheist religions, identifying the universal divine law: intra-activity (riba) ---lack of dependence---for the Master (Rabb) and inter-activity (bay')---dependence---for the servant ('abd). This yields the new critical theory of normative human behavior prescribed by "Islam"---the din al-fiṭra, which calls for total human conformity to the design and purpose of human creation in pairs (tathniya: duality), reserving riba (tawḥid : singularity) for the One whose divine attribute it is.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s661k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b536z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Interest (Islamic law)</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
