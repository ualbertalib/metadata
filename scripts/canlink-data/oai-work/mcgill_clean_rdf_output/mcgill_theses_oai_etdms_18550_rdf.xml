From where he lay on his cot he could see the clock through the open door. As it was only four o'clock in the afternoon, neither the beginning nor the end of night, the sailing ship which followed round the hours on its own turning disc had not yet poked its bow-sprit up; it rode quite over-turned above the numeral six, nor would it begin to right itself again until the hour came round to six.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Files, H.

It is imperative, therefore, to clarify the terminology at the outset. In experiments on time estimation, the subject (S) is required to make judgments about temporal durations. The duration that S is asked to judge is called the standard. The estimate of the standard made by S is called the judgment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.

One may say that the development of civilization and the evolution of all its main attributes (economic, political, cultural, and social) rest upon man-made means of communication. Among the many factors which have conditioned and at the same time shaped the history of mankind, transportation and communication have been not causes, but certainly essential elements of the progressive development of society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, J.

When we refer to an economic plan, we generally have in mind a program of action aiming at certain modifications of the economy for a given period of time. The Schuman plan is not a plan of this kind. It is a treaty, which has been signed for a duration of 50 years. It represents in fact the Constitution which will regulate the action of a new independent power "The European Community of Coal and Steel", and also provides a statement of the basic principles which are to regulate and inspire the policy of this new power.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dales, J.
