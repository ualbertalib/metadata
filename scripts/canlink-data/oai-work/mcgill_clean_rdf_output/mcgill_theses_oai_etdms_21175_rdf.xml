The influence of chronic alcohol administration on the structure and function of rat liver plasma membranes was studied. Functionally, a diminished response to both glucagon and epinephrine was detected in the isolated perfused rat liver preparation after chronic alcohol feeding. Receptor binding studies identified a decrease in glucagon and alpha(,1)-adrenergic receptor numbers. The binding affinities were not altered. This condition remained stable through 72 hours of alcohol withdrawal. Further characterization with isopycnic centrifugation showed that the alcoholic plasma membrane spanned a different equilibrium density range with a significantly raised peak density value. This anomaly persisted after 48 hours withdrawal from alcohol. Analyses of lipid composition revealed significant alterations in the phospholipids as well as the fatty acid content in some phospholipid classes of the experimental plasma membranes. However, these modifications were reversed during 48 hours of alcohol withdrawal. Additional changes were noted in some fatty acids of certain phospholipids, reflecting readaptation to the new condition without alcohol. The discrepancy in the time course of reversal of various alcohol-induced effects suggests that adaptation of the plasma membrane to alcohol includes both the lipids and proteins. A combination of alteration in both these components would contribute to the overall modification of structure and function of rat liver plasma membrane subsequent to chronic alcohol administration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx429.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732d989w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs547"><dcterms:title>A study of the chrysopids (Neuroptera : Chrysopidae) in two old fields in Quebec.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Manuel, Raymond Lewis</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Faunistic composition and population dynamics of chrysopids were investigated in two old fields in Quebec. Nine species were collected; Chrysopa oculata Say and Chrysopa chi Fitch are dominant and resident. Parasitism due to Chrysopophthorus americanus Mason has little effect on the reproductive potential of C. oculata and C. chi populations. However, embryonic mortality, resulting from autosomal translocations, is a major mortality factor in both species. Their karyotypes are described and developmental studies conducted on them and Chrysopa lineaticornis Fitch are reported. Inheritance of wing and cephalic characters was investigated in C. oculata. A population genetics study revealed seasonal selection against the allelic gene B (black gradates) and superior fitness of its recessive counterpart b (green gradates). A meiotic drive mechanism also favors the b allele, and the allele A determining "facial band" expression. Chrysopa chi exhibits obligatory and facultative prepupal diapause. The field population, however, is primarily univoltine. Voltinism is controlled by two independently segregating autosomal genes; the recessive alleles, in the homozygous state, determine obligatory diapause and, consequently, univoltinism. Diapause termination is reported.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s36p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs547</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Neuroptera -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lacewings</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak3569540p"><dcterms:title>The solid substrate fermentation of African locust beans (Parkia filicoidea Welw.).</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ikenelbomeh, Marcel James.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The fermentation of African locust beans was studied.

The beans were first processed by boiling and dehulling. They were then fermented at 37 (+OR-) 2(DEGREES)C in stationary fermentor units. Physico-chemical, microbiological, biochemical and enzymological investigations were carried out on the substrate undergoing spontaneous fermentation and on radappertized (11 kGy) controls. Reductions in carbohydrate (52%), protein (12%) and energy (9%) contents, as obtained from the mass and energy balances, occurred during fermentation. The physico-chemical changes were due to the action of extracellular carbohydrases and proteases produced by a Bacillus spp. Pure culture inoculation with the Bacillus spp. gave the fermented product within 24 h in contrast to the normal 72 h fermentation period. Both pH and titratable acidity increased during fermentation. Ammonia was produced as a result of proteolysis. Fermented African locust beans are rich in both protein and fat and feature in the diet of a large proportion of the 200 million people in West Africa.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch36x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569540p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fermentation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Angiosperms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beans</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870w76n"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of organ specific neoantigen from the urine of lung cancer patients</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fink, Aaron.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Organ specific neoantigen (OSN) is shed from cancer of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is filtered into the urine.

Among the seven types of yeasts and ten types of fungi isolated, two strains of Candida krusei, two strains of Candida rugosa and an unidentified fungus (F-20) were characterized further. Optimal conditions of biomass production were obtained (pH 6.0, 28(DEGREES)C, SSL diluted with water 1:1, addition of 0.2% NaH(,2)PO(,4)). As a result of optimization, efficiencies of conversion ranged from 25% for C. krusei, to 44% for C. rugosa. The yeast species grown in mixed cultures increased the biomass production to 52.8%. Intraspecific hybridization by protoplast fusion of auxotrophic mutants of C. rugosa produced fused variants able to increase biomass production to efficiencies of conversion up to 55.9%. The cells of the fused variants were larger than those of the parental types, resulting in faster sedimentation during centrifugation. The regeneration of protoplasts from C. rugosa was affected by the length of incubation in the protoplasting solution. Optimal regeneration was found after 30 min of incubation. Mannitol was shown to be a better osmotic stabilizer than sorbitol for the regeneration of protoplasts from C. rugosa in MMA supplemented with amino acids. The protein content of C. krusei, C. rugosa and its fused variants and the fungus F-20 was 44-55%; carbohydrate content, 15.7-21.5%; nucleic acid, 3.6-5.8%; and lipid, 0.8-3.8%. A good amino acid profile was obtained with one of the fused variants, except for the low content of methionine. The protein quality (calculated PER) of C. rugosa ranged from 1.32 for the wild type to 1.50 for fused variants. The initial BOD was reduced by 80% after the yeast growth in SSL.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q986.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pb267</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r390s"><dcterms:title>Phosphorus limitation and competition in the phytoplankton</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Smith, Ralph E.

Comparison of the activity of the inducible enzyme alkaline phosphatase between the lake and cultures operated at various dilution rates (0.06-0.93 day('-1)) established that in situ phosphorus limitation rarely depressed average community growth rates much below 0.6 day('-1). Growth rates under comparable, or even more severe (0.2-0.3 day('-1)) limitation in culture decreased significantly with increasing cell size. Phosphorus uptake kinetics and cell quotas measured by track autoradiography on the competing species showed that biomass and quota-specific uptake rates varied inversely with cell size in highly significant allometric regressions, correctly predicting that competitive outcome should depend on size. Substituted in a variable internal stores model of phosphorus limited growth, the allometric functions for uptake, cell quota, and maximum growth rate correctly predicted observed growth rates except in competition much stronger than natural (D = 0.06-0.2 day('-1)). Failure of the model to encompass cell senescence and death due to severe nutrient stress appeared to account for the discrepancy. Neither the absolute difference in growth rates due to cell size nor the direction of selection among the naturally co-occurring species varied systematically with the intensity of competition, indicating that spatio-temporal variation of limiting phosphorus supply in nature is unlikely to directly select the size or taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf43d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r390s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water -- Phosphorus content.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phytoplankton.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphorus in animal nutrition.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462634n"><dcterms:title>Reactions of 1, 2-dithiolium cations and formation of metal thio-l-dicarbonyl compounds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shobsngob, Sujin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The decomposition of three phenyl-substituted 1,2-dithiolium salts, 3,5-diphenyl-, 3-phenyl- and 4-phenyl- in aqueous, ethanol and DMSO solutions have been examined. With bases of the type hydroxide, ethoxide, DMSO, and acetate, the 1,2-dithiolium ion formed adducts reversibly. Orders of adduct stability were determined in ethanol and water. Many of the adducts were unstable and decomposed to monothio-(beta)-dicarbonyls. The monothio-(beta)-dicarbonyls were in turn unstable and decomposed in aqueous media to the corresponding-(beta)-diketone in the case of the monothiodibenzoylmethane. Reaction of the 1,2-dithiolium ions with sodium sulphide or sodium borohydride led to dithio-(beta)-dicarbonyls. These species were unstable and decomposed to monothio-(beta)-dicarbonyls in the presence of water. It was possible to observe the formation of metal chelates of monothio- and dithio-(beta)-dicarbonyls in DMSO for several systems. Metal ion and ligand stability orders were established. Chelates of dithio-(beta)-dicarbonyls decomposed to monothio-(beta)-dicarbonyls in the presence of trace amounts of water. Monothio-(beta)-dicarbonyl chelates were also sensitive to water with dibenzoylmethane produced from monothiodibenzoylmethane chelate decomposition. Mechanisms for 1,2-dithiolium ion decomposition in the presence and absence of metal ions have been proposed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp541.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462634n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dicarbonyl compounds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dithiolium salts.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ligands.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36tz43f"><dcterms:title>Effects of medial temporal-lobe lesions on intermediate-memory in man</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Read, Donald E., 1942-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A word-generation experiment explored the relative contributions of the left temporal neocortex and the left hippocampal region to verbal recall.

His reign is not commonly known, and he is often given brief mention only together with the other rulers following the reign of Justinian the Great, although his era spans twenty eventful years. Indeed, his rule is of considerable importance since it is in his time that we first hear about new administrative structures such as the Exarchates of Carthage and Ravenna. The focal point of this thesis is the military and civil administration of the Empire at the end of the sixth century. In order to arrive at a more precise picture of these subjects, different types of materials have been analyzed, such as military handbooks, numismatic data and laws, as well as the literary sources of the reign. Among the latter, the most valuable is the Histories of Theophylact Simocatta. It has been seen as important, or even essential, to relate the more technical material to this literary source. The conclusions reached from this study are various. From the numismatic evidence we can see that there was considerably more stability in monetary matters in the East and the West than is sometimes assumed. By comparing expenditures in general, and subsidies paid especially, at different times in Late Roman or Byzantine history, we learn that the "gold drain" on the Empire's resources was not necessarily as devastating as is sometimes thought. With regard to the military administration, the malaise of frequent unrest among the soldiers is traced to problems of internal structure besetting the military establishment for various reasons, including bad choices of commanding officers. Finally, changes in both military and civil administration are often seen as developments of an evolutionary kind rather than as arbitrary innovations established by Imperial fiat.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp033.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795859d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Byzantine Empire -- History, Military.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maurice, Emperor of the East, 539-602.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Byzantine Empire -- Politics and government.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tm87t"><dcterms:title>Microstructures and preferred orientations of quartz in tectonites of different metamorphic grade</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tella, Subhas, 1945-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The quartz microstructures and microfabrics in tectonites representing greenschist to granulite facies conditions are examined to assess the factors influencing their development.

The small circle girdles, the most common fabrics at all metamorphic grades, are oriented at 30(DEGREES)-40(DEGREES) and 50(DEGREES)-70(DEGREES) about the axes of shortening and extension, respectively. The c-axis orientations of the recrystallized grains bear no relationship to those of the host grains suggesting that host control, though important initially, is commonly overridden by strain controls. The style and magnitude of strain, and the metamorphic grade are the significant controlling factors in the microfabric development.

These data were consistent with the amodal model of perceptual processing: the modality of the patterns did not affect performance. The last four studies found that when considerably more difficult comparisons were combined with blocking on intramodal and intermodal trials a difference emerged between the two types of trials. Intramodal performance was superior to intermodal performance. The effect was subtle though and difficult to isolate.

It is based on the properties of the state transition graph which can be considered as a generalization to the multivariable case of the classical Good-De-Bruijn graph associated with linear shift register sequences. The concept of a minimal graph is introduced and shown to be isomorphic to the class of all minimal encoders previously defined by Forney. Straightforward algorithms based on simple algebraic and graph manipulations are introduced to allow for the reduction of any state transition graph to a minimal form. Furthermore each stage in the reduction procedure is shown to be related to some fundamental system theoretic concept including the conditions for causal invertibility, pseudo invertibility and polynomial invertibility of a linear feedforward system. By using the concept of dual codes and introducing a straightforward algorithm for the construction of a dual encoder in minimal form which is valid on any field; a simple procedure is further devised providing for the reduction of any rational basis to a minimal polynomial form and the applications of this result to multivariable realization theory are discussed. Finally several non exhaustive applications of the above mentioned concepts to linear system theory are developed. A special emphasis is placed on the solution of the problem associated with the construction of the class of all minimal order, minimal delay pseudo inverses of any realizable linear system. Furthermore, we present a solution to the minimal partial realization problem for vectored sequences based on the use of a Berlekamp-Massey type algorithm.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nm33m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139276q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>System analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multivariate analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Convolutions (Mathematics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hs75j"><dcterms:title>The high performance liquid chromatography and detection of phospholipids and triglycerides /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Compton, Bruce Jon.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Work on developing an instrumental system for total analysis of triglycerides and phospholipids is presented.

The aldehyde reagents, called the Fluorals, of which Fluoral-P (4-amino-3-penten-2-one) is studied extensively, have promise of being useful for selective, rapid and sensitive (sub-nanomoles formaldehyde) determinations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b954.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs75j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Liquid chromatography.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Triglycerides.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phospholipids.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nx95b"><dcterms:title>Econometrics of money demand : with applications to the Canadian economy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cockerline, Jon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis seeks to contribute to the theoretical and empirical debate surrounding five key issues in the demand for money.

In addition to providing information about Canadian money demand, efforts are made to assess the practical nature of the econometric techniques employed. Contributions include: an assessment of relative sensitivity of various stability tests; a discussion of stability of monetary aggregates wherein a demand shift in the current account component of narrow money in the mid-1970s is identified; empirical and theoretical analyses of the appropriateness of a semilogarithmic functional form; technical improvements in the study of causality for Canada; discussion and assessment of variable dynamics in the equilibrating adjustment process; and construction of a statistically-optimum and economically-rational price expectations series.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq50s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx95b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Econometrics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Economic conditions -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Money -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s570r"><dcterms:title>Reduction of enveloping algebras of low-rank groups</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Couture, Michel, 1949-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We find the generating function for group tensors contained in the enveloping algebra of each simple compact group of rank three or less.

We show how the generating functions for tensors in the enveloping algebra of SO(5) and SU(3) reduce when the tensors are acting on the basis of representations for which one of the Cartan labels vanish. The missing label problem in the reduction SO(5) (R-HOOK) SO(3) restricted to SO(5) representations of the type (0,(nu)) is considered; the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a missing label operator are found up to (including) representation (0,12).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k11b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s570r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Universal enveloping algebras.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lie groups.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc116"><dcterms:title>Shape change and aggregation of human and rabbit platelets</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tang, Shiow-Shih.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The nature of shape change and aggregation of human and rabbit platelets was assessed by light transmission studies of stirred platelet suspensions and phase contrast microscopy. Platelet shape change and aggregation were differently affected by experimental conditions: pCO(,2), pH and anticoagulants, according to choice of aggregating agents. Optimal physiological conditions were established for functional studies. A new class of potent antithrombotic agents, BL-3459 and BL-4162A, were identified as selective low Km cyclic 3':5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These BL-compounds could block platelet shape change and aggregation for all aggregating agents tested. Dose-response studies with adenosine 5'-diphosphate demonstrated that these two consecutive events are separately and oppositely controlled by aggregating agent and inhibitor concentration. A model for the role of cAMP-calcium in regulating these changes is presented. Finally, we studied platelets from a distinct hereditary bleeding disorder, which we designated as the "Montreal Platelet Syndrome". These platelets showed abnormal shape change, low to absent thrombin-induced aggregation; and spontaneous aggregation leading to microaggregates of disc-shaped platelets.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9997544.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc116</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77sr00x"><dcterms:title>The desulfurization of organic trisulfides : a mechanistic study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Smith, Roger Astbury.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many aspects of the desulfurization of trisulfides have been investigated. Efforts directed toward the syntheses of cyclic trisulfides provided mixtures of oligomers or the corresponding disulfide. Radiochemically labelled trisulfides and an optically active trisulfide have been desulfurized by a variety of phosphines. Triarylphosphines preferentially removed the central sulfur atom under all conditions, while tris(dialkylamino)phosphines exhibited preferential terminal sulfur removal in low polarity solvent with a trend to increased central sulfur removal with increased solvent polarity. Exchange phenomena were examined and a mechanistic rationalization presented. Desulfurization by triarylphosphines was concluded to proceed by the rate-determining decomposition of a phosphonium salt to form products, while desulfurization by tris(dialkylamino)phosphines was considered to have phosphonium salt formation as the rate-determining step. The reaction of trisulfides with trialkyl phosphites to give a mixture of unsymmetrical and symmetrical disulfides has been studied. Mechanistic and synthetic aspects are described. The spontaneous desulfurization of sulfenic sulfonic thioanhydrides and exchange of the thiosulfonate products in polar solvents were examined.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b2085.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr00x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Desulfurization.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organosulfur compounds.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d5064"><dcterms:title>Studies on increasing the specificity of anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antisera by means of solid phase immunoabsorption</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Skurnik, Risa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Clinical studies have suggested that the anti-CEA antiserum directed against purified CEA reacts with a variety of constituents. This phenomenon may account for the lack of tumor-specificity seen in the clinical radioimmunoassays in use. The object of the experiments presented here was to see if anti-CEA antisera could be made more specific to the tumor portion of the CEA molecule. The method of approach was by the use of affinity chromatography. Normal bowel material was coupled to glass beads and used as a matrix though which anti-CEA antisera was recycled. Both a single column with sequential passages and separate columns with successive passages were employed. The results obtained indicate that the anti-CEA antiserum is indeed heterogeneous. It reacts primarily with normal bowel constituents and contains little, if any, tumor-specific reactivity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp05n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d5064</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s337w"><dcterms:title>Exceptional sets in a product of harmonic spaces and applications</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Singman, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A study of exceptional sets in a finite product of Brelot spaces is made.

The first phase of this study proposes a simple model to account for this modifiability in terms of known neurophysiology. To study the phenomenon further two series of experiments were conducted on long-term vision-reversed cats. For this a new computer technique was developed to analyse oculomotor responses. The first series studied the time course and amplitude dependence of adaptation; the second, the frequency response of the fully adapted system. The adaptive process exhibited strict limitations, the functional effectiveness of which is quantitatively defined. The findings as a whole suggest that adaptive mechanisms other than the VOR are at play and that far more complex interactions exist between vestibulo- and visual-motor mechanisms than originally envisaged.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w43m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j912</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eye -- Adaptation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plasticity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vision -- Research.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xj522"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of crystalline and non-crystalline proteins from phaseolus beans</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1979</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Alli, Inteaz.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Proteins were isolated from acidic extracts and alkaline extracts of white kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and baby lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus).

An empirical equation was derived for calculating its modulus of toughness. Experimental justification was provided for the application of the Hertz linear elastic contact theory in determining cob mechanical properties in radial compression, since the cob is a composite of three inelastic materials. In simple bending, the basic flexure formula was modified to account for the composite and tapered structure of the cob. The relative contributions of the macro-structural components of the corn cob to its mechanical properties were determined. Cob mechanical properties were found to be significantly affected by corn variety, harvest date and moisture content, but not by loading rate. Further experimental investigations showed that the cob mechanical properties were much dependent on fertilizer type and application rate but less dependent on soil type and condition.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p551c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182m06k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corncobs -- Testing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z76s"><dcterms:title>Experimental studies on occurrence of cereal aphids and resulting damage to small grain crops in southwestern Quebec.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ba-Angood, Saeed Abdulla.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cereal aphids started to infest cereals in the first week of June and reached their peak in the second and third week of July.

Pirimicarb is recommended for chemical control, as it controlled aphids efficiently and had a minimal effect on the available predators and parasites. A sequential sampling plan has been developed to detect if populations reach economic threshold.

SKN7 was mapped to the right arm of chromosome VIII, and is predicted to encode a 70 kDa protein, Skn7p, with a region of homology to the DNA binding domain of the yeast heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1p. Skn7p also has a domain which shows similarity to the prokaryotic receiver modules found on an extensive family of two-component response regulators, including the product of the rcsC gene. While restoring the growth rate to near wild type levels, SKN7 does not appear to restore the $ beta$-glucan levels of the $kre9 Delta$ mutant. However, SKN7-suppressed cells show a partially restored cellular morphology, and a restored cell wall resistance to mechanical stress. SKN7 does not suppress other mutations in the ($1 rightarrow6$)-$ beta$-glucan biosynthetic pathway, suggesting that it does not act as a general bypass suppressor of this glucan.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bussey, A.
