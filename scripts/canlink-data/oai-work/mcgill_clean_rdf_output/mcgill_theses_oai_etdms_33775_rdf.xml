'Third space' is a way to examine the question of culture in a time marked by large epistemic, political and representational shifts. Recent theorization of 'third space' often locates this as a cultural 'in-between' or field of liminality, beginning with the polarities of hierarchical and binary dualisms. The body, as one half of dualistic thought and practice, remains conspicuously absent from concepts of 'third space' and its activities. A series of dynamic modes of engagement, in which embodiment figures centrally, constitutes 'third space' in this theorization of it. Rather, however, than approach the articulation of a 'third space' solely through academic and literary texts, its primary 'sources' of 'information' to date, photographic imagery is proposed as a means to access 'third space'. The photographic, through its mediation of "vision," provides visual 'clues' by which to approach the "subjects" and "objects" of 'third space'. A trialectical relation of Visuality, Embodied Inter(ob)subjectivity and Space therefore characterizes a feminist approach to, and conceptualization of, 'third space'. An interpretative analysis of the contemporary photographic practices of Genevieve Cadieux, Marlene Creates, and Sylvie Readman contributes to an understanding of the significance of a notion of 'third space'.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, Christine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kobayashi, Audrey (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161791w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn93n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human figure in art.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminism and art.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Photographic criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Space and time in art.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v465d"><dcterms:title>Concerto for piano and orchestra : "Inside passage"</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ferguson, Sean.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis contains two volumes. The first is a written text that describes my compositional techniques in the context of an analysis of my Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. The second volume is the score of this work. Volume one is divided into two parts. Part I describes my compositional techniques and the original contributions of the thesis. These include the incorporation of psychoacoustic models of hearing into the creative process, as implemented by a computer program written by the author. I give detailed descriptions of models for dissonance and pitch commonality, and discuss my use of contour theory. Part II of the first volume illustrates these techniques through an analysis of the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. The main topics of this analysis are the creation of background harmonic regions based on high pitch commonality to a referential sonority, and the integration of a basic shape or contour into all parameters and structural levels of the music. Volume two is the full score of the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. This work has a duration of 23 minutes. It is scored for solo piano and a small orchestra consisting of flute (doubling on piccolo), oboe, B-flat clarinet, bassoon, horn in F, trumpet in C, trombone, two percussion and strings (44332). The Concerto is divided into four movements, played without pause, and two brief opening and closing sections.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rea, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634549h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v465d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Concertos (Piano) -- Scores.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21th093"><dcterms:title>TGF- receptor profiles in skin cells : identification of a novel TGF-1 accessory receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tam, Betty Yuet Ye, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Impaired wound healing leads to major medical problems such as chronic ulcers and tissue fibrosis. As transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is an important regulator of cutaneous wound repair, modulation of TGF-beta's function represents a potential means of therapeutically modifying the healing process. In order to understand TGF-beta's action in the skin, it is important to characterize TGF-beta receptor profiles and the formation of oligomeric receptor complexes in human skin cells. TGF-beta signals through the types I and II receptor kinases, while the type III receptor facilitates ligand binding to the types I and II. Our results show that human dermal fibroblasts express two isoform specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored TGF-beta binding proteins in addition to the types I, II and III receptors. In fibroblasts and keratinocytes, we demonstrate the occurrence of types I and II heterodimers and type I homodimers. This allows the expansion of the hetero-oligomeric TGF-beta receptor signaling paradigm proposed using mutant cells overexpressing these receptors, to include normal TGF-beta responsive cell types. In keratinocytes we identified a novel 150 kDa GPI-anchored TGF-beta1 binding protein (r150) which forms a heteromeric complex with the TGF-beta signaling receptors. We demonstrate that the GPI-anchor is contained in r150 itself and not in a tightly associated protein. Furthermore, the soluble form of r150 can inhibit TGF-beta1 binding to its receptors as a result of soluble r150's ability to bind TGF-beta1 independently from the signaling receptors. We also provide evidence that r150 is released from the cell surface by an endogenous phospholipase C. In order to study the role of r150 in TGF-beta signaling, we created a keratinocyte cell line mutated in GPI anchor biosynthesis (GPI M) which expresses decreased levels of r150. These cells display enhanced TGF-beta stimulated transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of Smad2. Therefore, in its membrane-anchored or soluble form, r150 may act as a negative modulator of TGF-beta action in keratinocytes. Finally, by tandem mass spectrometry of purified soluble r150, we obtained a 19 amino acid sequence that matched to an expressed sequence tagged cDNA clone of unknown function. Studies are in progress to verify if this clone's putative full length cDNA encodes a product with properties of r150. The novel accessory receptor, r150, may have an essential role in the skin by acting as a key regulator of TGF-beta action.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Philip, Anie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t66s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21th093</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418p88f"><dcterms:title>Permeability of alginate polylysine microcapsules encapsulating hepatocytes as a biohybird artificial liver by high performance size exclusion chromatography</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Coromili, Vaia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rat hepatocytes are isolated via a modified collagenase portal vein perfusion method and encapsulated within alginate-polylysine microcapsules to be used as a biohybrid artificial liver support system.

The success of a complete hybrid liver depends on the preservation of hepatocyte multiple functions including the removal of ammonia amongst other toxic substances, urea synthesis, gluconeogenesis and secretion of proteins in the molecular weight range of 5--150 kDa while allowing the transport of lower MV biomolecules. Five types of alginate-polylysine microcapsules are examined (i) standard single membrane microcapsules; (ii) microcapsules prepared with a two step procedure where special attention is taken to prevent the entrapment of cells within the membrane matrix; (iii) double membrane microcapsules where intracapsular alginate is minimized for improved intracapsular diffusion and cell contact; (iv) new microcapsules where microcapsules are encapsulated within larger microcapsules, macrocapsules, with distinct and non interacting membranes separated by a liquid intracapsular space; and (v) microcapsules with polyanion/polycation multilayering.

Because deliberation about important decisions is a time when people are more realistic and impartial in processing information about themselves and the world, a deliberative mindset was expected to increase the predictive accuracy of relationship appraisals compared to an implemental mindset. Four studies using different methodologies tested this hypothesis. In Study 1, relationship mindset assessed via content coding interacted with commitment in predicting the survival of the relationship 4 months later. In Study 2, mindset assessed via closed questions about academic goals interacted with explicit forecasts in predicting the survival of the relationship 9 months later. In studies 3 and 4, an experimental manipulation of mindset interacted with explicit forecasts or relationship assessments of relationship constructs in predicting relationship survival 6 months later. Overall, a deliberative mindset increased the accuracy of relationship predictions and the validity of relationship constructs in predicting the dissolution of a relationship compared to an implemental mindset. Importantly, deliberatives were not more pessimistic than were implementals; they were more realistic. Nonetheless, a deliberative mindset about an important goal in the relationship can be threatening. Previous work found that boosting perceptions of partner superiority is one way to cope with such threat (Gagne &amp; Lydon, 2001, Study 1). Study 5 further showed that participants in a deliberative mindset boosted their perceptions of partner superiority only if they were sufficiently committed to their relationships. Those in an implemental mindset boosted their perceptions of partner superiority irrespective of their commitment level. In sum, a deliberative mindset about the relationship increases the accuracy of evaluations serving epistemic needs (i.e., relationship predictions) while n</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lydon, John E.

At low cellulose concentrations the suspensions are disordered, becoming ordered upon reaching a critical concentration, which depends on the aspect ratio of the rods. AFM and TEM were used to characterize particle size and polydispersity. Just beyond the critical concentration for anisotropic phase formation is an intermediate concentration range in which the isotropic and anisotropic phases co-exist. This biphasic region was examined for its potential to partition dextran molecules. At extremely high cellulose concentrations, solid cellulose films that maintain some chiral nematic order may be obtained. The degree of order in the films has been measured using induced circular dichroism and optimized by magnetic alignment. These suspensions can also be used to create model surfaces of cellulose I. The smooth cellulose surfaces have been characterized by XPS, X-ray diffraction, and AFM.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray, Derek G.

Because Ig V(D)J recombination in chickens results in minimal diversity, diversity being generated instead by gene conversion in the follicles of the bursa of Fabricius, B cell precursors express a limited range of Ig specificities prior to colonization of the bursa. It has been proposed that recognition of endogenous ligands by this 'pre-diversified' B cell receptor is critical to the progression of normal B cell development. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a truncated IgM receptor (Tmu) lacking the V and Cmu1 domain, which does not associate with Ig L chain proteins nor does it require IgL chains for surface expression, and used a retroviral gene transfer system to introduce it in developing chick embryos. In these embryos, Tmu+ B cell precursors productively colonized bursal follicles as efficiently as B cell precursors expressing endogenous sIg. Furthermore, we detected low but significant levels of IgL VJ rearrangements in Tmu + bursal cells. The analysis of these VJ junctions revealed no selection for in-frame products as these cells are maintained by the Tmu receptor. Interestingly, we showed that the rearranged VL segments derived from Tmu+ bursal cells underwent gene conversion indistinguishably from rearranged VL segments derived from bursal cells expressing endogenous sIg. Taken together, we have ruled out a role for V(D)J encoded determinants in the normal development of B cells in avian embryos. Sequence analysis of 80 IgL VJ segments derived from Tmu+ bursal allowed the unique opportunity to assess the efficiency of gene conversion in vivo, in the absence of selection. Using this system, we demonstrated that &gt;97% of gene conversion events maintain the sequence in-frame.

The earliest intrathymic progenitors are known to depend on cytokine signaling. However, the mechanisms regulating cytokine signaling during thymopoiesis have not been characterized. Moreover, the contribution of cytokine signaling to the maturation of CD4-CD8- thymocytes into CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, mainly controlled by the pre-TCR, is uncertain. Overexpression of SOCS-1, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, in developing thymocytes resulted in decreased proliferation following pre-TCR signaling, revealing a novel role for cytokine signaling at this developmental stage. Moreover, pre-TCR signaling negatively regulates SOCS-1 expression, establishing a link between the pre-TCR and mechanisms regulating cytokine signaling. During the later stages of thymocyte development, signals delivered by the pre-TCR and TCR assume a dominant regulatory role. Although structurally similar to the TCR, the pre-TCR possesses distinct biological properties. The major difference between these receptors is the presence of the pTalpha chain in the pre-TCR, which is structurally different from the TCRalpha chain present in the TCR. The connecting peptide domain of pTalpha regulates the interaction between the pre-TCR and the TCR&amp;zgr; subunit. In addition, the structural differences between pTalpha and TCRalpha constitute a post-translational regulatory mechanism to prevent the coexpression of pre-TCR and TCR at the cell surface of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, as pTalpha cannot pair with TCRbeta in the presence of TCRalpha. The competitive advantage of TCRalpha relates to the position of the bridging cysteine residue within its connecting peptide domain. Thus, the structural features of pTalpha regulate the assembly and surface expression of the pre-TCR, and endow it</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zuniga-Pflucker, Juan Carlos (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Hugo, Patrice (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66345508.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd34q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hd84k"><dcterms:title>Age-related structural and functional modification of cortical synapses</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wong, Tak Pan, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cortical synaptic atrophy with aging has long been regarded as the primary substrate of decline in cognitive function. However, little is known about the impact of this structural change on cortical synaptic function. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the functional consequence of age-related synaptic reductions in the parietal cortex. In the first study, I analyzed synaptic density in the parietal cortex and revealed significant age-related presynaptic reductions. Interestingly, I found a preferential disappearance of synapses in deep cortical layers. The functional impact of presynaptic reduction was tested in the second study. Whole cell patch clamp recording of spontaneous synaptic currents (sPSCs) onto layer V pyramidal neurons revealed no age-related change. In contrast, the frequency of action potential - independent miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) was decreased, thus revealing an increase in action potential dependent activity (FrequencysPSCs - frequencymPscs) in aged brains. The third study focused on the ratio between excitation and inhibition in aged impaired and aged unimpaired rats that were divided on the basis of their performance in the Morris Water Maze. Interestingly, I found an imbalance between excitation and inhibition in both aged groups. Finally, to test whether similar age-related modifications occur in other neurotransmitter systems, the fourth study contrasted cholinergic vs. non-cholinergic inputs onto layer V pyramidal neurons. I found a preferential decline in cholinergic inputs onto pyramidal neurons with aging. These findings provide evidence of functional compensation for the lost of synaptic structures in aged brains. However, rather than a general decline in synaptic function, imbalance between different synaptic inputs may be an important cellular substrate for cognitive impairment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cuello, A.

Despite amino acid differences, all HOX homeodomains recognize highly similar sites on DNA. One mechanism by which HOX proteins achieve specificity is through interaction with cofactors of the PBX and MEIS/PREP1 families. Higher order complexes between HOX, PBX and MEIS/PREP1 proteins form in vivo and are essential for target recognition and transcriptional regulation. Another level of control of HOX function is the nuclear availability of its cofactors. This thesis addresses the regulation of the nuclear availability of the PBX protein by MEIS/PREP1 family members. We identified two nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the PBX homeodomain and showed that the NLS are masked in the absence of MEIS/PREP1. Upon a conformational change in PBX induced by MEIS/PREP1 binding, the NLS are exposed and a receptor-mediated active transport of PBX into the nucleus is allowed. This thesis also investigates the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by the HOX·PBX complexes. We show that HOX·PBX complexes repress transcription and are switched to transcriptional activators in response to cell signaling. We demonstrate that PBX mediates the repression function by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to HOX target promoters. Inhibition of HDAC activity or stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling converts the HOX·PBX complex into a net activator of transcription. The activation function is mediated by the HOX protein through its recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a coactivator with histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity. We propose a model whereby HOX·PBX transcriptional activity is determined by cell signaling, and is mediated by the local modification of chromatin structure in the promoter of downstream targets.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Featherstone, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472z19m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s410p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p633n"><dcterms:title>Empirical and modeling studies of multi-joint limb movement</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gribble, Paul L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Empirical and simulation studies are described which assess the form of central control signals for human limb movement. Recent claims about the complexity of control signals are addressed using a mathematical model of two-joint planar arm movement. The model is based on the lambda version of the equilibrium point hypothesis and includes neural control signals, reflexes, reflex delays, muscle mechanical properties, realistic musculo-skeletal geometry, limb dynamics and external loads. It is shown that ostensibly "complex" features of limb motion such as the "2/3 power law" and non-monotonic patterns of limb impedance are predicted using simple constant-rate equilibrium shifts which do not explicitly encode these movement properties. In addition it is shown that simulated limb impedance using the A model both during movement and in statics matches empirically estimated values of impedance reported in the literature. Empirical studies assessed the control of muscle coactivation by measuring tonic levels of electromyographic activity in shoulder and elbow muscles at the end of reaching movements in a horizontal plane. Shoulder muscle coactivation was related to the amplitude and velocity of shoulder motion, and unrelated to elbow motion whereas elbow and double-joint muscle activity was related to elbow motion, and unrelated to shoulder motion. It is suggested that muscle coactivation at the shoulder and elbow may be controlled independently. Other experiments addressed the extent to which control signals are adjusted to account for interaction torques---torques arising at one joint due to the motion of limb segments about adjacent joints. Electromyographic activity of limb muscles was measured during single- and multi-joint movements in which the magnitude or direction of interaction torque was systematically varied. During single-joint movements, phasic activity which preceded motion and varied in magnitude with interaction torque was observed in muscles acting at the stationary joint. During multi-joint movement EMG activity in muscles at one joint was modulated to offset interaction torque arising from limb motion about an adjacent joint. It is suggested that control signals to muscles are adjusted to offset interaction torques arising from limb dynamics. Schemes for incorporating information about dynamics into the position control framework proposed in the equilibrium point hypothesis are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ostry, David J.

Genetic epidemiologic studies have consistently shown that genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of bipolar disorder, however, the precise mechanisms that increase the susceptibility to this condition are not known. In the past three decades, several studies have been carried out hoping to identify major genes. However, conflicting results between and within studies that do not replicate previous findings have constituted a major problem. It is believed that part of this problem is related to genetic heterogeneity. We have attempted to reduce heterogeneity by selecting patients responsive to longterm lithium treatment. There is compelling evidence that selecting patients according to lithium response may help define a more genetically homogeneous subgroup of bipolar patients. This evidence is based on the fact that lithium is more effective in bipolar patients with classical symptomatology and the absence of comorbidity. Similarly, nonresponders to lithium treatment are different with respect to neuroendocrine responses and family history from responders, who are more likely to have relatives affected with bipolar disorder than lithium nonresponders. Using association and linkage designs, we have studied 31 lithium responsive bipolar families and 138 unrelated lithium responsive bipolar patients and 163 normal controls. We used a candidate gene as well as a whole-genome scan approach.

The location at which attention is focused is a function of an ongoing tension between external cues and internal goals. Control over selective attention is often described as an executive process, attributable to the function of the frontal lobes of the brain. The present experiments investigated the role of the frontal cortex in attentional control, through the study of patients with focal cortical lesions and through functional neuroimaging in neurologically normal subjects. It was found that patients with unilateral surgical resections from the frontal cortex were as efficient as patients with temporal-lobe resections and normal controls at attending selectively to a visual stimulus at one location in the presence of irrelevant distracting stimuli. In fact, those patients whose lesions invaded the anterior cingulate gyrus tended to be less reactive to changes in irrelevant stimuli. However, patients with frontal cortex lesions were mildly impaired in a different task in which they used visual cues to direct attention voluntarily to a different location from one trial to the next. In addition, patients with excisions from the right frontal cortex performed less efficiently with increasing time spent on a task, suggesting an important role for this region in sustained attention. These observations prompted a further study of attention using positron emission tomography in normal subjects. This experiment was designed to identify the brain regions that were more active during trials in which cues could be used to direct attention voluntarily, relative to trials in which uninformative cues were presented. The striatum and extrastriate cortex were the only regions in which blood flow correlated positively with the proportion of trials containing informative cues.

The Met receptor is also oncogenically activated following genomic rearrangement which generates a cytoplasmic, constitutively activated fusion protein, Tpr-Met. In addition to autophosphorylation sites within the catalytic domain, the carboxy terminus of Tpr-Met/Met contains a single major site of autophosphorylation, tyrosine 489. This tyrosine residue represents a unique multisubstrate binding site, capable of binding numerous intracellular proteins, and is critical for the biological activities of both the Met receptor and Tpr-Met oncoprotein. Addition of the c-src myristoylation sequence to the amino terminus of the normally cytoplasmic Tpr-Met, localizes Tpr-Met to plasma membranes and enhances cellular transformation, in vitro invasion, and tumourigenicity. Furthermore, a membrane targetted Tpr-Met is localized to a similar subcellular compartment as the Met receptor, and alters the complement of signalling proteins required for efficient transformation. In this respect, a membrane localized Tpr-Met resembles oncogenic forms of the transmembrane Met receptor, and provides a model with which to study transformation by Met receptor oncoproteins. Significantly, membrane localization of Tpr-Met induces a phosphoinositide 3' kinase (PI3' K) dependent autocrine loop, involving the production of hyaluronic acid (HA), and post-translational modification of the cell surface receptor for HA, CD44. PI3'K activity and the HA/CD44 autocrine loop, are dependent on the multisubstrate binding site, tyrosine 489, and tyrosine residue 498, a residue with no previously described biochemical function. Although the exact mechanisms by which PI3'K regulates HA production are unclear, the induction of a HA/CD44 autocrine loop may represent a novel mechanism by which deregulated receptor tyrosine kinases increase their onco</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Park, Morag (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dh43z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r272x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977w699"><dcterms:title>Altered reactivity of pulmonary vessels in postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shi, Weibin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chronic ligation of one pulmonary artery results in pulmonary vascular remodelling and bronchial angiogenesis, known as postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy (POPV). In previous studies of POPV, we found that responses of pulmonary arteries to 5-HT and of veins to histamine were markedly increased, but the role of putative factors, such as structure, endothelial modulation and alterations in receptors remains unknown. First, we examined the role of these mechanisms in the differential responses of pulmonary arteries and veins of normal guinea pigs to histamine and 5-HT, using a novel lung explant technique. We found that veins contracted more to both agonists than arteries, and that H2 receptors were responsible for the differential contractile responses of pulmonary arteries and veins to histamine, whereas endothelium-derived vasoactive substances (nitric oxide and prostacyclin) were responsible for their differential contractile responses to 5-HT. We also investigated relaxation responses, and found that endothelial-dependent NO-mediated relaxation was greater in pulmonary arteries than veins, and that acetylcholine-induced NO-mediated relaxation was reduced by the simultaneous production of cyclooxygenase-derived vasoconstrictors. Second, we did experiments in guinea pigs with POPV, and found that the maximal contractions of pulmonary arteries to 5-HT and of veins to histamine were increased compared with controls, and that the augmented responses were not due to endothelial dysfunction nor to structural alterations, but probably to changes in the smooth muscle proper. To ascertain responses to endothelin (ET), and the role of altered receptors, specifically ET receptors, in POPV, we produced the model in rats: we found that contractions to ET-1 and ET-3 were increased and that relaxation to ET-1 was reduced significantly only in the pulmonary arteries with POPV compared with controls; these findings were attributed, using receptor binding studies, to an augmented proportion of ETA over ETB receptors. We conclude that the differential contractile responses of normal pulmonary arteries and veins to histamine and 5-HT, and the altered vascular responses to these amines and to ETs in POPV, are due primarily to differences in receptors or in endothelial modulation, rather than to disparities in vascular structure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Michel, Rene P.

Most interpreters have derived Courage's meaning from only one term of the contradiction of merchant and mother that constitutes her, either blaming the inhuman, war-mongering merchant for her participation in war, or defending the vital, productive, and nurturing mother for that same (unavoidable) participation. Some have stressed instead the unity formed by Courage's contradiction, without being able to elucidate its meaning. The present interpretation, proceeding from a clue given in scene 7 to the meaning of the text, draws parallels between the drama and Brecht's view of the world, and shows that the world of Mutter Courage is the symbolic representation of capitalism as Brecht knew it during the rise of fascism and the approach of the Second World War. Courage is then shown to be a concentrated form of this symbolic representation; indeed, she turns out to be a representation of capitalism in its "totality". This representation is inseparable from the invocation, through Courage, of the Great Mother archetype. The Great Mother describes a contradictory capitalism that is both a Good Mother in its promising productivity, and a Terrible Mother in its destructive warring and oppression; but she, as the symbol of Nature, also describes a capitalism that had begun to seem even to Brecht like a second Nature. Courage also represents the totality of capitalism (as the Marxist Brecht saw it) by embodying both its "affirmative" aspect (as a merchant who engenders soldiering sons), and (undermining the archetype of the Great Mother) its "critical" aspect as the representation of the resistance of the oppressed to their warring world (as the outlaw who engenders a daughter who rebels against war). The meaning of the drama, then, is the story of Courage as the incarnation of the dialectic of capitalism, a dark tale whose conditions seem eternal, but which contains the promise of something bet</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goldsmith-Reber, T.

This thesis thus, addresses the role of NO in septic pigs. I first hypothesized that induction of NOSII in pigs is the cause of sepsis-induced hypotension as occurs in rodents. To test this, I treated pigs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate sepsis. In contrast to what is observed in rats and mice, plasma nitrite did not change during the 4 hours of the LPS infusion and there was no increase in calcium (Ca)-independent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in lung tissue from endotoxemic pigs compared to control animals. Furthermore, there was only minimal induction of NOSII mRNA. My second hypothesis was that NOS (NOSIII) is not down regulated in septic pigs, and NO from NOSIII, could contribute to peroxynitrite formation. In support of this, western blot analysis of samples from aorta and vena cava showed no down regulation of NOSIII. There also was an increase in Ca ++-dependent NOS activity of aorta and vena cava after 2-hour of endotoxemia, which indicates increased constitutive NOS activity. Moreover, there was an increase in NOSI in the vena cava. LPS produced a leftward shift in the dose-response curves of SVR and RVR in response to the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (NG -nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester). Peroxynitrite is formed from NO and superoxide (O2 -). Since NO was not increased in endotoxemic pigs, I next hypothesized that O2- is increased in endotoxemic pigs and this reacts with NO from constitutive NOS to form peroxynitrite. To test this hypothesis, I first studied rats to confirm that O2 - is increased in arterial vessels of endotoxic rats. There was a small increase in basal O2- in endotoxic rats. Stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidase by giving the substrate, NADH, did not result in different O2- production in control and endotoxic rats. However, inhibition of NOS increased O2 - in endotoxic rats. I demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, that the components of NAD(P)H oxidase, gp91phox, p22phox , and p47phox are present in skeletal muscle and it has similar behavior to other non-phagocytic NADPH oxidases. The addition of L-NAME to NADH-treated diaphragm strips of endotoxic rats, increased O 2- production in endotoxic rats indicating that O2- production counters the increased NO formation as we observed in rat aorta. These observations indicate that O2 - generation from NADPH oxidase in skeletal muscles can play a role in the pathophysiology of sepsis.

In a Russian context, where both literature and film have played roles of central cultural importance, the study of this interaction can be particularly fruitful. The first chapter of this dissertation considers the theoretical aspects of adaptation, namely fidelity to the original work and questions of metaphor and narrative structure. After examining these issues in a general context, Chapter 1 then views them in the light of specific stages of Russian cinematic history. The remaining chapters of this dissertation consider selected post-revolutionary Soviet and Russian filmic adaptations of the works of Nikolai Gogol', Fedor Dostoevskii and Anton Chekhov in chronological order. Analysis of both text and film is undertaken in order to demonstrate the complexity of literary and extra-literary factors involved in adaptation. The works of Gogol' have provided film makers with the challenge of finding "adequate" filmic equivalents to this writer's narrative devices, particularly his use of skaz [oral folk narration]. Dostoevskii's works have proven to be a stumbling block for film makers, both in terms of their ideological acceptability, and their exploration of complex psychological and religious issues. The adaptations of Chekhov's works have provided cinema with diverse subject matter that reflects the various stages and developments of Russian cinematic history, from pure fabula borrowing to an emphasis on mood and atmosphere.

The superior set of product property profile of these fibers is due to the preferred microstructure development, during the fiber spinning process, which is facilitated by anisotropic nature of the carbonaceous mesophase. The development of microstructure during the fiber formation process is critical to optimize their properties. However, the flow behavior of carbonaceous mesophases under such complex external fields is largely unknown. Several experimental studies have been performed worldwide to explore the flow behavior of precursor materials. Mathematical modeling, on the other hand, has not only complemented the experiments but has also emerged as a more economical alternative, and forms the basis of this study. In this thesis we developed a constitutive equation (CE) for carbonaceous mesophases by taking into account full microstructure characteristics. The microstructural and rheological predictions of the constitutive equation are computed by subjecting it to shear and extensional flows. The steady and dynamical microstructure features of the various orientation regimes are thoroughly characterized and analyzed. The predicted relations among the rheological properties (simple shear and uniaxial extensional), flow-induced microstructure, processing conditions, and material properties are discussed. The effect of surface anchorings and the long-range elasticity on the bulk shear-induced microstructure of discotic mesophases is analyzed. The numerical results are used to put forth the fundamental principles that govern mesophase carbon fiber texture generation under shear. The simulations reproduce and explain a significant number of experimental facts and trends. The excellent performance of selected CE strongly suggests that it is a reliable contribution towards formulation of a process model for carbonaceous mesophase spinning.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rey, Alejandro D.

Consequently, the mobility and bioavailability of phosphate and arsenate in the marine environment are mostly regulated by the fate of iron oxyhydroxides. However, to this day, the majority of adsorption studies of phosphate and arsenate were performed in low ionic strength solutions. In this study, phosphate and arsenate complexation on goethite in a 0.7 M NaCl solution and seawater was characterized over a pH range of 3.0 to 10.0 in batch adsorption experiments. Phosphate complexation is described using electric double layer models which consider the presence of three monodentate surface complexes, each characterized by an intrinsic formation constant. Arsenate shows a similar adsorption pattern on goethite but a higher affinity than phosphate. A model including three surface complexes describes the arsenate adsorption at relatively high initial concentrations (i.e., 23 and 34 mumol/l) but overestimates the adsorption at a lower concentration (i.e., 8.8 mumol/l). The equilibrium model derived by combining the formation constants obtained in the single oxyanion subsystems predicts the shape of the competitive adsorption data but fails to reproduce it quantitatively. In competitive experiments, phosphate adsorption is underpredicted whereas arsenate adsorption is overpredicted. Magnesium, calcium and sulphate complexation on goethite was studied in a 0.7 M NaCl solution at 25°C and a pH range of 3.0 to 10.0 and their surface complexation constants were derived. Phosphate adsorption in a 0.7 M NaCl solution increases slightly in the presence of Mg and Ca and decreases at low pH upon the addition of SO4. In contrast, arsenate adsorption is not affected by the presence of Mg or Ca. Phosphate adsorption in seawater is reduced at low pH and enhanced at neutral pH relative to 0.7 M NaCl whereas arsenate adsorption is identical in both solutions except for a decrease at low pH in seawater. The equilibrium model derived by combining the single adsorbate subsystems predicts phosphate and arsenate adsorption in the PO 4-SO4-goethite and AsO4-Ca-goethite systems well, but fails to accurately reproduce the adsorption data in the PO4-Ca-goethite, PO4-Mg-goethite, PO4-seawater-goethite, AsO4-Mg-goethite and AsO4-seawater-goethite systems. The inclusion of ternary surface complexes &gt;FeOMgHPO4-, &gt;FeOMgH2PO 40, &gt;FeOCaHPO4-, &gt;FeOCaH 2PO40, &gt;FeOMgHAsO4- and &gt;FeOMgH2AsO40 in the latter systems improves model fits significantly. Phosphate adsorption in the competitive experiments in seawater is identical to that in the 0.7 M NaCl solution whereas arsenate adsorption in seawater is greater at pH &gt; 7. In competitive experiments in seawater, phosphate adsorption is underpredicted at pH &lt; 6.5 whereas arsenate adsorption is reproduced well using the Constant Capacitance Model (CCM) with the inclusion of the ternary surface complexes. Phosphate and arsenate adsorption by ferrihydrite, in both 0.7 M NaCl and artificial seawater solutions, was studied at particle concentrations of 0.24 g/l and 0.025 g/l between pH 3.0 and 10.0. Both phosphate and arsenate surface complexation can be described using a model comprising three surface intrinsic constants which decrease with decreasing particle concentration. Ferrihydrite is a stronger adsorbent of PO4 and AsO4 on a per mass basis whereas goethite is a stronger sorbent in terms of chemical affinity. The CCM is able to predict PO4 and AsO4 adsorption on a mixture of goethite and ferrihydrite by combining the complexation constants derived from the single adsorbent subsystems. There is no evidence that adsorbed PO4 and AsO4 is released to solution when ferrihydrite is converted to hematite, an iron oxide with a much lower affinity for these oxyanions. The coprecipitation of both PO4 and AsO4 with hematite during the conversion may be responsible for these observations. Finally, the surface complexation constants reported in this thesis may be incorporated into other models and contribute to the development of an experimental and thermodynamic database for marine geochemical systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mucci, Alfonso (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p98x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h29m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m100d"><dcterms:title>G protein specificity of dopamine D2S receptor signaling in cell growth and proliferation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ghahremani, Mohammad H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A wide range of hormonal, developmental and growth factors regulate cellular growth and proliferation events through receptors that couple to heterotrimeric G proteins. Upon activation of the receptor by its ligand the G protein is activated and subsequent dissociation of alpha subunit from betagamma dimer initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events. Dopamine D2 receptors, short form (D2S) and long form (D2L) have been implicated in diverse physiological functions including the regulation of pituitary cell proliferation. Although in neuro-endocrine cells, the D2 receptor is traditionally known as an inhibitory receptor since it couples to "inhibitory" G proteins (Gi/Go), a stimulatory role of this receptor has been reported in many non-neuronal cell systems involving growth-related signaling pathways. In this thesis, I have investigated the role of the dopamine D2S receptor in cell growth under the hypothesis that "D2S receptor couples specifically to multiple combinations of Gi/o protein subtypes to initiate specific signaling pathways contributing to cellular proliferation". At first I have examined the role of D2S-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC). I have shown that D2S receptor activation inhibits cAMP production in Ltk-(LD2S) and Balb/c-3T3 (Balb-D2S) fibroblast cells. This effect is blocked by pertussis toxin, which specifically inactivates Gi/o proteins. Using a series of toxin-insensitive Galphai/o subtypes, I have identified that in LD2S AC inhibition is mediated through Galphai2 when AC is activated by forskolin and through Galphai3 when AC is stimulated by Galphas. In Balb-D2S cells, D2S inhibition of forskolin-inuduced AC is mediated through Galphai2 and Galphai3. Activation of D2S receptor increases Ca+2 mobilization in both cell lines. Unlike inhibition of AC, this action is mediated through Gbetagamma subunits. The D2S receptor induces MAPK activation and increases DNA synthesis in Balb-D2S cells, actions mediated through a combination of G protein subunits. I have shown that MAPK activation is mainly mediated though Galphai2 and Gbetagamma and DNA synthesis is only mediated through Galphai2 and Gbetagamma. Long term activation of D2S receptor in Balb-D2S cells induces cellular transformation and foci formation. I have shown that this effect is mediated through Galphai3, which suggests a different pathway from MAPK activation and DNA synthesis, initiated via specific G proteins, induces cellular transformation. In conclusion, I have shown that activation of dopamine D2S receptor couples to multiple Gi/o protein subtypes to regulate different growth-related pathways. More over, I have reported that the D2S receptor induces cell growth and transformation in fibroblast cells and that the specificity of D2S receptor signaling in these pathways is dictated by G protein subunit and Galphai/o subtype. Take together, this thesis exhibits different levels of specificity in D2S signaling which provides novel insights for diseases involving alterations in G protein coupling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Albert, Paul R.

These methodologies fall into the category of volume tracking methods, with piecewise-linear interface calculation (PLIC). The scope of this work is limited to the laminar, incompressible flow of immiscible, non-reacting Newtonian fluids, without phase change, in planar two-dimensional geometries. The following new or enhanced procedures are proposed: a parallelogram scheme for multidimensional advection of the volume fraction field, that rigorously conserves mass; a circle fit technique for the orientation of the interface segments and the calculation of curvature; a novel contact angle treatment; and a staggered formulation for volumetric body forces that can accurately balance pressure forces in the vicinity of the interface. In addition, surface-tension-derived and hydrostatic-derived pressure corrections are introduced as a novel means of calculating accurate pressure forces in cells that contain the interface, thereby virtually eliminating parasitic currents, or the non-physical flows that afflict many available volume tracking methods. A total of six test problems are presented. The first three test problems do not involve surface tension, and are used to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to accurately simulate two-fluid flows with complex interface deformations. These test problems involve pure advection flows, a collapsing water column, and a Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. The last three test cases are employed to check the effectiveness of the surface tension modelling. Simulations of a static drop indicate that the proposed curvature calculation procedure is of reasonable, but not very high, accuracy, and it is quite successful at maintaining a smooth, high fidelity interface. Next, it is shown that the proposed method can accurately simulate an oscillating bubble. In the final test case, the formation of a meniscus between two parallel plates is simulated. The equilibrium meniscus shape is in good agreement with the analytic meniscus solution. Overall, the proposed method is shown to be capable of accurate and stable simulations of the two-fluid flows considered in this work.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baliga, B. R.
