The first study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which propofol, a commonly used intravenous anesthetic agent, can affect cerebral structures involved in the processing of vibrotactile information. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we demonstrated that propofol interferes with the processing of vibrotactile information first at the level of the cortex before attenuating its transfer through the thalamus. The second study validates the bispectral index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram and the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) as monitors of the level of consciousness during propofol-induced sedation. The ability of those parameters to predict consciousness was excellent. In the third study, we investigated the effect of altering central cholinergic transmission on the loss of consciousness produced by propofol. We concluded from this study that the loss of consciousness produced by propofol is mediated at least in part via interruption of central cholinergic muscarinic transmission.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paus, Thomas (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx977.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97ks35q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848s39t"><dcterms:title>Acceptance threshold's adaptability in fingerprint-based authentication methods</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bocoum, Mounina G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The individuals' authentication is an necessary step in the securization process of any system including a person-machine interface.

The study's objective is to demonstrate the soundness of the threshold's flexibility in biometric authentication systems. The emphasis is put on fingerprint-based methods. The hope is to promote the application of this kind of authentication, in areas such as electronic commerce and cellular telephony. Hence, this research paper starts by presenting the state-of-the art for both these domains. Then, the three existing authentication techniques are explained. The next step is the analysis of potential factors that will cause a threshold's modification. Subsequently, for each of the selected criteria, a computation technique for the threshold's new values is defined. A generalization of the threshold's modification procedure is then exposed. The thesis finally closes, by an implementation of a part of the proposed generic procedure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crepeau, Claude (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Dini, Petre (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204101s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s39t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5x21th32w"><dcterms:title>Grammatical processing in American sign language : effects of age of acquisition and syntactic complexity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boudreault, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated the effects of age of acquisition and syntactic complexity on the outcome of American Sign Language (ASL) acquisition.

In this task, the signer saw dynamic ASL sentences on a computer screen and decided whether they were grammatical or not. Response accuracy and latency were measured. The stimuli were 168 examples of six ASL syntactic structures ranging from simple to complex. Results showed that as age of acquisition increased, response accuracy decreased and response latency increased. Also, as ASL syntactic complexity increased, accuracy decreased and latency generally increased, independent of age of acquisition.

ICAO viewed the merger of several international instruments of private international air law into one legal instrument as a milestone in the history of international law making. However, the rules presented in the Montreal Convention represent principles not unique to the international airline community as they have been tested in the industry for nearly a decade. This thesis analyzes two such provisions, liability and jurisdiction. Chapter One presents the history of the "Warsaw System" and the individual and collective State and private air carrier actions which have given these two principles "face-lifts" throughout the years in order to update their antiquated and unjust effects. Additionally, Chapter One concludes with the drafting history of the Montreal Convention, specifically focusing on the liability and jurisdiction rules. Chapter Two analyzes the liability provisions and the effects that the new two-tier system with its strict liability up to $135,000 U.S. in the first tier and presumed fault---unlimited liability in the second tier will have on the States, carriers, and insurance premiums. Chapter Three explores the consequence of the inclusion of the fifth jurisdiction in the Montreal Convention, a concept which invoked much criticism, yet is not unique to most legal systems of the world. Chapter Three also examines the effects that the fifth jurisdiction coupled with the unlimited liability regime will have on States and carriers alike.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s6628.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n2041022</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Liability for aircraft accidents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jurisdiction</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3484zj62w"><dcterms:title>Wrongful system rights violations and the potential of court-sponsored structural reform</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sharp, Naomi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis highlights the emergence of a wrongful system conception of rights violations. In the modern welfare state, many constitutional rights violations are not discrete, one-off events but instead result from the combined conditions and dynamics of a state-sponsored system. These rights violations are pervasive and ongoing and are detected not through the existence of malevolent intent, but through an assessment of the outcomes and effects of the system on particular groups of individuals. This thesis explains why wrongful system rights violations can only be effectively remedied through detailed structural reform programs. It identifies the nature and main features of such programs. It asks whether and what capacity the courts have to sponsor these kinds of programs. The question of court-sponsored structural reform is approached from an institutional competency perspective that focuses on the courts' remedial capacities. Accordingly, this thesis examines the courts' remedial powers---concentrating on equity---and also the courts' remedial limits. To examine remedial limits, the courts' dominant remedial framework---corrective justice---is examined. The inability of the corrective remedial framework to ground structural reform remedies is discussed, and the disjuncture between court remedial rhetorical and court remedial practice is highlighted. This thesis argues that a strictly corrective remedial framework is inappropriate in constitutional rights adjudication and advocates the development of a broader remedial framework in this field of adjudication, a framework more suited to the development of structural reform remedies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacDonald, Roderick (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nk01c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zj62w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Constitutional law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Judicial power.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Civil rights.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451k51w"><dcterms:title>L'application des règles d'interprétation de la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des traités dans le cadre de l'ALE, de l'ALENA, du GATT, de l'OMC et de l'Union européenne</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Seroin, Isabelle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores the way in which the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties have been applied in the context of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the GATT, the World Trade Organization Agreement and the European Union.

Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). If a buyer suffers damages as a result of a breach of contract, she is entitled to damages under the Convention. The issue in this thesis is whether a buyer may also invoke product liability actions under national tort law if a defective good causes bodily injury or property damage. The provisions of the CISG generally displace national law governing the rights and obligations deriving from a contract of sale. Despite the desirability of removing the uncertainties of foreign liability regimes from international trade, domestic rules of product liability remain, in general, applicable. Only if national tort actions interfere with the core of the Convention's liability regime, must the domestic law be modified.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saumier, G.

Given the existing divergence in approaches and rules relating to agency, the international unification of law in this field, although highly demanded by commercial practice, seems a problematic, but not impossible, task. The decades long efforts of a large number of states, international organisations and individuals to provide uniform rules of international agency law have resulted in the adoption of two conventions, namely, the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Agency (1978) aimed at the unification of the conflict rules of agency, and the UNIDROIT Convention on Agency in the International Sale of Goods (1983) which attempts to provide uniform material rules. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of the uniform rules set out in both agency Conventions. The main purpose of this analysis is to assess the extent to which uniformity is achieved by these Conventions. However, in order to reveal the divergence of approaches between the civil and common law legal systems and define the "conflict areas" of international agency, the present study also contains a comparative survey of material and conflict rules of agency existing in the two systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, W.

In this search, multiple legal and financial frameworks have been created resulting in economic flexibility for carriers, through very complex transactions. Inside this trend of financial arrangements the most frequently used method is to lease the equipment they need. The main concern related to these transactions is that aircrafts are highly movable assets that can travel to various jurisdictions. This faculty supposes a threat to lessors and owners' property interests over the aircraft because property law is encompassed into national laws and are not easily recognized in other countries in cases of controversies centered in a movable good. Chapter I of this thesis will focus on the different types of financing methods used by carriers to procure new equipment.

It is divided into four chapters: (I) an introduction why Transylvania has been selected as a site of analysis; (II) a brief presentation of the ethno-history of Transylvania; (III) an analysis of law focusing on the possibility of applying parallel legal systems, in contemporary states, taking as a case study how Romania might deal with Transylvania; (IV) finding conclusions between utopia and reality. The evolution of the ethnic composition of Transylvania over the centuries is used to illustrate the complexity of the legal and political issues that must be addressed. Several questions of legal theory are then addressed. When does a norm become legal? What is the relationship between Law and state institutions or the relationship between Law and society? Is Law a singular or a pluralist phenomenon? How is Law culturally, historically or politically determined? How can ethnicity or cultural membership be defined in legal terms? The two main justifications for accommodating ethnic minorities through parallel legal systems are then examined: the argument based on the collective rights of national groups; and the argument based on protecting the cultural continuity of a national group. The thesis suggests that thinking about parallel legal system must be grounded in the specific historical, political, ethnic, and legal context of a region. The goal of "The Vampires of Transylvania" is to challenge contemporary legal thinking rather than to provide an absolute final conclusion on the topic of parallel legal systems. Final answers in this field are possible only after legal mythology and ethno-cultural taboos have both been demolished.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macdonald, Roderick A.

This thesis will concentrate on the laws governing the taking of aircraft as security. The draft UNIDROIT Convention, once approved and implemented by states, would introduce a vast degree of economic benefits to airlines and their respective governments, ranging from lower banking interest rates to more credit being generated, all of which will benefit national economies and the traveling public at large.

Second, this thesis will analyse the practical roles that these clauses have played in the two legal traditions, which will illuminate further differences between their respective approaches. Emphasis will be placed on the difficult question, which has arisen in both legal systems, of defining the notion of stipulated damages clauses and of differentiating them from other institutions, such as deposit clauses. Third, the evaluation of these two legal systems will facilitate the contention that the approach of the French civil system is, in most cases, preferable to the solution adopted by the common law.

Based on priori knowledge accumulated from years of practical operations, a set of imprecise and empirical equations are derived to give a description of a CTMP process. The system dynamics which is a key actor in this process control is also presented and analyzed. Due to the imprecise and highly nonlinear characteristic of this system, the need for a proper global optimization algorithm is highlighted. The application of the simulated annealing algorithm is explored in cases of both the mainline and the whole process control. Comparisons of this method with some other optimization methods are characterized in general in terms of feasibility and accuracy. It is shown from experiments that although it is a time consuming algorithm, simulated annealing is suitable for decision making of process manipulations aiming at maximizing profit. Finally, a PI feedback loop is implemented to fulfill this control scheme of the process. Then, with critical system disturbances and high degree process variance under control, an optimal control law is synthesized for the set-point tracking control policies. The controller performance is investigated at the simulation level.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lin, Lin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f7847.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204104m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881n864"><dcterms:title>Mathematical modelling of temperature evolution in the hot rolling of steel</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Purcell, Anne, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The CANMET-McGill Mathematical Model has been expanded and improved to provide a more comprehensive predictive tool for simulation of temperature evolution in the hot rolling of steel. The model uses a Windows(TM)-based, user-friendly, graphical interface and the explicit finite-difference method in two dimensions to simulate the rolling of flat product. Data input options were expanded to allow an initial temperature gradient in the steel to be rolled, the inclusion of a runout table in the calculations, specific chemical compositions and a choice of emissivity values. A novel, chemistry-dependent thermal conductivity term was developed to account for the variation in heat conduction through the thickness of the steel and to ensure that the temperature of the entire cross-section is accurately predicted. In addition, the model now calculates a heat of transformation for phase changes from austenite to ferrite, pearlite and bainite. An automated self-calibration module was included to facilitate the calibration of the model's predictions to empirically obtained temperature setpoints. The model's temperature predictions were validated against both industrial and laboratory data with excellent results.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yue, Steve (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676x56w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n864</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fn65t"><dcterms:title>Load-haul-dump machine automation at Inco's Ontario division</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Poole, Ross, 1949-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is based upon field studies of automation research in Inco mines of the Ontario Division.

Our research has focused on adapting a low bit rate/fixed bit rate audio coder to handle signals at a wide range of bit rates and sampling rates. Bit rates as low as 4 kbps and sampling rates between 4 kHz and 16 kHz were incorporated. Further, the coder can change bit rates during transmission in order to adapt to the available channel bandwidth. The coder was implemented in the C programming language and its performance evaluated. It was found that the quality of the reproduced audio for this coder requires some improvement, but the scalability performs smoothly, with transitions causing no artifacts, and reasonable loss of quality at the lowest bit rates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w424s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z726j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h978"><dcterms:title>Interpolation of linear prediction coefficients for speech coding</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Islam, Tamanna.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Speech coding algorithms have different dimensions of performance. Among them, speech quality and average bit rate are the most important performance aspects. The purpose of the research is to improve the speech quality within the constraint of a low bit rate. Most of the low bit rate speech coders employ linear predictive coding (LPC) that models the short-term spectral information as an all-pole filter. The filter coefficients are called linear predictive (LP) coefficients. The LP coefficients are obtained from standard linear prediction analysis, based on blocks of input samples. In transition segments, a large variation in energy and spectral characteristics can occur in a short time interval. Therefore, there will be a large change in the LP coefficients in consecutive blocks. Abrupt changes in the LP parameters in adjacent blocks can introduce clicks in the reconstructed speech. Interpolation of the filter coefficients results in a smooth variation of the interpolated coefficients as a function of time. Thus, the interpolation of the LP coefficients in the adjacent blocks provides improved quality of the synthetic speech without using additional information for transmission. The research focuses on developing algorithms for interpolating the linear predictive coefficients with different representations (LSF, RC, LAR, AC). The LP analysis has been simulated; and its performance has been compared by changing the parameters (LP order, frame length, window offset, window length). Experiments have been performed on the subframe length and the choice of representation of LP coefficients for interpolation. Simulation results indicate that speech quality can be improved by energy weighted interpolation technique.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zg40q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h978</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87ps31c"><dcterms:title>Interfacial heat transfer of a single belt casting process</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kim, Jinsoo, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Aluminum-magnesium alloys, used in sheet form, provide substantial strengthening with good ductility as a result of cold work, in addition to excellent corrosion resistance and weldability. In this thesis, the microstructures of Al-Mg alloy strips formed on a small scale simulator of a single belt caster was investigated. Heat transfer characteristics heat fluxes and heat transfer coefficients were also evaluated using thermocouple inserts and the IHCP (Inverse Heat Conduction Problem) method to deduce these values. This single belt casting is being developed as a new promising technology high productivity, in which liquid metal is cast from a dispenser system onto a moving belt that is cooled from below with water jets. In this process, the rate of heat transfer from the solidifying strip to the belt is one of the most important factors because the thermal history of the strip has a great influence on strip quality. By measuring two temperature points under the moving substrate of different thermophysical properties, the values of heat flux and heat transfer coefficient were evaluated and microstructures were characterized quantitatively using the IHCP technique. With different substrate chemistry, correlations among liquid metal superheat, substrate velocity, substrate roughness, maximum heat flux, and grain size distributions were investigated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R.

The method of velocity singularities has been originally developed by Mateescu for the analysis of the steady flows past airfoils. This method makes use of special singularities associated to the leading edge and ridges that directly represent the complex perturbation velocity. Closed form solutions were derived for the pressure distributions and for the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the oscillating airfoils with or without oscillating ailerons. The solutions obtained with the velocity singularity method for steady flows past airfoils were found to be in very good agreement with the exact solutions obtained by conformal transformation in the case of thin Joukowski airfoils, as well as with the previous solutions for the case of flexible-membrane airfoils obtained by Mateescu &amp; Newman, Nielsen and Thwaites. For unsteady flows, this method has been validated for airfoils executing oscillatory motions in translation and pitching rotation and for airfoils with ailerons executing oscillatory rotations. The pressure distributions and the aerodynamic forces and moments obtained with the present method were found to be in excellent agreement with the previous solutions obtained by Theodorsen and Postel and Leppert. The method has then been extended to the unsteady flows past airfoils executing flexural harmonic oscillations. Closed form solutions were also derived for the pressure distributions and the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an airfoil with an aileron executing flexural oscillations. No comparisons were presented for the cases of flexural oscillations since there are no previous results known. The present approach displayed an excellent accuracy and efficiency in all problems studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mateescu, Dan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb615.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr56c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816p356"><dcterms:title>Spatial information and environmental decision making : the Windermere Valley, British Columbia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yetman, Gregory George.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Local participation in environmental decision making processes is a recognized need if the goals of sustainable development are to be met. Spatial information is an important part of environmental decision making, but so far, technical barriers have prevented effective public participation in spatial data management and analysis. These barriers need to be overcome if participants are to take part in a decision making process in a manner that is both fair and competent. The study was undertaken to quantify land cover change in a particular region and, through this exercise, to determine what the practical barriers to public participation in decision making might be. The work was conducted in the Windermere Valley, British Columbia. Community questions about local environmental change were determined from a local newspaper and discussions with Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (ENGO's). Using satellite imagery and other geospatial data, community questions about local environmental change were answered through the detection of land cover change for the period 1974--1991. The processes of acquiring the data and completing the analysis were evaluated with the criteria of fairness and competence. The products of the change detection analysis were evaluated based on how well they answered community questions. Suggestions are presented on what tools and resources ENGO's would require to complete a similar study to answer questions about the environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meredith, Thomas (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m5893.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816p356</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Remote-sensing images.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Windermere Lake Region (B.C.) -- Remote-sensing images.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental management -- British Columbia -- Windermere Lake Region.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
