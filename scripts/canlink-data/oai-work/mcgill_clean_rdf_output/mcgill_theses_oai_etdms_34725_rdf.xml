While taking into account the psychoanalytical and philosophical approaches to Kleist, this project has Heiner Miller's words as its point of departure: that the theater represents the collision of ideas with the body. The forces of power, gender and authority leave their traces of this collision on the bodies of his characters, whose metaphorical and literal falls, wounds and recoveries speak their own gestural language. This study is organized on the principle of Kleist's use of genre designation, the approximate chronological order of his plays, and the representation of the body. Chapter one focuses on Die Familie Schroffenstein, Der zerbrochne Krug, and Amphitryon and the notion of bodily authenticity and integrity; chapter two, on Die Hermannsschlacht and Penthesilea, looks at the spectacle of violence and its effect on the body mobilized by emotional extremity; the third chapter, on Kleist's most celebrated works, Prinz Friedrich von Homburg and Das Kathchen von Heilbronn, examines aspects of gender and vulnerability. The conclusion views his essay "Uber das Marionettentheater" not as a key to understanding his works, but rather as a culmination of them, and investigates Kleist's writing on the wounded body and its connection to grace.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peters, Paul (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f3016.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rj88s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kleist, Heinrich von, 1777-1811 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body, Human, in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sx63d"><dcterms:title>Design and implementation of biosystem control and tools for biosystem simulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Molenaar, Robert.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At present, compared to our scientific knowledge of how natural biosystems function, we have practically no knowledge of how to engineer biosystems, i.e., how to design, build, repair, maintain, operate, and modify them in a rational and knowledgeable manner. Thus, the EcoCyborg research project was established with the basic intent of making a contribution to the science and engineering of biosystems. This thesis covers three important arms of study within the overall framework of the EcoCyborg project. The first area is the development and implementation of a workbench for simulation based on composite models. The workbench was designed to accommodate easy integration, synchronization and communication of a number of independent modules. It was developed for use under OS/2 Warp, an operating system that supports multi-process simulation. The functionality of the workbench was tested with a composite model of an EcoCyborg. This composite model contained submodels of an ecosystem, two control systems, and several forcing functions. The second area is the development and implementation of control systems for biosystems. The control system was intended to guide an ecosystem so that its behavior would best achieve the goals of the controllers which, in this case, were related to the populations of the ecosystem's species. The major part of the work on the control systems was focused on the Pavlovian controller. It mainly covered the investigation of the possibilities to develop and to implement a physiological-level Pavlovian controller. The thesis also presents results from a preliminary investigation on the design and implementation of a cognitive controller. From this, a relatively simple cognitive controller was developed to complement the action of the Pavlovian controller. The third area is the experimental use of the workbench, and of the Pavlovian and cognitive controllers. For this, ecosystems having various constitutions and their forcing functions were modeled and used in the simulation. Pavlovian controllers with on-off, proportional and proportional plus integral mechanisms were used to control the populations. The cognitive controller was used to maintain minimum population of the various species in the ecosystem. In general, the workbench that was developed was found suitable to accommodate the simulation of an EcoCyborg composite model. The tools that ware developed for constructing and implementing the Pavlovian controller were tested and found practical and effective for use in constructing Pavlovian controllers of various configurations. The results of the work on the cognitive controller provided useful information for its further development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kok, Robert (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tn68t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx63d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biological control systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biological systems -- Computer simulation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biotic communities -- Computer simulation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257g743"><dcterms:title>Integration of a geographic information system and a continuous nonpoint source pollution model to evaluate the hydrologic response of an agricultural watershed</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mousavizadeh, Mohammad Hassan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The environmental impact of agricultural activities on water quality was studied on two sub-watersheds of the L'Assomption river in Quebec, over a 3 year period. The sub-watersheds studied were the Saint Esprit (26.1 km 2) and Desrochers (17.9 km2). Development of a methodology and associated tools for targeting conservation activities and assessing the potential impacts of conservation practices was one of the study's components. A goal of this research was the development of a tool using NPS modelling capability and GIS tools. The ANSWERS 2000 model and SPANS GIS software were selected for integration. Using the advanced SPANS operation and EASI script language, the ANSWERS 2000 model was integrated into the latest version of SPANS GIS (Explorer ver. 7). Integration of these two software packages provided assistance in creating and handling the extensive input and output data for models, evaluating of model output, and delineating of critical areas. A sensitivity analysis of the ANSWERS model was performed on thirteen parameters to determine their effects on runoff ANSWERS 2000 was found to be most sensitive to depth of soil horizon, silt and clay contents of soil texture, and solar radiation. Four years of runoff predictions by the model were analysed using observed data. Overall, the model was in good agreement with observed runoff in the Saint Esprit watershed, particularly in the years with above the average precipitation. The coefficient of (CP'A) between predicted and observed runoff values was 0.5 and 1.5 for 1994 and 1995, respectively. The model predictions of total cumulative runoff were 66.6% in 1994, 54.9% in 1995, 71.7% in 1996, and 42.4% in 1997, of measured cumulative runoff values.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C.

It is my contention that, first, every version of the story appears to be dictated by the purpose of informing the 'ignorant'---namely those unaware of how events truly unfolded---in order to complete a narrative that, from beginning to end "interamente si contenga;" second, that this repetition ensures the unity of the work as a whole. Moreover, the gradual process leading to full information runs parallel, I believe, to the gradual process of Florio's coming of age, from his fallacious "imagining" to his acquisition of "real knowledge." With my interpretation I wish to shed light on one aspect of Boccaccio's poetics, that is, the way he opposes his full, well-founded and consistent account to the "fabulosi parlari degli ignoranti." On a quite different level, the repetition of the same story can be linked to Boccaccio's penchant for experimenting with the art of storytelling. I have followed throughout the text of the Filocolo leaving aside, however, Book I, which concerns the parents of the two lovers and is essentially just a premise to the story. The division of my dissertation in four chapters reflects the two distinct phases that, in my opinion, characterize the narration: the 'outward journey' (Chapters I--III) and the 'return journey' (Chapter IV). In Chapter II I deal with the much discussed episode of the Questioni d'amore, that takes place in Naples during a pause in the outward journey. In the Appendix I analyze the phenomenology of death, both actual and 'verbal,' which allows me to explore further the character and personality of Florio and Biancifiore.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Predelli, Maria (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cv72s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741t542</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Boccaccio, Giovanni, 1313-1375.

Whereas death is the paradigmatic object of laughter in the premodern period, animate or thinking matter is the prevailing object of laughter in modernity. The change is located in texts of the English baroque period from 1607 to 1767. Baroque discourse is defined by the language developed by writers loyal to both the Christian and the Copernican world views. Contradictory allegiances required them to institute a narratorial position based on simultaneous attachment to and detachment from a single point of view. This position is the defining feature of baroque discourse, the basis of both the perspective of modem science and the animation of multiple viewpoints in the modern novel. The Nose of Death develops Walter Benjamin's reading of baroque "muting" and "fragmentation," processes that free matter, language, and time for alternative composition. The dissertation likewise adapts M. M. Bakhtin's account of the "grotesque method," considered as the approach to language and the human body that the modern "scientific method" posits itself against. This study treats baroque novelistic discourse in forgotten texts drawn from McGill's Redpath Tracts by Thomas Tomkis, Thomas D'Urfey, Tobias Swinden, and a selection of anonymously authored pamphlets. It considers, as well, two early medical works by Robert Boyle and Walter Charleton. Analogous fragments are similarly analyzed from three canonical works: Robert Burton, The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), Samuel Richardson, Clarissa, or The History of a Young Lady (1747--48), and Laurence Sterne, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759--67).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hensley, David C.

The objective of the project was to obtain quantitative measurements of constituents in a medium in which the absorption and scattering optical properties vary. Initially the project was divided into two separate experiments, namely multiwavelength steady state and time resolved measurements. Both methods are applicable to complex media, providing information related to absorption and scattering. The first phase was the study of Near Infrared diffuse reflectance for the determination of pulmonary edema. Non-contact pulmonary edema measurements were made on in vitro isolated perfused animal lungs. Multispectral analysis with Partial Least Squares (PLS) depicted three distinct changes associated with fluid increase: an increase in the O-H absorption, a decrease in the C-H absorption, and a decrease in the spectral baseline or scattering contribution. PLS estimates of relative water content had an R2 of 0.973 with a standard error 10.6 +/- 2.9% relative to the weight of lung. The behavior of light in a highly scattering medium is a complex phenomenon. A method is described using analytical descriptors for the separate determination of the absorption and scattering properties from time resolved photon distributions. Estimates with the analytical descriptors were tested using simulated data generated from the time dependent diffusion equation. Objective selections of the descriptors were made using a Stepwise Multi-Linear Regression technique to independently estimate the absorption and scattering coefficients. In a medium where scattering and absorption vary simultaneously multiple parameters are required for quantitative estimates. Relative standard errors of less than 0.5% were obtained with the analytical descriptors estimates. Estimates using the analytical descriptors were tested experimentally with the use of a photon time-of-flight instrument. Different light collection geometries and their relation to the descriptors were investigated in both transmittance and reflectance configuration. Absorption and scattering estimations of less than 9% error were attained for both collection geometries. Information on both the absorption and scattering properties in highly variable media can assist in quantitative multispectral measurement. A method was developed whereby a multiwavelength scatter correction was made using optical coefficients determined from time resolved distributions. Optical coefficient corrected estimates produced a 70% improvement in the error over non-corrected spectra. The study suggests a practical method to correct and quantitate constituent measurements in variable media.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burns, David H.

Reduced functioning of the serotonergic system hypothetically increases alcohol intake in both animals and humans. In this thesis, it was proposed that the effect of lowered serotonergic function on alcohol intake is mediated by an increase in disinhibition. The hypothesis that lowered serotonin increases disinhibition was tested in separate groups of individuals at high risk for the development of psychopathology: nonalcoholic young men with a strong family history of paternal alcoholism, and adolescent men with previous histories of physically aggressive behavior. Lowered serotonergic synthesis (and thus presumably function) was experimentally induced through a transient dietary reduction in the availability of the amino add precursor of serotonin, tryptophan. Disinhibition was quantified using a go/no-go task previously shown to characterize psychopaths and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as disinhibited. In the first study, acute tryptophan depletion had no effect on aggressive responding on a modified competitive reaction time aggression task, but increased disinhibition in young men at risk for alcoholism. This effect was independent of the tryptophan depletion-induced mood alterations. The effect tryptophan depletion on disinhibition was not replicated in the second study with previously aggressive adolescent men. A number of explanations for this were posited, including the presence of a ceiling effect. An association between disinhibition and executive functioning (cognitive abilities associated with proper functioning of the prefrontal cortex, such as working memory, planning abilities) was demonstrated in the second study.

The model assumes that people generate an ordering of a finite set of symbolic stimuli on the basis of information contained in the pairwise relations between adjacent stimulus items. The learning of this ordering is simulated within a simple connectionist framework. The decision-making component of the model utilizes 2 separate evidence accrual processes operating in parallel. One process accumulates information about the positional difference between the stimulus items being compared, and the other accumulates information about the endpoint status of each of those items. A response occurs whenever enough evidence favouring it has been accumulated within either of these processes. The model also assumes that the congruencies between the positions of the stimulus items within the ordering and the form of the comparative instruction can lead to either interfering or facilitating effects on the rate of evidence accumulation within each of these accrual processes. To test the model, data are obtained from the single-session performances of a group of 16 subjects and the multiple-session performances of an additional 2 subjects. The task is a variant of the one used by Trabasso, Riley, and Wilson (1975) and involves paired comparisons of ordered symbolic stimuli (three-letter names). Simulations of the model provide an excellent account of the group mean correct response times, as well as a very good account of the full set of data obtained from the 2 additional subjects (including percentage correct and response time distributional data).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marley, A.

The first one, an active set algorithm for inverse treatment planning employs a conjugate gradient routine for subspace minimization in order to achieve a higher rate of convergence than the widely used constrained steepest descent method at the expense of a negligeable amount of overhead calculations and storage. The active set algorithm is found to be superior to the constrained steepest descent in terms of both its convergence properties and the residual value of the cost functions at termination. The active set approach can significantly accelerate the process of inverse treatment planning by decreasing the number of time consuming dose calculations. The second algorithm employs a continuous penalty function method to solve approximately a large-scale constrained minimization problem which reflects the goal of sparing healthy tissues as much as possible while delivering the necessary tumorcidal dose. The performance of the continuous penalty function method is optimized by a numerical investigation of a few integration schemes and a pair of weighting functions which influence the performance of the method. Clinical examples are presented that illustrate possible applications of the techniques in the context of multi-objective optimization. An image correlation based algorithm for automatic registration of pairs of portal images has also been developed. Accounting for both in-plane translations and rotations, the algorithm uses fast-Fourier-transforms and a sequential approach to speed up the registration without degrading the accuracy of the match. The technique has also been applied to the automatic registration of portal images to digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) which have been modified to resemble megavoltage images. The results indicate the feasibility of this approach as a tool for treatment setup verification.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fallone, B. G.

Independent ligation of CD4 prior to anti-TcRbeta versus anti-CD3epsilon induced activation, precludes alphabetaTcR induced, but not CD3epsilon induced signalling in primary CD4+ T cells. Thus, CD4 pretreatment Prior to activation with these antibodies correlates with an apparently uncoupled antigen receptor complex in primary CD4+ T cells. Moreover, CD4 pretreatment prior to activation with anti-TcRbeta can also activate alphabetaTcR induced programmed cell death in primary CD4+ T cells. These results indicate that CD4 can exert a negative effect on alphabetaTcR induced signalling. We recapitulate these findings in a CD4+, interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent T cell clonal system, and we observe that one plausible mechanism for the negative effect associated with the expression of CD4, is the ability of CD4 to sequester its associated Ick. In physiological circumstances, this would ensure that CD4+ T cell activation requires MHC restricted antigen presentation. Moreover, non-productive anti-TcRbeta induced signalling in the CD4 + clones is alleviated by the withdrawal of exogenous IL-2 with concomitant accumulation of cells in G0/g1. In subcellular fractionation studies, we demonstrate that the two plasma membrane-bound pools of Ick (ie. that pool which is associated with CD4 and that pool which is non-CD4 associated), are both kinase active in quiescent CD4+ cells, while both pools are kinase inactive in CD4+ IL-2 blasts. Thus, the rescue of anti-TcRbeta induced growth in quiescent CD4+ cells correlates with the presence of kinase active Ick on the plasma membrane. The results indicate that of the two membrane-bound pools of Ick, antigen induced activation likely utilizes the CD4 associated pool, and anti-TcRbeta likely utilizes only the non-CD4 associated pool. Since anti-CD3epsilon induced signalling is intact in CD4+ IL-2 blasts, we present the findings that IL-2 can functionally uncouple alphabetaTcR/CD3 complex signalling, by altering critical signals provided by p56Ick .</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Julius, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn24b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752j53t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw37638765"><dcterms:title>The impact of the dissolution of the monasteries on patronage structures in Yorkshire and East Anglia /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Housez, Janis Claire.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, the dissolution of the monasteries is treated as an event in the history of patronage relationships between the English crown and local patronage groups. In a comparative approach, the regions of East Anglia and Yorkshire are examined in search of patronage-related differences that help to explain the contrasts in regional political responses to the dissolutions. The first section deals with aspects of patronage in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, exploring through test cases the normal patterns of patronage on monastic estates and the estates of lay landlords and the Crown. Normal durations in tenure, remuneration and networking patterns are explored, in order to show what expectations monastic servants would have held as to the effects of the dissolutions on the duration and value of their positions as well as the creative or destructive impact of the dissolutions on patronage networking. The second section then analyzes patronage on the monastic estate under the management of the Court of Augmentations, following through in case studies the patronage impact of the sale of major blocks of monastic property to lay landlords in either region. The study finds that the northern region underwent more severe patronage dislocation than was the case in East Anglia, partly on account of long-term structural conditions and partly because of the differences in the more immediate political relations between the crown and elites in either region.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maxwell, M.

The study traces; the work of four German and four Italian historians, and highlights the establishment of the history seminar at the University of Vienna (1850). The founding of the Institute of Austrian History in Vienna (1854--1855), marked the beginning of a specialized study of history in the Habsburg Monarchy. The philosophical reforms, launched in 1849 by Count Leopold Thun, were successfully implemented in Austria, but faced defiance in the Lombardy-Venetia, where universities were hotbeds of nationalism and insurgency. Nevertheless, the appointment of a Vienna-trained historian at the University of Padova (1855), and the founding of philological-historical seminars at the Universities of Pavia (1856) and Padova (1858), paved the way for the eventual professionalization of the study of history in Italy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hoffmann, P.

To clarify its biochemical properties, CDH was purified from cultures of T. versicolor. Two isoforms of CDH were found: a 97 kDa isoform with both heme and flavin cofactors, and an 81 kDa isoform with a flavin cofactor. Both isoforms of CDH were found to be quite non-specific in their reductive half reactions. The flavin enzyme catalyzed many of the same reactions as the heme/flavin enzyme, but less efficiently. The flavin isoform reduced Fe(III) and Cu(II) only at concentrations well above those found physiologically. Thus the heme/flavin enzyme, but not the flavin enzyme, could be involved in promoting and sustaining the generation of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) by Fenton's chemistry. To characterize further the structural features of CDH, a genomic clone was isolated and sequenced. CDH was found to consist of 748 amino acids, without its predicted 19 amino acid signal peptide. Consistent with the domain structure of other CDHs, T. versicolor CDH appeared to be divided into an amino terminal heme domain and a carboxy terminal flavin domain, connected by a hydroxyamino acid-rich linker. Within the flavin domain, a putative cellulose-binding domain (CBD) was found by alignment to the hypothesized CBD of P. chrysosporium CDH. The CBD of CDH appeared to be structurally unrelated to other CBDs which have been reported. A cDNA clone encoding T. versicolor CDH was isolated by RT-PCR. Using this clone, three vectors for the heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae of CDH were prepared. These vectors were built by performing in-frame fusions of the cDNA to control sequences from the highly expressed A. oryzae amylase gene. These vectors were transformed into A. oryzae and one strain was isolated which contained the expression construct DNA. A rapid method for cloning cdh-like genes was developed. Using short stretches of amino acids completely conserved within T. versicolor and P. chrysosporium CDH, PCR primers were designed to amplify a homologous gene from other fungi. The primers were tested using genomic DNA of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus. A 1.8-kb fragment of P. cinnabarinus cdh was thereby amplified and cloned, and its sequence was determined. The three CDHs displayed very high homology at the amino acid level. Finally, to probe the role of CDH in lignocellulose degradation by T. versicolor, a "knockout" vector was constructed consisting of a phleomycin-resistance cassette inserted into the protein coding sequence of cloned T. versicolor cdh. T. versicolor was transformed with the knockout vector and the transformants were analyzed for their CDH-producing phenotype. Three isolates were found that produced no detectable CDH. Biobleaching and delignification by the CDH(-) strains appeared to be unaffected, suggesting that CDH does not play an important role in these processes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Archibald, Fred (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd51w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh49m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wood-pulp -- Bleaching.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cellobiose dehydrogenase.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lignin -- Biodegradation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trametes versicolor.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw66345576"><dcterms:title>Carving lives from stone : visual literacy in an African cottage industry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Esbin, Howard Bennett.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is scant research within educational literature on the nature of visual cognition, language, and expression in relation to cross-culturally driven socio-cognitive and socio-economic development. Indeed, the integrated, multi-disciplinarian approach needed to address the nature of this complex relationship is still being devised. This dissertation examines a community of artisans located in Kenya's remote western highlands. Over the past ninety years, the community has developed a unique soapstone carving cottage industry. This creative commercial response to the pernicious effects of Western acculturation has somewhat mitigated the severe environmental, demographic, and economic stresses being experienced by most other Gusii communities in the region. The community-cottage industry's structural and longitudinal dynamics meld traditional artisanal and social practice to Western market mores. However, the industry could not have evolved, nor could it have sustained itself, without a corps of competent artisan-merchants. The creation of such a corps is the result of a distinctive bi-modal educational system consisting of both indigenous training and Western-style schooling. This system, in its totality, helps to develop the requisite cognitive, affective, psychomotor, and linguistic skills essential to artisanal-mercantile practice. Consequently, participating Gusii youth generally graduate knowing how to produce and market soapstone carvings. This dissertation, drawing from studies in history, economics, psychology, sociology, ethnography, phenomenology, communications, and aesthetics, examines the foundation and growth of this cottage industry as well as its bi-modal education system in tam of its socialization patterns and learning processes. These patterns and processes are related to cross-cultural theories of socio-cognitive and socio-linguistic development and learning. One of the principle features of this particular educational system involves the of visual acumen among its trainees. Such an enhanced faculty is for those whose livelihoods depend literally on pleasing the eyes of Western consumers. Explication of this system, therefore, provides the necessary framework within which to consider the central role that visual cognition, Language and expression plays in the cottage industry.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182m971.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66345576</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stone carving -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Visual literacy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w1519"><dcterms:title>Generalized log-domain integrator structure &amp; its application to the synthesis of high-frequency and low-voltage log-domain filters</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>El-Gamal, Mourad.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The recent trend towards increasing the operating frequency of integrated analog processors while lowering the supply voltages results in a serious reduction of the dynamic range of the signals. To cope with those conditions, a new signal processing scheme has recently emerged known as "log-domain signal processing". Circuit realizations based on this scheme operate in current-mode and therefore have potential for high-frequency as well as low-voltage applications. This thesis proposes a versatile log-domain integrator structure which enables the synthesis of arbitrary and general filter topologies. The structure is verified through detailed mathematical analysis of two examples: The first one is an LC-ladder-based filter, while the second one is a state-space-based filter. An integrator circuit based on this structure, and employing only NPN transistors, is used in the design of a second-order prototype filter chip, fabricated in a 0.8 mum BiCMOS process. The circuit achieves a maximum operating frequency of 220 MHz. A new fully-differential log-domain integrator circuit is then proposed. It is used in the design of a low-power distortion fourth-order bandpass filter, and of a VHF oscillator. Both were integrated in a BiCMOS prototype chip, along with a digital phase-locked-loop (PLL) for automatic tuning. The filter's intermodulation distortion is -45.6 dB at 83 MHz, and reaches a maximum frequency of 130 MHz. The oscillator's total harmonic distortion is -40 dB at 82 MHz, and reaches a maximum operating frequency of 162 MHz. These figures suggest a potential for log-domain filters and oscillators in very high-frequency applications. Finally, a novel and elegant 1.2 V log-domain integrator is proposed and fabricated using the Gennum GA911 bipolar transistor array. It is used to build a third-order class-A lowpass filter. The dynamic range of the filter is 42.1 dB for a cutoff frequency of 1.5 MHz. It consumes 282 muW per pole. This combination of low-voltage and reasonable dynamic range again suggests a potential for log-domain filters in many low-power microelectronics applications.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k35h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w1519</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988m80b"><dcterms:title>Self-sacrifice, caring and peace : a socio-ethical preface to feminist theology</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dyck, Veronica H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a critical survey of selected feminist writings on topics of interest to Christian, feminist thinkers.

This survey indicates directions and tendencies within works on virtues connected to women's work and gendered ideological assumptions about public and private spheres. A summary of the contribution and themes of this thesis includes using critical social theory to uncover ideological distortions such as those perpetuated by patriarchy. The thesis highlights how a feminist critique contributes to the debate on values and virtues, pointing out biases which previously hid the contributions of women. An important theme uncovered using these critical tools is the dualist division between the public and the private spheres which reinforce gendered social and moral roles. The discussion is structured around three virtues with an emphasis on praxis, that is, since values arise out of shared practices, these values are inherently teachable and able to contribute to an evolving understanding of moral principles which break from and/or enhance traditional liberal understandings of these principles. Finally, connections are made with the gospel and utopian values grounded in a Christian vision of the kingdom of God.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baum, Gregory (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010r89f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988m80b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caring -- Religious aspects -- Christianity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Altruism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminist theology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peace -- Religious aspects -- Christianity.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wm02p"><dcterms:title>Analysis of the combined primary data from case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer : a pilot study of three North-American sites</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Catalan, Vanessa Spurll.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. Radon gas is a naturally occurring, radioactive contaminant of indoor air. Based on extrapolations from occupational epidemiologic studies in underground miners, as many as 10--14% of lung cancer deaths may be attributable to radon exposure. Such extrapolations involve many sources of uncertainty. The individual results of the eight major completed studies investigating residential exposures have been equivocal. Inadequate statistical power is a substantial problem in their interpretation. To mitigate this problem, an analysis of the combined primary data from the three completed North American studies has been undertaken. Methods. Individual-level data were received from Winnipeg, Canada, and New Jersey and Missouri, USA and compiled into a common format. Radon exposure was expressed both in cumulative working level months (WLM) and as average intensity in Becquerels per cubic metre. Parallel logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify a common model for the prediction of lung cancer rate ratio which would adjust for all matching variables and risk factors (including potential confounders) determined to be important in at least one site. Next, a combined analysis utilized a random-effects model to obtain the most realistic assessment to date of the rate ratio of lung cancer as a function of residential radon exposure. Sensitivity of the results to exposure time window definition and statistical model form (exponential logistic versus additive excess relative risk) was also investigated. Results. Estimated arithmetic mean (standard error) cumulative exposures among population controls for the period 5 to 50 years prior to subject ascertainment were 4.6 (2.6), 10.2 (6.3), and 16.7 (9.9) weighted WLMs in New Jersey, Missouri, and Winnipeg, respectively. During this same exposure period, the estimated rate ratio [and 95% confidence interval] was 0.94 [0.52, 1.72] per increment of 10 weighted WLMs radon exposure, and 0.98 [0.84, 1.14] per increment of 100 Bq/m3 weighted average radon concentration. No or negligible differences were observed in the estimated radon effect between sites. Conclusions. At the observed levels of radon exposure, the log-linear and linear excess relative risk models provided indistinguishable fits to the data. Modification of the weighting factors did not affect radon effect estimates. Statistical and other sources of uncertainty preclude a definitive conclusion with respect to the magnitude of effect of residential radon on lung cancer.

A randomized field trial was conducted in 52 DCCs in Quebec. One or two toddler groups in each DCC were followed between September 1st, 1996 and November 30, 1997. Absences for any reasons and the daily occurrence of colds and/or diarrhea in toddlers were recorded on calendars by the DCC educators. Questionnaires to the DCC director and on-site visits were used to measure potential confounding variables. The number of fecal coliforms (FC) on children's hands, on educators' hands, in the sandbox and in the playarea of each DCC was measured during three unannounced visits. Participating parents were asked to record on a 15-month calendar the occurrence of colds and diarrhea in the child and the actions taken when s/he was ill. Overall, 1,729 children were followed in 47 DCCs for a total of 153,643 child-days. The incidence rate of diarrhea was significantly reduced by the effect of monitoring alone (IRR = 0.73, 95% BCI = 0.54, 0.97) but not significantly reduced by the intervention whereas the intervention had an effect in reducing the IR of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) (IRR = 0.80, 95% BCI = 0.68, 0.93) but the monitoring did not. Monitoring also had a significant effect in reducing the level of bacterial contamination on children's and educators' hands. Overall estimates of the IRs of respiratory and diarrheal infections based on parents' data were higher than those based on educators' data (difference of 0.81 episode of diarrhea and 2.2 episodes of URTI per child-DCC year-at-risk). During the 6-month pre-intervention period, the average direct, indirect and total costs per child due to the study illnesses were $132.06, $235.58 and $367.64, respectively.

In Study 1, 72 year-old healthy men and women estrogen-users performed better than estrogen non-users on Forward and Total Digit Span, which test attention and short-term memory, concomitant with their higher E2 levels. The estrogen-users performed better than the men and the non-users on Delayed Selective Reminding, a test of explicit verbal memory.

The ENM approach is based on the Principal Component Analysis (which consists of finding the most efficient basis explaining the variance of a time series), except that it takes advantage of wave-activity conservation laws. In the present work, the small-amplitude version of the pseudoenergy is used to extract from data quasi-monochromatic three-dimensional empirical modes that describe atmospheric wave activity. The spatial distributions of these quasi-monochromatic modes are identical to the normal modes of the linearized primitive equations when the underlying dynamics can be described with a stochastic linear and forced model, thus establishing a bridge between statistics and dynamics. We use this diagnostic method to study inertia-gravity wave generation, propagation, transience, and breaking over the Rockies, the North Pacific, and Central America in the troposphere-stratosphere-mesosphere GFDL SKYHI general circulation model at a resolution of 18° of latitude by 1.2° of longitude. Besides the action of mountains in exciting orographic waves, inertia-gravity wave activity has been found to be generated at the jet stream level as a possible consequence of a sustained nonlinear and ageostrophic flow. In the Tropical region of the model, the "obstacle effect" has been found to be the major source of inertia-gravity waves. A significant proportion of these inertia-gravity waves was able to reach the model mesosphere without much dissipation and absorption.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Warn, Tom (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67315697.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g195m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117q661"><dcterms:title>DNA encapsulation within membrane coated alginate beads</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Quong, Douglas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alginate beads produced by both external and internal gelation techniques were Studied so as to determine the optimal bead matrix structure within which DNA can be immobilized for in vim application. Alginates were characterized for guluronic/marmuronic acid (G/M) content and average molecular weight. Non-homogeneous calcium, alginate and DNA distributions were found within gels made by the external gelation method because of the external calcium source used. In contrast, the internal gelation method produces more homogeneous gels. The encapsulation yield of DNA was over 97 and 80% for beads formed using external and internal gelation methods, respectively. DNA molecular weight cut-off was determined to be 394 kDa for both external and internal gelled beads. DNA alginate beads produced using both external and internal calcium sources were coated with chitosan, poly-L-lysine or co-guanidine membranes. For chitosan and poly-L-lysine, membrane thickness increased with decreasing molecular weight and increasing degree of deacetylation (chitosan). Co-guanidine membranes were shown to form intact ionically complexed membranes on alginate beads, serving as an alternative to the commonly used polymers; poly-L-lysine and chitosan. The co-guanidine membranes thickness increased with increasing concentration and coating time. The beads were assayed with DNAse nuclease to determine optimal membrane matrix combinations offering the highest level of DNA protection from nucleic acid hydrolysis, simulating gastrointestinal exposure. An extractive electrophoresis method was also developed to extract and assay intracapsular DNA by measuring its molecular size range. Almost total hydrolysis of DS-DNA was observed in alginate beads and chitosan coated beads following nuclease exposure. The casting of membranes reduced the permeability of alginate beads, shown by the enhanced retention of DNA residuals (i.e. double- and single-stranded DNA, polynucleatides, bases) after DNAse exposure. The highest level of DNA protection was obtained with high molecular weight (197.1 kDa) poly-L-lysine and high concentration (5 mg/ml) co-guanidine membranes coated on beads formulated using an external calcium source, where over 80 and 90% of the DS-DNA remained after 40 min of DNAse exposure. Guanidine membranes were capable of fully excluding DNAse nuclease with a molecular weight of 31 kDa. Lyophilization and rehydration of DNA beads also reduced permeability to nucleases, resulted in DNA recoveries following nuclease exposure of 60% for chitosan coated, 90% for poly-L-lysine coated, and 95% for alginate beads. Soluble chitosan and poly-L-lysine are readily hydrolyzed using lysozyme or chitmanase for chitosan, and trypsin, chymotrypsin or proteinase K for poly-L-lysine. In contrast, chitosan and poly-L-lysine membranes were almost inert to the respective hydrolytic enzymes, with less than 2% of the membrane weight being hydrolyzed. It appeared that either membrane material would be stable for in vivo application, and in particular in the protection of DNA during gastrointestinal transit Intracapsular DNA was accessible to the carcinogen ethidium bromide, which showed a 4 fold increase in uptake in uncoated beads and 2 fold uptake in co-guanidine coated beads compared to beads lacking DNA. Low molecular weight cut-off co-guanidine membranes appear to provide free diffusional access to low molecular weight carcinogens or mutagens.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q5836.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q661</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g6776"><dcterms:title>Functions of grade-six students' evaluations and goals as they revise their writing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Richard, Rhonda J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research examined how sixth-grade students utilized evaluations and goals while revising their texts, to determine if those students who were identified as better writers also had more success when revising, and if specific types or configurations of operations lead to more successful revision.

Goals were categorized as text strategy or guidance goals, depending on whether they instituted a specific strategy to counter a perceived problem in the text, or instituted a procedure or action that constituted management of the revision task. Think-aloud protocols and drafts of compositions provided a trace of students' revision activity. Identification of evaluations and goals by the functions that they served during revision provided a method for monitoring the connection between the process students used in revising and the product (if any) that resulted. Revisions produced were categorized as surface or text-base, with both their accumulative and individual impact on the text assessed. The coding system identified all evaluations and goals, even those that did not result in text changes but that were associated with considerations and attempts. Therefore, all revising behaviors, including emerging skills, were acknowledged. Results revealed that those students identified as better writers were not better revisors in terms of using evaluations or goals in a manner that resulted in the production of more sophisticated or more effective revisions. Students identified as low to high level writers all experienced various revision difficulties, as reflected by the absence of specific types of evaluations and/or goals that could have facilitated revision, yet were not used. Terminal revising was the common approach and involved reviewing a textual area only once, and setting a limited number of evaluations and goals to address a perceived problem. However, a sub-group of students who were identified as poorer writers did use an iterative revising strategy, which resulted in improved text quality. This strategy involved successive reviews of the text, resulting in the implementation of related multiple evaluations and goals addressing one textual area. Educators can consider the revising strategies (i.e., terminal and iterative revising) and operations (i.e., functional evaluations and goals) specifically identified in this research to assess how students' revise and to determine what strategies and operations need to be encouraged to foster absent or underdeveloped revision skills. Collaborative student and teacher interactions designed to encourage the utilization of these specific strategies and operations have the potential to lead to more effective revising.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bracewell, Robert J.

The relations among children's behaviours were examined during teaching sessions conducted either by children's mother or an unfamiliar examiner. Specifically, the relations between children's compliance with instructional requests and their attention, affect (positive and negative), and inappropriate behaviours (inappropriate object use, inappropriate vocalizations, inappropriate sitting, wandering, and self-directed behaviour) were examined. In both studies, highly compliant children showed less negative affect and were more attentive to the tasks than were less compliant children. Highly attentive children, in turn, showed less out-of-seat behaviour/wandering, less inappropriate object use, and less negative affect, than did less attentive children. In the second study, the hypothesis that delayed children may have greater difficulties with self-regulation than nondelayed children was investigated by examining-the effects of task difficulty on children's behaviour and affect during instruction. The responses of preschoolers with developmental delays Were compared to those of their nondelayed peers during two types of tasks (verbal and visual-perceptual) presented at three levels of difficulty (easy, moderate, and difficult). The tasks were presented in a standardized manner by an unfamiliar adult to minimize extraneous sources of variation in children's responding. To ensure that children in all groups received comparably difficult tasks, task difficulty was defined using an individualized procedure. Thus, group differences in children's responses to task requests could not be attributed to differences in their level of developmental functioning. Finally the associations between children's behaviours and task performance were examined to identify the behaviours that contributed to task success. The results indicated that even when given comparably difficult tasks, children with delays showed less tolerance for task demands than did their nondelayed peers. The delayed children were less compliant than the nondelayed children during moderately difficult and difficult tasks and were also less attentive than the controls during difficult tasks. Also, whereas the delayed children showed reductions in compliance and on-task attention with increases in task difficulty, the nondelayed children were equally compliant and attentive at all levels of task difficulty. All children were more compliant and attentive and showed less inappropriate behaviour during the visual-perceptual than the verbal tasks. Furthermore, compliance was strongly associated with children's performance on both types of tasks. The findings are interpreted as evidence that children with delays may have greater difficulties with emotion and self-regulation than their nondelayed peers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zelazo, Philip R.

To comprehend the model's overall operation, three broad sectors of the theatre's sphere of activity were explored and juxtaposed: institution, reception and creation. For this purpose, a preliminary set of quantitative and discursive data was assembled from a study of the network of professional schools, associations, and festivals in the theatrical milieu. Following this, examination of a number of scholarly texts made it possible to observe the way in which these elements are linked together into a more comprehensive ideological structure, while analysis of a representative body of contemporary (1945--1990) Quebecois plays served to consolidate and refine these observations. The central thesis of this work is that, at the level of the representation of the "world", there are a series of characteristics that may be thought of as the distinctive elements of Quebecois drama. In general, Quebecois theatre feeds off the denial of the theatrical in order to present itself to the spectator as a site of an impossible theatricality. This dynamic inscribes itself in sociocultural representation in general, and is perceived both in the spatio-temporal dimension of the play, and in the structure of dramatic character and dramatic conflict.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br203.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md590</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French-Canadian drama -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Theater -- Québec (Province) -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
