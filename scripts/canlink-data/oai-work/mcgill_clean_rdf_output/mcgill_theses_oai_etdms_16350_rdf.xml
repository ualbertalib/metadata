These definitions situated architecture within larger classifications of knowledge. They established alliances between architecture and other disciplines. They also influenced elements of architectural practice: what we would associate conventionally with the designer, builder, dweller, material, drawing, and building. The dissertation reviews writings in each historical period and focuses on the practical implications of several texts: Hugh of St. Victor, Didascalicon; Leon Battista Alberti, De re aedificatoria, Book 1; and Etienne-Louis Boullee, Essai sur l'art. As a series, the four historical definitions show how the concept of architecture and the elements of architectural practice have been open to change. Even the word "architecture" has ambiguous roots.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k60r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg70n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture -- Western influences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architecture -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591c71z"><dcterms:title>Optimized waveform relaxation methods for circuit simulations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Khaleel, Mohammad D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Waveform Relaxation methods are very efficient and reliable methods. They have been widely used in several fields, including circuit theory, for solving large systems of ordinary differential equations and solving partial differential equations. A new approach called optimized waveform relaxation algorithms was recently introduced which greatly improved convergence by using new transmission conditions. These conditions are responsible for the exchange of information between subsystems. In this thesis, we demonstrate that the transmission conditions have a tremendous influence on the convergence of the waveform relaxation algorithms for circuit simulations. We first derive new waveform relaxation methods for a general circuit and its associated system of ordinary differential equations, and give transmission conditions with optimal performance. These optimal transmission conditions are however not convenient to use and thus we introduce approximations for them. We then determine numerically the approximate transmission conditions with the best performance of the new waveform relaxation algorithms for two model problems, and we show how much the convergence can be improved compared to the classical waveform relaxation algorithm. We then start a detailed study of optimized waveform relaxation algorithms for RC type circuits. We first analyze RC circuits of any finite size, and give optimal transmission conditions. We again propose approximations for the optimal transmission conditions which are optimized based on numerical insight. Then we choose a very small RC circuit which has only one cell and a small RC circuit which has three cells to further study the quality of the approximations. For the very small RC circuit we show that the optimal transmission conditions are indeed local operators in time, they are first degree time derivatives which are convenient to use. However; we also propose a constant approximation of the optimal transmission conditions which is simpler to use and we prove the optimality of this approximation. For the small RC circuit we also prove the optimality of the proposed constant approximation, and find asymptotically an optimized first order approximation. We then study an infinitely large RC circuit to demonstrate that the size of the circuit does not have a major impact on the convergence of the optimized waveform relaxation methods. We recall the optimality proof for the constant approximation given in [1], and we give an asymptotic result for an optimized first order approximation. We show that results found for the infinitely large RC circuit are indeed limits of those found for the finite size RC circuit as the size of the circuit goes to infinity. We next start a detailed study of optimized waveform relaxation algorithms for transmission line type circuits. We give optimal transmission conditions which we approximate by constants. We analyze very small and small transmission line circuits, which have one cell and two cells respectively, and we find asymptotically optimized constant transmission conditions for both. We consider also an infinitely large transmission line circuit, and we give an optimized constant approximation based on an asymptotic analysis. We finally show that the systems representing the circuits considered are semi-discretizations of particular partial differential equations, and in addition, we show that the new transmission conditions introduced for the circuit problems imply the ones associated with the partial differential equations at the continuous level. We also show that the convergence factors and the solutions obtained by applying the new waveform relaxation algorithms to the partial differential equations converge to those obtained by applying the algorithms to the circuit systems. In order to demonstrate the practicality and the efficiency of the optimized waveform relaxation methods; we give numerical experiments that show the drastically improved convergence behavior.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tg662.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591c71z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Differential equations -- Numerical solutions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electronic circuits -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agb19f965f"><dcterms:title>Further studies of the keratinolytic activities of scopulariopsis brevicaulis.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1962</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Van Walbeek, Wilhelmina.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (Saccardo) Bainier is a member of the Fungi Imperfecti.

Of the many species in the genus Scopulariopsis, this organism has attracted the most attention. A review of the literature shows that it is important not only as a saprophyte but also as a parasite. As a human parasite it is most commonly encountered as a dermatophyte. Reviews by Dodge (1935), Raper and Thom (1949), Conant et al. (1954) and more recent reports such as Fischer's review of clinical cases (1960) and a report from Poland by Kapica (1960) indicate that S. brevicaulis is isolated from clinical material more frequently than any other recognized species belonging to this genus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blank, F.

Computer programmes were written for the I.B.M. 650 digital computer to calculate test conditions and to compute Mach Number and total pressure profiles in the tube, with and without combustion.

The new humanity, inaugurated in Christ's fulfillment of the creator's purpose, is an eschatological concept and offers man the possibility of becoming a complete man in Jesus Christ.

These structures are made from steel beams which support a concrete slab. The concrete slab serves a dual purpose: It provides a deck or working surface and it acts as the top flange of the supporting beam. The compressive forces are resisted by the concrete slab; the tensile forces are resisted by the steel beam; and the horizontal shear between these two elements is resisted by shear connectors which are welded to the steel beam and embedded in the concrete slab. The resulting structure has greater stiffness, shallower construction, greater live load factor of safety and often greater economy than a non-composite structure designed for the same loads.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De Stein, J.

Since the chemical properties of phenazine place it between aromatic hydrocarbons and strongly electron-deficient aza-aromatics, the compound is especially interesting from the point of view of the behaviour of its nitramine derivatives. An investigation of the latter would bridge the gap between nitramines of the two groups of compounds. 2-Nitraminophenazine was prepared and was found to behave similarly to the known aza-aromatic compounds of this type. 1-Nitraminophenazine could not be isolated under the reaction conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.

The composition of the intracellular fluid is, under normal physiological conditions, quite different from that of the extracellular fluid and it is the role of the external membrane surrounding the cytoplasm of each cell to maintain this state. The mechanisms which come into play in this process are still far from completely understood, although a great deal of work has been devoted to their study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quastel, J.

All teachers cannot be expected to accept one specified code of beliefs. The pruning of superfluous ideas, and the effecting of greater unanimity, however, is sure to create a more fruitful theory of education. The tenacity with which most teachers hold to their beliefs based on a fragmentary knowledge of popular philosophies prevents agreement on the answers to many problems. Their blind acceptance of the dictates of common sense blocks the path of advance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nash, P.

In the words of Durell, “the administrator is always working with both factors, he is cutting a coat according to his cloth, and the quantity of cloth is just as vital a factor as the pattern of the future coat in his mind”. Canada's financial administration, like that of Great Britain, is based on a budgetary rather than a non-budgetary system. The distinction between these two systems has been described by Villard and Willoughby in the following words.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mallory, J.

The peninsula, itself within the District of Franklin, is joined to the northeastern corner of the District of Keewatin by Rae Isthmus. It forms the western shore of Foxe Basin (map 1) and is separated from Baffin Island to the north by Fury and Hecla Strait and from Southampton Island to the south by Frozen Strait. The region covered by this study includes Wales, Amherst and Igloolik Islands. It does not include several smaller islands off the extreme southern tip of the peninsula.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bird, J.
