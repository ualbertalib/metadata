Airway closure was assessed by a single-breath N2 technique, gas exchange by A-aD02, venous admixture, and cardiac output (dye-dilution). Functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured by a helium technique. A posture change from seated to supine produced changes of lung volumes allowing functional effects of airway closure to be isolated. Closing volume (lung volume where airway closure starts to occur) was unchanged with posture while FRC fell in the supine position. When airway closure occured below FRC in both postures, gas exchange was improved in the supine posture. When airway closure involved increased lung volumes above FRC with the posture change, there was deterioration of supine gas exchange. It was concluded that airway closure was a factor tending to impair gas exchange. These findings disagree with previous reports of posture and gas exchange, which failed to consider effects of airway closure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Becklake, M.

The catecholamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline, are known to increase the level of cyclic AMP in the heart before the maximum of their inotropic effect is reached, and it has been suggested that cyclic AMP is a mediator of the effect on contractility. The catecholamines act on cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. Phenylephrine, which is not a catecholamine, is known to act on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in mammalian myocardium. In the chicken heart no evidence of alpha receptors was found in this study. The effect of phenylephrine on the formation of cyclic AMP from ATP was studied in rabbit and chicken heart homogenate. The drug did not significantly increase the level of cyclic AMP although it was as effective as the catecholamines in increasing contractility of the isolated heart. This result makes it unlikely that sympathomimetic drug effects on cardiac contractility are mediated by cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP is known to be involved in glycogen breakdown, and it was found that adrenaline which increases cardiac cyclic AMP levels reduces cardiac glycogen concentration in the isolated perfused rabbit heart, while phenylephrine which does not increase the level of cardiac cyclic AMP, does not reduce the concentration of cardiac glycogen.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Benfey, B.

Discrimination was better under bisensory conditions than under either unisensory condition. Vision supplemented by optimal audition was superior to vision supplemented by suboptimal audition. There was no significant difference between visual and auditory conditions. Dental consonants were visually discriminable when contrasted with alveolar consonants, and the vowels /a/ and /i/ had a more positive influence on consonant discrimination than /u/.

Adsorption increased with pH, especially at pH 8 - 10, and was enhanced by starch at low pH. Starch decreased amine adsorption at high pH. Starch adsorption increased with concentration and rose with amine concentration to 10^-4 molar. Higher amine concentrations lowered starch adsorption. Floatability increased with amine concentration up to 10^-3 molar and fell at 10^-2 molar amine. Maximum flotation was achieved in slightly alkaline solution. Starch was most effective as a depressant at high and low pH but the maximum floatability value was little affected. Starch produced a shift of the maximum floatability peak to higher pH levels.

Case studies of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, the Borough of Richmond, the United States Department of Defense and the Canadian Treasury Board are conducted because of their special significance. The study is divided into two parts. The first part describes the circumstances leading to the evolution of PPBS. Similar reform movements that were going on in Canada are briefly discussed and a special effort is made to assess the impact of the transplantation of PPBS in the Canadian system. The second part attempts to portray PPBS decision making both in theory and practice, the main aim being to relate PPBS policy alternative selection to political reality. An empirical study was conducted in the Canadian Treasury Board to test several hypotheses that portray PPBS as a hybrid rather than a rational or an incremental budgeting model.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bruneau, T.

Two groups of dogs were fasted for 24 hours, then given intravenous injections of a suspension of E. coli bacteria. When severe bacteremia with prostration was evident, thoracic duct lymph, blood, liver and lung extracts were assayed for triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acids. While thoracic duct lymph showed little change, there was a significant increase in triglycerides in the other specimens. It is postulated that in sepsis the liver is unable to handle the marked mobilization of lipid that occurs. Triglyceride with minimal or abnormal protein binding is released via the hepatic veins into the circulation. Increased lung triglyceride and pulmonary fat embolism may be explained on this basis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duff, J.

Highest grain yields resulted from seeding prior to the last week in May or during early July. A seeding rate of 34-50 kg./ha. in 20-cm. drills was optimum, and the crop responded well to additions of fertilizer on low fertility soils. Harvesting date tests indicated that maximum grain yield in buckwheat is realized at a relatively early stage and remains stable over a period of 3-4 weeks. Attempts to harvest prior to Frost killing, however, gave rise to difficulties since conventional grain harvesting equipment is not designed to handle high moisture plant material. Treatment of buckwheat with the growth regulator, Ethrel, showed few beneficial effects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Klinck, H.

Deposition of isogeneic and xenogeneic antigen (FIA) host gamma globulin and complement were demonstrated along the glomerular basement membrane by immunofluorescence techniques. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated deposits beneath the glomerular epithelial cells. An antigen was demonstrated in the serum and urine of nephrotic animals. This antigen exibited immunologic identity with host tubular antigen. Arthus and delayed skin reactions were utilized to demonstrate the active role of the humoral system, in contrast to the lack of specific delayed (cellular) mechanisms. This latter observation was confirmed by the lack of specific monolayer destruction by isogeneic nephrotic lymphocytes in vitro, and by the positive cell transfer of sensitized lymphocytes into isogeneic kidneys.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watson, J.

Hitherto only those species of insects numerous enough to impair the health or efficiency of the trees and their products have been considered of sufficient economic importance to be worthy of extensive study. Now, insects capable of being vectors of virus diseases may assume a significance quite out of proportion to their relative density of population. It was therefore decided to commence a study from this point of view of the insects inhabiting the cherry orchards of the Niagara District of Ontario. The leaf hoppers were chosen as the first group to be investigated as it is in this family that vectors of many other important plant virus diseases are found.

This author’s hope is to make clear what prob-[sic] were common to both nobility and Crown, how they were met by both, and finally, why it was that the Crown emerged victorious from the struggle. 1594 was chosen as the starting date because it is the year in which Henry IV was finally recognized as king; the closing date, 1624, marks the entrance of Richelieu into Louis XIII’s council. Some mention is made, however, of events occuring after 1624, which indicate a strengthening of the Crown’s position. This effort is, at best, but an introction [sic] to the question. Much of the necessary material - histories of the various provinces, the “proces- verbaux” of the provincial estates, the Parlements, the Huguenots’ assemblies, collections of letters of the various nobles - in short, some of the most valuable sources for this period were not available. With the information at my disposal, however, I hope to have written something which will prove helpful, and perhaps even interesting to other students of this period.

The yellow colouring matter, citrinin, produced by several species or fungi, exerts considerable antibiotic activity against most gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms in vitro. Although some uncertainty existed as to its usefulness in vivo, the high yield and ease of production justified further investigation of this antibiotic. The purpose or this investigation was to study the chemistry of citrinin in order to elucidate its structure more fully with the object or relating its antibacterial activity to specific functional groups. At the same time derivatives were to be prepared to obtain compounds that would be more active than citrinin in vivo and also be more acceptable with regard to toxicity, stability, solubility and colour. The above objects, as far as they lay within the scope of this investigation, have been accomplished. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

This deficit will most certainly affect Canada’s overall supply in 1947, particularly as our production has declined, eg., the amount of lard produced in 1946 was only fifty percent of the 1944 production. [...] Linseed oil comprises by far the largest proportion of the vegetable oil produced in Canada and if it could be utilized for edible purposes it would assist materially in alleviating prevailing shortages of food oils. Some linseed oil is being used in the manufacture of shortening but the amount has to be strictly limited because of the undesirable flavour and odour its products acquire in baking. The problem of “flavour reversion” in linseed shortenings has recieved considerable attention in recent years and improved products have been obtained, but the undesirable flavours and odours have never been completely eliminated. There is considerable evidence that linolenic acid is the main source of the trouble. Linolenic acid is known to be more susceptible to the action of heat than the other component acids of linseed oil. The ensuing investigation, therefore, is primarily concerned with a study of the nature of heat polymerization with the object of establishing the conditions of thermal treatment of the oil which would eliminate “flavour reversion” in the final shortening.

Fertilization resulted in a considerable increase in the percent phosphorous in the fertilized forage over that in the unfertilized but this increased forage phosphorous was not fully available to the animals. The indications were that this was a direct result of the increased physiological age and resultant lower digestibility of the fertilized forage. This was borne out by the fact that the forage phosphorous in the hay cut at the pre-bloom stage, which had a higher digestibility, was more available to the animals than that cut at the more mature stage of growth.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.
