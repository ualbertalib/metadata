The remaining carbon atoms are converted to pentose phosphates and can subsequently be degraded to lactate, as indicated by studies with modified cells. The lactate produced may then be oxidized to CO2 as a result of the operation of the TCA cycle. Glucose oxidation via the HMP shunt is controlled by the rate of NADPH oxidation. NADPH oxidation may involve the malic enzyme, the reduction of pyruvate and fatty acid synthesis. Adenosine, which inhibits shunt activity in Ehrlich ascites cells, acts by diminishing NADPH oxidation. The rate of oxidation of glucose- 1-14C is also decreased when the intracellular ATP level is depleted by preincubating the cells with glucose plus oxamate. When the ATP level is restored by incubating the cells with glucose plus adenine, the decrease in shunt activity is also reversed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scholefield, P.

Alkaline dissociation of cryoglobulin was first noticed at pH 11.75, accompanied by irreversible conformational changes. All 62 tyrosyl groups became available in 5 M guanidine-HCl. The greater was the disruptive field induced by perturbants (pH, temperature and ionic and non-ionic solutes), the greater was the irreversible deformation. Transition temperatures of cryoglobulin, its Fab and Fl(ab)2 fragments as measured by fluorescence emission intensity were 63°, 65.6°, and 65.7°, respectively. Perturbants produced varying degrees of inhibition in the antibody-combining capacity. The Fc and lambda-determinant sites were alkali-resistant while cryoglobulin-specific determinant sites were alkali labile. The lamda-determinant sites were resistant to heat-denaturation. Self-association of cryoglobulin Fab (mol. wt., 44,600) and Fl(ab)2 (mol. wt., 105,600) was observed depending on temperature, protein concentration and pH of the suspending media. Both F1(ab)2 and F2(ab)2 (mol. wt., 93,000) displayed visible cryo-gel formation, the efficiency being dependent on molecular size. Reduced-alkylated H-chains of cryoglobulin also exhibited gel formation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rose, B.

The leucocyte S-galactosidase activity of the parents (carriers) was 50% of normal. Two glycosaminoglycan fractions were isolated from the urine. Both CPC- and non-CPC-precipitable fractions contained large amounts of galactose-glucosamine-containing materials of the keratan sulfate type but they were undersulfated. Glycosaminoglycans of similar composition were isolated in large amounts from the liver of a Type l patient. They were polydisperse, not CPC-precipitable, had an alkali-labile protein polysaccharide linkage region and were similar to keratan sulfate. The cultured fibroblasts of Type II contained two gangliosides not found in normal cell cultures.

The hydrolysis appeared to be stereospecific. Acetyl-dl-carnitylcholine was hydrolyzed slightly by purified human serum but not by fresh human plasma or purified horse serum cholinesterases. Several preparations of both acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase failed to hydrolyze I-carnitylcholine and acetyl-dl-carnitine. These three compounds, as well as several other choline esters, competitively inhibited acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine. Acetyl-dl-camitylcholine had marked affinity for acetylchol inesterase whereas acetyl-dl-carnitine and choline were very weak inhibitors. The products of hydrolysis of acetyl-dl-carnitylcholine by acetylcholinesterase were acetylcarnitine and choline.

The modal approach is presented as a comprehensive framework around which the numerical results are systematically organized and such disparate subjects as acceleration transients, asymptotic stability and nonsimultaneous switching are unified. Detailed attention is given to the identification of the physical modes and to understanding their behavioral changes as a function of rotor speeds. Asymptotic stability is studied by linearization through small signal perturbations. Quadratic liapunov Functions are proposed and it is shown that a Liapunov Function associated with the Total Energy con be used to prove Asymptotic Stability in the large. Eigenvalue sensitivity with respect to system parameters is also presented. The m.m.f. spacevector viewpoint is presented to give a physical description of the modes, the airgap magnetic field interactions in the production of transient torque, and the possibility of supersynchronous speeds during transients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barton, T.

For 20 grid points within 42-miles range, the ratio of amounts measured by radar at 5000 ft to amounts measured at the ground had a log normal distribution, the standard deviation corresponding to ratio 1.3 and its reciprocal. It was found that useful measurements of snowfall amount could be derived from radar observations out to 100-miles range, and that the variation of snowfall rate at a point could be determined from observations taken earlier along the trajectory of the snow falling toward that point. Radar data from greater heights showed that more than 95% of the snow that fell within 100-miles range had been generated below 20,000 ft, and that the growth of snow with distance fallen varied in space and time. Thus in regions north of the radar hall the growth was at heights between 10000 ft and 5000 ft; in regions south of the radar half the growth was between 15000 and 10000 feet.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.

The thesis consists of four parts: Part I deals with the general aspects of the problem. The views of twelve economists are analyzed and the principles underlying the problem methodically examined. The period of transition from feudal to capitalist economy, the growth of the national state and its influence upon economic activities are briefly discussed. Part II describes conditions in England during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, the attempts of the governments to intervene in all spheres of economic activity, and the views held by outstanding mercantilists. Similarly, conditions in France are discussed in Part III. The administration of Colbert, the great minister of Finance, is methodically examined. Part IV deals with the decline of the doctrines favouring government intervention and reviews critically the methods, extent and results of mercantilist policy.

By immunofluorescent techniques it was shown that following incubation of monkey skin with sera of ragweed atopic individuals, the ragweed-binding antibodies fix exclusively to the skin mast cells, and that these cells constitute target cells of human reaginic, IgE antibodies. By immunofluorescent and column chromatographic studies it was shown that non-reaginic, ragweed-binding antibodies ether than IgG, IgA, IgM and IgD, present in the sera of hypesensitized individuals also fix to the monkey skin mast cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goodfriend, L.

Generally, there are three differences between the reaction of these birds and that of mammals during experimental hemorrhagic hypotension. First, the mean arterial pressure of both species of fowl falls very rapidly after even a small hemorrhage; second, hemodilution is both more rapid and larger in the birds; and finally, chickens do not appear to develop hemoconcentration and the "irreversibility" which is characteristic of hemorrhagic shock in mammals. Results of hemodynamic studies on chickens reported here led to the proposal that all these phenomena are related to a lack of active vasoconstriction. The evidence suggests that absence of active vasoconstriction may be partly due to chronic tachyphylaxis resulting from high levels of circulating catecholamines.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Après hémorragie, on aperçoit, chez la volaille ainsi que chez la dinde, des réponses physiologiques étalées d'une façon bien caractéristique et qui diffèrent remarquablement de celles aperçues chez les mammifères (ainsi que chez les oiseaux plongeurs). Généralement, nous trouvons qu'il existe trois différences entre la réaction de ces oiseaux et celle des mammifères durant l'hypotension hémorragique expérimentale. Premièrement, même à la suite d'une petite hémorragie, la pression artérielle moyenne des deux espèces d'oiseaux tombe très rapidement; deuxièmement, chez les oiseaux, l'hémodilution est à la fois plus rapide et plus grande; enfin, les volailles ne semblent développer ni l'hémoconcentration, ni l'irréversibilitée, ces phénomènes étant caractéristiques des chocs hémorragiques chez les mammifèresé. Les résultats de recherches hémodynamiques obtenus ici ont conduit à la proposition que tous ces phénomènes sont reliés à un manque de vasoconstriction active. L'évidence des faits suggère que cette absence de vasoconstriction active pourrait être partiellement dûe à une tachyphylaxie chronique causée par un niveau élevé de catécholamines dans la circulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nickerson, M.

Carnitylcholine was not susceptible to the action of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, choline acetylase or carnitylacetyl transferase. The resistance of carnitylcholine to the action of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase was reflected in its capacity to produce a prolonged neuromuscular block in all species studied. This compound was found to be a weak competitive inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. However, it is likely that the capacity of carnitylcholine to potentiate the maximal twitch is independent of its anticholinesterase activity. Attempts to identify a carnitylcholine-like metabolite in serum from myasthenia gravis patients were unsuccessful.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.

Glucose caused a slight increase in incorporation in erythrocytes which had been stored for 18 hours at 4°C, but had little effect on fresh cells. Esterification was proportional to the intracellular nucleotide labile phosphate level (corresponding to the ATP and ADP levels), provided the labile phosphate was less than that found in fresh erythrocytes. However, no further increase in esterification occurred when the level of the nucleotide labile phosphate was raised to twice that of fresh cells by incubation of the cells for 10 hours with glucose and adenine.

With a fixed stimulus, at constant lung volume, transdiaphragmatic pressure decreases with increasing airflow, and at constant airflow transdiaphragmatic pressure decreases with increasing lung volume. Taking into account these properties of the respiratory system observed during diaphragmatic contraction, and also the pattern and frequency of breathing, it can be predicted that during spontaneous breathing the ventila tory pump should resist changes in tidal volume brought about by mechanical loading to a degree much greater than that expected on the basis of its mechanical properties under passive conditions. Experimental elastic loading of respiration in human subjects verified this prediction, and showed also that this 'stability' to changes in mechanical load increased with increasing ventilation. Stability under these circumstances was increased partly by increased respiratory frequency, and partly by further mechanical changes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milic-Emili, J.

A technique was devised whereby a catheter bearing exposed magnesium-aluminum wire was placed in the thoracic aortas of rabbits, dogs, rats and monkeys. This embolic source resulted in scattered areas of renal cortical atrophy which were subtended by arterioles showing extensive intimal hyperplasia. The medial cells of these arterioles, especially in the rabbit, were transformed to granule-containing cells with supposed secretory function. Animals with this lesion became hypertensive. A correlative study of renal renin, plasma renin, renal arteriolar granularity and hypertension revealed that in the acute phase of micro-embolic hypertension there is evidence for the participation of renin-angiotensin system; however, in the chronic phase there is none.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moore, S.

A tRNA cistron-hybrid, a molecule consisting of a transfer RNA (tRNA) hybridized to its complementary DNA sequences, was isolated. The approach used consisted of hybridizing denatured E.coli DNA with E.coli tRNA and separating the DNA-tRNA hybrid from unhybridized tRNA by gel filtration. The DNA-tRNA hybrid was treated with N.crassa endonuclease, an enzyme specific for single-stranded nucleic acids. This treatment released a tRNA cistron-hybrid from double-stranded DNA regions formed by re-annealing of DNA strands during hybridization. The tRNA cistron-hybrid was isolated from the reaction mixture by successive purification procedures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spencer, J.

With increasing loads tidal volume diminished and end-inspiratory tracheal pressure became progressively more negative with respect to the atmosphere. This response was linear, and independent of volume over a range of ventilation equivalent to twice the normal tidal volume. The equivalent elastance value could be computed from the control tidal volume and the pressure developed when the airway was occluded at FRC. The effective elastance so measured permitted the calculation of load-response curves. Using a technique based on these findings, it was determined that immediate load-compensation in the cat is provided chiefly by the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The former contribution is largely a function of the diaphragm's intrinsic properties, whereas the intercostal response results from recruitment of additional motor units and is dependent on the integrity of the vagus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milic-Emili, J.
