One reason for this is that in the last twenty years the development of the electronic tube rectifier has facilitated the economical conversion of A-C power to D-C power. The recent improvement of dry disk rectifiers, particularly selenium rectifiers, suggests that they may soon seriously compete with tube rectifiers in many applications. The writer has attempted in this thesis to do two things. Firstly: to outline the theory of rectification, dwelling particularly upon the advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used rectifier circuits. This material has been augmented with numerous oscillograms which are so often lacking in texts and technical literature. Secondly: to point out the advantages and disadvantages of dry disk rectifiers as applied to rectifier-motor drives. This work is not original, but rather a compilation of information found scattered throughout the literature. The use of a multi-rectifier-motor drive is suggested; this type of drive has not, to the writers knowledge, been discussed elsewhere in the literature. Time limitations have made a study of this drive impossible.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schippel, W.

Due to the inaccessibility of much of this inhospitable land, it has been impossible to undertake many extensive ground surveys in the interior and consequently most studies in the past have been confined to the coastal areas. In recent years there have been several surveys conducted in the interior, but the nature of the country will prevent much detailed ground work for many years to come. Nearly all of Labrador-Ungava has, however, been photographed from the air and, within one or two years, aerial photographic coverage should be available for the whole Peninsula. From these photographs much knowledge may be gleaned, and it only remains for interested people to take advantage of this wealth of information. In order to interpret the aerial photographs it is necessary to establish areas of ground-control at which the photographs are studied on the ground and variations in the appearance of the photographs are correlated with variations on the ground. It was the purpose of the present investigation to make such a study and correlation. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hare, F.

The anomalous flow characteristics of these systems render them useful for a number of practical applications such as in medications (vaseline) and lubricating greases. During World War II, Aluminum soap-gasoline gels were used extensively as incendiary bomb chargings and flame thrower fuels. The merit of these systems may be indicated by referring to the behavior of one or two commercial products. For application to the skin medications with high viscosity are required to prevent the material from running off. Since it is much more convenient to apply a material of low viscosity, there are distinct advantages in using materials such as a soap-hydrocarbon which has low viscosity while being applied and high viscosity when allowed “to set”. The change from a high to a low viscosity is brought about simply by rubbing or shearing the material. Soap-hydrocarbon lubricants have similar merit. When they are used in high speed machinery they become fluid and there is little resistance to flow. 9 When the machine is stopped the grease adheres to the metal surfaces and forms a protective coating.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

It has long been held responsible for the disease known as haemorrhagic septicaemia in a large variety of animals, both tame and wild. In the 1850’s, many workers in the course of their investigations found in varied sick or dead animals, an organism that is now called Pasteurella but was not known by any name at that time. These organisms, apparently pathogenic, were isolated from animals suffering from a disease of a haemorrhagic nature. Hueppe (1886) collected strains of these organisms from various sources. His study included organisms from fowl cholera, rabbit septicaemia, haemorrhagic septicaemia of cattle, including wild deer, wild boar and swine plague. He was endeavouring to show that this organism was a soil bacterium, similar in behaviour in respect to infectivity, to the anthrax bacillus. In this he was not too successful, although there are still some workers in Europe today who hold tentatively to this view. What Hueppe did show was a relationship of the organisms isolated from various sources to one another.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kalz, G.

The detector is an electronic device which beats the incoming signal with a local oscillator signal. This effect is due to the heterodyne principle. The local oscillator is of the Wein Bridge type which utilizes a Wein Bridge C-R feedback circuit to produce stable harmonic-free oscillations. The beat-frequency signal is filtered by a two-section tuned amplifier tuned to 1000 cycles per second. The amplifiers are of the parallel-T feedback type which use a C-R degenerative feedback network to produce selective amplification. The output signal is detected by means of earphones. Good sensitivity is obtained by the use of high gain throughout the circuit. Several capacitors were measured at frequencies up to 20 kilocycles on a Schering bridge using the instrument. Balances of five significant figures were easily obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rowles, W.

Twelve nutrient solutions were used to grow the plants in sand cultures. Determinations of ascorbic acid concentration in the fresh tissues were made colourimetrically and the results analysed statistically. It was found that increased nitrogen gave highly significant increases in the ascorbic acid content of the plants in the winter experiment and non-significant increases in the spring experiment. Increased phosphorus and potassium gave non-significant results. The general effect in both experiments was for phosphorus to increase and potassium to decrease the concentration of vitamin C. Significant interactions between phosphorus and potassium in the winter experiment and between nitrogen and phosphorus in the spring experiment indicated that a balance between nutrients was as effective as the actual concentration of any element. From these studies it appeared that factors other than mineral nutrition are responsible for much of the variation in the ascorbic acid content of leaf lettuce.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, H.

The experimental work was divided into three sections, namely, a pulse source, a dispersion network and a spectrum analyser. The present discussion is primarily concerned with the analyser section of the computer. Theoretical considerations have been applied to typical microwave antennas to determine the electrical specifications and preliminary design has been tested by experimental circuits.

Unfortunately, after the mapping had been underway for six weeks, the company officials decided to abandon all work in the basemetal belt, and the personnel were moved to areas that required immediate mapping in the main iron ore zone, north of Burnt Creek. The writer was senior-assistant to Dr. P.E. Auger, chief of one of the seven man parties that carried out mapping in the base-metal belt. During the six weeks in the district, an area of approximately six miles by two and one half miles was mapped and prospected at a scale of one thousand feet to the inch. Although many localities of considerable sulphide mineralization were found in the subsequent mapping, none of the assay results merited further investigation or development. This paper contains a detailed petrographic description of the many basic sills that were encountered in the mapping. These sills intruded the Howse Series, a sedimentary group that were host to the sulphide mineralization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, A.

In order to disclose the pattern of folding in a region as complex as the Howson creek area, it is necessary to determine the tops of beds. The most valuable criteria for such determinations are primary sedimentary structures, notably cross-lamination, graded bedding and ripplemark. The recognition and interpretation of these features has resulted in a fundamentally changed concept of the pattern of folding from one of isoclines and synclines with steep-dipping axial planes and little or no overturning, to one of isoclines and synclines with nearly horizontal axial planes, and as many beds overturned as not. The interpretation of secondary linear and planar structures confirms this pattern. Accordingly, the thickness of the Slocan sedimentary series is computed to be in the order of 37,000 feet, over five times that formerly postulated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, T.

More recently models have been used to study the radiation pattern of an array of antennas. There are some problems which can be studied with great ease,when working with small models, and cannot be done, or at least will be very difficult to accomplish under the actual physical conditions. For instance, if the effect of height of antenna above ground is to be studied, it may not be economical to construct antenna towers of various heights,whereas the model could be made in such a way that its height could be continously varied,and results recorded. Whereas in mechanical problems the scale of reduction is arbitrary,so long as all the dimensions are reduced by the same scale, with antennas there is an important qualification which must be satisfied. The ratio between the dimensions of the actual antenna and the model must be equal to the ratio between the wave lenghts used with each of them respectively. This follows from the assumption that for instance, a quarter wave lenght vertical antenna placed 50 metres above ground level,operating on 5 metre wave lenght,will have the same radiation pattern as a quarter wave lenght antenna placed 50 cm above ground level,operating on 5 cm wave lenght. Thus the scale of reduction of dimensions should be the ratio of the two wave lenghts used on actual antenna and model antenna, respectively.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Howes, F.

The historical geographer thus hopes to explain the development of each landscape, including that of the present, and its transformation into the next. By means of maps and diagrams, comparisons can be made of the spatial distributions of various units at different periods. The historical geographer also hopes to show to what extent the past and present landscapes are the result of the geographic characteristics of the region. The location, climate, surface configuration, soils, and natural resources of a region determine in a large measure the type of economy which may develop.

Thomson in his publication “Recent Researches” of 1895 mentions the existence of electromagnetic waves in metallic cavities. This seems to be the first reference made to cavities as we know them today. Sir Oliver Lodge demonstrated their use as resonators in the following year. Lord Rayleigh in 1897 showed that there were two types of modes possible and proved that each mode type had a definite cut off frequency, and that propagation is possible only if the frequency is higher than this limiting value. In 1902 Becker did some experimental work at wavelengths of 5 and 10 cms. The damping effect caused by imperfect conductors has occupied a great deal of attention more recently. This is a very important consideration and the amount of work that has been done in this respect is enormous. The use of cavity resonators for the measurement of the dielectric properties of materials has also attracted very wide attention. Horner, Taylor, Dunsmuir, Lamb and Jackson may be mentioned in this respect. (Figure 2). All workers in this field have found that the Q factor which would have been expected on theoretical grounds is greater than the experimentally measured Q. This is found to be due to the conduction properties of the metal forming the resonator walls. A recent publication by A.C. Vivian and A.L. Gregory states that very careful control of the silver plating and finishing of the metal surfaces is necessary if surfaces of supernormal resistivity are to be avoided.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chipman, R.

The map-area forms part of a concession in New Quebec granted to the Hollinger North Shore Exploration Company Limited. The concession includes part of the “Labrador Trough” which contains a folded and faulted assemblage of Precambrian sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Figure 1). The first part of the report deals with the general character of the country and the regional geology. The second part is concerned with a detailed study of part of the Kanispiskau system (Late Precambrian) northwest of Attikamagen Lake, and in particular with the iron-formation and the iron ore deposits which occur within it. The field work consisted of detailed mapping in the vicinity of several iron ore occurrences which lie to the northeast of the main ore zone in the Labrador Trough (Figures 2 and 3). Mapping was done by plane-table on the scale one inch equals 200 feet and orientation was maintained from known azimuths of the sun. In addition, a few short pace and compass traverses were made to complete the local geology. Two triangulation stations were erected so that the survey could be tied into the main triangulation system farther west. Accompanying the report are two maps of the local geology on the scale one inch equals 1000 feet. The contours are based on assumed elevations of 1725 feet for Snow and Bruin lakes.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gill, J.

By applying the reaction isochore to the equilibrium between inactive and active species the variation in the reaction rate with temperature is found to be ln k = ln A - E/RT (1) where E represents the difference in heat content between active and inactive molecules and A is a term which is independent of temperature. In the exponential form k = A exp(-E/RT) (2) the factor exp(-E/RT) may be considered as the fraction of molecules having sufficient energy to react, or as the probability of occurrence of the active complex.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.

This is the opening remark of a paper entitled “Some Account of a Disorder of the Breast” read by Heberden before the Royal College of Physicians in 1768. It was not long after this, in 1799, that Edward Jenner correctly interpreted John Hunter’s fatal malady as a disease of the coronary arteries (157). Since that time coronary artery disease has remained a topic of profound interest. Coronary arteriosclerosis is a challenge to surgery and medicine alike. Although no specific etiology has yet been determined, coronary artery disease, with the many other degenerative diseases, falls into one great class. It is unfortunate that heretofore medical therapy has done little to repair the diseased vessels, or alter or halt the progressive sclerotic changes in the coronary arteries. In the shadow of this failure the time is ripe for the advent of adequate surgical therapeusis.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vineberg, A.

Growing stock are generally reared on grass range and, on many farms, the laying flock is allowed access to pasture during the summer months. It is considered that the forage, insects, and other natural sources of feedstuffs, which are available to birds on range, make a useful contribution to the poultry diet and act as an insurance against a possible deficiency in the ordinary ration of grain and mash. It is also considered that the fresh air, sunlight, and sanitary conditions, enjoyed by birds on pasture, promote good health and contribute towards the control and prevention of disease. Undoubtedly, the economic benefits, that may be realized by rearing poultry on pasture, are determined, to a great extent, by local environmental conditions. The quality and quantity of forage which can be made available to poultry must be regarded as foremost considerations in the recommendation of its use in any specific region. The disparity in published experimental data of the value of pasture to poultry upholds this point of view.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nikolaiczuk, N.

The aim of this thesis is to show that some of the greatest difficulties in Kant’s Ethics are due to his attempt to be too consistent - to his attempt to expound his moral theory in the metaphysical terms of the First Critique. That this attempt fails and that, nevertheless, the greater part of Kant’s moral philosophy is not thereby invalidated, is proof of the worth and strength of the latter. How far grounds for the rejection of Kant’s metaphysical system are provided by the incompatibility of this system with the most important field of man’s experience, is not here discussed. It must however be emphasised that far from Kant’s moral theory being dependent on the existence or reality of certain metaphysical entities, as some have argued - for example, G. E. Moore in “Principia Ethica” - Kant’s very attempt to establish the reality of his metaphysical world on moral grounds is one which can only be held a failure. But it is a failure to be contrasted with the success of his analysis of moral obligation and the authority of the moral imperative, which analysis does not require the phenomenal-noumenal distinction according to this thesis.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Noad, A.

Although limited experimental evidence for (α, jn) and(d, jn) reactions is available, there appears to be no (p,jn) reactions (other than j = 1,2) reported. The McGill 82” F.M. Cyclotron, with a proton energy range up to 100 Mev. is particularly suitable for this type of investigation. Gold, Z = 79, has a single stable isotope of mass 197 and (p&gt;jn) reactions yield neutron-deficient mercury (z = 80) isotopes for which no data has been published except for j = 1. Since gold in very pure form is available and the mercury isotopes can be separated quite readily, it was decided to investigate this field. The experimental evidence required to check Weisskopf’s (7, 8, 9) theory is the threshold at which each isotope is formed and the relative isotope yield at each proton energy. However, before this information can be found, it is necessary to know some of the properties of the mercury isotopes e.g., half-lives, modes of decay, γ-ray energies. The purpose of this investigation was to determine these properties. This has been accomplished for isotopes up to Hg^191 i.e., j = 7. A mass spectrograph and a 180° beta-ray spectrometer, now under construction at this Laboratory, will be used to determine threshold energies and relative yields.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.
