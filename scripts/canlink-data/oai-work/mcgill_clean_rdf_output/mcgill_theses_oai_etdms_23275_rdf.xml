The principles of fuzzy theory and fuzzy expert systems will develop a framework for the diagnosis and analysis of results produced by the circuit measurement instruments of the telephone lines. The thesis is a case study in which a fault is isolated and then, membership functions are empirically produced to represent fault parameter behavior. Fuzzy system rules are then constructed and the whole module system is tuned and put to testing. The results of the tests are thoroughly discussed, concluding with recommendations for extending the case module study in for the purpose of constructing a complete fuzzy diagnostic system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Malowany, Alfred (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq633.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t716z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816n325"><dcterms:title>Heating behavior and quality factor retention in canned foods as influenced by thermal processing in a rotary autoclave</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Abbatemarco, Carla</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Heat penetration data were obtained for a canned food model (gelatinized waxy maize starch) during processing in an agitating retort under various conditions to evaluate the effect of process variables on the heat penetration parameters (f$ sb{ rm h}$ and j$ sb{ rm ch}$) and resulting process lethality (F$ sb{ rm o}$) and cook value (C$ sb{ rm o}$).

Retention percentage of thiamin, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll at each process condition was estimated using the heat penetration data and documented D and z values for each quality factor. Results confirm better retention of quality factors at higher temperatures and higher rotation speeds. Rheological changes associated with the starch were evaluated in relation to different factors and were well described by the Power law model. Apparent viscosity of the processed product was related to the cook value of the process. Fresh vegetables were canned and subjected to end-over-end rotation. Heating times were adjusted to give approximately the same process lethality (F$ sb{ rm o}$ = 10 minutes). Processing under higher temperatures and higher rotation speeds resulted in better retention (p $&lt;$ 0.01) of vegetable texture, while only temperature (higher the better) had a desirable effect on color. Buffered aqueous mixtures of ascorbic acid and thiamin were sealed in glass vials and cans. At each temperature, rotation speed did not have a significant effect on the retention of either vitamin. Processing at 110$ sp circ$C yielded significantly lower retention (p $&lt;$ 0.01) of both vitamins than at 120$ sp circ$C and 130$ sp circ$C. Estimated ascorbic acid and thiamin retention using experimental time-temperature data and published kinetic parameters showed fairly good agreement with experimental data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ramaswamy, H.

In the forecast based on infection, the blight severity values (BSV) were calculated for each day using duration of leaf wetness, relative humidity and temperature. The first fungicide was applied when the cumulative blight severity value reached 14 (CBSV 14) and 18 (CBSV 18). The forecasts were compared with the 50% disease incidence threshold method where the first fungicide was applied when the middle leaf of 50% of plants was diseased, and the conventional method where the first fungicide application was made when the plant height reached 15 cm. For the threshold of CBSV 14 and CBSV 18, no loss was observed in yield and fewer fungicides were applied as compared to conventional and 50% disease incidence threshold methods. Three years of weather data from experimental plots and 155 commercial field data were used to study the behaviour of CBSV at 50% disease incidence threshold. Only in 3% of the fields, the disease incidence of 50% was observed before the CBSV reached 11. The increase from CBSV 11 to 20 was rapid. Depending on environmental conditions the first fungicide at a CBSV range of 11 to 20 is proposed rather than a critical threshold since no loss in yield was observed at 18 in the experimental plots. No fungicide is applied until the CBSV reaches 11 and the application must not be delayed after CBSV reaches 20.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kushalappa, A. C.

In conventional courtly love lyrics, women are silenced and objectified by the male speaker. Still, a handful of women-voiced lyrics--"women's songs"--exist in the courtly love lyrical tradition. This thesis studies women's songs in Middle English and their role in the androcentric courtly love tradition. In the first chapter, I discuss critical perspectives on conventional courtly representations of women. In the second chapter, I locate Middle English women's songs in literary contexts other than courtly love: the Middle English lyrical tradition, the cross-cultural phenomenon of medieval women's songs, and the manuscript contexts of Middle English women's songs. In Chapter Three, I discuss the individual songs themselves and examine the range of perspectives found in woman-voiced lyrics. My discussion of Middle English women's songs includes texts not previously admitted to the genre. This expanded collection of women's songs creates an alternative courtly discourse privileging female perspectives. Middle English women's songs create a space for women's voices in courtly love.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Westphal, Sarah (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579t06t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q717h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>English literature -- Middle English, 1100-1500 -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qm82p"><dcterms:title>NMDA receptor blockade and spatial learning : a reinvestigation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>White, Lynn H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation is believed necessary for certain types of learning.

Experiment 1 tested the effects of MK-801 on the acquisition and retention of a water maze task. MK-801 produced a performance, but not a spatial learning deficit. Experiment 2 tested the effects of MK-801 on the acquisition and retention of a radial arm maze task (RAM). MK-801 had no effect on initial acquisition and retention, but impaired subsequent reversal learning when the pattern of rewarded and unrewarded arms was reversed. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of MK-801 on RAM reversal learning in rats previously trained on the initial task in the absence of drugs. MK-801 produced a dose dependent impairment on reversal learning. These results are consistent with one interpretation that MK-801 impairs the ability to suppress interference from previously learned information.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shapiro, Matthew (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365589s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm82p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Methyl aspartate.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rats -- Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pr15s"><dcterms:title>Patterns in the distribution and abundance of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the St. Lawrence River in relation to substrate and other physico-chemical factors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mellina, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using SCUBA and an in situ method of quantifying substrate characteristics, I describe patterns of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) distribution along the St. Lawrence and Hudson Rivers and in Oneida Lake, New York, and develop empirical models for their abundance. Calcium-poor waters originating from rivers draining the Canadian Shield resulted in a lack of zebra mussel along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River east of Montreal until Portneuf despite an abundance of suitable substrate. Calcium concentrations of 15 mg/L or less were found to limit the distribution of zebra mussel. The entire south shore from Cornwall, Ontario to Ile d'Orleans, Quebec was colonized by zebra mussel wherever suitable substrate was found. In the Hudson River, along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River and in Oneida Lake variability in density was primarily related to substrate type which explained between 38% and 91% of the variance. Other factors such as Secchi depth, calcium concentration of the water, the presence of crayfish, native unionid abundance and the maximum width of the river at the site increased the amount of explained variance across the different systems. The influence of substrate type on zebra mussel density and the predictions of the model were also tested using data from the literature, where substrate type explained 75% of the variability in density. The scatter of the literature data above the predictions of the empirical model suggests that North American zebra mussel populations may continue to grow before reaching equilibrium levels. While water chemistry parameters may be useful predictors of the presence or absence of zebra mussel in a given water body, physical factors play a far greater role in determining local abundance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rasmussen, J.

The surface films of the diblock families poly(styrene-block-sodium acrylate) and poly(styrene-block-sodium methacrylate) spread at the air-water interface were also investigated. The morphologies of their surface aggregates, i.e., jellyfish micelle, ribbon, and plane, were studied as parameters such as temperature and sub-phase electrolyte concentration were varied. A novel morphology, the 2-D nanofoam, was also investigated. The cellular walls of the 2-D nanofoams are found to consist of the polystyrene blocks of thickness on the order of the radius of gyration of the polystyrene blocks. Quantitative analysis of these cellular networks provides results similar to macroscopic 2-D surfactant foams indicating that the same forces are operative in both systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lennox, R.

The former fail to see that while negative theology is oriented towards ineffable union with the divine, deconstruction radically denies the possibility of this union. The latter, however, read negative theology solely in the context of this ineffable union, ignoring the possibility of a second apophatic language whose critique of language is itself so radical that it engages in a paradoxcical self-critique that denies, if not union itself, at least the possibility of speaking about union. This second, concurrent language has a distinct family resemblance to Derrida's own deconstructive project, for it embraces the radically negative denials of differance. This study will first present a critique of those who offer either an affirmative or negative answer to the question "Is deconstruction a form of negative theology?", arguing instead that Derrida denies all answers. Its final step will analyze the similarities between negative theology's escape from the silence of pure denial--prayer--and Derrida's own means of escaping the silence summoned when he asks: "How to avoid speaking?"</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kr27t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418p077</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Derrida, Jacques -- Contributions in philosophical theology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophical theology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prayer</dc:subject><dc:subject>Negativity (Philosophy)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jv52p"><dcterms:title>The state and labour : party regimes and state-labour relationships in three Indian states</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sundar, Aparna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of the political party in power in mediating the relationship between the state and labour was examined.

(Stéphane Marc)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Intercropping of a short-cycle legume crop and a longer-cycle non-legume crop has been suggested as a potentially beneficial intercrop combination. Most studies have concerned cereal and legume corps. Few have involved horticultural crops. In 1990 and 1991, a 56-day semi-leafless pea crop (Curly) and a 75-day lettuce crop (Paris Island Cos) were grown both as monocrops and as intercrops. Intercrops consisting of alternating rows of each crop, represented additive populations (56:100) of peas and lettuce. Three lettuce transplanting dates (June 19, 25 and July 4) and three nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 50, 100 kg ha$ sp{-1}$) were tested. Peas were all sown on May 18. In addition, a new pea/lettuce intercropping pattern (45:82), consisting of alternating double rows of peas and lettuce, was tested in 1991. The $ sp{15}$N dilution method was also used to test for nitrogen transfer. Alternate row intercropped lettuce plant$ sp{-1}$ yields were, on average, 76% and 46% lower than their corresponding monocrop yields for the early and late transplanted lettuce, respectively. Declines in yield of 63% and 55% were reported for the double row intercropped lettuce for the early and late transplanting dates, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization significantly improved intercropped fresh lettuce yields but had no effect on monocropped lettuce. Pea yields m$ sp{-1}$ row were unaffected by intercropping. Alternate row land equivalent ratios (LER) ranged from 0.87 to 1.05 and from 1.06 to 1.63, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. The double row LER's ranged from 1.06 to 1.21 in 1991. The higher LER's in 1991 reflected higher pea yields. No evidence of nitrogen transfer to the lettuce crop was detected.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, Katrine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj49r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr23g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lettuce.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intercropping.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Peas.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nitrogen fertilizers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60cx18t"><dcterms:title>In vitro and in vivo studies on the immunobiology of encysting Giardia lamblia trophozoites</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Campbell, John Darren</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gerbils, experimentally infected with Giardia lamblia trophozoites, had trophozoites and encysting trophozoites in all 3 equal sections of the small intestine and in the colon at necropsy. Cysts were found in the second and third sections of the small intestine and in the colon. WB strain derived trophozoites (WB, D1, WB-C6, and V1) differed in levels of encystation in vitro but not in gerbils. Passage in gerbils increased the in vitro encystation levels of WB and D1 but decreased that of WB-C6 and V1. No differences were found in the total protein profiles or isoenzyme patterns of these G. lamblia populations. Immunization of mice with in vitro cysts produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing cyst protein antigens. In Immunofluorescence (IFA), mAb 5A4.G6 recognized cyst walls. This mAb reacted with a 38 kD band on Western blots. IFA results showed that mAb 8C5.C11 reacts with vesicles in encysting trophozoites and with cyst walls. It recognized 26, 28, 42 and 46 kD bands in Western blots. When mAb 8C5.C11 and Guinea pig complement were added to 0-9 hour encysting cultures, the numbers of cysts produced were significantly reduced compared to control. MAb 5A4.G6 did not affect in vitro encystation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Faubert, G. M.

Nitrogen fertility caused an increase in YLD, lodging, several yield components, GPC, and breadmaking quality and caused a reduction in N harvest index and grain ash, and N use efficiency (NUE) resulting in an increase in soil residual NO$ sb3$-N. Split N application reduced lodging, tillers and spikes m$ sp{-2}$ and caused an increase in grain weight, GPC, loaf volume and NUE. Grain yield increases were largely due to increases in the grain spike$ sp{-1}$ and tillers n$ sp{-2}$. Absolute protein content was found to be critical in determining GPC. Cultivars showed plastic responses to N. Despite its high YLD and flour yield, Hege 155-85 may be risky to produce because of its high dependence on N. Mineralization of N occurred during winter. Marked differences existed between the sites.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, D. L.

Grain corn yields increased with increases in N rates, and split applications of N were superior to preplant incorporated (PPI) fertilizer. Grain N uptake was associated to grain yield and N uptake. Stover yields increased with increased N and varied with application times of N, but the effects were not as pronounced as with grain yields. Soil NO$ sb3$ generally increased with increases of added N but not with split application of N compared to PPI N.

Personal expenditures and revenue sources were endogenized into Agriculture Canada's I-O open model. Two models were developed, Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1 was a closed model that assumed homogeneity among households. Model 2 relaxed the homogeneity assumption. The superiority of Model 2 was empirically demonstrated by comparing the economic indicators generated by the models. The indicators of interest were industrial output, GDP at factor cost and the number of paid jobs. A sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of changes in wages and salaries and final demand on the models. Larger differences were found between the models when wages and salaries were stimulated. As hypothesized, Model 1 underestimated the contribution of the lowest wages and salaries group by 19.9 percent and overestimated the impact of the higher wages and salaries group by 19 percent. A $1 million increase in the final demand for agricultural, agri-food and petrochemical products was also simulated. The largest impacts on industrial output occurred when agricultural production was shocked ( $3.8 million). This was followed by agri-food products ($3.2 million) and petrochemical products ( $2.7 million). While differences in the models' estimates were minimal when changes in final demand were simulated, Model 2 generated additional information on the distribution of income. In conclusion, the results generated by the I-O model with the disaggregated household sector, Model 2, were consistent with budget data and economic theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomassin, Paul J.

Three cultivars of timothy (Salvo, Champ and Bounty) were evaluated at various growth stages. The following quality components were examined: neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), hemicellulose (HEM), crude protein (CP), and in vitro dry matter digestibility. Differences in quality among the locations were measured for the growth stages that were common to all sites. The rate of change in quality with advancing phenological development was also examined to determine differences among locations. The results indicated that there were significant differences in quality among the locations. Although quality was not consistently better for either the northern or southern locations, it showed a tendency to be superior at the southern locations. Locations with the highest dry matter yields were also observed to have inferior forage quality. The rate of change in quality at the locations was not homogeneous for the majority of the quality components. At the northern locations, the rate of change in quality was generally greater than the southern sites. The rate of change in forage quality with growing degree-days was, in general, greater at the northern locations. Furthermore, timothy at the northern locations reached the same level of a given quality component at a lower accumulation of growing degree-days than at the southern locations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coulman, Bruce E.

The study's theoretical framework is based upon several concepts inherent in the theory of compellence as conceptualized by Schelling (1966) and Craig and George (1983). Furthermore, several key elements of domestic politics are incorporated into the framework to add richness to this traditional conception of inter-state bargaining. The empirical validity of the hypotheses rests on the findings generated by four case studies, including the use of the Strategic Defense Initiative as a bargaining chip. This study's findings show that there is, in fact, no basis for traditional criticisms levelled at the use of bargaining chips in arms control. However, the study strongly suggests that policy-makers should be prepared to escalate the operation of a negative leverage from the threat to deploy a weapon system through actual deployment to the exercise of positive leverage to fully exploit the bargaining chip's potential.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>James, Patrick (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r181p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q13g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arms control.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Strategic Defense Initiative</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848r479"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of prostatic obstruction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Péloquin, François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common condition.
