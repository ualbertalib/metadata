This thesis thus takes recent decisions of the Quebec courts that apply the province's Charter of the French Language to the Internet as a point of departure for an in-depth analysis of the nature of sovereignty as an increasingly indeterminate principle of law in the emerging discipline known as Internet Law. Ultimately, the chaos that the Internet initially provoked may be resolved by the return to ethical principles based on the theoretical approach of legal pluralism and the philosophical treatment of ethical responsibility as proposed by Emmanuel Levinas' "humanism of the other".</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3659316.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sz068</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Internet -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sovereignty.</dc:subject><dc:subject>French language -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sz08t"><dcterms:title>Epileptiform synchronization of the rat insular and perirhinal cortices in vitro</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sudbury, Jessica Rosemary.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of adult epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown that the hippocampus plays a principle role in epileptogenesis. Recent clinical studies have additionally implicated extrahippocampal brain structures as important participants in TLE, including the perirhinal cortex (PC) and the insular cortex (IC). Modelling TLE with animals rendered epileptic (chronic models of TLE) have corroborated such clinical findings, and have enhanced our understanding of the pharmacology and network interactions that occur during sustained limbic seizures. Due to certain constraints associated with the chronic models, however, brain slices treated with pharmacological agents that induce synchronous neuronal network activity (acute models of TLE) have been popular systems with which to study epileptogenicity in vitro. These acute models have reproduced many findings from clinical and chronic animal studies, and have additionally revealed new and exciting concepts that have helped guide hypothesis-driven epilepsy research. The 4-aminopyridine (4AP) acute model of TLE has been especially useful in investigating GABAergic signaling during epileptiform network synchronization, and was therefore chosen to answer the questions asked within this study. Using this model, I have provided the first evidence of epileptiform synchronicity among the PC and the IC in vitro, and have resolved some pharmacological and network mechanisms involved in sustaining such activity. Furthermore, I discovered that in the absence of glutamatergic signaling, GABAergic pathways can produce synchronous network activity in the PC and the IC that is modulated by the activation of mu-opioid receptors. The experiments presented here support clinical and chronic animal study findings concerning the involvement of the PC and the IC in TLE, and additionally provide interesting observations that may impact research that focuses on IC involvement in nociception.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440x917.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sz08t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612s860"><dcterms:title>Mapping of the TGF-[beta] 1 binding domain of CD109, a novel transforming growth factor beta accessory receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Soe-Lin, Hahn.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine with a broad spectrum of effects including cellular proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. Dysregulation of its action has been implicated in a wide variety of conditions including hypertrophic scarring. CD109 is a novel TGF-P accessory receptor that inhibits TGF-beta1 signaling and cellular responses in an isoform specific manner. Modulation of signaling via CD109 may have the potential to abrogate scarring by altering pro-scarring TGF-beta ligand isoform ratios. The objectives of the current study were to (1) map the TGF-beta1 binding domain of CD 109 as a first step towards the development of a small molecular antagonist based on that domain, and (2) test whether such a molecule inhibits TGF-beta1 binding to its signaling receptors. We cloned a series of partial CD109 constructs into a GST-containing vector, and used it to synthesize and purify GST-fusion proteins spanning the entire CD109 molecule. We then used these constructs to test for their ability to inhibit TGF-beta1 binding to its receptors in an in vitro affinity labeling assay using HaCat and HEK293 cell lines. Of the six constructs tested, three, encompassing regions spanning amino acids 606-766, 640-720, and 640-1045 successfully bound TGF-beta1 and sequestered it away from its signaling receptors. The current study reports the development and synthesis of a novel 80 amino acid peptide capable of binding to and sequestering TGF-beta1 ligand and demonstrating that a TGF-beta1 binding domain on CD 109 resides between amino acids 640-720.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fn36z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612s860</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kv51h"><dcterms:title>Improving the spatial resolution of the MicroPET R4 scanner by wobbling the bed</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Suk, Joon Young.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The MicroPET R-4 scanner was designed for imaging small rodents such as mice and rats. In many cases its spatial resolution is not good enough to perform the required task. We have implemented an eccentric motion (commonly referred to as wobbling) which is applied to the bed during scanning. The program which histograms the list-mode data was rewritten to increase the spatial sampling by incorporating the wobble position in the sinograms. The corrections for the dwell time, apparent crystal location, and crystal-pair efficiency are applied within the program. A series of scans were performed to decide the optimum wobble radius; it was found to be 1.50 mm. Another series of scans was performed during which a Na-22 source was moved 0.25 mm between scans with and without the optimal wobble motion. The peak-to-valley ratio between two Na-22 point sources 4.0 mm apart, improved from 1.75 in the conventional mode to 2.26 during wobbled scans applying a ramp filter. The bed wobbling mechanism can he added to the microPET R4 or P4 scanners without any major changes to make wobble motion and without compromising any imaging modes. Implementing the wobble mechanism may present a cost-effective upgrade over a trade in or purchase of the higher performance scanner.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x338r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kv51h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bg91r"><dcterms:title>Role of methyl CpG binding protein 2 in regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator espression and breast cancer metastasis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shikimi, Keisuke.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Invasion and metastasis are crucial steps in breast cancer for patient's survival. Recent studies suggest the involvement of loss of DNA methylation resulting in the activation of prometastatic genes, such as uPA and heparanase, during metastasis progression. Also, global DNA hypomethylation and regional DNA hypermethylation are associated with tumorigenesis. Methylated CpG binding protein 2 (MBD2) binds to methylated DNA and demethylates it. Early growth response 1 (EGR1) is also implicated in metastasis and DNA demethylation. We show in this study that MBD2 expression in breast cancer cell lines correlates with uPA expression. Moreover, MBD2 overexpression leads to a global DNA hypomethylation. Furthermore, MBD2 and EGR1 expression induces uPA promoter activity alone or in combination. We also demonstrate a physical interaction between EGR1 and uPA promoter as well as EGR1 and MBD2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MBD2 in association with EGR1 regulates uPA gene expression through DNA demethylation, and involvement of MBD2 in regulation of metastasis progression.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t84g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg91r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732df18r"><dcterms:title>The representation of frequent word combinations in lexical memory /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McDevitt, Jason.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many current psycholinguistic theories view the mental lexicon as a listing of (only) unpredictable sound-meaning correspondences (primarily words and morphemes). Under this view, regular complex word forms and syntactic structures are built with rules during language production, obviating the need for storage of complex but regular linguistic material. This type of model conflicts with recent experimental evidence that suggests that lexical memory may in fact consist of a more heterogeneous set of linguistic units, including complex word forms and multi-word expressions that in theory could be constructed via rules. Storage of such material seems to be driven largely by frequency. The present research consisted of two experiments designed to investigate whether semantically transparent noun and adjective phrases are stored as single lexical units when they are very frequent. Results from the two tasks (grammaticality judgment and speech production) supported the notion that frequent word combinations can come to be stored holistically in lexical memory. It was argued that usage-based models of lexical memory (vs. dominant generative theories) best account for such data. Data from language acquisition, aphasia, and corpus studies were offered as complementary evidence in support of the more general claim that a large component of linguistic competence is knowledge of lexical co-occurrence patterns. Finally, it was hypothesized that an exemplar-based model of lexical memory best captures the range of available data.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sj04w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732df18r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Experimental.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Cognitive.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82kc61h"><dcterms:title>Proteomics and the identification of serum biomarkers in a mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Otolaryngology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mlynarek, Marcin Aleksander.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objective.

PCR amplification of the DNA was then performed using six dinucleotide and two mononucleotide microsatellite markers. Forty benign and malignant thyroid tumors were compared with their adjacent normal thyroid follicular tissue and were analyzed for MSI. 9/14 papillary thyroid carcinomas and 10/16 of follicular thyroid carcinomas demonstrated MSI at &gt;30--40% of loci tested. For benign follicular adenomas, 9/10 demonstrated microsatellite stability or low-frequency MSI. Microsatellite instability appears to play a role in thyroid pathogenesis as evidenced by the high frequency of MSI in malignant thyroid neoplasms. In addition our study showed a significant difference in MSI frequency between follicular adenomas and follicular carcinomas. More importantly, the technique of laser capture microdissection allows for more accurate selection of benign, malignant and normal DNA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nn31h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g915t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70n0533"><dcterms:title>Autonomic dysfunction in fibromyalgia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mendelson, Anita.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Autonomic nervous system dysfunction characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity at rest and sympathetic hypo-reactivity to physical stressors has been demonstrated in individuals with fibromyalgia.

The periplasmic protein FhuD then binds TonB and transfers iron to the cytoplasmic membrane-associated permease FhuB/C. Phage display results predict complementary binding sites on both TonB and FhuD, advocating the need for direct evidence of these interactions. Analytical ultracentrifugation results indicated that both FhuD and TonB were predominantly monomeric in Hepes-NaCl buffer. SEDFIT analysis agreed with their theoretical molecular weights of 32 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively. TonB sedimented at 1.7 S and FhuD at 2.2 S. Frictional ratios confirmed that TonB is elongated while FhuD is globular in solution. For surface plasmon resonance experiments, TonB with a cysteine residue introduced at its N-terminus was immobilized using thiol or amine coupling methods on Biacore sensor chips. Kinetic modeling of FhuD interactions with immobilized TonB indicated that this is a high-affinity interaction (ie. low nanomolar KD) with 1:1 binding stoichiometry. In the presence of ferricrocin, the degree of binding was not altered significantly. Overall, the present data provide the first direct evidence of a specific binding interaction between FhuD and TonB. FhuD has a higher affinity for TonB in absence of siderophores. This suggests that FhuD might be released from TonB upon binding of siderophores, thereby efficiently shuttling ligands to FhuB/C complex on the cytoplasmic membrane.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f67x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h8511</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2r36v2747"><dcterms:title>The effect of altering the head's mechanics on gaze shift accuracy in humans /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kokkinos, Vasileios.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel methodology for investigating the performance of the eye-head coordination system in humans is proposed. The objective is to alter the head's mechanics by applying torque loads during gaze shifts. A servo-motor, connected to the subject's head through a "motor shaft-to-dental bite" arrangement, is applying brief torque pulses in order to both aid and resist the head's movement, thus increasing and reducing respectively the head's velocity. The subjects perform a simple visual task to guide their gaze shifts in the dark, that is, after fixating on a standard point in space, a briefly flashed target will indicate the amplitude of the required gaze movement. Three targets appear in the horizontal plane within, at the limits of, and beyond the human oculomotor range (40¬∞, 55¬∞, and 70¬∞ respectively) in order to cover a significant range within which the head's contribution to the gaze coordinated movement is indispensable. The main question, the proposed methodology aims to answer, regards the effect of the torque loads on gaze shift accuracy. Two (2) subjects were tested under the above-mentioned conditions. Their accuracy was not significantly affected, although both head velocity and gaze duration were considerably altered by the torque loads. The results support the existence of a feedback control mechanism in the eye-head coordination system that keeps track of the on-going movement and adjusts the movement's kinematics on-line accordingly.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k947v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v2747</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79408234w"><dcterms:title>Defining QUAKING's ribonucleoprotein complex and its potential involvement in microRNA processing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lacroix, Genevi√®ve.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The quaking gene encodes a family of alternatively spliced RNA binding protein isoforms that differ in their C-terminal regions.

Novel therapies seek to restore a functional beta-cell mass through stimulating endogenous beta-cell mass expansion. Whilst there is considerable evidence that the beta-cell mass is under homeostatic regulation in the normal pancreas, it is unclear if such regulation exists in the context of induced beta-cell mass expansion. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that beta-cell mass expansion resulting from the induction of islet cell neogenesis is subject to long-term homeostatic control in the normoglycemic mouse adult pancreas. A pentadecapeptide fragment of Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein (INGAP 104-118) was administered daily to adult C57BL/6J mice for 12 weeks. Four animals from the INGAP104-118 treatment group and control group were sacrificed each week. The pancreas was removed from each mouse and stained for insulin. beta-cell mass was calculated as the organ weight multiplied by the percent of insulin+ area of total tissue area. Contrary to our expectations, there was no change in the total beta-cell mass in INGAP104-118-treated animals compared to control. Reanalysis of the stained tissue sections was preformed, and insulin+ structures were classified as being: (1) a duct islet, (2) a cluster of insulin+ cells, or (3) a mature islet. The density (#/mm2) of duct islets, clusters, and total structures in INGAP 104-118-treated animals was significantly increased; conversely, the density of mature islets was significantly decreased. The increase in cluster density suggests that INGAP104-118 induced neogenesis in the pancreas of treated animals. Poisson regression revealed 9th order polynomial time trends in the structure densities. Though these time trends differed between the classes of structures, they were identical in INGAP104-118 and control animals for each class of structure, suggesting an external stimulus was acting equally on both groups. While this study did not determine if there is homeostatic regulation of induced beta-cell mass expansion, it did reveal important aspects for the design of a future study to address this issue.

We evaluated the electron Monte Carlo (eMC) module of the Eclipse‚Ñ¢ using a verification data set comprised of depth dose curves, profiles, Relative Output Factors (ROF), and 2-0 dose distributions in the transverse plane in a homogeneous phantom. The verification data set was comprised of measurements performed for combinations of 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV beam energies with five standard field sizes and thirteen irregularly shaped fields under three phantom setups. The phantom setups were normal beam incidence at source-to-surface distance (SSO) = 100cm, normal incidence with extended SSO=11 Ocm, and oblique incidence with extended SSO=11 Ocm. Calculations were performed in a digital phantom with the maximum number of particles accepted by Eclipse ‚Ñ¢ with a grid spacing that was no larger than approximately one-tenth the distal falloff distance of the electron depth dose curve from 80% to 20% of the maximum dose. Overall, the agreement between the calculated dose distributions and measured on es was good for fields larger than 2 cm to better than 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd96w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333657t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vw214"><dcterms:title>Identification and characterization of rearrangements in the vervet monkey genome</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Badhwar, AmanPreet.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several mechanisms can lead to the reorganization of genomes during speciation, including centromere repositioning, new centromere emergence or other chromosomal rearrangements. Using a comparative karyotype approach, I determined that the vervet genome contains at least 12 evolutionary young centromere locations. To study the evolutionary dynamics of centromere formation, I identified and validated the alpha-satellite repeat as a centromere-specific marker in the vervet using comparative genomics, sequence analysis and hybridization screening. I developed criteria to infer the position of vervet bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) inserts based on alpha-satellite monomer content. In a complementary approach, I demarcated the pericentromeric boundaries in human and identified vervet BAC clones that mapped orthologously to these regions. In addition to centromeric analyses, I developed methodologies to detect other genome rearrangements, in particular vervet deletion/human insertion and vervet translocation events. The tools and approaches developed in this thesis will prove useful in cataloguing additional vervet genome rearrangements.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9034243.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vw214</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n539r"><dcterms:title>Methodological study of nicotine conditioned place preference in rats</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Baharnouri, Golriz.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is widely believed that nicotine is the main reason for acquiring and maintaining tobacco addiction. However, animal studies suggest that nicotine is only a weak reinforcer compared to other drugs of abuse. For example, nicotine does not consistently produce a conditioned place preference (CPP), a standard measure of reward in rats. We attempted to examine the reason(s) for this discrepancy by manipulating several procedural variables in this paradigm. In addition, we hypothesized that partial monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition, as observed in smokers, may potentiate the rewarding effects of nicotine in the CPP paradigm. Overall, we were not able to obtain reliable nicotine CPP and none of the procedural variables tested (e.g. speed of injection, nicotine pre-treatment) proved to play an important role in acquisition of nicotine CPP. Possible reasons for the failure of our experiments and of other nicotine CPP studies are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354k52x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n539r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cz54g"><dcterms:title>The magnetic properties, crystal and magnetic structures of Nd5SixGe4-x /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Huabin, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The magnetic properties, crystal and magnetic structures of Nd5 SixGe4-x were investigated by ac susceptibility and high resolution neutron powder diffraction. The magnetic and crystalline phase diagrams were derived. Four distinct structures exist in the Nd 5SixGe4-x system: Gd5Ge 4-type [O(II)], Gd5Si2Ge2-type (M), Gd5Si4-type [O(I)], and Zr5Si4-type (T). The refinements of the neutron powder diffraction patterns revealed that the Nd5SixGe4-x compounds exhibit mixed ferro-antiferromagnetic structures. The ac susceptibility measurements showed that the magnetic ordering temperature of Nd5SixGe 4-x increases slightly with increasing silicon content, except that it increases by a factor of 2 in the orthorhombic Gd5Si 4-type [O(I)] phase region. The abrupt change of the magnetic ordering temperature between x = 2.25 and x = 2.5, where the monoclinic Gd5Si 2Ge2-type (M) structure changes to the orthorhombic Gd 5Si4-type [O(I)] structure, suggested that a first order magnetostructural transition likely takes place in this narrow composition range (2.25 &lt; x &lt; 2.5). The investigation of Nd5Si2.335 Ge1.665 revealed that Nd5Si2.335Ge 1.665 adopts the Gd5Si2Ge2-type (M) structure and undergoes a first order magnetostructural transition from the paramagnetic-monoclinic Gd5Si2Ge2-type (M) structure to the orthorhombic Gd5Si4-type [O(I)] structure upon cooling. The T1-T1 bonds increases by ~1 A when the the Gd 5Si4-type [O(I)] structure (10 K) transforms to the Gd 5Si2Ge2-type (M) structure (140 K). The giant magnetocaloric effect is not observed in Nd5Si2.335Ge 1.665 probably due to the co-existence of the M phase and the O(I) phase. The maximum magnetic entropy change in Nd5Si2.335Ge 1.665 is 7.3 J/kg K for magnetic field change from 0 to 7 Tesla, which is similar to that obtained in Nd5Si1.5Ge2.5, the neighboring phase O(I).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kp88q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cz54g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Magnetic materials -- Thermal properties.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neodymium.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adiabatic demagnetization.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gj15f"><dcterms:title>The effects of alternative harvesting practices on saproxylic beetles in eastern mixedwood boreal forest of Quebec /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Webb, Annie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I examined saproxylic beetle responses in two silvicultural systems of the eastern mixedwood boreal forest of Quebec.

A second study focused on effects of partial cutting, a method that may serve to imitate natural succession dynamics. Remnant forest patches had the highest saproxylic and bark and woodboring beetle species richness and relative abundance. Although non-significant, higher larval densities were also collected from remnant forest patches. In the second study, partial cut patches had an intermediate saproxylic beetle assemblage compared to uncut forest and clearcuts.

Recent experimental approaches are mainly focused on the bulk properties of colloidal gels, using methods of static and dynamic light scattering and shear rheometry. This thesis describes the development of a system for measuring the mechanical properties of colloidal gels with optical tweezers. We make colloidal gels out of polystyrene beads of two different sizes, diameters of 3.5mum or 62nm respectively. Investigation of the colloidal gels under the light microscope shows the fractal nature of the gel structure while macroscopic study confirms that the gelation process of the smaller polystyrene beads is faster than that of the bigger polystyrene beads. We were also able to generate a phase diagram of the gelation process. We successfully assembled the main instrument, a time-sharing single beam optical tweezers, and calibrated the lateral stiffness of the optical trap. Our optical tweezers setup is used to study the polystyrene gel and it has many more applications in colloidal samples. The strong 3D optical trapping highlights the optical tweezers as a powerful technique suitable for further investigation of colloidal samples.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752n00d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp60t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Optics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r520s"><dcterms:title>Multi-resolution motion textures and applications</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wahab, Matthew Randall.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Vector fields arise from experiments and simulations in many scientific and engineering disciplines. The visualization of this data is important to understanding the inherent, nature of the field-generating process as well as providing an intuitive notion of the system's behavior. This thesis addresses some of the limitations in the flow visualization technique of Langer et al. [19]. One drawback of their method is that it uses a static uniform resolution grid. It cannot add more resolution in highly varying areas of the field without increasing the resolution for the entire grid, which comes at a substantial cost. We extend the method to use an adaptive multiresolution grid. This allows the local grid resolution to be dictated by the motion field, leading to both increased accuracy in the visualization as well as a lower computational overhead. Another limitation is that it is restricted to two dimensional grids. We extend the method to curvilinear surface grids. This allows our technique to address a wider range of problems in computer graphics and scientific visualization. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the new method by using our motion textures to perform texture-space bump mapping. Our method is demonstrated on various two dimensional curvilinear surfaces.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1396316.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r520s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924g88x"><dcterms:title>Programmer-friendly decompiled Java</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Naeem, Nomair A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Java decompilers convert Java class files to Java source. Common Java decompilers are javac-specific decompilers since they target bytecode produced from a particular javac compiler. We present work carried out on Dava, a tool-independent decompiler that decompiles bytecode produced from any compiler. A known deficiency of tool-independent decompilers is the generation of complicated decompiled Java source which does not resemble the original source as closely as output produced by javac-specific decompilers. This thesis tackles this short-coming, for Dava, by introducing a new back-end consisting of simplifying transformations. The work presented can be broken into three major categories: transformations using tree traversals and pattern matching to simplify the control flow, the creation of a flow analysis framework for an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of Java source code and the implementation of flow analyses with their use in complicated transformations. The pattern matching transformations rewrite the ASTs to semantically-equivalent ASTs that correspond to code that is easier for programmers to understand. The targeted Java constructs include If and If-Else aggregation, for-loop creation and the removal of abrupt control flow. Pattern matching using tree traversals has its limitations. Thus, we introduce a new structure-based data flow analysis framework that can be used to gather information required by more complex transformations. Popular compiler analyses e.g., reaching definitions, constant propagation etc. were implemented using the framework. Information from these analyses is then leveraged to perform more advanced AST transformations. We performed experiments comparing different decompiler outputs for different sources of bytecode. The results from these experiments indicate that the new Dava back-end considerably improves code comprehensibility and readability.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fw84x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g88x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Java (Computer program language)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Decompilers (Computer programs)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70n055n"><dcterms:title>Particle tracking with application to the trafficking of synaptic receptors :</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Naud, Richard.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Particle tracking is an optical microscopy based technique that can probe very small changes in the dynamics of microscopic objects.

The purpose of my thesis is to develop a comprehensive approach for single-particle tracking applied to the lateral diffusion of synaptic receptors. This thesis will describe the proper use of particle tracking including the description of how particle tracking algorithms are able to extract trajectories of particles from a set of consecutive digital time series images. Second, several methods to extract coefficients of motion from the trajectories will also be described, followed by a statistical analysis to determine the precision of the measured coefficients. Finally the application of particle tracking to measure the motion of synaptic receptors on the dendritic membrane of neurons will be presented. Overall, this document is a useful, up-to-date and concise thesis for biophysicists and molecular biologists who are interested in using particle tracking to measure the transport properties of membrane receptors using from time series microscopy images.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268951f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70n055n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67ws02f"><dcterms:title>Synthetic routes to non-symmetric tropones</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Navasero, Neenah.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The synthesis of substituted non-symmetric tropones has proven to be a considerable synthetic challenge.

Two approaches towards the synthesis of substituted tropones are presented. Both utilize linear diene precursors which are closed to 7-membered cycloheptene rings via ring closing metathesis. In the first method, linear precursors are synthesized by addition of nucleophilic substituents to carbonyl groups to form alcohol groups. After forming the cycloheptene ring, the alcohol groups are eliminated to form the tropone. The second method uses an oxidation protocol to form a,(3-unsaturation on either side of a cycloheptenone precursor. An attempt towards the synthesis of the desired tropone required for the CP-225,917 synthesis is also presented. The methods described here use simple inexpensive starting materials and provide access to tropone substitution not readily available through other means.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v275h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67ws02f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tropolone -- analogs &amp; derivatives.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cycloalkanes -- Derivatives.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nn32s"><dcterms:title>Powell's realizability universe</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nashaat, Sherif.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>After a brief introduction to the main results of Recursion Theory, we present the notion of Partial Applicative Structures (PAS).
