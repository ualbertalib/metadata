Experiments were carried out to determine the effects of emulsion concentration (1-5% w/v), transmembrane pressure (0.103-1.241 MPa), and temperature (25-45$ sp circ$C) on the permeation rate of clean water and on the oil content of the water, using a model cutting oil emulsion having a mean droplet size of 2.8 um. The emulsion concentration had no effect on the permeate flux. Increasing temperature or pressure increased the flux. The concentration of oil in the permeate was directly proportional to the emulsion feed concentration, yielding rejections of oil greater than 0.995. At feed concentrations above 5% w/v, the membrane fouled. The permeate fluxes were approximately 1.5 L/min m$ sp2$ for the 10 000 MWCO membrane, and 5.0 /min L/min m2 for the 30 000 MWCO membrane. A statistical model was developed relating ie permeate flux to the temperature and pressure. The fluxes were compared to a gel polarization model which was based on shear-driven diffusion. The experimental fluxes were somewhat higher than the predicted fluxes, with better agreement for the 50 000 MWCO membrane.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Simandl, J.

The system is completely bottom-up, using pixel region-matching techniques. A coordinated gradient descent method is broken down into two stages; pixel region matching error measures are locally minimized, and flow field consistency constraints apply non-linear adaptive diffusion, causing confident measurements to influence their less confident neighbors. Convergence is usually accomplished with one iteration for an image frame pair. Temporal integration and Kalman filtering predicts upcoming flow fields and figure/ground separation. The algorithm is designed for flexibility: large displacements are tracked as easily as sub-pixel displacements, and higher-level information can feed flow field predictions into the measurement predictions into the measurement process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, Frank P.

Using methods based on adaptive control, a new formulation is introduced such that bench calibration of the robot joint sensors and actuators is no longer necessary. When adaptive control is used in identification, inaccuracies caused by various sources of noise are averaged out because the identification takes place on-line, this is in contrast to static methods which rely on a limited number of input data. This method is unique because the joint calibration is done with respect to invariant forces due to gravity loading. The method also guarantees convergence to the true values from arbitrary initial estimates. Experimental results are presented which were performed on two links of a six degree of freedom hand-controller. Results show that angles can be recovered to an accuracy of $ pm1.5 sp circ$ in the absence of initial estimates. From both the theoretical derivations and experiments, the properties and performance of the algorithm are discussed. Conclusions and topics for future research are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t8386.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x118v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wj07x"><dcterms:title>Methods and practice of blast-induced vibration monitoring</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Andrieux, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Regardless of the objective sought, the conclusions drawn from seismic monitoring can only be as good as the quality of the recorded data: the importance of properly capturing relevant raw vibrational information in the first place is thus absolutely crucial. The difficulty is that blast-induced vibration monitoring is site specific and that general formulas do not apply: every situation will correspond to a unique combination of objectives, ground conditions, blast design and explosive types, and will need to be monitored accordingly. To adequately acquire all the pertinent seismic information, a number of points must be successfully addressed, such as the choice of sensors, their location, number, orientation and anchoring, the transmission of the captured signals from these gauges to the recording equipment, and the choice and set-up of the data acquisition system. It is the purpose of this thesis to address these questions in some detail, in an attempt to provide the reader with an understanding of how all the components involved in blast-induced vibration monitoring interact, and on how the choices made at each step can significantly affect overall results.

The study consists of four chapters which examine four contexts in which the story, for the purposes of this thesis, should be interpreted. The first is historical, in which the previous reception of the novella, as well as the author's own struggle with his identity, is investigated. In the second, Mann's philosophical paradigms to represent homoeroticism, drawn largely from classical Greece and Nietzsche, are examined. Freud's views of homosexuality and sublimation furnish the basis for the third chapter, in which sublimated imagery of sexual desire in the text is considered. Finally, the narrative strategies employed by Mann that render the story palatable to his heterosexual, bourgeois reading audience are illustrated in the fourth chapter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peters, Paul P.

This construction posed a serious problem for the study of Aspect in Semantics. That is, it seems to allow two contradictory interpretations: progressive and perfect of result. We argue that the the two distinct readings are the result of the syntactic interaction of the morpheme "te", the aspectual predicate, and the aspectual auxiliary verb "i-(ru)". Adopting the framework proposed by Travis (1991, 1994), we argue that the semantic operators, "BECOME" and "CAUSE", originally proposed by Dowty (1979), are actually generated in Syntax as the aspectual predicate, Asp$ sp0$, and the higher V$ sp0$ of a double VP structure, respectively. The event argument (Higginbotham 1985) is, we claim, subcategorized for and $ theta$-marked by the aspectual predicate. Further, we demonstrate that a morpheme "te" is an imperfective marker, and show that the two readings, progressive type and perfect type, arise because this morpheme is generated in the higher aspectual category, EP, in Japanese. The auxiliary verb "i-(ru)" connects the embedded event noted by EP to an interval time through the control of the event argument. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that Aspect is a syntactic category.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Travis, Lisa (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558g261.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r045x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Japanese language -- Aspect.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322g35r"><dcterms:title>Philosophy, history, language and education : the hermeneutic epistemology underlying scientific linguistics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lugtig, Joan F.

The thesis begins by situating the "metalanguage" in which the argumentation between Chomsky and Quine takes place in the Western philosophical tradition.

Since then, his articles and essays mostly revolved around secularism, americanization, consumerism, and effects of television. These issues are also part of his novels, which are always linked to Quebec reality, and often serve to express his theses in a different perspective.

It was also evident that at the early viewing times younger children did not predict ball flight as well as older groups. Similarly, children with DCD predicted more poorly at most viewing times compared to their non-DCD peers. Similar results were found for gender in the analysis comparing DCD and non-DCD children.

This thesis attempts to examine Lewis's thoughts on metaphor against the background of modern metaphor theory. Forty or fifty years ago such a study would have been less fruitful, for his views on metaphor so differed from contemporary theorists that their works offered no positive atmosphere in which to approach his work. Now, however, the general tenor of certain streams in metaphor theory has become more amenable to his views. Indeed, it appears that some key issues raised in modern metaphor theory exist in a seminal form in Lewis's writings. While Lewis cannot be put into any one school, modern theory offers the necessary tools with which to approach his discussions of the figure. This thesis, therefore, begins by briefly outlining the history of metaphor theory in so far as it relates to Lewis. The second chapter discusses his metaphysics, since he believed that his views on metaphor had metaphysical implications. The third and fourth chapters present Lewis's view of metaphor' process and function, as gleaned from his writings. Finally, the thesis concludes by relating Lewis's view back to his metaphysics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v73w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q835n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Metaphor</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lewis, C.

This work explores the factors that motivated the creation of Filter Designer, and examines the process of its development, from basic user interface design to the calculation and implementation of digital filters for use with audio signals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pennycook, Bruce (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97ks45z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741t80p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Acoustic filters</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g945z"><dcterms:title>Public opinion and the British Legion in Spain, 1835-1838</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>James, Richard, 1949-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines public opinion towards the participation opinion of the British Auxiliary Legion in the Spanish Civil War. It is based on an analysis of British newspapers, periodicals and political discussion between 1835 and 1838. It suggests that, although there was some degree of support for the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston in sending the legion to aid liberalism in the Peninsula, yet that support declined rapidly. In spite of Palmerston's eventual claim that intervention in Spain had been worthwhile, public opinion was not to reflect the view that his policy had been a right one, or that the British Auxiliaries had been indispensable to the cause of Spanish constitutionalism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Senior, Hereward (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft463.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g945z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Great Britain -- Military relations -- Spain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spain -- Military relations -- Great Britain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spain -- History -- Carlist War, 1833-1840 -- Foreign public opinion, British</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spain -- History -- Carlist War, 1833-1840 -- Participation, British</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811km693"><dcterms:title>Liberal reforms and the statist agenda : the thought and politics of Liberal social reform in early twentieth century Britain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jabbari, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the social reforms ushered in by the prewar Asquith cabinet.

Firstly, the two Baptist Confessions are compared with each other in the areas of the atonement, baptism, the Church, and religious liberty, to see if Particular Baptist beliefs had changed. Secondly, the 1689 Baptist Confession is compared with the two leading English Calvinistic Confessions of the seventeenth century, the Presbyterian Westminster Confession and the Congregationalist Savoy Declaration, in order to see their similarities and differences in the same four areas.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Furcha, Edward (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c94v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m46w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Baptists -- Creeds</dc:subject><dc:subject>Baptists -- Doctrines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Creeds -- Comparative studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Congregational churches -- Creeds</dc:subject><dc:subject>Presbyterian Church -- Creeds</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kj32j"><dcterms:title>Interpersonal negotiation strategies and ego development in relation to maladaptive behaviour in preadolescents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Howell, Angela, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Interpersonal negotiation strategies and ego development of 32 preadolescents attending a day treatment program and 33 non-referred, demographically matched preadolescents was compared.

Referred preadolescents generated developmentally lower strategies than non-referred preadolescents, specifically in contexts involving unfamiliar adults and familiar children. Level of perspective taking predicted parent's rating of maladapted behaviour on the Child Behaviour Checklist-Revised.

However the international definition of a refugee contained in the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees does not explicitly include gender as an enumerated ground on which persecution can be feared. This omission has required women who fear gender-based persecution to use the Convention's "membership in a particular social group" provision. Traditionally, judicial interpretation of criteria establishing a "particular social group" was not consistent in cases alleging gender-based persecution. In 1993, Canada developed guidelines that attempt to establish a coherent and consistent application of the "particular social group" category. This represents a state policy initiative to recognize the international evolution of policy on gender as a basis for persecution. Although the guidelines challenge theories of state sovereignty in the design and execution of domestic policy, they demonstrate that a coherent and consistent framework for granting asylum status to women who fear gender-based persecution can be developed in such policy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Black, Jerome (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv68z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t405c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women refugees -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women refugees -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A00000213g"><dcterms:title>Writing from the pen : a study of selected works from American prisons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haslam, Jason W. (Jason William), 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This essay closely studies several works written by American male writers--either while the author was in an American prison, or shortly after he was released. The first works studied, from the nineteenth century, introduce the themes and questions for the later discussion of the other works, all of which are taken from the twentieth century. A central focus of the essay is on the process by which all of the authors studied attempt a textual reversal of the positions of reader and author. In each of the works, the reader, generally seen as a member of 'outside' society, is portrayed as a representative of the imprisoning society. Thus, the textual confrontation is between a prisoner/author and a warden/reader; and the subsequent reversal that takes place through the medium of the text places the reader in the position of being a prisoner, with the author becoming the prison-authority, or warden. This reversal is used by the authors examined as means or attempt at freeing themselves from both the defining and imprisoning texts of society, as well as from the actual prison where the author finds himself. The writing of the prison-text, therefore, is a verbal act intimately associated with the gaining of various forms of at least visionary freedom.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gibian, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268717q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000213g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Prisoners as authors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prisoners' writings, American -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf89b"><dcterms:title>The growth of a secondary city in Costa Rica : a case study of the development of Puntarenas</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>González Pantaleón, Mariá del Pilar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the growth of secondary cities, there is still little written about these intermediate cities in the literature. This thesis addresses this gap by examining the growth of Puntarenas, one such secondary city in Costa Rica. Within the framework of dependency theory and an historical background, this case study examines several factors which have affected the development of this city over the last three decades. An undiversified economy based on fishing, migration patterns, and Puntarenas' dependent relationship with the capital, San Jose, are analyzed in depth. The study, which is based on interviews, statistical data, and published literature, suggests that although there has been some effort to limit the concentration of resources in the centre of the country and to develop secondary cities, these cities continue to be neglected by central powers and, for the most part, are only taken into account when they serve the interests of the centre.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Locher, Uli (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h652w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf89b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Puntarenas (Costa Rica) -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cities and towns -- Costa Rica -- Growth.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq871"><dcterms:title>L' effet-idéologie dans les dialogues de la nouvelle "Arsène Guillot"</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagné, Marie-Josée, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The unique stylistic particularity of the novel as a literary form is that it is the presentation of the speaking human and his words (Bakhtine, 1978). The speaker in a novel is an exponent of a specific ideology and his words serve to express this ideology. For all its ideological components, the novel's dialogues form the characteristic feature of the narrative gender. The characters fill concrete social roles and they speak from within the limits of those roles, their speech emerging from different social languages. Prosper Merimee's short story, Arsene Guillot (1927: 85-145), offers an ensemble of character's constrained voices, of speakers imprisoned by their own social positions. The novel is developed as a sequence of carnivalesque reversals. Paradoxically, the text establishes a prostitute as an admirable figure (Arsene Guillot) and deposits a pious French bourgeoise from her social acknowledgements. Philippe Hamon, in his book Texte et Ideologie (1984), presents a theory of the semiotic of character's normative knowledge. This factorisation of the ideology notion, in separated normative elements, form a group of knowledges composing the text's ideology-effect. With the assistance of the critical concepts of speech universe, power and position struggle, discourse insignia and speaker's desire of fulfillment elaborated by Francois Flahault (1978), we apply the ideas of Hamon to the non-exclusive study of the dialogues in Arsene Guillot. Our pragmatic analysis emphasizes on how the dialogue contributes to the construction of the novel's ideology-effect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c471n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq871</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mérimée, Prosper, 1803-1870 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
