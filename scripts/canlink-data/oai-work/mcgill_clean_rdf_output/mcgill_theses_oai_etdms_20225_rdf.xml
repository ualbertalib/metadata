The characters speculate about the meaning of life and death, about good and evil. Of all Roy's writings, it is undoubtedly in Alexandre Chenevert that these searching questions are most expressly depicted. In this thesis, we will study the manner in which the romantic background of Alexandre Chenevert reflects the religious experience of post-war French Canadians. Under the guise of distorted images, the novel does, in fact, hide an abundant network of themes referring to the religious context of the 1940's-1950's. This period was marked by challenging the ecclesiastical authority. The study of Alexandre Chenevert, a genuine sociological document, will allow us to understand the role religion played in the evolution of the French Canadian society.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666558c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv68k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909- Alexandre Chenevert caissier</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117q059"><dcterms:title>Thule subsistence and optimal diet : a zooarchaeological test of a linear programming model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Whitridge, Peter James</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Thule archaeological sites typically yield large quantities of well-preserved faunal remains.

While both are mixtures of trialkyl phosphine oxides, the trialkyl groups in the former have straight chains, while those in the latter have branched chains. The major variables studied were hydrochloric acid, extractant and zirconium concentrations, and phase ratio. With both reagents, zirconium is extracted rapidly. Extraction increases with increasing hydrochloric acid concentration, and zirconium is loaded as its neutral tetrachloride complex by a solvation reaction. The loaded zirconium forms a di-solvate, except at high excess extractant concentrations, where solvation numbers greater than 2 are found. At a constant total chloride concentration, the zirconium extraction level is maintained if hydrochloric acid is partially replaced by lithium chloride, provided sufficient hydrochloric acid is retained to prevent zirconium hydrolysis. Distribution coefficients decease with increasing zirconium concentration, suggesting that polymerization occurs in the aqueous phase. For given conditions, zirconium extraction into Cyanex 923 is higher than for Cyanex 925. However, loading selectivity for zirconium over other metals has not been studied. A few preliminary experiments have shown that aqueous solutions of ammonium carbonate are potential stripping agents.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g15x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg134</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88ch75m"><dcterms:title>Low-delay speech coding at 16 kbs and below</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Foodeei, Majid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Development of network quality speech coders at 16 kb/s and below is an active research area.

The slender-body solutions are independent of the Mach number, and therefore, for supersonic flow, cannot appropriately take into account the directional propagation of disturbances. The slender-body model is attractively simple of the pressure distribution and lift prediction, but in the supersonic regime it can lead to large errors when the wing geometry is not very slender with respect to the Mach cone. In the treatment of attached flow over arbitrary wing-body combinations in supersonic flow regime, the method of Velocity Singularities based on conical motion provides a more accurate alternative over slender-body theory by considering the appropriate boundary condition of flow disturbances outside the wings. This thesis presents an extension of the method of Velocity Singularities for the analysis of the separated flow over thin delta wings.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386k508.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td244</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn31n"><dcterms:title>A distinguished, nontrivial class in the Chevalley cohomology associated with the Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms of contact structures /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Milson, Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A distinguished class of cocycles in the local Chevalley cohomology associated with the representation of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the vector space of differential 2-forms is defined and proven to be non-zero.

The analytical models for modulus degradation, matrix crack density and delamination size growth as function of fatigue stress and fatigue cycles are proposed. The proposed approach provides four choices for predicting tension-tension fatigue life and for assessing fail-safety for structures made of composite laminates. The direct relation of physical damage to fatigue life and analytical equations for calculating residual elastic moduli E$ rm{ sb1, E sb2, v sb{12}}$ and G$ sb{12}$ in terms of fatigue load and fatigue cycles are proposed.

Intra- and inter-specific egg predation by the two sucker species was observed as well as predation by lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) on sucker eggs. Synchronisation of the spawning of the suckers may allow them to "swamp" egg predators with drifting eggs. Abundance of spawning fish was affected by water management practices in the reservoir. When water levels were low, fewer fish of all species had access to the stream possibly because of the development of rapids. The courtship behavior of the two sucker species was described and compared in the same period, to determine if behavioral isolating mechanisms which prevented hybridization existed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm597.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd586</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Resource partitioning (Ecology) -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>White sucker.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishes -- Québec (Province) -- Ecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Longnose sucker -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mk154"><dcterms:title>A study of mining taxation systems /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Feng, 1957-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study compares three mining taxation systems: royalty, profit tax and profitability tax, in a theoretical framework.

Then, using a computerized model of a hypothetical project, the comparative impacts of the three tax systems are determined. The following conclusions have been drawn from the study: (1) In general, taxes are a significant cost to a mining project.

The crucial problem resided in developing an economic framework to evaluate alternative crop rotations that would provide farmers in transition an optimal rotation plan compatible with organic farming practices. Two multi-period linear programming models were developed for that purpose, both models having different assumptions concerning effects that the transition might have on crop yield. In both transitional models, two crop rotations were selected in the optimal solution. In addition, the establishment of crop rotations was comparable for both models, and this showed that the assumed drop in yield did not have a large impact on the selection of crop rotation. Also, the results support the notion that conversion to organic agriculture had a relatively less negative effect on farm profit if the transition was done gradually.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t9651.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz640</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy farming -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Crop rotation -- Economic aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organic farming -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j63q"><dcterms:title>Optimization of positron imaging systems through the use of tapered collimators</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moreno-Cantú, Jorge J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A Monte Carlo simulation system was enhanced in order to analyze photon transport in tapered geometries.

These parameters include the immediacy of the dramatic experience as a vehicle for identification with the audience and a hero fully capable of realizing the tragic truth of his existence. Curiously restrained by formal requirements postulated in antiquity, the majority of critics have neglected that modern tragedy may have shed structures no longer culturally relevant while maintaining the essence of the tragic vision. The novel has been largely ignored despite its being perfectly suited for a contemporary communication of the tragic vision. The skepticism shattering the belief that our respective destinies can be fully embodied by another is no obstacle for tragedy in the novel. Through a narrating choric figure acting as mediating consciousness, the novel provides a direct link between reader, hero, and the tragic experience. The very act of narration also sheds light on the creation of the tragic text, extending this link to the tragedian himself. The result is a three-pronged identification, (with the hero, choric figure, tragedian), through which the reader is confronted with the multifarious truths laid bare in the text.

This analysis shows how D'Arcy and Arden foreground the encompassing Theatre Possible World, within which the performance takes place, in order to cast doubt on the natural character of generally accepted meanings, and to induce the audience to consciously choose the frames within which it makes sense of action.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Suvin, Darko (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g166.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p573d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arden, John -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>D'Arcy, Margaretta -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p153b"><dcterms:title>The effects of concept mapping on prior knowledge and meaningful learning /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gryspeerdt, Danielle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Undergraduates' conceptual knowledge of important concepts in a Pre-historic Archaeology course was investigated with a pre-post open-ended test procedure.

Of the 124 students who completed the pre- and post-tests, students (n = 45) in the first treatment level were given a reading guide to the textbook material. Students (n = 36) in the second treatment level were given a reading guide with incorporated concept mapping questions. Treatment level three students (n = 43) were also given the concept mapping reading guides and received instructor and peer feedback on their responses to the concept mapping questions. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that students in all three treatment levels gained in conceptual knowledge.

The nonlinear equations of motion are derived for cantilevered pipes and for simply-supported pipes, using Hamilton's principle and the force balance method. The resulting equations are compared with previous derivations. The linearized system is first studied, to get the critical parameters corresponding to the stability boundaries, i.e. the local bifurcations. Then, the nonlinear equations are investigated, both analytically and numerically. Centre manifold, normal form and bifurcation theories are used to obtain complete bifurcation sets which provide the qualitative dynamics of the system. It is shown that chaotic motions may arise under perturbation, or when the motions are constrained by motion-limiting restraints, through calculations of the Lyapunov exponents and the construction of phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams and power spectra. This modeling is in close agreement with experimental observations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440t55r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f9532</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asx61dn568"><dcterms:title>Separation with reverse-micelles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ladanowski, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reverse-micelles are surfactant aggregates in an apolar solvent. The surfactants, which must have two hydrophobic tails, cluster around a water core. The effects of the compositions of the solvent and the aqueous phase on water solubilization were studied for two anionic surfactants: sodium di-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate (AOT) and dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid (DNNSA). Single straight chain alkanes having 6-17 carbons, mixtures of these alkanes and branched alkanes were used as solvents. The aqueous phases consisted of salts and buffers. For AOT in straight chain alkanes, water uptake increased as the length of the chain approached 9 carbons, the length of the AOT hydrocarbon tail. As the solvent length increased further, a critical carbon number was reached above which there was no water uptake. Different buffers shifted the critical carbon number somewhat. Mixtures of straight chain alkanes behaved similar to single alkanes when compared on the basis of volume-average carbon number. Branched alkanes solubilized more water than their straight chain isomers. For DNNSA the water uptake was the same for all solvents.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t0374.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dn568</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jc572"><dcterms:title>Vibration effects on pickforce sensing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Idriss, Omar Selim</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pickforce sensing is a method demonstrating a promising future in automating coal mining machines. The method is based on the ability to determine the vertical location of a rotary cutting machine from the force measured at the point of contact between the machine and the coal seam. A major problem that may degrade the reliability of the pickforce data is vibration and is the major concern of this study. To analyze the effects of vibration on pickforce sensing, a vibration model of the cutting process is first developed. Then, a stochastic model of the coal seam is constructed. Subsequently, the vibration model is simulated in three stages. In these stages, the machine is assumed to be cutting through three types of coal seam: homogeneous, predetermined heterogeneous, and heterogeneous stochastic model. The first stage is conducted to prove that pickforce data always contains a degree of phase shift between successive half revolutions. This eliminates the effect of repetitive or orderly vibration that may mask the pickforce data. In addition, both the first and second stages are conducted to find ways to improve the reliability of pickforce data by adjusting a few parameters within the machine. The third stage is conducted to prove that the chaotic appearance of the pickforce data does not eliminate the features that are used to determine the vertical location. The present study concludes that vibration has a minor effect, and that pickforce sensing can be improved by adjusting some parameters of the cutting machine.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m774c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jc572</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc37b"><dcterms:title>Investigation of deep levels in monocrystalline CuInSe2</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, A.

The current-voltage characteristics at different temperatures were measured. The measured current-voltage data were analyzed by computer fitting using a junction model to obtain parameters. From the computer fitting results, it was confirmed that the recombination process is dominant in the current transport mechanism of the homojunctions in monocrystalline CuInSe$ sb2$. It was found that at a given voltage, the capacitance value decreased when the measuring frequency was increased. This result indicated that deep defects exist in the material. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements were performed on all of the samples in order to investigate the deep levels. Two hole trap levels, one located at 250 $ pm$ 15 meV and the other at 520 $ pm$ 15 meV from the valence band edge, were observed in the samples treated at 200$ sp circ$C in N$ sb2$. For the sample heated at 200$ sp circ$C in air, the latter was at 850 meV. The above results suggested that O atoms may have an important contribution to the defects. The electron traps, with the energy at 182 $ pm$ 14 meV from the conduction band edge, were found on all of the samples treated in N$ sb2$ and air.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666562z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nc37b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57ns187"><dcterms:title>An analysis of three learner-based formative evaluation conditions /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rahilly, Timothy J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The current study seeks to determine the costs and benefits associated with three different learner-based data collection conditions; the one-to-one, dyad, and small group.

Thirty-four (15 males, 19 females) McGill University undergraduate students participated in the study. Participants were instructed on how to report problems they encountered while learning from a six-page instructional unit. Results indicate that the one-to-one condition resulted in the least amount of feedback or data collected.
