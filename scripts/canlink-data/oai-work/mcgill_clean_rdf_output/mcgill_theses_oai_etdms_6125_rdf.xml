The House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs served to channel much of the latter part of the debate and then produced recommendations, many of which were accepted by the Government. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the work of the Finance Committee in its study of tax reform in order to reach some conclusions as to the role of Standing Committees of the House of Commons in policy formulation. The thesis also attempts to examine the function of White Papers in promoting public participation in policy-making.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mallory, J.R.

Depuis une décennie, on note un rapprochement entre les deux groupes. Bien avant l'établissement de relations étroites, cependant, le romancier québécois s'intéressait déjà au Juif, mais l'image qu'il rendait de ce dernier reflétait les préjuges de son proprem.1lieu. Le personnage mythique que l'on a le plus associe au Ju1f est celui du commerçant ruse et âpre au gain; aussi le retrouve-t-on souvent dans le roman québécois. La figure du Juif représente, par contre, des caractéristiques complexes; elle symbolise, par exemple, la souffrance humaine et les romanciers s'identifient à l'angoisse qu'éprouvent leurs personnages. L'idéalisation du Juif représente donc un autre aspect de sa complexité et les écrivains découvrent alors un charme particulier dans l'exotisme qu'évoque pour eux la Juive.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pw305.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v8103</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Jews -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jews in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pq520"><dcterms:title>NATO burden sharing : a case study in alliance cohesion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Munipalli, Yamini</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ce mémoire de recherche essaie de combiner une analyse historique de trois questions au sujet  e la cohésion des pactes militaires avec une étude empirique d'une de ces questions.

Irony was both a national and literary means of retaining trust in God and goodness while encountering barbaric forms of persecution. Though originally alies to America, Yiddish humor penetrated the general culture, particularly after World War II.

The effect of age, cultural background, socio-economic status and intelligence on the degree of conformity was examined. Cultural background proved the most influential factor while socio-economic status and intelligence differed considerably by sex. The consequences of sex role orientation on educational choices, aspirations and advisors were investigated.

Part One of the instrument is designed to measure whether a certain principle is present in the repertoire of the learner, and Part Two is designed to measure whether the learner can use this principle in a problem solving task.  Analysis of the data suggests that Gagne1s model which uses mathematics and physics as content or experimental investigation is applicable, as he suggests, in other content areas ae well.

The metabolites were separated by various extraction procedures and the conjugates investigated by chromatography on DEAE-sephadex. The main steroid found following incubation of El or Ez in all species was El. This agrees with most in vitro studies except where gonadal tissue is concerned. More polar metabolites were virtually absent and there was no evidence of sulfurylation having occurred. Some glucuronide formation was apparent. Incubation of EIS showed a wide range of sulfatase activities, extremely high in the rat and very low in the dog. The hen, followed by the rabbit showed intermediate values. Kidney preparations from rabbit and dog appeared capable of metabolizing EIS without prior hydrolysis. Little evidence was obtained for the presence of significant S-glucuronidase activity in these tissues. On occasion it appeared that EzG could be converted to conjugated metabolites probably the N-acetyl glucosamine derivative.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hobkirk, R.

In prophesying retribalization, he fabricates an idealist stasis susceptible to religious exegesis and preaches a neo-Thomist morality of submission and passive acceptance. Circumscribed by his biochemical theory of extension and his theory of meaning ('the medium is the message/massage/mass age),  their radical anthropomorphism and formal subjectivism constituting the main features of his idealist ontology and epistemology, the keystone of McLuhan’s theory is the determinist fetishism of technology. Media are seen as the cause and ultimate effect of everything; human praxis and development disappear in an Eleatic pseudo-history generated by a pseudo-dialectic. McLuhan IS voluntarist reductionism, liquidating all discrepant particulars, is a double fetishism of content and form which impoverishes the rich, ever-totalizing totality of human existence, and serves to legitimate and reinforce stable forms of domination.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Theall, D.

It shows how ecosystem analysis makes possible the resolution of long standing debates unresolved by previous Stewardian cultural ecological analyses; in particular, thedebates over the aboriginality of the family hunting territory system and over the primary aboriginal subsistence base. On the basis of an extensive review of current biological knowledge on the boreal forest ecosystem an attempt is made to reconstruct the pre-contact strategy of adaptation, with particular stress on tfeast or famine' as a mechanism for maintaining human population density equilibrium. In addition, a hypothesis is proposed as a possible guide for further research on the ecosystems of hunters and gatherers: that in hunting and gathering societies the socio-cultural subsystem will respond to the variability, both spatial and temporal, of the environmental subsystem.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Salisbury, R.

The legislative vacuum left in the wake of urban sprawl cannot be filled by either the federal or provincial .governments, nor by the local governmental units since they are incapable of providing even the essential services for their citizens. The co-operation of all three levels of government is not considered an ultimate solution for the administrative problems of the city-centered region. A regional administrative body should be the legislative and executive answer to the metropolitan region where decisions are made and successively implemented. In the region of Montreal such an authority seems to be in the offing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mallory, J.

The Automotive Trade Agreement is evaluated with respect to production of automotive equipment, vehicles and parts; changes in employment levels; wages (and productivity) and the pricing policies of the automotive companies.The principal economic gain achieved by the Canadian automotive industry is shown to lie in the rationalization of production facilities which has worked to narrow prices of similar type vehicles in Canada and the United States and to increase the volume of Canadian exports.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beach, E.

The analysis covers the implications of the trademark law to consumer information, advertising and product differentiation, competitive behaviour and industry structure in the producing and the distributive trades. The author argues that trademark protection is partly responsible for strong barriers to entry of new firms into an industry. Not only does it encourage advertising and other forms of differentiation, it also serves to enforce restrictive arrangements such as exclusive distributorship, market sharing, tying, and resale price maintenance. It is also argued that through the above arrangements, trademark protection influences the structure of the distributive trades, hence their relative bargaining strength vis-a-vis the producers. The study shows further that although a trademark serves as a storehouse of information regarding a product's properties, the proliferation of trademarks may serve to confuse rather than inform the consumers. Finally, no reason has been found for associating “real" (as opposed to "fancied") differentiation with trademark protection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Handa, J.

Stylistically and psychologically# the prologues and tales fit the characters and intentions of the tellers. In contrast with the Man of Law and the Wife of Bath# the Clerk emerges as a scholar-rhetorician who follows Saint Augustine's precept to make learning and language subserve caritas and "essential truth."  Chapter One surveys critical opinion on Chaucer's rhetoric and establishes criteria of decorum and juxtaposition. The second chapter examines the Man of Law's character from his description and performance. The third and fourth chapters analyze Trivet's, Gower's# and Chaucer's treatment of the Constance story and Chaucer's rhetorical infusions for purposes of characterization. Chapters five and six discuss the Clerk's training# character# and allegorical technique. The seventh chapter assesses the Clerk's rhetorical performance and sums up Chaucer's hitherto unrecognized achievement in decorum.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hemlow, J.

Organizing the operations were Jacob Thompson of Mississippi and Clement C. Clay Jr. of Alabama, two prominent Confederates whose opposing attitudes towards war gave the Canadian campaign its complexity. The Confederate efforts were made possible by the vast discontent in the United states ., w~tt\, the war. Employing this discontent Thompson organized Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Northern prisons and, forming a coalition with anti-war anti-Lincoln forces in the United states, he attempted to disrupt the Northern war effort. Clay, on the other hand, disapproved of this policy of escalating the war. Clay was tired of bloodshed and his energy was directed primarily toward peace negotiations. Although both men failed to achieve their major objectives, the campaign exemplifies the desperate yet strategic maneuvers of the Confederacy during the last year of its struggle.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>RIggs, A.

The method of interpretation is based on a detailed analysis of the text, considering political and social background only to a limited extent.  The introduction outlines the problem and methods of the study, and gives a summary of the period's literary sources. Chapter one, based on an analysis of the speech Pro Flacco" 66-69, examines Cicero's attitude to Judaism. Chapter two is an analysis of Tacitus' Historiae, 5, 1-13. Its different sections examine the characteristics of the ethnographical excursus, the influence of conventional historiographical themes, and, finally, the discussion concentrates on particular points in Tacitus' presentation of the Jewish character. The conclusion compares the attitudes towards Jews in Cicero and Tacitus. Cicero appears as an advocate, who uses his derogatory remarks as a rhetorical device to invalidate Jewish witnesses. Tacitus' attitude is found to be biased, reflecting personal and general anti-Jewish prejudice.  The appendix discusses various opinions on Judaism in the Hellenistic world, pointing out a marked change of attitude between early and later Hellenistic writers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gordon, C.
