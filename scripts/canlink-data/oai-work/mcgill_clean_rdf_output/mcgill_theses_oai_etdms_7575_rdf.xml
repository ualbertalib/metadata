Mysticism utilizes a form of language which is quite similar to poetry. The object of our research is to identify the main similarities in poetry and mysticism in order to better clarify mystic poetry as a literary genre.  In the first chapter, we will compare poetry and mysticism, exploring similarities between. The two disciplines that will define a genre that may be labelled mystlc poetry. In the second Chapter, we will examine four French and Quebecois poets and analyse the relationship between their conception of poetry and the vocabulary of biblical theology, attempting to explain how their verses represent a research into the supernatural.  In the process, we will delineate four major tendencies of 2Oth century mystic poetry : biblical, liturgical, prophetic, monastic. The last chapter will permit us to better understand the relationship between aesthetic and mystical experiences and how poetry can be lived as a spirItual experience.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Ce mémoire porte sur l'évolution des rapports entre la poésie et la mystique au XXe siècle. La mystique utilise une forme du langage qui s'apparente à la poésie. Dans ce travail, nous voulons éclaircir les notions essentielles de l'une comme de l'autre afin de mieux situer la poésie mystique comme genre littéraire. Dans le premier chap1tre, nous établirons des comparaisons précises entre la poésie et la mystique af1n d'en faire ressortir les similitudes qui nous permettront de définir le genre que nous appellerons poésie mystique. Ainsi, le deuxième chap1tre présentera quatre poètes français et québécois dans l'œuvre desquels nous pourrons analyser comment leur conception de la poésie se rapproche du vocabulaire de théologie biblique et pourquoi leurs vers expriment une recherche du surnaturel. Nous pourrons alors délimiter quatre principales tendances de la poésie mystique au XXe siècle: biblique, liturgique, prophétique et monastique. Le troisième chap1tre permettra de mieux comprendre les rapports qui existent entre les expériences esthétiques et mystiques et comment la poésie peut être vécue comme une expérience spirituelle.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zx19s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gz876</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French poetry -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian poetry -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mysticism and poetry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r589f"><dcterms:title>Emile Zola et I'étude naturaliste des classes de lasociété.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1911</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tremblay, Joseph A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le naturalisme, école littéraire qui tient à la fois de l'art et de la science a atteint l'apogée de son succès avec Emile Zola dont la tendance instinctive fut de ce retourner vers la science, et de produire, à l'aide de sa volonté indomptable et de ses facultés puissantes, une série d'oeuvres constituant un tout.
