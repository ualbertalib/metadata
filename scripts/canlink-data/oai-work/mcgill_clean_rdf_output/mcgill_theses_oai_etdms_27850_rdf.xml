This obscurity can be partially dispersed only through detailed analyses of the few religious works of early Muslim-Turkish literature. One such work, namely the legendary biography of the pir of the Bektasi order known as the Manakib-i Haci Bektasi Veli, or simply the Vilayet-name, is here subjected to a critical analysis with the purpose of identifying the survivals of pre- Islamic Turkish beliefs within it.  After an initial effort to place the Vilayet-name into its proper historical context, an overall view of the religious life of Turkish nomads prior to their Islamization is given. This is followed by a comparative analysis of the text in the light of the information already presented, and it is demonstrated that this central work of the heterodox-antinomian Bektasi tradition of Turkish Anatolia is clearly imbedded in the pre-Islamic culture of nomadic Turkish peoples.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv123.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f779</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature -- Middle Eastern</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adr26xz90k"><dcterms:title>Development of cationic liposomes to transfer proteins between membranes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stamatatos, Leonidas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The overall goal of this thesis work has been the construction of liposomes that can be used to deliver biologically active molecules efficiently into the plasma membranes of animal cells in tissue culture.

However, the addition of circuit-independent test structures have often restricted the usage of BIST for high-performance and large-volume production circuits. Recently, several new testing schemes based on the concept of an Arithmetic BIST have been proposed, where simple arithmetic functions are used to generate test vectors and perform test response compaction. This paradigm provides an efficient BIST solution for a variety of circuits featuring basic arithmetic functionality, as there is virtually no hardware overhead and no performance degradation introduced by the scheme. In this thesis, the Arithmetic BIST scheme has been used as a platform to develop new and efficient test schemes for functional blocks in data-path architectures. Data paths generally have numerous arithmetic and logical blocks with very regular and structured implementations. Therefore, an exhaustive coverage of all states at the input of the sub-blocks, constituting a functional block, reduces significantly the test application time. Pseudo-exhaustive tests, unlike pseudo-random test techniques, deliver complete coverage for a much wider spectrum of combinational faults thereby providing a better defect coverage. Furthermore, the establishment of pseudo-exhaustive test conditions for functional blocks in data paths obviate the necessity for fault simulation, which is otherwise very expensive, specially with the "no fault dropping" option required in the BIST mode. The application of pseudo-exhaustive test necessitates an analysis of the susceptibility of various functional blocks in data paths to pseudo-exhaustive patterns. Consequently, a detailed structural examination of several commonly used functional modules in a digital signal processing environment is presented. A relationship between the subspace size that has to be exhaustively covered at the input of the functional blocks and their corresponding structural fault coverage is determined. For certain other functional modules, customized arithmetic generators have been designed to ensure 100% fault coverage. Furthermore, several testability enhancing techniques for multipliers in fixed-width data-path architectures have been presented to ameliorate the overall testability of such designs. These schemes are based on residue number arithmetic, and reuse the existing resources in the data path for their implementation. Finally, a new behavioral synthesis methodology for testable data-path architectures is proposed in the thesis. A pair of test metrics that abstracts the structural testability of data paths at the behavioral-level has been developed. Test pattern generators and output response analyzers are designated at the high-level, thereby allowing the maximum sharing of resources between the functional and test modes of circuit operation. The test metrics along with the assigned generators and compactors are subsequently, used to guide the synthesis of self-testable RT-level data-path implementations. The behavioral synthesis methodology averts adverse test related design decisions thereby avoiding additional hardware otherwise necessary to make a data path testable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rajski, Janusz (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Tyszer, Jerzy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn229.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h13q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j3333818"><dcterms:title>Industrial development in an era of structural adjustment : the growth of export informatic services in Jamaica</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mullings, Beverley.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Based on a case study of the export informatic$ sp1$ services industry, this dissertation examines the prospects for industrial development in Jamaica in the twenty first century. It contends that the island's current strategy of neo-liberal industrial restructuring will not bring about sustained development because it embodies macro-economic reforms that are incompatible with local, cultural and structural realities. Under structural adjustment, Jamaica has embarked upon policies that have been short-term in vision, un-coordinated and subject to the demands of local and global hegemonic groups. These policies have limited the expansion of this export sector and has encouraged forms of work organisation that are deeply exploitative of labour. In the case of the informatics sector, the pressure to satisfy IMF and World Bank macro-economic restructuring requirements, together with, inadequate finance and marketing support, and technical labour, has limited the potential of the sector to become a growth catalyst. Instead of becoming an industry that provides foreign exchange earnings, jobs and technical skills, informatics in Jamaica remains low in value added content, and reliant on sweated, female, low cost labour. The current organisation of work is particularly exploitative of women and their households who provide them with support. The strain that workers and their households sustain creates a vicious cycle, because as workers find ways to resist their employers demands, the industry loses its ability to compete globally. This dissertation concludes that the future of the industry will depend on the extent to which the industry is able to: provide local and foreign firms with equal opportunities to compete in global markets; develop higher value-added services and provide workers with better opportunities for personal and occupational development.

In line with the tension field approach, the axisymmetric tension field problem is studied in the context of large displacements and finite strains. General analytical solutions are obtained for the special cases of pressure and gravity loadings. The general solution for the gravity loading is original. Tension field conical and triangular finite elements (FE) are formulated for the analyses of axisymmetric and 3-D membranes. The procedures account for large displacements and finite strains. Tension field is modeled by using relaxed constitutive relationships corresponding to linear elastic and neo-Hookean material behaviours. Both axisymmetric and 3-D FE procedures are implemented in FORTRAN programs and validated by comparison with exact solutions. The solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations of the 3-D FE procedure employs a dynamic relaxation iteration with a new method for choosing the elements of the mass matrix. This results in a stable solution procedure for all wrinkling problems studied. By accounting for the flexural stiffness of the thin membrane, wrinkling is approached as a post-buckling phenomenon. This is achieved by allowing compressive stresses to develop in the membrane element, and formulating a thin triangular shell bending element with small strains, large displacements, and large rotations capabilities. Material behaviour is assumed to be linear elastic. Standard stability tests are used, and a perturbation of the solution point in the direction of the buckling mode, is adopted for the initiation of the solution iteration in the past-buckling range. The implementation in a FORTRAN program is validated against some exact solutions. Three examples of wrinkling in plates and shells demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach in obtaining the detailed configurations of the wrinkled structures and the corresponding tensile, compressive and bending stress fields.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shrivastava, S.

The depictions of illicit love and sexuality in these plays reveal problematic social and moral issues inherent in the construction of the English Renaissance ideal of love and marriage. Not only do the dramatists reveal the tension between transgressive and normative love and sexuality, but they do so through the use of aesthetic forms that transgress conventional dramatic structure. This dissertation contends that the unconventional dramatic representation of transgression functions as a cognitive mode for the audience in their understanding of the practical social reality associated with the abstract ideality of love and marriage. Focussing on a selected plays of English Renaissance dramatists William Shakespeare, Thomas Middleton, Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher, Thomas Heywood, John Ford, and two anonymous playwrights, I suggest that the dramatists refuse to condemn or condone the transgression. Rather, they endow it with meaning, and while not rescinding the ideal love and sexuality, offer possible ways of accommodating it.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Liebleim, L.

Model systems of scL-phenylalanine (aromatic amino acid), glycine and scL-alanine (aliphatic amino acids), scL-serine ($ beta$-hydroxy amino acids) and scL-methionine (sulphur containing amino acid) were investigated. Quartz tube pyrolysis of scD-glucose/amino acid or dicarbonyl/amino acid mixtures shortened the analysis time (from hours to minutes) and eliminated the need for extraction since the volatiles generated from the precursors are directly transferred into the GC column. Phenylalanine Amadori product and different model systems containing phenylalanine and different reducing sugars were studied. Ribbon pyrolysis was used to study the effect of temperature (150, 200, 250$ sp circ$C) on the efficiency of formation of initial pyrolysis products from phenylalanine and Amadori phenylalanine. Quartz tube pyrolysis was used at 250$ sp circ$C to enhance the secondary reactions. These studies revealed the formation of pyridine and naphthalene derivatives such as 3,5-diphenylpyridine, 1(2)-naphthaleneamine, N-methyl-1(2)-aminonaphthalene, 1-aminoanthracene, 2$ sp prime$-phenyl-pyrrolo (4,5-A) dihydronaphthalene, 1(2)-(N-phenethyl)napthaleneamine and 1(2)-(N-phenethyl-N-methyl)naphthaleneamine. Model studies using scD- ($ sp{13}$C) glucoses and a series of dicarbonyl compounds with labeled ($ sp{15}$N/$ sp{13}$C) glycines and ($ sp{15}$N/$ sp{13}$C) alanines identified a new chemical transformation of $ alpha$-dicarbonyls, that lead to the addition of alkyl groups from the amino acid to the $ alpha$-dicarbonyl compounds, instead of the amino group as in the case of the Strecker type interaction between the two reactants. Thus, glyoxal and pyruvaldehyde can be transformed into pyruvaldehyde and 2,3-butanedione respectively, by glycine and 2-ketobutanal and 2,3-pentanedione respectively, by scL-alanine. The labeled glycine model studies indicated that methyl substituted pyrazines and pyrazinones formed in the model systems, have a common intermediate. Two pathways of pyrazinone formation were distinguished based on the labeling experiments, one involving the reaction of three moles of glycine and the other the interaction of the dipeptide glycylglycine with an $ alpha$-dicarbonyl compound. A major product of the reaction of scD-glucose with excess glycine was detected by Py/GC/MS analysis and subsequently synthesized and isolated using focused microwave irradiation at atmospheric pressure conditions. Spectroscopic analysis by NMR, FTIR, MS and UV in conjunction with labeling studies have indicated the unknown compound to be 5-hydroxy-1,3-dimethyl-2 (1H) -quinoxalinone. The labeling studies indicated the incorporation of ten carbon atoms (six from sugar, one C-1 atom of glycine, and three C-2 atoms of glycine) and two nitrogens. scL-Serine was found to be a unique amino acid generating in the absence of sugar a variety of heterocyclic compounds. Under pyrolytic conditions scL-serine can be viewed as a potential mixture of glycine, alanine, serine, formaldehyde and dicarbonyl compounds. Model studies with scL-methionine provided evidence that methional (Strecker aldehyde) generated under Quartz tube pyrolysis undergoes secondary reactions with amino compounds generating 1,3-thiazines or 3-substituted pyridine in a similar fashion to that of scL-phenylalanine systems where 3-substituted pyridines were also identified.

Several missense mutations in the LBD cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AI), a condition in XY individuals with absent or subnormal male primary and secondary sexual characteristics. On the other hand, abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal domain of the hAR causes spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) which also affects males and causes milder forms of AI, in addition to adult-onset motor neuron degeneration and gradual wasting and weakening of the muscles of the limbs, face, throat, and tongue. However, it was not clear how and to what extent these mutations contribute to the clinical phenotype of the affected individuals. In order to investigate this matter, I used PCR site-directed mutagenesis to create plasmids expressing hARs with two pairs of missense mutations in the LBD (Val865Leu and Val865Met, and Arg839His and Arg839Cys), discovered in AI individuals with varying severity of the phenotype, and two abnormal expansions of the polyglutamine repeat discovered in SBMA patients (40 and 50 glutamines). I also synthesized plasmids expressing no glutamines (0 glutamines), 12 glutamines, or 20 glutamines in the same N-terminal region of the hAR. These plasmids were transiently expressed in heterologous cells (COS-1 and PC-3), and the mutant hARs were assayed for ligand binding, stability, and transactivational capacity. In contrast to the findings by others (McPhaul et al., 1992; Marcelli et al., 1994), in some instances involving identical mutations, I consistently observed a correlation between the biochemical phenotype of the mutant hARs and the clinical phenotype of AI individuals; that is, the more severe receptor phenotype was associated with the more severe AI. These results support the hypothesis that hAR phenotype is the dominant factor in the development of the secondary sexual characteristics in normal and affected individuals. I also observed a tight negative correlation between polyglutamine tract length and transactivational capacity. This suggests that polyglutamine modulates the activity of the hAR, and that hAR activity might be suppressed in various androgen-sensitive tissues (including motor neurons) in SBMA individuals, thereby contributing to the age of onset and/or progression of the disease, even if it cannot be the primary pathogenic agent of the disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pinsky, Leonard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b767t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r464c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex differentiation disorders.</dc:subject><dc:subject>X chromosome -- Abnormalities.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Androgens -- Receptors.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hd686"><dcterms:title>Pleistocene Laurentide Ice Sheet drainage into the Labrador Sea : sedimentary facies, depositional mechanisms, stratigraphy and significance of Heinrich events</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khodabakhsh, Saeed.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>On the basis of sedimentary structures and textures, six depositional facies have been identified in Labrador Slope, Rise and Basin cores. They include: (1) turbid-surface plume sediments (facies P; plumites) comprising 4% of the total length of the slope cores; (2) hemipelagic sediments (facies HI and H) with and without ice-rafted debris (IRD) (48% and 20% on the slope/rise and basin centre, respectively); (3) nepheloid-layer deposits (facies N; 9% on the slope); (4) contourites (facies C; 4% on the slope); (5) turbidite facies (30% on the slope and $&gt;$40% on the levees of the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel, NAMOC) with three subfacies: thin-bedded silt and mud turbidites (T); turbidites with laminae of IRD (TI), and sand turbidites (MS); and (6) debris-flow facies (10% on the slope) with four subfacies: gravelly (D1), sandy silt (D2), thin bedded (D3) and sandy gravelly debris-flow deposits (D4). Facies P occurs on high-relief slope sections, deposited by buoyantly rising meltwater plumes entrained by the south-flowing Labrador Current. The high relief was caused by retrograde canyon erosion after deposition. Facies N is best developed and thickest on the slope and upper rise. It was deposited when sediment-laden meltwater from the Laurentide Ice Sheet with high concentrations of suspended sediment spread out in mid-water or along the bottom. Facies T occurs on the levees of the NAMOC and its tributaries. It originated from the remobilization of detrital carbonate-rich sediments on the slope south of the Hudson Strait. Extensive sand turbidites occur on a braided floodplain east of NAMOC. Deposition of sand turbidites by high-density turbidity currents, probably of sheet-flow type, resulted from bedload-rich meltwater discharges on the low-relief slope sector off the Hudson Strait. They may have been caused by subglacial-lake outburst flooding, which might be linked to Heinrich events. Facies C occurs on the lower slope to upper rise. Facies H is present in all parts of the basin but most abundant on the slope; together with facies T, it is the major facies in the intercanyon regions. Facies D is found mainly on low-relief slope sectors, in front and north of major glacier outlets. Debris-flow tongues in the slope canyons merge downslope forming an extensive stacked megadebris-flow deposit on the floodplain west of NAMOC. Facies D makes up $&gt;$75% of the sediment thickness in the western floodplain cores. Four types of Heinrich layers (HL) were identified.

The method uses an electrochemical cell with two ion selective electrodes and a reference electrode. Activity coefficient data, at 298.15 K, for eight water-electrolyte-amino acid systems were measured. The cell consisted of a cation and an anion ion selective electrode, and the potential of each was measured versus a double junction reference electrode. The amino acids studied were glycine, DL-alanine, DL-valine and DL-serine and the electrolytes studied were NaCl and KCl. For the same systems, the solubilities at 298.15 K of the amino acids were measured at various electrolyte concentrations. The results show that the activity coefficients and the solubility of the amino acid in aqueous electrolyte solutions are strongly affected by the concentrations of both the electrolyte and the amino acid, the chemical structure of the amino acid and the nature of the cation of the electrolyte. The activity coefficients of amino acids in aqueous electrolyte solutions were modelled using a two-parameter excess Gibbs free energy model based on the contribution of a long range interaction term represented by the Bromley or the K-V model and a short range interaction term represented by the NRTL or the Wilson model. A model based on the perturbation of a hard sphere reference system, coupled with a mean spherical approximation model, was also developed to correlate the activity coefficient of the amino acid and the mean ionic activity coefficient of the electrolyte in water-electrolyte-amino acid systems. The model can also predict the activity coefficients of amino acids in aqueous electrolyte solutions, without adjusting any parameter, at low electrolyte concentrations and slightly deviates from the experimental data at higher electrolyte concentrations. A model was developed to correlate the solubilities of amino acids in aqueous and aqueous electrolyte solutions. The activity coefficients of amino acids in both aqueous and aqueous electrolyte solutions were represented by the perturbed mean spherical approximation model. It was shown that upon availability of independently evaluated experimental data for $ Delta h$ and $ Delta g$, the water-amino acid solubility model can accurately predict the solubility of amino acids in aqueous solutions without any adjustable parameter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Vera, Juan H.

It offers an outline of different types of theology to address the shortcomings exposed in the critique of Systematic Theology. The first two parts of the thesis are an inquiry into the meaning of an archive. This word identifies an epoch of history, but it is a spatial rather than a chronological emphasis. An archive identifies experiential conditions that limit both the potential and sense of thinking; yet, such limitations simultaneously permit sense and thinking. An archive denies and constitutes possible sense-perception. In relation to knowledge, this calls forward several sociological and historical factors. It was Foucault's uniqueness to place great emphasis on power and on the general sense of the sociology of knowledge. The focus of Part III rests on the critique of traditional Systematic Theology. In particular, this tradition has tended to presume the correctness of what Schleiermacher called the religious a priori. In this approach, the fact of existence demonstrates the necessity of a pregiven source of existence. But this attempt to transcend existence covered up several important questions related to the experience of the a priori from within the archive. Foucault demonstrates that the transcendental tradition did not sufficiently consider its sociological context or the spatial dynamics involved in its production. In response, there are different types of theological practices available. The first type (called theology A) arises from the affirmation that knowledge is a dynamic archive location. From this point of view the history of Christian thought can be approached as sets of archives in which certain types of God-sense are produced. The second type of theology (called theology B) arises from the affirmation that a critical theology is possible only when, from its location, it orients itself to non-events and non-being. Theology is accomplished critically when it undertakes to affirm itself as both a product of its archive and an orientation toward the available nothingness of its archive. The work of Michel Foucault opens to theology two different manners of approaching its history and its contemporary task.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Buckley, Philip (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td643.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vq083</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophical theology -- History -- 20th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foucault, Michel, 1926-1984.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pp400"><dcterms:title>Turtle nest sensory perception by raccoon (Procyon lotor) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) : an approach through discrimination learning of potential nest cues</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Galois, Patrick.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Egg predation may be the most important mortality factor for North American turtles. This predation can destroy 50-90% of nests in an area. The major predators are striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Despite differences in their habits and diet, these species appear equally efficient in turtle egg predation, even though these eggs represent a very small portion of their annual food intake. Sight, olfaction, touch and hearing could be used by these predators to find the nests. The aim of this study was to document intra and inter-specific differences in the perception of possible nest-cues used by raccoon and striped skunk. Choice-tests based on food-conditioning were carried out with two visual cues (dark and smooth surface), one olfactory cue (turtle urine) and one tactile cue (soil compaction). Subject performances (number of trials to obtain 80% success rate in the different tests) were compared to assess intra and inter-species, and skunk inter-age differences in sensory perception and learning abilities. As expected raccoons learned the tactile cue discrimination faster than the visual cue discriminations. The tactile cue discrimination was learned as fast as the olfactory cue. As expected skunks learned the olfactory cue discrimination faster than other cue discriminations. When compared, the olfactory cue appeared to be as important for both species even though raccoons had faster learning rates than skunks in all the tests except for one visual test. Juvenile skunks learned faster than adult skunks with four out of six juveniles performing better in the olfactory test. Olfaction may play an important role in nest localization by raccoons and skunks, and sight may also play a role for raccoons. Learning turtle nest cues while with their mother could facilitate their future ability in locating turtle nests.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bider, Roger J.

According to physicalism, all behavior is caused by brain-states; given "folk-psychology", behavior (such as the waving of my hand) is caused by some psychological state. If psychological states are distinct from brain states (event dualism), then our behavior is overdetermined and this, it is claimed, is unacceptable. I argue that this consequence is not unacceptable. I claim that our explanatory practice should guide our ontological commitment. If we can offer true explanations that appeal to more than one event (or property), then we are committed to overdetermination for the event explained. I argue that accepting overdetermination is not absurd and that we can give an adequate account of causal relevance for psychological and other supervenient properties. The result is a partial defense of both property and event pluralism.

The majority of NF2 patients develop juvenile lens opacities often presenting prior to the development of tumors usually in early teens. The NF2 gene had been identified by positional cloning. It encodes a recessive tumor suppressor protein mutated in both sporadic and familial schwannomas and meningiomas. We have isolated the mouse homologue of the NF2 gene (Nf2) from an 18-day old mouse brain cDNA library. Nf2 encodes a 596 amino acid-protein, schwannomin (alternatively merlin), with 98% identity to the human NF2 protein. By characterizing a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism within the 3$ sp prime$ untranslated region of Nf2, we have mapped the mouse gene to the proximal end of chromosome 11 at a small region of conserved synteny to human chromosome 22. These results indicate that Nf2 is highly conserved and suggest that analysis of the mouse Nf2 gene might yield insights into the human gene. Schwannomin shares homology with members of erythrocyte band 4.1 superfamily which are known to be localized in the membrane-cytoskeleton interface. The predicted secondary structure of schwannomin includes an amino-terminal domain which is highly conserved within the superfamily and is proposed to associate with plasma membrane proteins, and a carboxy-terminal domain of lower homology but hypothesized to associate with the cytoskeleton. By Northern and Western analyses, Nf2 is expressed in all tissues studied. However, analysis by RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed a widespread but cell-type specific pattern of expression. Furthermore, immunofluorescence technique showed cytoplasmic localization in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. When analysed in lens and Schwann cells, two cell types affected by the NF2 phenotype, schwannomin localized to dynamic structures such as the ruffling membrane and leading edges. Fractionation of cellular proteins revealed the presence of schwannomin in the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction as an $ sim$80 kDa protein, consistent with the hypothesis that it functions in association with cytoskeleton proteins. Moreover, schwannomin's expression pattern in the lens indicated that it plays a role in differentiation-specific events. With these observations together with information on related proteins, we propose a working model that defines the role of schwannomin as a membrane organizing protein in the leading edge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rouleau, Guy A.

CCH (carbachol), a stable Ach analog, caused a concentration and time dependent increase in the accumulation of InsPs and the mobilization of (Ca$ rm sp{2+} rbrack sb{i},$ which was inhibited by atropine, a specific muscarinic antagonist, and was negatively regulated by acute activation of protein kinase C by the phorbol ester TPA. CCH also negatively regulated the $ beta$-adrenergic-stimulated increase in cAMP levels. Using subtype m1 and m2 specific muscarinic receptor oligonucleotide primers RT-PCR confirmed the presence of, at least, these two muscarinic receptor subtypes. CCH caused a time and concentration-dependent increase in c-fos proto-oncogene mRNA levels as determined by Northern blot analysis. The CCH-stimulated c-fos increase was mediated through a non-phorbol ester sensitive PKC isozyme, and was dependent upon intra and extracellular calcium. Moreover, CCH stimulated DNA synthesis in OLPs, as measured by both ($ sp3$H) -thymidine and BrdU incorporation. Lastly, the NE-stimulated signal transduction pathway was characterized in developing OLPs. Using selective agonists and antagonists, we determined that NE increased the formation of InsPs through $ alpha sb1$ adrenoceptors. We further subclassified the $ alpha sb1$ receptor to the $ rm alpha sb{1A}$ subtype using more selective reagents; WB4101, a selective antagonist for $ rm alpha sb{1A}$ receptors blocked the response to NE, while chloroethylclonidine, an $ rm alpha sb{1B}$ antagonist had no effect. Furthermore, Pertussis toxin, a bacterial toxin that ADP-ribosylates and inactivates certain G-proteins, EGTA, a calcium chelator, or CdCl$ sb2,$ an inorganic calcium channel blocker, all significantly blocked the NE-stimulated InsP formation. Together these results suggest that OLPs express $ alpha sb1$-adrenoceptors characteristic of the $ rm alpha sb{1A}$ subtype. In toto, these studies demonstrate that developing OLs express functional muscariaic and adrenergic receptors, and suggest that Ach may function as a trophic factor. These results help to define a mechanism whereby neurons, and OLs may use neurotransmitters to communicate both during development and in the mature central nervous system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Almazan, Guillermina (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr58b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j90m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j037q"><dcterms:title>Adaptive finite element analysis of unbounded electromagnetic wave problems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Choi, Charles Tak Ming.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An adaptive finite element method is developed to solve two dimensional unbounded electromagnetic radiation and scattering problems. Though there has been considerable research in adaption in electromagnetics, to date there have been few attempts to deal with adaptively reducing the error introduced by the boundary that artificially truncates the unbounded domain in a finite element analysis. The technique proposed here adapts on this boundary error, as well as on the usual finite element discretization error. It combines three techniques: (i) p-adaptive hierarchial triangular finite elements, (ii) wave-envelope elements and (iii) absorbing boundary conditions. Hierarchial finite elements allow the polynomial orders of the elements to be used to control the distribution of degrees of freedom, and therefore they make p-adaption possible, i.e. adaption by varying the element orders. This is more efficient than h-adaption which requires an actual re-meshing of the finite elements. The wave-envelope method uses a change of dependent variable to remove the wave-like qualities of the solution and thereby permits the use of very large elements, i.e. elements much larger than a wavelength, in the external domain. An absorbing boundary condition is a boundary operator which approximately absorbs all the radiation incident on the boundary from within. In the new method, the scattering or radiating object itself, and its immediate surroundings, are meshed with hierarchial finite elements. Outside that, a thick layer of free space is meshed with hierarchial wave-envelope elements. The layer is thick enough that when an absorbing boundary condition is imposed on its outer surface, there is very small reflection from it. Such a thick layer can be meshed with relatively few wave-envelope elements. The boundary error seen by the finite element region is then a function of how well the wave-envelope region is discretized. During the p-adaption, increasing the order of the wave-envelope elements increases their ability to model the field accurately and therefore reduces the boundary error. Moreover, this reduction in boundary error is selective: in directions of strong radiation, the error reduction is greater. The new method is validated by comparison with exact solutions for a number of radiation and scattering problems over a range of frequencies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webb, J. P.

The two low carbon grades were produced such that any complication from AlN precipitation was avoided. X-ray, neutron diffraction, optical metallography and mechanical testing measurements were carried out on the samples before and after annealing. The main aim of this work was to further the understanding of the metallurgy of recrystallization after ferrite rolling at temperatures between room temperature and 700$ sp circ$C. Deformation textures, recrystallization kinetics, final grain sizes and recrystallization textures were quantified for all the samples and experimental conditions. A major conclusion based on these data is that the influence of rolling temperature is far greater in the low carbon samples than in the IF grade. Indeed, the IF results alter only marginally with increasing temperature. In the low carbon grades, however, the rolling texture sharpens, recrystallization slows, the final grain size coarsens, and the recrystallization texture changes when the rolling temperature is increased. This distinct difference between the two steel types is explained in terms of their contrasting deformation behaviors. Solute carbon and nitrogen in the low carbon grades interact with dislocations causing high stored energy levels after low temperature rolling (due to dynamic strain aging) and high strain rate sensitivities during high temperature rolling (due to the solute drag of dislocations in the transition region between DSA and DRC). Nucleation during subsequent recrystallization is strongly influenced by both the stored energy and the strain rate sensitivity. The latter affects the occurrence of the flow localisations that enhance nucleation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, John J.

We can answer by saying that a linguistic theory is applicable to an individual language-user just in case that individual tacitly-knows the theory. But this is an uninformative answer until we are told how to understand 'tacit-knowledge'. The end goal of this thesis is to defend the claim that we should take tacit-knowledge to be, simply, knowledge. Towards this end I argue against the satisfactoriness of competing ways of understanding 'tacit-knowledge'. For example, the instrumentalist position is neutral on whether linguistic theories are actually known by the ordinary language-users who tacitly-know them; instead, linguistic theories are to be such that knowing them would enable someone to do whatever it is that the tacit-knower can do. Other competing positions hold that, though tacit-knowledge is a psychological relation of some sort, it is not genuine knowledge. I also attempt to meet specific objections to the claim that a typical language-user (as opposed to a linguistic theorist) could plausibly be said to know a linguistic theory. An objection on which I focus is based on the claim that typical language-users do not possess the requisite concepts for having genuine knowledge of a linguistic theory. The aim in attempting to meet these objections is to open up the way for the linguistic theorist to exploit a paradigm of explanation: explanation of behaviour by knowledge attribution. Attributing knowledge of linguistic theories would be potentially explanatory of linguistic behaviour in exactly the same way that attributions of knowledge in non-linguistic spheres are potentially explanatory of behaviour. Finally, because my emphasis is specifically on semantic theories, I attempt to explicate and defend the claim that a semantic theory could and should have the form of a theory of truth.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pietroski, Paul (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q16w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd22x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Knowledge, Theory of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and languages -- Philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Semantics (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and logic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
