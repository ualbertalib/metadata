The program essentially follows the techniques suggested by Kondratiev and Elsasser, and is based on their "radiation tables". Atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide are fully considered, and the effects of clouds of varylog thermodynamic blackness are incorporated. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hitschfeld, W.
