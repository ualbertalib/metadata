The cells up to and including the normoblast stage have a well defined nucleus, whereas the reticulocyte contains only stainable granules believed to be ribonucleoprotein.

This altered rate of respiration, usually measured in terms of oxygen uptake, starts before symptoms of disease appear, rises gradually to a maximum as the disease develops, and declines rapidly as death is approached. These observations on abnormal rate of gas exchange indicate that the enzyme-catalysed processes resulting in oxygen absorption are accelerated in the host tissue as a result of infection. A natural question is then, what enzymes are involved in this acceleration. Among the great variety of enzymes that could possibly be involved, cytochrome oxidase can be regarded as an important one, as it functions as terminal oxidase in the phosphorylating electron transport system of the mitochondria.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pelletier, R.

This observation has been combined with calculations by ether researchers to give a three-fold relation between mean updraught speed, height of accumulation and energy of convection. Profiles for continuous rain are quite distinct from those of showers, generally showing the greatest amount of precipitation at the base of the storm. Profiles form a useful digest of the radar data for the synoptic meteorologist. The essential data can be reduced to a small array of digits, which are economically transmitted and readily interpreted to give insight into the precipitation pattern and the accompanying convection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gunn, K.

Hale, the first scientific mammalian experimental teratologist, produced a litter of 11 eyeless pigs by feeding the mother a vitamin A deficient diet (1933). At the present time most teratologist, have progressed from merely producing malformations and enumerating them, to making use of the malformations for the study of their pathogenesis and the role played by the genetic background of the mother and embryo in the production of the malformation in question.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fraser, F.

The efficiency and economy of these ten municipal filtration plants have been examined. Field surveys have been made and samples collected over a period of eleven weeks to accumulate data for interpretation. The quality of raw water and its fluctuation, particularly during the spring break-up of the rivers, is considered. The application efficiency and quantity of chemicals employed in water coagulation are investigated. The efficiency of water treatment prior to filtration is related to data of removals obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pakalnins, A.

Galsworthy wrote his best novel, The Man of Property, in an uncharacteristically rebellous mood because of the circumstances of his courtship of Ada. As he grew older and more tolerant, as he and his wife were accepted into the society against which they had rebelled, and as his position in literature became firmly established, he looked at Soames with increasing insight and compassion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lucas, A.

Si "la dérision, en général, fréquente les parvis des dieux", il n'en reste pas moins vrai que la mode de l'existentialisme "la dernière absurdité du siècle" allait jeter la confusion dans les esprits et réduire au bavardage une philosophie "dont tout le sens est de nous arracher au bavardage". En 1943, Simone de Beauvoir ne soupçonnait aucunement l’étrange fortune à venir de l'existentialisme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lariviere, H.

Similar changes have been reported by other workers investigating both gram-positive and gram-negative chloramphenicol resistant organisms. The additional observation of a simultaneous increase in resistance to other antibiotics such as penicillin implies a possible non-specific mechanism contributing to resistance linked to the relative permeabilities of the cells. Work was therefore continued with a resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium in an attempt to find out more about the mechanism of resistance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevenson, J.
