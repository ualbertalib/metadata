For diagnostic purposes, it is desirable to obtain the sounds at the source. In this thesis, an algorithm has been developed to recover the left-ventricular component of the second heart sound from externally recorded phonocardiograms. The algorithm uses a model of the heart-thorax system and is derived from deconvolution techniques developed for analogous problems in speech processing and seismology. The algorithm has been tested on data acquired from dogs. The recovered sounds are compared with the intracardiac heart sounds by using the normalized crosscorrelation sequence, the mean squared error, and the coherence function. The results show that the recovered sounds exhibit a high degree of match to the intracardiac heart sounds.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t40w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d102g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dw68d"><dcterms:title>High wire : for chamber orchestra</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McManaman, Steve</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The way I approached this analysis was to start with two general statements, one on the form and the other on the harmony.

Significant differences in digestion patterns produced by the limited proteolysis of AFP were apparent. Proteolysis under denaturing conditions was most efficient and yielded smaller peptide fragments of narrower molecular weight range. Similar findings were observed for larger scale digests using milligram amounts of AFP. Some of the cleavage products were found to possess antigenic properties of the parent AFP molecule as demonstrated by immunoblotting experiments. Attempts were made to isolate individual AFP peptides from digests of 20-40 mg of the glycoprotein. Only partial separation of the proteolytic fragments was accomplished. Experiments were performed which involved testing the immunoregulatory activity of synthetic AFP peptides on an in vitro lymphocyte reaction known to be sensitive to AFP-mediated suppression. Anti-proliferative activity was observed with one of the peptides, AFP-34/48, which represents an amino acid sequence near the N-terminus of the parent molecule.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s76n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd607</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010r329"><dcterms:title>The influence of experimental Trichinella pseudospiralis infections on the reproduction and behaviour of captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saumier, Mich√®le Dominique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reproductive success of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) infected with Trichinella pseudospiralis was significantly reduced when compared with uninfected controls. Egg laying was delayed, and infected females produced fewer eggs than uninfected controls. Infected females were more aggressive and copulated less frequently. Egg breakage among infected birds was greater than among controls. Infected females tended to lay eggs outside the nest box. Infected females did not incubate as frequently as the controls, thus accounting for the higher prevalence of embryo mortality among these birds. The above effects translated into a mean production of 2.1 hatchlings per control pair and 0.6 per infected pair of kestrel. Both in breeding and non-breeding kestrel, T. pseudospiralis infections gave rise to a general decline in mobility. Behavioural effects are primarily attributable to the presence of muscle larvae. The parasite showed no predilection for specific muscle groups.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr262.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r329</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture, Forestry and Wildlife.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Zoology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn361"><dcterms:title>Development of a computer-coupled fermentation system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leung, Wing K.

In 10 dogs we reversed the positions of the grafts (Group II). External fixation was used. The grafts were evaluated radiographically, mechanically and histologically. The vascularized grafts hypertrophied early, and were stronger than conventional grafts, particularly in Group I, where the former were stressed more. A previously unreported repair pattern was observed: vascularized grafts increased in size by peripheral apposition of new bone, there was no creeping substitution or weakening resorption. Conventional grafts remodeled by creeping repair, and hypertrophied slower, never reaching the size or the strength of the vascularized grafts.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462665n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t321j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sb37h"><dcterms:title>·π¨ƒÅhƒÅ ·∏§usayn, a study of his six books with historical content on Islam</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mohammed, Baba Gidado</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis attempts to study six of Taha Husayn's books in order to determine the factors which inspired him to write on Islam.

The characteristics of simplicity of use and of legendary reliability found in this mechanism of payment have induced the parties involved in world trade to use it as a guarantee to the execution of all kinds of legal obligations such as the full completion of construction work, financing, payment of customs duties or taxes, judicial bonds and even promises of marriage. This master's thesis specifically concerns letters of credit used as a guarantee which are called in the trade "stand-by letters of credit". The first title presents the instrument in a practical context illustrating its principles with examples. The second title examines the legal aspects as such of the stand-by letter of credit while trying to circumscribe the nature of the instrument in law. Finally, in the third title, the cases where the functions and integrity of the instrument are tested are studied thereby identifying the legal strength of stand-by letters of credit recognized by the courts of different jurisdictions. This study has enabled me to discover that this instrument is not as well suited to be a guarantee than it is to be a payment mechanism. In fact, its principles of function which are assets when used as a payment can become sources of flagrant injustice in the eyes of courts of certain jurisdictions when used as a guarantee.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d722.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx34z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics, Finance.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7d278v25n"><dcterms:title>Ego development in high school dropouts who have returned to school</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Whalen, Thomas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated the ego development of a group of dropouts who had returned to school.

These hypotheses are tested with an historical analysis of the use of polls in the political organization of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1943 to 1984.

The emergence of analytic discourse in the seventeenth century is presented through the study of changing concepts of religious, political and epistemological mediation. Browne's 'mediate' position within the conflicts of his era is seen as representing a desire to unite apparent opposites and arrive at a 'complete' way of thinking which combines the medieval and the modern. The unified vision he advocates is of interest in both modern science and literary theory, where the premise of objectivity fundamental to analytic thinking is now being questioned.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jz30z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mw42s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Browne, Thomas, Sir, 1605-1682 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kh576"><dcterms:title>Toughness and factors in graphs</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tsikopoulos, Nicholas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The author proved independently, every 2-tough graph is hamiltonian (3), that if G is a K-tough graph with n vertices and if kn is even then G has a k-factor (4) is best possible by showing that for every positive integer k and for every positive $ varepsilon$ there is a (k-$ varepsilon$)-tough graph G with no k-factor; furthermore, if k is odd then G can be made to have an even number of vertices; this result makes chapter 1 of the present thesis.

In the case of women, moral education is preponderant, but knowledge is also important. In addition to her pedagogical advice, the writer provides some thoughts on the status of women in general.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107023c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s1355</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Charri√®re, Isabelle de, 1740-1805 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m2966"><dcterms:title>Origophonie : for 2-12 voice choirs (SATB), 6 percussion and tape</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Radford, Laurie, 1958-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Abstract Not Available.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225c208.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m2966</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electronic music.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Choruses, Secular (Mixed voices) with percussion -- Scores.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892c01v"><dcterms:title>Formal languages in music theory</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Diener, Glendon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this paper, the mathematical theory of languages is used to investigate and develop computer systems for music analysis, composition, and performance.

A finite difference technique is used to formulate the coupled flow and energy solutions for arbitrary transients in pressure drop and temperature. The solution algorithms are presented in two forms: one-way dependence and two-way dependence: for the constant and variable property version of the model, respectively. Variable time step algorithms are also developed to predict the optimal time step for the finite difference solution. The first one uses a first order predictor method and the second one uses a combined first/second order predictor method. Finally, the generic model is configured to model the economizer and tubular air preheater of an existing boiler. Steady-state tests validate the numerical solution against available theoretical relations and transient tests investigate the parameters in the solution and time step algorithms to determine their effect on simulation speed and accuracy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182m37k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mw45m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tq49s"><dcterms:title>From discovery to creation : feminist literary criticism's aesthetic turn</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacKeen, Alison</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis challenges the way feminist literary criticism has been represented as a field polarized between American and French positions. As an alternative to the American/French distinction, I propose one between feminist criticism oriented to research and feminist criticism oriented to aesthetics. In keeping with this alternative distinction, I relocate the shift in feminist criticism within American feminism. The "aesthetic turn" inaugurated by American "gynocriticism" is itself identified in relation to a more general philosophical shift from discovery to creation. While the relativistic and voluntaristic tendencies which distinguish the latter pole are exemplified by French feminism, I argue that they are anticipated by American feminism's "aesthetic turn." Finally, this thesis not only relocates and redefines the shift in feminist literary criticism, but provides arguments in favour of a research-oriented feminist criticism.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf77g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq49s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feminist literary criticism -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminist literary criticism -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminist literary criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mw44b"><dcterms:title>A diagnostic study of the thermodynamic equation in rain/snow boundaries /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jarrett, Philip Lionel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A diagnostic study using the CASP (Canadian Atlantic Storm Program) dataset and available precipitation data is performed to examine the thermodynamics of melting-induced mesoscale circulations.

The horizontal and vertical advection terms were calculated using the rawinsonde data while the diabatic term due to melting was parameterized using surface precipitation observations. The effects of evaporation and dissipation were neglected in the calculation of the diabatic terms. The importance of the melting term was clearly shown although direct evidence of a melting-induced circulation was not found due to the relatively low resolution of the datasets used.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w811.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mw44b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh85h"><dcterms:title>"Il nome" : per una poetica "classica" di Cesare Pavese</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guardo Siino, Lina, 1936-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work is divided in two parts: the first part contains analysis of some writings from Feria d'agosto among which "Il nome", narration that opens the series in the book, has retained our particular attention and its analysis brings us to discover "classic" origins not yet identified by critics. "Il nome" is the key to finding out about the essence of Pavese's poetics. In the second part we approach the Croce-Pavese's affinities. The relation arises from Pavese's controversial writing on Proust. We also give an idea of reviews which reflected various tendencies of the Arts during the 20th century. We are trying to place Pavese in his "time" and we are searching out how many of those ideological aspirations are in our writer's poetics.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jp92f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh85h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pavese, Cesare -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h304x"><dcterms:title>The influence of vibratory stimulation on the nociceptive component of the lower limb flexion relfex in man /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dallaire, Michel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The nociceptive component of the flexion reflex (FR) has been observed by several investigators to be a reliable physiological manifestation of pain perception in man. It has thus been used as an index of spinal nociceptive activity to study analgesic mechanisms. Vibration is one analgesic procedure which has been reported to decrease subjective pain report in certain pain conditions. The objective of this study was thus to quantitatively investigate the behavior of the human FR during segmental peripheral conditioning with high-frequency vibration. A first study was undertaken to determine the relationship between pain sensation and the FR under the paradigm developed in this laboratory. Visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of subjective sensation were found to bear a high, linear correlation with stimulus intensity (r = 0.95) and with FR area (r = 0.91). In the main study, we found segmental vibration to inhibit the FR in 5 of 9 subjects. The modulatory effects displayed a slow onset and decay, lasting beyond the 30 min vibration period. Maximum modulation occurred late into vibration, and in some cases after vibration. The direction and magnitude of modulatory effects were basically the same in both biceps femoris (BF) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Our results raised the possibility that prolonged vibration could influence spinal nociceptive reflexes in ways similar to the vibration-induced pain relief described in the clinical literature.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts803.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h304x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bm800"><dcterms:title>Le r√©gime juridique des activit√©s industrielles et commerciales conduites dans l'espace extra-atmosph√©rique : nouvelles orientations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nordlund, Fr√©d√©ric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Current technology and the planning of ambitious programs for the next decade tend to transform the stakes inherent in space activities. In effect, the launching of space stations and platforms pave the way towards new industrial prospects previously unheard of to date. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to present an outline of these new prospects and to undertake a legal analysis motivating the transition from basic research to commercial applications. Consequently, the preliminary chapter will describe the general characteristics of those future trends towards commercial and industrial space activities. Legal provisions of Public International Space law are examined in the first chapter, notably those which are indicative of the difficulties encountered in this process. A second chapter will conduct the study of the questions regarding Registration, Jurisdiction and Choice of Law which hopefully lead to a successful regulation of Outer Space activities. The US/International Space Station project will provide an example which will underline the deficiencies and ambiguities of the applicable law. Finally, the development of a legal framework favouring the commercial viability of these future commercial production processes will be produced in the third chapter.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q518w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm800</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
