The specialist should also be concerned to submit the data record to a central facility that would supply the probabilities, evidence-based, that a recent drug use by a patient caused the adverse event. Continual and systematic accumulation of these data records at the central facility--using the same logistic and organizational framework for each of different type B events--provides for both the numerator and denominator series for etiologic research.

The myogenic response operates at $ approx$0.1-0.2 Hz and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) operates at $ approx$0.03-0.05 Hz. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) dilates pre-glomerular resistance vessels, in which autoregulation occurs, and has been reported to inhibit TGF. We tested the potential actions of ANF on TGF-mediated autoregulation using Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with isoflurane. Renal perfusion pressure (RPP) was manipulated by a servo-controlled clamp placed on the aorta between the renal arteries. Time constants for constriction and dilatation were consistent with operation of TGF. ANF did not affect either the magnitude or the time constants of the response. To test the contribution of TGF resetting to the wide dynamic range of steady state autoregulation experiments, the autoregulatory range was first defined by conventional stepwise reduction of RPP. As ANG II is necessary for TGF resetting, the experiment was repeated in the presence of Losartan, a competitive ANG Il-AT$ sb1$ receptor antagonist. The results do not support the hypothesis that TGF resetting contributes to the wide dynamic range of steady state autoregulation. In fact, the lower limit of autoregulation was extended to a lower RPP. In the Losartan experiment, this shift was not apparent, suggesting that it was ANG II-dependent.

Molecular cloning of the genomic locus corresponding to the highly conserved phosphatase domain of MPTP has permitted the comparison of intron/exon boundaries between MPTP and different members of the PTPase gene family, and made possible the targeted disruption of its gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. To elucidate the biological consequence(s) of complete disruption of the MPTP gene, an ES cell line harboring such a disruption was used to generate a mouse heterozygously targeted for MPTP. Isolation and DNA sequencing of the 5$ sp prime$ genomic region of MPTP, in addition to primer extension techniques, have permitted the determination of the transcription start site, located at position $-$215/$-$214 relative to the initiation ATG, and the functional mapping of the promoter element. Structure and function studies were also performed on the MPTP gene product using a random mutagenesis approach. Several mutants of the protein, in particular temperature sensitive (ts) mutants, were isolated and characterized for altered phosphatase activity. Together with the enzyme kinetic data, analysis of the recently determined crystallographic structure of the closely related enzyme hPTP1B revealed the structural importance of the mutated amino acid residues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tremblay, Michel L.

(Jennifer Elizabeth)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic, psychrotrophic microorganism that is ubiquitous in nature. L. monocytogenes has been isolated from numerous meat products, both fresh and processed, the incidence of contamination varying greatly. The ability of Listeria to grow in meats depends on temperature, pH, water activity (a$ sb{ rm w}$), nutrients, species and numbers of competing microorganisms, gaseous conditions, and levels of additional barriers. Therefore, methods to control the growth of L.monocytogenes are of great importance to food processors since this organism can grow under a wide range of environmental and storage conditions. Two methods of control, in conjunction with temperature, were studied in this project: (i) modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and (ii) chitosan, to determine the optimum levels of these "hurdles" needed to effectively control the outgrowth of L.monocytogenes in both model broth and agar systems and in fresh pork loin. On the basis of these preliminary studies, a combination of chitosan as a dipping solution and modified atmosphere packaging were investigated to control the growth of L.monocytogenes in fresh pork loin. Pork loin samples were dipped in a 0.2% chitosan solution for 60 seconds and packaged under various atmospheres in Cryovac bags and stored at 5, 10 and 15$ sp circ$C up to 28 days. Samples were monitored for physical, chemical and microbiological changes throughout the storage period. Optimum control over the growth of L. monocytogenes was achieved using a combination of 100%N$ sb2$ + an Ageless FX oxygen absorbent and dipping in a 0.2% chitosan solution. Based on these studies, a combination of 0.2% chitosan and MAP could be used to extend the shelf life of pork without adversely affecting color, odor and exudate loss while inhibiting the growth of the pathogenic microorganism, L.monocytogenes.

Galactolipid biosynthesis was completely dependent on an exogenous supply of UDP-galactose. UDP-galactose stimulated both total lipid biosynthesis from acetate and the proportion of radioactivity accumulated in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). The proportion of MGDG synthesized was saturated at 30$ mu$M UDP-galactose and represented approximately 30% of the total lipid radioactivity after a one hour incubation. However, total lipid biosynthesis continued to increase with concentrations of UDP-galactose up to 75$ mu$M while the proportion of radioactivity in MGDG remained at 30%. MGDG biosynthesis was always accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the amount of diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulated. Digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) synthesis was not routinely observed in these experiments. These results suggest that the in vitro pathway for MGDG synthesis in the root plastids of pea (an 18:3 plant) is similar to 16:3 plants (FFA's$ to$PA$ to$DAG$ to$MGDG). The endogenous lipids, consistent with the thought of pea as an 18:3 plant, contained 80% C$ sb{18}$ in the fatty acids of MGDG, DGDG, TG and PC. However, in labelled acetate experiments palmitate was the predominately labelled fatty acid in all lipids except PC (where 80% was 18:1). The precursors PA and DAG had ratios of 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 similar to that of MGDG. 70-80% of the label was associated with the sn-2 position of glycerolipids. The cofactors required for fatty acid synthesis were generally not as required for galactolipid synthesis. The results suggest that galactolipid synthesis relies primarily on endogenous DAG and only partly involves de novo fatty acid synthesis.

Until recently, such operations were planned manually by experts in the field using tools such as templates, protractors and calculators. An initiative from the Department of National Defence of Canada has recommended the development of a prototype computerized tool to help the experts in the planning phase of these operations. This thesis, which was carried out under PRECARN project Passport, addresses two types of algorithms that are at the core of SAR and emergency planning operations: airborne path planning for surveillance and search, and land path planning for mobility analysis and rescue route determination. The major limitation associated with these algorithms is the high computational cost incurred from the treatment of vast amounts of data representing elevation, transportation networks, vegetation and other soil characteristics. In addition, the programming complexity of these algorithms is not negligible. These issues demand the high performance computing capabilities and relative ease of programming of today's multiprocessor shared-memory computers, as well as algorithms that are scalable and highly efficient. Parallel algorithms for visibility analysis and path planning using digital terrain data are proposed. The algorithms have been implemented on a Sun symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) SPARC 20 machine and integrated with the Passport airborne path planning and land path planning software. Results of experiments are presented. Some results are compared with a previous implementation on the MasPar MP-1 and MP-2 massively parallel computers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, Gerald (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p6819.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv73t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geodesy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n13p"><dcterms:title>Dose delivery uncertainty in photon beam radiotherapy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Curtin-Savard, Arthur</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is known that slight variations in total dose delivered to the patient in external beam photon radiotherapy can significantly alter the probability of tumour control.

Several instances of apparent linkage and allelism were observed. The high probability of fortuitous co-segregation of parental bands as if linked or allelic resulting from the small number of offspring was most likely responsible. Otherwise, the kestrel fingerprints displayed germ-line stability and high levels of heterozygosity characteristic of other species. A positive linear and quasi-linear relationship was found between pedigree-based and DNA fingerprint-based relatedness coefficients. High levels of genetic variation and minimal inbreeding were detected via genetic analyses. Genetic similarity coefficients between colony-bred and free-ranging American kestrels were not significantly different (P $&gt;$ 0.5), indicating minimal genetic drift within the colony. Managed mating combined with immigration of new members into the breeding pool can maintain genetic diversity within a captive population of 200 to 300 American kestrels for a long term management scale. The captive-bred kestrel population can be fully exploited for general research, management and care techniques and as a genetic and demographic reservoir.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bird, David M.

The sulfhydryl compound, cysteamine (CSH), promotes the accumulation of identical autofluorescent, peroxidase-positive granules in primary astrocyte cultures. In the present study, we demonstrated that within 6 hours of CSH-treatment, long before cytoplasmic granulation occurs, cultured astroglia exhibit increased levels of HSP 27, HSP 90 and heme oxygenase (HO-1) protein and mRNA, relative to control (untreated) cultures. Moreover, CSH treatment elicited relatively minor increases in HO-1 mRNA and had no effect on HSP 27 and HSP 90 mRNA and protein in the glioma cells. Untreated glioma cells exhibited yellow autofluorescent cytoplasmic granules consistent with lipofuscin which was not affected by CSH exposure. Moreover, CSH treatment failed to induce the accumulation of red autofluorescent, peroxidase-positive inclusions in these cells. Taken together, these findings support the notion that the biogenesis of peroxidase-positive astrocytic granules in CSH-treated cultures and in the aging periventricular brain is dependent on an antecedent stress (heat shock) response. In further support of this contention, we demonstrated that CSH treatment up-modulates the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant MnSOD in cultured astroglia. Augmented levels of MnSOD mRNA and protein were only noted after 5 days CSH exposure. The relatively late induction of MnSOD suggests that it is not part of generalized cellular stress response. It may serve as a late cytoprotective mechanism in astrocytes against secondary superoxide injury resulting from mitochondrial damage rather than due to the direct effects of CSH.

To characterize the nascent enamel proteins, cell free translation and immunoprecipitation procedures were performed using poly(A)$ sp{+}$RNA isolated from freeze-dried segments of rat incisor enamel organs at the secretory, early maturation, and mid maturation stages of amelogenesis. Phosphoimaging revealed that the enamel organ produces enamel proteins continuously throughout enamel development albeit in decreasing number and intensity. Ten enamel proteins were translated at the secretory stage and ranged in molecular weight from 80 to 18 kDa, resembling the number (Simmer et al., 1994) and the size (DenBesten et al., 1992) of RNA transcripts recently described for murine and rat. At the early and mid maturation stages, the enamel proteins span a 27 to 68 kDa region. This selected expression of enamel proteins at each stage of development suggests that specific proteins may be important for the maturation process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Charles (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h671.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d866w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq94f"><dcterms:title>Subcellular localization and substrate specificity of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase MPTP</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boerboom, Derek</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In order to study the subcellular localization of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase MPTP, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy experiments were performed. The enzyme was thereby determined to localize almost exclusively to the nucleus. The nuclear localization signal was mapped by further immunofluorescence experiments performed with deletion mutants and $ beta$-galactosidase fusion constructs. The sequence $ rm sp{345}RKRIRED sp{351}$ was found to be capable and sufficient to localize MPTP and unrelated proteins to the nucleus, and a secondary domain was identified that is likely involved in mediating the nuclear retention of MPTP. To determine the in vivo functions of MPTP, its substrate specificity was analyzed. Dephosphorylation assays of cellular proteins identified a preferred substrate of an approximate molecular weight of 40 kiloDaltons (kDa) and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.9. This and another substrate of approximately 43kDa and a pI of 4.8 were identified in a trapping assay using a catalytically inert mutant of MPTP as an affinity reagent, and could be isolated from two independent cell lines. Taken together, these data provide significant advances towards the identification of the signal transduction pathways in which MPTP is involved.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tremblay, Michel L.

(Lise Marie)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present work is an endeavour to gain an understanding of the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimator beyond that which can be garnered from textbook consultation. To this end, I explore two aspects of the estimator which cannot be fully understood from the textbooks: the rationale for its weights, and its performance. The first one has to do with the basis for the particular choice of the estimator's weights, and the second one with the estimator's distributional properties and their assessment. The approach to each of the topics is, first, to identify and understand what is presented in the original literature; and second, critically to examine the findings in light of established principles of data analysis, to shed new light on the issues that turn out to be ill-understood. Rather striking new understandings arise. Theoretical justification for the "weights" of the cross-products cannot be found in the literature. The textbook conceptualization of the MH estimator as a weighted average of stratum-specific estimates of odds ratio (unconditional) is supported by the original literature, yet untenable. A new and tenable conceptualization of the estimator is proposed. Unrecognized in the literature, the stratum-specific cross-products involve a random aspect of the data, and the structure of the estimator is hence unjustifiable in this respect. A first order improvement is proposed and illustrated using examples. Theoretical evaluation of the estimator's performance is limited by the literature's focus on one of the asymptotic situations. Results of empirical evaluations of the estimator are in accord with textbook claims, but are still too limited. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miettinen, Olli S.

To examine the effect of ectopic expression of NF-$ kappa$B proteins on DNA binding activity and transcription control, individual NF-$ kappa$B subunit genes were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells via retrovirus mediated gene transfer. Expression of NF-$ kappa$B subunits p65, p105, p100 or c-Rel increased the basal level of nuclear NF-$ kappa$B DNA binding in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas expression of p65$ Delta$ and p52 subunits did not affect basal level activity. TNF-$ alpha$ treatment of the NF-$ kappa$B expressing cells stimulated the induced level of DNA binding activity, reflecting interaction between endogenous murine and transfected human NF-$ kappa$B proteins. Furthermore, expression of p65, c-Rel, p105, p100 and p52 subunits increased I$ kappa$B$ alpha$ protein levels from 3 to 30 fold, indicating that one mechanism to compensate for the increased expression of NF-$ kappa$B proto-oncogenes was to upregulate the synthesis and/or stability of the regulatory I$ kappa$B$ alpha$ protein. In addition, overexpression of p65, c-Rel, p100 and p52 altered the kinetics of interferon-$ beta$ mRNA induction after Sendai Virus infection, whereas overexpression of p105 decreased the IFN-$ beta$ mRNA induction. The results of this study demonstrate that overexpression of individual NF-$ kappa$B subunits differentially altered expression of at least two NF-$ kappa$B regulated genes--the cytokine IFN-$ beta$ and the regulatory I$ kappa$B$ alpha$ protein. Given the range of immunoregulatory and growth regulatory genes controlled by NF-$ kappa$B, it is likely that expression of other NF-$ kappa$B regulated genes will be modulated as a consequence of specific subunit expression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hiscott, John (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tx19f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569642f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n075w"><dcterms:title>A genetic algorithm with self-adaptive niche sizing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bernier, Lucie, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optimization of multimodal functions is hard for traditional optimization techniques.

We present an implementation of this concept using minimum spanning trees that is compared with a previous algorithm on random choices of input parameters.

In light of these new therapies we have synthesized two hormonotoxins (HTs): (i) composed of the ribosome inactivating plant protein gelonin conjugated to luteinizing hormone (LH), (ii) gelonin conjugated to human chlorionic gonadotropin (hCG), both through a disulfide bond. Characterization of both conjugates was carried out by SDS-PAGE analysis, radioimmunoassay and Western blotting (using polyclonal antibodies against both the hormone and the toxin). In addition, bioactivity of the hormonotoxins was determined by their ability to bind LH receptors in testicular membrane preparations. MA-10 cells showed a significant reduction in protein synthesis following a 24 hour exposure to the cytotoxic conjugates. In vivo studies were carried out using the LH-gelonin hormonotoxin. Intravenous injections of $ sp{125}$I-HT into 28-30 day-old pseudopregnant mice and determination of radioactivity in the ovaries, kidneys, liver, thyroid, brain, and blood helped to establish preliminary results on the uptake of hormonotoxin by these tissues. Study of the cytotoxic effects of the conjugate in vivo in normal male mice (following a three week period of injection), revealed a significant reduction in testosterone production in animals which received the highest concentrations of hormonotoxin. In addition, treatment of animals with the separate components of the conjugate (same pattern and duration of treatment), established specificity of the effect exerted by the hormonotoxin. Treatment with the LH-gelonin hormonotoxin caused production of antibodies to both components of the conjugate. Results obtained from these studies have helped to establish the groundwork for the effects of HT in vivo in normal mice. Overall, the research on these HTs had provided encouraging information for their potential use as therapeutic agents. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sairam, M. R.

To increase the applicability of WPC as well as other food proteins, it is often necessary to enhance the functional properties of the protein. Various protein modification techniques can be used for this purpose; this includes chemical, physical and enzymatic modification. In present study acid hydrolysis, a chemical modification, was investigated as a means to improve functionality of WPC, emulsifying, foaming and gelatin. Most of the previous work on WPC has been directed at enzymatic hydrolysis. Dispersions of WPC (8%) in organic acids (0.5 N, 1 N and 1.5 N acetic acid, citric acid phosphoric acid and mixture of these acids) were subjected to acid hydrolysis (6, 18 and 48 h) and the effects of this modification on functional properties was assessed. The degrees of hydrolysis were measured and freeze-dried hydrolysates were evaluated for their foam capacity and stability, emulsifying activity and stability index and toughness. Highest foam capacity was found in the hydrolysate obtained using 0.5 N acetic acid (6 h hydrolysis, foaming capacity of 140%); acid hydrolysis increased foam stability, in general. In addition, acid hydrolysis did not affect emulsifying activity index but gave higher emulsifying stability index and toughness of prepared gels. Results of PAGE indicated that acidic modification led to progressive decrease in the $ alpha$-lactalbumin and BSA. $ alpha$-lactalbumin was found to be the most sensitive protein with significant degradation after 6 h hydrolysis.

The notable feature of these beams is their thin webs. The modes of failure and their corresponding loads were predicted based on a number of previous studies. A nonlinear finite element analysis was carried out in order to provide a new assessment tool. The program used was NASTRAN. The geometrics of the castellated steel beams were predicted to be susceptible to web post buckling. The applied load which causes the formation of the mechanism failure (Redwood 1978), and the load which causes a horizontal yield failure, (Blodgett 1963), were calculated and compared to the predicted buckling load to anticipate the mode of failure. The web post buckling loads were predicted based on an analysis by Blodgett (1963), Aglan and Redwood (1974) and on the finite element analysis. The above analyses were repeated for five of the seven beams tested by Bazile and Texier (1968) and which failed by web post buckling. The beams tested were susceptible to web post buckling, as predicted. The web post buckling analysis suggested by Blodgett (1963) resulted in large variations from the experimental failure load. The analysis suggested by Aglan and Redwood (1974) yielded conservative results. The finite element buckling analysis showed a good correspondence with the experimental buckling load and may be a good tool to conduct a more complete parametric study.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd89t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bn785</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42n993j"><dcterms:title>Stress compatible bimaterial interface elements with application to transient dynamic stress analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yi, Jun, 1959-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Conventional displacement-based finite element programs do not yield unique values of stress components which ought to be continuous at element interfaces.

The constructed finite elements programs, suitable for analyzing two-dimensional and axisymmetric three-dimensional problems, have been validated by comparing the predicted responses with the exact analytical solutions of some non-trivial impact loading (wave-propagation) problems.

A pseudo steady state kinetic model describing the dependence of activity on peroxide concentration was derived and apparent kinetic constants describing the oxidation of SBP by hydrogen peroxide and the reduction of SBP by phenol were determined. SBP incubated at 25$ sp circ$C was relatively stable in neutral and alkaline buffer but was inactivated in acidic buffer. SBP incubated at elevated temperatures experienced 1st order thermal inactivation that depended on incubation temperature and pH. At 25$ sp circ$C in pH 7.4 buffer, SBP incubated with hydrogen peroxide demonstrated biphasic suicide inactivation whose rate depended on the initial peroxide concentration. SBP catalyzed removal of seven phenolic compounds from aqueous solution depended on enzyme dose, reaction pH and buffer species, the phenolic compound, and the measurement technique used to quantify removals. While the observed ability of SBP to catalyze phenolic compound removal was less efficient than the reported ability of HRP, the industrial grade cost of SBP is sufficiently less than the cost of HRP that SBP can be considered an attractive alternative to HRP in the treatment of wastewaters containing phenolic compounds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicell, James A.
