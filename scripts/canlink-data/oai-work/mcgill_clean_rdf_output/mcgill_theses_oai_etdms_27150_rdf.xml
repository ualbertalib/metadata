To begin with, after six decades of stringent regulation and control, the State finally realized that international trends and domestic needs dictated a drastic reduction in the role it played in the economic affairs of its airlines. Airline deregulation thus became a reality in Canada and as such, a detailed review of the process leading to the adoption of the National Transportation Act, 1987, as well as an extensive legal analysis of the legislation itself are warranted. The second major development was the extremely rapid process of consolidation, precipitated mainly by deregulation, into an industry dominated by two airlines; a duopoly. The implications arising from this situation for present and future competition in the Canadian air transport industry, as viewed from a market contestability perspective, need to be assessed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r054.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z44b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics, Commerce-Business.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074w32x"><dcterms:title>Improving long-fibre compounding via a novel thermoplastic pultrusion process</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bates, Philip J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A pultrusion process using staggered cylindrical pins in a molten polymer reservoir is one method of pre-compounding long glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastic materials. This material, if well impregnated with resin, will maintain much of its aspect ratio during subsequent moulding. The longer fiber length translates into improved mechanical properties versus conventional extrusion compounded material. This research studies the effect of a novel pin shape and configuration on the wetting of glass roving during thermoplastic pultrusion compounding. Experimental pultrusion studies using polypropylene indicate that alternating concave (collecting) and convex (spreading) contoured pins promote superior resin impregnation compared to conventional cylindrically shaped pins. A mathematical model describes the necessary convex pin contour and was used to fabricate the convex pins employed in the research. Pins thus designed promote uniform filament spreading across the wide convex contour which in turn favours good resin impregnation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n9180.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w32x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plastics Technology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jc61n"><dcterms:title>What's wrong with the concept of "very low birthweight"? : heterogeneity and confounding in epidemiologic studies of very small or immature neonates</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Arnold, Cody</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We divided 640 consecutively live-born newborns into two overlapping groups: a traditional very low birthweight (BW) cohort (500-1500 g, mean BW 1055 g) and a gestational age (GA) cohort (23-30 weeks, mean BW 1070 g).

Mg doped samples showed strong Mg concentration gradients, with substantial diffusion into the substrate. An electrical transport model has been developed for each of the previous cases. These models provided excellent agreement with experiment. The uniformly Zn-doped samples have been used for a detailed study of hopping conduction. Excellent quantitative agreement can be reached between theory and experiment both in the variable range hopping regime and in the nearest neighbor hopping regime.

As host density increased (1-6 mice/cage), but exposure dose held constant (8000L$ sb3$), the mean number of L$ sb4$ recovered per mouse decreased at a faster rate than expected assuming a constant per capita rate of transmission. In an attempt to interpret the experimental data, mathematical models were generated. Although the inclusion of a death rate of infective larvae dependent on mouse density did improve the fit of the mathematical model based on a constant per capita rate of transmission, the best fit was provided by a model assuming a per capita rate of transmission dependent on mouse density.

For optimum soil management, however, we must be able to evaluate adequately soil structural damages. This study compares different methods of assessing soil structure as affected by compaction and subsoiling treatments in a clay soil under corn production. The tests used were: total porosity as calculated from densimeter readings and from soil cores; structural porosity; water desorption characteristics; and soil profile examination. These tests were performed in three layers of 20 cm and evaluation was based on their practicality and their ability to differentiate between treatments and to correlate with corn yield. The results confirm that total porosity is a poor indicator of compaction in the subsoil. In soil profile assessments, ped descriptions were preferable to examination of pores. Water content and saturation deficit at $-$4.0 and $-$100 kPa were the best indicators of treatments and plant response.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn60v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf49w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Clay soils.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil structure.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil porosity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Soils.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jm63t"><dcterms:title>Structure and contribution of extreme events in airbourne carbon dioxide and water vapour flux traces</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duncan, Michael Ross</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Conditional sampling techniques were used to analyze airbourne carbon dioxide and water vapour flux traces recorded during the FIFE experiment.

Department chairs spend 22 hours each week performing their different administrative roles but would like to increase the time to 25,4 hours per week in order to do a better job. Women chairs spend 23 hours and would like to spend more time working on the administrative roles of department chair than their male counterparts. This is also true of the professional sector in relation to the general sector. The importance attached to the different administrative roles and the perception of these roles vary depending on whether the chair is a man or a woman, in the general or professional sector. Department chairs have intrapersonal role conflicts. They are caught between what they do and what they would like to do to make their department function well.

The house is usually depicted as a prison and a tomb, and only sometimes as a shelter. Products of a stagnant society whose laws they wish to perpetuate, parents give their children a loveless upbringing, in a house from which nature and the external world are rigorously excluded. A few of these captives think that happiness is to be found in marriage, but the conjugal home and that in which adultery occurs prove scarcely more welcoming. Some houses can even be dangerous. The house almost always appears as a forerunner of the tomb, inhabited by individuals unwilling to outgrow childhood, by the living dead, by the living who await death. Certain of Hebert's characters, however, revolt against this fate and flee the closed house. In order to be free, the Hebertian hero must exorcise the past and dissolve the obsessive image of the closed house. The rare open habitations of Hebert's universe are shelters to be found along the individual's road to liberation and life. Most are located near the sea or in the countryside, in a magnificent natural setting evocative of Paradise lost.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806101x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq90g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hébert, Anne -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g866h"><dcterms:title>Orientation and survival of hatchlings and reproductive ecology of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) in southern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Robinson, Candace</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The orientation and survival of neonate snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) were studied in 1986 and 1987.

Eighty-two percent of hatchlings from nests within 18 m of the shoreline were successful in reaching water.

Six rainfall events which occurred in 1986 and 1987 over an 8.13 km$ sp2$ agricultural watershed in south-western Quebec were used in model simulations. Radar measured rainfall rates were calibrated using measurements from a single tipping-bucket raingauge located at the study site. A deterministic, event-based model, HYMO, was used to simulate streamflow using radar and gauge measured rainfall. The model utilized two rainfall abstraction techniques, i.e. the SCS Curve Number method and the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. Simulated streamflow hydrographs were compared with observed storm flows. For short duration, high intensity, simple rainfall events, there were minor improvements in hydrograph simulations when calibrated radar measured rainfalls were input to the model, compared to tipping-bucket raingauge measurements. Complex, low intensity storms were poorly simulated by the model using either rainfall data source. Neither rainfall abstraction method proved consistently superior.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n724.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj30m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rainfall frequencies -- Québec (Province) -- Saint Dominique.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Runoff -- Québec (Province) -- Saint Dominique.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrologic models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radar in hydrology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930bz418"><dcterms:title>Variations in snow quality in the Montreal region</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Smith, Janet</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m18v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bz418</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Snow -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acid precipitation (Meteorology) -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x0163"><dcterms:title>Ventilatory effects of airflow through the upper airways of newborn kittens and puppies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Shway, Saad F.</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gm04h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x0163</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm88x"><dcterms:title>Behaviour and migration of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Ascaris suum in the tissues of the rat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ma, Kathleen Y.H.</ual:dissertant><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d74m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm88x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z202g"><dcterms:title>Endobronchial lymphoscintigraphy : a new method of mapping intrathoracic lymph nodes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bethune, Drew C.
