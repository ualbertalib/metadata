To prevent biofilm formation, it is important to study the initial stages of bacterial adhesion. The aim of this study was to compare the initial interactions of the uropathogen Enterococcus faecalis with different medical grade polymers. To accomplish this, kinetics of E. faecalis adhesion were followed using a DNA quantification assay. The influence of biomaterial surface properties, including surface wettability and roughness, was investigated. Moreover, the distribution and morphology of the adhered bacteria were studied. Finally, quantification of bacterial adhesion forces was achieved using AFM through cell detachment measurements. The results showed significant differences in E. faecalis adhesion between the studied polymers suggesting that precautions should be made for the choice of polymers in the design of medical applications in order to prevent subsequent biofilm formation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tabrizian, Maryam (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq16g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x157</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plastics Technology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vt97s"><dcterms:title>Dynamic penetration of metalfiber laminates</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Wei, 1970 May 26-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Laminates composed of alternating layers of metal and fiber  reinforced polymers (FRP's) exhibit a number of properties, which are preferable to  either metals or FRP's alone, making them attractive materials for a number of  industries, particularly aerospace. A number of questions persist, however, before  these new composites can be widely accepted and utilized; one of which is their  response to impact, which may occur over a wide range of velocities. Numerical  methods, especially the FEA method, have been widely used to simulate the impact  response because they can reduce the cost and save time comparing with the  experiment. In this work, a continuum damage based model (CDM) is developed and  implemented into FEA commercial software ABAQUS. Using a rate-dependent plasticity  model for the constitutive behavior of Aluminum and the CDM for the behavior of  fiberglass laminates, the dynamic penetration is simulated using ABAQUS. Force vs.  displacement results compare well with those obtained from the experiments. In  addition, the computed damage region is in close agreement with that seen in  sectioned specimens of the tested material. Simulations are also performed for  ballistic experiments conducted on 150mm x 150mm clamped panels of the same  laminates. Ballistic experiments involve both the local penetration response as well  as the global deformation behavior, particularly at velocities near the ballistic  limit, where significant flexural deformation takes place. Results from the  simulation agree well with the ballistic experiment results. Given the validity of  the modeling approach, the high velocity impact response of the other metal/fiber  systems can be examined minimizing the need for trial and error  fabrication.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemes, James A.

In the overall  research program, a total of eight deep beams were tested. A companion study by Li  (2003) presents the results of four of these beams. This research examines the other  four beams, two without uniformly distributed crack control reinforcement and two  with distributed horizontal and vertical reinforcement. The specimens' dimensions  were 2000 mm long and 400 mm thick, with two specimens having heights of 1160 mm and  the other two heights of 1840 mm. The specimens were loaded with a central loading  plate 300 mm long and 400 mm wide. The end bearing plates were 250 mm long and 400  mm wide. All specimens contained seven 15M bars forming the main tension tie  reinforcement. The test results provided information on the influence of the  uniformly distributed reinforcement and the crack and strain development up to  failure. The ductility of the specimens containing only the main tension ties was  limited due to the formation of splitting cracks along the anchorages of the main  tension ties during the later stages of testing. The uniformly distributed  reinforcement provided additional tension ties that increased the capacity and the  ductility. Strut-and-tie models were developed to predict the capacities. The FIP  Recommendations (FIP 1996) were used to determine the contributions of the two major  mechanisms, direct strut action and indirect strut action. This approach gave very  conservative strength predictions. More refined strut-and-tie models were developed  for the specimens with uniformly distributed reinforcement. These refined models  gave more accurate predictions of the capacities of the deep beams.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Denis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr886.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z5905</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asx61dm94g"><dcterms:title>An experimental investigation of flow over an oscillating airfoil /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gerontakos, Panayiote</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The detailed behaviour of the unsteady boundary layer and stall  events occurred on a sinusoidally oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil at Re = 1.35 x 105  was investigated experimentally by using closely-spaced multiple hot-film sensor  arrays. The hot-film measurements were supplemented by surface pressure  measurements, hot-wire wake velocity surveys and smoke-flow visualizations. Three  typical oscillation parameters: attached flow, light stall, and deep stall were  tested. Special attention was focused on the non-intrusive identification of the  spatial-temporal progression of the locations of the boundary-layer transition and  separation and reattachment points for a range of oscillation frequencies and  amplitudes both prior to, during, and post the stall. The results show that for an  unsteady airfoil, the reduced frequency of the oscillation was found to be highly  significant and only small values of reduced frequency were required to delay the  onset of the various boundary-layer events, and to produce significant variations  and hysteresis in the peak values of lift and drag forces and the pitching moments,  which are fundamentally different from their static counterparts. Lift stall was  observed to occur when the leading-edge vortex reached 90% of the chord, while  moment stall occurred at the end of the upward spread of the trailing-edge flow  reversal. The convection speed of the leading-edge and the secondary vortices were  also reported. Dynamic stall was found to be caused by an abrupt turbulent  separation near the leading-edge region and not with the bursting of the laminar  separation bubble, as is commonly observed for a static NACA 0012 airfoil; the  result being the initiation, growth and convection of an energetic leading-edge  vortex. Moreover, the detection of the sudden turbulent breakdown could serve as an  indicator for dynamic stall detection and control.

This research will provide a brief overview of alkali-aggregate  reactions in concrete, the causes of the problem and its symptoms in existing  concrete structures. The goal of this study is to assess the role of the steel  reinforcement on the response of AAR-affected concrete; the paper will also review  how the reaction affects the mechanical properties of concrete. Expansion and  compression tests as well as Poisson's elastic modulus are being studied. The  results show that reinforcement has a significant effect in decreasing the expansive  effect of the AAR. Some preventive measures are reviewed, focusing on the  minimization of AAR with the use of quality aggregate, portland cement, and mineral  and chemical admixtures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mirza, M.

To be competitive in a crowded  market, implementation of the different systems of an optical transceiver on a  single chip has become mandatory. CMOS technologies, especially state-of-the-art processes like  the 0.18mum CMOS, permit integration of huge amounts of transistors per millimeter  square. Furthermore, deep-submicron CMOS processes have similar RF performances to  their traditional bipolar equivalent. It is therefore a small footstep to go to  congregate high-speed analog circuits with digital cores on a single  die. This thesis addresses two of the building blocks found in an  optical communication receiver, namely the analog front-end receiver and a digital  frequency-acquisition based clock-and-data recovery circuit. The latter reduces the  headcount of bulky passive components needed in the implementation of the loop  filter by porting the analog loop to the digital domain. This circuit has been  successfully fabricated and tested. Finally, an optical front-end, comprising a transimpedance  amplifier and a limiting amplifier is proposed and fabricated using a standard  0.18mum CMOS process. The speed of this circuit has been pushed up to 5Gb/s.  Different techniques have been employed to increase the effective bandwidth of the  input amplifier, namely the use of a constant-k filter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>El-Gamal, Mourad N.

While the crime novel is generally considered trivial entertainment for  mass audiences within the realm of German literature, the case is somewhat different  in Switzerland, a country with a small state mentality. The forthcoming analysis  will demonstrate how these authors employ the crime novel as an educational device  to convey a very important message to their fellow countrymen about the society in  which they live. In their portrayal of Switzerland, the authors cover a wide range  of circumstances relevant to their respective time periods, often dealing with  controversial issues. Consequently, the Swiss detective plays a major role, as he  must often solve difficult cases while faced with tremendous pressure from society.  By focusing exclusively on Switzerland, this analysis will ultimately prove that the  modern Swiss crime novel contains not only an entertainment aspect, but also  important political, sociological and historical elements that distinguish the  phenomenon from its international counterparts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schmidt, Josef (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k50d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579s815</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Switzerland -- In literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Detectives in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Detective and mystery stories, German -- Switzerland</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x199s"><dcterms:title>La mentira como componente identitario en La verdad sospechosa de Juan Ruiz de Alarcón /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>spa</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Hispanic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Robalino, Gladys</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work focuses on the topic of identity and, particularly, on  the study of lies as a component of identity through the analysis of the main  character in the comedy La verdad sospechosa , and the Court represented in the  play. The text has been divided into two sections: the text's reality and the  stories invented by the main character. This distinction serves to establish the  relation between the elements of both parts, as well as their consequent influence  in the construction of the character's identity. Conditions such as space, time and,  particularly, social surrounding are taken into account in the fabrication of lies.  The work shows how lying serves as a tool to create, sometimes fictitious but  nevertheless useful, routes that help achieve an immersion in the society, even if  it seems to go completely against the social values that, on the other hand, helps  attain. Through the deconstruction of the character's lies, this work shows how,  gradually, the made-up stories assimilate with the reality of the text until they  become one with it. This gradual assimilation goes hand in hand with the character's  immersion into the community, which includes the learning of social values and the  fulfillment of the community's expectations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Magallon, Jesus (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xx88b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x199s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Truthfulness and falsehood in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ruiz de Alarcón, Juan, 1580?-1639.

As a result, this is one of  the first detailed zooarchaeological analyses performed on Thule archaeofaunas from  the Ungava region. Because of the poor preservation that characterized the  assemblage, a taphonomic study was undertaken in order to determine the  "representativeness" of the faunal remains. Food utility indices are  compared to bone density indices, in order to establish the effects of  density-mediated attrition upon the faunal remains. A moderate correlation was found between bone density and the  identified animal bones. This indicated that, while density-mediated attrition had  altered the zooarchaeological assemblage, bone density alone did not provide a  sufficient explanation for the observed element distributions. Other taphonomic  agents, such as those related to the degree of butchering and the potential effects  of cryoturbation upon remains, also need to be taken into  consideration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Savelle, James (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65v853m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d0320</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Thule culture -- Québec (Province) -- Nunavik.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nunavik (Québec) -- Antiquities</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s684"><dcterms:title>The green ears of Xanthicus : calendrical interpretations of Exodus 12:1-2 in Jewish and Sectarian sources from the biblical through medieval periods</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lobel, Andrea Dawn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This historical survey traces the interpretation of Exodus  12:1--2, the Bible's first calendrical commandment, through Jewish and sectarian  writings from the biblical verses themselves through the medieval era.

Metaphor, a form of figurative language has the potential to  clarify or increase the understanding of an unknown or unfamiliar concept. The  metaphoric process accomplishes this through "comparative mapping," where  the unknown is understood via an interaction with a known concept in a familiar  domain. This can be extrapolated to include understanding a philosophy despite a  lack of direct experience, rendering the previously unknown philosophy a known  phenomenon. This thesis promotes the use of metaphor and subsequent  metaphoric process for improvement in education by bridging the gap between  educational philosophy/theory and educational practice.

The goals motivating this inquiry were  (1) to understand the process through which the transition from student teacher to  teacher occurred, and (2) to understand what influence the people surrounding the  student teachers, such as the cooperating teacher and the supervisor, had on the  process. The analysis closely follows Wenger's (1998) work in Communities of  Practice and Schon's (1983, 1987) work in Reflective Practice. The data consists of  audio-taped de-briefing sessions attended by the student teachers and the  cooperating teacher, the cooperating teacher's Reflective Log, and a student  teacher's journal.

Also important is the "close accompaniment" of student  teachers by the cooperating teacher in order to enact the reflective dialogue by  which student teachers learn to become teachers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh60w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676w19j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Student teachers</dc:subject><dc:subject>English teachers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nh69m"><dcterms:title>Surface tension : Kuki Shūzō's iki as a posture of resignation and resistance</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Curley, Melissa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Kuki Shuzo was a philosopher at the margins of the Kyoto School;  his most significant contribution was the short work 'Iki' no kozo, in which he  located Japanese uniqueness in the Edo demimonde aesthetic of iki, style or chic.  This thesis surveys the major Western critiques of Kuki's aesthetics, focussing  particularly on the work done by Peter Dale, Leslie Pincus, and Harry Harootunian  revealing Kuki's borrowing from European modernism, especially fascist modernism,  and attempts to uncover an alternative genealogy for Kuki in Japanese Pure Land  thought.

More specifically, it examines how their views have been influenced by New  Age thought in general and Transcendental Meditation in particular and how these  perceptions reflect the changing relation of religion and Ayurvedic medicine. It is  the intent of this thesis to show that Ayurveda in Canada exists mainly as part of  the greater New Age movement, as a transformed system that is inspired by both  Hinduism and New Age thought, and that this transformation of Ayurveda evokes two  distinct responses from Indian diaspora medical personnel in Canada---one  unsupportive and one partially supportive. To the dismay of "traditional"  Indians and to the praise of "modern" Indians, New Age Ayurvedic  organizations strongly emphasize their version of "spirituality" as the  primary goal of Ayurveda, whereas Indian forms of Ayurveda---both in the past and  today---generally approach religion and spirituality secondarily. Thus, the role of  religion and spirituality become major controversial issues in New Age Ayurveda.  From the "traditional" point of view, the commercial achievements of New  Age organizations (such as the Transcendental Meditation Movement) are not  indicative of a successful introduction of Ayurveda in North America and run  contrary to classical Ayurvedic principles, with regard to religious and medical  practice. But, from the "modern" point of view, the New Age Ayurvedic  emphasis on spirituality is indicative of an inevitable evolution of the system in  North America.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Katherine K.

Through autoethnography, I connect my  personal experiences to my culture, and construct a sense of 'home' by writing from  both sides of a border: Armenian and Canadian. Autobiographical approaches make use  of the self to construct meanings that illuminate larger themes and bear  implications for wider audiences (Cole &amp; Knowles, 2000; Kamanos-Gamelin, 2001;  Mitchell &amp; Weber, 1999; O'Reilly-Scanlon, 2000). Thus, as I describe the  outcomes of my experiences of literacy and identity, I consider the need for  critical pedagogy in order to create or 'write' home. This self-study is based on my realities and the ways in which I  understand those realities. Moreover, it follows a phenomenological aim to  "uncover and describe the structures, the internal meaning structures, of lived  experience" (van Manen, 1997, p. 10). However, the value of finding meanings in  the past lies in the possibilities to construct the future. Shirinian (2000) points  out that "in the diaspora, meaning has been displaced but not replaced, and one  of the principal problems the very concept of Armenian diaspora culture seeks to  understand is the relationship between the experience of cultural displacement and  the construction of cultural identity" (p. 5). By writing about my home from  both sides of a border, I hope to bridge this gap and offer new meanings and  perceptions in understanding the Armenian-Canadian experience.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beer, Ann (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236263w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q66x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literacy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Armenians -- Ethnic identity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Armenian Canadians</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hv921"><dcterms:title>Schooling the imagination : an experiment in arts-based education</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Menon, Nimi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This classroom-based interpretive inquiry investigates how the  teaching strategies used in a grade-three classroom in a small, private, arts-based  primary school implement the arts mission of the school. Further, it explores the  relationship between art subjects [music, visual arts, theater, and dance] taught in  art ateliers and academic subjects taught in the classroom. The art teachers'  practices and the classroom teacher's practices are conceptualized within a  Vygotskian socio-cultural framework. Further theoretical background is provided by  the literature from art-based curriculum studies, developmental psychology,  philosophy of education, and theories of qualitative research. This inquiry  challenges the traditional view of arts reflected in most North American classroom  practices. The chief research participants were the classroom teacher, the arts  teachers, the school's founder, and the school's Principal. The children in the  school also participated in focus groups. Data collected and analyzed include 40  hours of classroom-based observations in one class over a three-month period, 12  hours of interviews with the research participants over 16 months, and documents  such as course handouts and small brochures describing the school's mission.  Findings indicate that the arts instructors and classroom teacher collaborate  closely to develop the yearly "theme unificateur" or unifying theme.  Attitudes and strategies revealed in the study fit the constructivist model of  classroom instruction. Despite growing pains experienced by the school's current  expansion, findings suggest that the arts instructors and the classroom instructor  are not only filling the academic mission of the school, but are also (a) creating  strong relationships with their students, (b) promoting self-esteem and emotional  intelligence, and (c) creating artistic and cultural literacy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Butler-Kisber, Lynn (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm00j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hv921</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arts -- Study and teaching (Elementary)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j1573"><dcterms:title>Edition critique du Livre de vieillesse de Laurent de Premierfait (1405)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marzano, Stefania</ual:dissertant><ual:dissertant>Cicero, Marcus Tullius</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Livre de vieillesse pertains to the field of study concerning late medieval Humanism, where the first royal patronage of translations from ancient Latin texts proved to be of enormous consequence for the French language, and especially for the formation of its vocabulary.

The thesis first examines the  roots of nationalist historiography in the West and in Ottoman Empire, and then  paraphrases the proceedings of the congress in detail. It arrives at the view that  during the formation of a nation state in alignment with European standards, Turkish  nationalists within the Ottoman Empire often found it necessary to review the  methodology and the content of history books. The break with Ottoman historiography  was a result of the uniform Western approach to the past, promoted by Western  schools of thought. Thus, to become a nationalist meant to re-write history in  Western fashion. Available sources on the First Turkish History Congress and the  role of religion and language for the Turkish nationalist endeavors are referred  throughout the thesis. In its conclusion, this study raises questions about the  close relationship between nationalism and historiography, and the influence of  nationalism on our view of history today.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, Uner (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bm27g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d98m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nationalism -- Turkey</dc:subject><dc:subject>Historiography -- Turkey</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turkey -- Intellectual life -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752h32v"><dcterms:title>The Tijāniyya order in Tamale, Ghana : its foundation, organization and role</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ibrahim, Mohammad Saani</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis explores the historical background, activities and  organization of the Tijaniyya ṣufi order in the Tamale District of  Ghana. After a survey of the history of Islam's penetration of sub-Saharan Africa,  and the role of ṣufi orders in this process generally, the thesis  looks at the founder of the Tijaniyya, Aḥmad al-Tijani (d. 1815 A.D.),  his beliefs and the spread of these beliefs in the Dagbon area and, ultimately, the  Tamale District. This is followed by an overview of the order's salient doctrines,  and especially those teachings that are more or less unique to the Tamale region and  that have awakened the ire of local Wahhabiyya members (Munchires). A look at the  Tijaniyya local organizations and institutions comes next, which forms a backdrop to  the discussion of the cross-section of the conflicts that have ensued between the  order and its opponents in the Wahhabiyya movement. It will be seen that the  Tijaniyya has had a considerable impact on the social fabric of the region,  especially in terms of its ability to maintain the integrity of this fabric and its  efforts at promoting non-violence between religious groups in the area. Our analysis  concludes with a look at the series of reconciliation efforts made to find a lasting  solution to the conflicts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, A. U.

Fifty-one students between the ages of 14 and  18, who were seeking counselling in their schools, were recruited through two school  boards in a large eastern Canadian city. The results provided empirical support for  a relationship between adolescents' readiness for change and the quality of their  working alliance. In comparison to students who were resistant to change, those who  were ready to actively change were more likely to develop positive alliances with  their counsellors, and were in more agreement with their counsellors on the goals  and tasks of counselling.

Independent labels were the primary producers of rap  records until they made distribution deals with major record companies in the second  half of the eighties. I argue that the division of labor between production and  distribution, which became the most common context for the production of the music,  is both the result of an organizational strategy initiated by the majors and of the  negative perception their executives had of rap artists.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamilton, Sheryl (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r157m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wn52t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rap (Music) -- Economic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rap (Music) -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f883k"><dcterms:title>Les maîtres de Jean Ethier-Blais /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Luc-Charles</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The specific characteristic of Jean Ethier-Blais' works is the  continuity of a French Canadian tradition against the spirit of rupture that  prevailed during the Quiet Revolution.

This thesis is a  textual analysis that seeks both to challenge and complement the existing literary  criticism that has focused on construction of the female protagonists and the theme  of heroism and culpability. Raquel and La hermosa Ester demonstrate the centrality  of their female protagonists in the socio-political macrostructures of the  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through their ability to influence the  functioning of a monarchy and its reigns of power. The predominant theme that is explored is the ascension and  descension to and from power as seen through the movement of the female protagonists  within or beyond their social spheres. Other recurrent themes that are examined are  the sin of pride, the virtue of humility, the vital interdependence between the  monarch and nobility, the displacement of culpability and the fundamental role of  the male characters. Raquel and Ester, united in their tri-fold social  marginalization as Jewish, lower class females, are juxtaposed with the dominance of  a deeply rooted patriarchal, aristocratic and pagan society. While La hermosa Ester  offers the possibility of ethnic, religious and political coexistence on the throne,  Raquel does not achieve this ideal. However, Raquel's commanding presence is able to  unveil the chaos that lies beneath the monarchical order. The final objective of this thesis is to embrace the portraiture  presented of two women who are catapulted into political realms, polarized in love,  servitude, sacrifice and salvation, but who are uniquely bound by heroism, marked in  a bleeding lover or blessed in the hymn of a nation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Magallon, Jesus (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p777b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j82b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vega, Lope de, 1562-1635.
