Before examining the activities of this group in Parliament, it is necessary to consider, first, the problem caused by the retreat of Turkey from Europe and to examine, brietly, the factors which made up that problem. As soon as there appeared to be the slightest possibility of forcing the Turk out of Macedonia, three countries began to lay claims to that Turkish province.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fieldhouse, N.

Further variations in composition were associated with such factors as the age of the tree, the height at which the bark sample was taken and the season of cutting. All attempts at elucidating the nature of the various bark components depended on the separation achieved by extraction with a variety of organic or aqueous solvents.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.
