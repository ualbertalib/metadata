This formalism--a way of dividing a method of solution into a Krylov process and an associated subproblem--is described and then applied to several of the more popular algorithms in use today including the methods of Conjugate Gradients and BiConjugate Gradients. The aim is to clarify these algorithms to make them easier to understand, analyze and use. Several of the methods presented in this thesis were developed in exactly this way--notably the Symmetric LQ method and the Generalized Minimum Residual method--and required little or no effort to characterize using the formalism. It was successfully applied to Conjugate Gradients and BiConjugate Gradients, already recognized as being closely related to the symmetric and unsymmetric Lanczos processes respectively. The newer algorithms such as Conjugate Gradients Squared and BiConjugate Gradients Stabilized, with less obvious relation to a specific Krylov process, provided more difficulty in their clarification.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paige, Chris (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526f30h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b813q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj139403m"><dcterms:title>Sensible heat flux estimation over a prairie grassland by neural networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Abareshi, Behzad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sensible heat flux, a key component of the surface energy balance, is difficult to estimate in practice. This study was conducted to see if backpropagation neural networks could estimate sensible heat flux by using horizontal wind speed, air temperature, radiometric surface temperature, net radiation, and time as input. Ground measurements from the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project) Field Experiment (FIFE), collected in 1987 and 1989 over a prairie grassland in Kansas, were used for network training and validation. Networks trained on part of the data from a narrow range of space-time coordinates performed well over the other part, with error (root mean square error divided by mean of observations) values as low as 0.24. This indicates the potential in neural networks for linking sensible heat flux to routinely measured meteorological variables and variables amenable to remote sensing. When the networks were tested with data from other space-times, performance varied from good to poor, with average error values around 1.26. This was mainly due to lack of input variables parameterizing canopy morphology and soil moisture, indicating that such variables should be incorporated in the design of future networks intended for large scale applications.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schuepp, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z742x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139403m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Terrestrial heat flow -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neural networks (Computer science)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grasslands.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak06989540"><dcterms:title>Palliative care, ethics, and the Jamaican paradigm</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Aarons, Derrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Palliative care provides symptom control, social, psychological and spiritual care for terminally ill patients, and psycho-social support and bereavement care for their families.

Solutions based on the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm are presented, with the focus being on discrete-cosine-transform-(DCT) domain finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters. In speech-related applications, the covariance matrix of the reference signal is ten nearly singular, i.e., rank-deficient, which has the effect that some of the transform-domain tap coefficients stop adapting and effectively "freeze". During is low-rank phase, this frozen taps can retain any value without effect on the mean-square error (MSE), while the remaining taps track the evolution of the system and keep the MSE at a minimum. When the covariance matrix becomes nonsingular, however, there are no longer any frozen coefficients, and a unique tap coefficient vector yields minimum MSE. The MSE abruptly "jumps", and convergence of the taps to the unique vector will take additional time due to the (obsolete) values of the previously frozen coefficients. To remedy the situation, one applies a method dubbed "spectral shaping". The objective of spectral shaping is to replace, during the low-rank phase, each frozen coefficient by an estimate of the corresponding coefficient of the unique full-rank solution. This is achieved in the transform domain by a combination of forward and backward linear predictors. By using spectral shaping, the frozen coefficients are thus "prepared" to be unfrozen when the covariance matrix gains full rank, resulting in a reduced jump in the MSE.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw08z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q882</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht779"><dcterms:title>Analysis-synthesis and time-frequency scaling of phonocardiogram</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Xuan, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The analysis-synthesis of eleven phonocardiograms (PCGs) representing the normal and pathological conditions of the heart was performed by the damped sinusoidal method and the matching pursuit method.

The matching pursuit method was found to be more suitable to the properties of both the transient heart sounds and the noise-like heart murmurs of the PCGs, therefore providing better analysis-synthesis results than the damped sinusoid model. It was applied to the transformations of the PCG signals, including time-scale expansion, frequency-scale expansion, and joint time-frequency expansion. A scaling/inverse-scaling process was set up for quantitative evaluation of the scaling performance. The spectrogram was used to calculate the NRMSE for the quantitative comparison of the PCG energy in the time-frequency domain, and both the spectrogram and the Wigner distribution were used for visual comparison. The results showed that the matching pursuit method is an effective technique for the time-frequency scaling transformations of PCGs, although its effectiveness is strongly related to the optimization of the parameters for the decomposition of the signals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, H.

Eye responses in the VOR consist of alternations between slow phases (eye moves opposite to head) to stablize the eye in space and fast phases to quickly redirect the eye in space. At the end of each fast phase segment, the eye position appears well correlated with head velocity. In contrast to slow phases, fast phases are of quite short duration. Therefore, they must be detected precisely in order to do any further analysis. This thesis reports an improved version of a previous autoregression (ARX) model classification algorithm, to allow automatic classification of fast phase segments or to detect only end points of fast phases. Results in this thesis demonstrate that the dynamics associated with the fast phase end points present specific patterns. These patterns can be represented as a linear or a cubic equation. In other words, a first-order or third-order polynomial can be fitted to the experimental data by the least square technique. The DC bias of the fitted data shows distinctive ranges for normal subjects and vestibular lesion patients. The asymmetric an non-linear shapes of the fitted curve can also denote a lesion. Other dynamic properties, such as the fast phase segment frequencies or the phase shift between the output eye position and input head velocity, have strong tendencies to differentiate normals from patients. In addition, the characteristics of fast phase beginning points suggest that the initiation of fast phases in independent of any obvious eye velocity or eye position threshold.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, H.

In one of the specimens, the column and hinge were circular in cross section; in the other specimen, the column and hinge were square in cross section. The main objective was to assess the seismic performance of these details, which are common in existing bridge structures in moderate seismic regions. The test results confirmed that the lateral column displacement was due almost entirely to rotations in the hinge. Horizontal slip at the hinge and flexural deformation in the column were insignificant prior to hinge gap closure, which occurred at large column displacements. Hinge gap closure resulted in sudden increases in stiffness and strength, but these increases occurred at column displacements which would be excessive in the prototype structure. The hinge responses are characterized by hysteretic pinching, poor energy absorption and significant stiffness degradation. The measured moment-curvature responses of the hinge regions are compared predicted monotonic responses. Special attention is given to the effect of confinement on the hinge concrete in increasing the strength and the ductility of the concrete.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, E.

By using space-variant sampling, the foveation process compresses the data in the perceived scene, thereby producing a significant reduction in subsequent image processing computations. These savings make foveated image sensors attractive for use on autonomous mobile robots with limited available computing power. When fabricated in standard Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, foveated sensors benefit from the integration of image sensing and processing functions on one substrate, yielding a further reduction in power consumption and system mass. In this thesis, the design, implementation and test of a CMOS foveated image sensor are examined in detail. A new representation of the foveated mapping, called the hybrid model, is introduced to facilitate design of the sensor using a standard CMOS process. The imager is based on the archetypal CMOS Passive Pixel Sensor (PPS). A study of this technology is undertaken, including an investigation of some non-ideal effects. A detailed explanation of the design of the prototype CMOS foveated sensor is presented. Issues related to the use of a standard CMOS process are examined, and the development of a software tool for automatic layout generation explained. The theoretical discussion is followed by a presentation of a comprehensive analysis of the fabricated prototype. With the help of experimental results, including sample images, noise performance, maximum frame rate and power consumption, the merits of the fabricated prototype are demonstrated, and its potential for use as a mobile robot vision sensor investigated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, G.

Water-saturated debris flows formed in a large-scale flume (95 m x 2 m) designed by the U.S. Geological Survey also exhibit roll waves. This work explores the characteristics of these waves. It focuses primarily on the wave profile and speed. Using a discontinuous theoretical solution of the shallow water wave equations, it is possible to predict wave speed, depth and period and to compare these values to the experimental results from both systems. The theoretical solution assumes that the discontinuous roll wave profiles can be connected through travelling shock waves. The height of a granular shock wave moving downstream must then match that of the roll waves for a particular flow condition. This method of predicting the wave depth was tested against the experimental evidence and was fairly successful. A power spectral density analysis of the larger scale debris flows exhibited no fundamental periodicity. The controlled granular chute flows, however had increased spectral densities in fairly wide low-frequency bands. This zone of increased spectral power may correspond to the natural frequencies of a quasi-periodic phenomenon.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Savage, Stuart B.

With the simulator, trainees can carry out all the switching operations necessary for their work in absolute safety, while staying in a realistic environment. A speech-recognition system controls the training session, while audio immersion adds a dimension of realism to the virtual world. An expert-system validates the trainee's operations at all times and a steady-state power-flow simulator recalculates network parameters. The automatic conversion of single-line diagrams enables the construction of three-dimensional models of substation equipment.

The present trend points towards a robotic mining environment where mobile machinery and stationary equipment will be fully integrated with a mine-wide information system overseeing all aspects of mining via a communication network. The successful design and implementation of the software and hardware components necessary to realize this vision depends on the level of seamless integration achieved. The complexity involved in terms of systems functionality and coherence necessitates systems analysis and computer-aided software engineering tools to actively support this integration effort. Hence, the primary objective of this thesis is to introduce and relate systems analysis concepts and tools to the business of mining. This investigation begins by setting the industrial context of this work with respect to past initiatives and future trends. It discusses different approaches to the design and implementation of mining information systems. It reviews the fundamentals of software and information engineering as well as structured and object-oriented analysis and design. It presents a survey of computerized tools for systems analysis. It then applies systems analysis concepts and tools to a high-level top-down analysis of a Mine Information System and examines a specific mining process in detail. Finally, it compares the applicability of structured versus object-oriented analysis and design methodologies to the complex problem of mining.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scoble, Malcolm (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b376.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795970m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, System Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719p38s"><dcterms:title>Edge localization in surface reconstruction using optimal estimation theory</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mathur, Shailendra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis the problem of localizing discontinuities while smoothing noisy data is solved for the surface reconstruction method known as Curvature Consistency. In this algorithm, noisy initial estimates of surface patches are refined according to a continuity model, using a relaxation process. The interaction between neighbouring pixels in local neighbourhoods during relaxation is shown to be equivalent to a multiple measurement fusion process, where each pixel acts as a measurement source. Using optimal estimation theory as a basis, an adaptive weighting technique is developed to estimate interpolant surface patch parameters from neighbouring pixels. By applying the weighting process iteratively within local neighbourhoods, discontinuities are localized and a piecewise-continuous surface description is achieved. The resulting discontinuity localization algorithm is adaptive over different signal to noise ratios, robust over discontinuities of different scales and independent of user set parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, Frank (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj66v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719p38s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg86w"><dcterms:title>Micellar-enhanced extraction across a membrane</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marx, Sarah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Micellar-enhanced extraction (MEEX) is a solvent extraction process which transfers organic solutes from wastewater to an aqueous surfactant phase containing micelles which solubilize the solutes. The feed and solvent contact each other across a microporous membrane having pore sizes small enough to prevent the micelles from crossing the membrane and contaminating the purified water. Back-contamination of the wastewater by surfactant monomers which cross the membrane is minimized by using a surfactant with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC). MEEX was demonstrated with an aqueous feed solution containing 500 ppm of benzoic acid as a model solute. The aqueous solvent contained a cationic tertiary amine surfactant, with an 18 carbon tail and two polyoxyethylene head groups, at concentrations between 0 and 17 g/L. The surfactant was characterized by surface tension measurements and by solubilization studies using semiequilibrium dialysis. The surface tension-derived CMC was approximately 0.04 g/L. MEEX was carried out in tubular hollow fiber membrane units with molecular weight cutoffs of either 5000 or 30000. The units contained 35 tubes of 30 cm length with inside diameters of 0.55 mm. The best results were obtained when the solvent was on the tube side. A model was developed for MEEX that incorporates solubilization equilibrium data. The overall benzoic acid mass transfer coefficient, based on the internal area of the tubes, and the flux of benzoic acid across the membrane were calculated. The flux of benzoic acid across the membrane opposed the overall concentration difference in the presence of surfactant. The back-contamination of the wastewater by the surfactant was at a concentration close to the CMC, except for surfactant solutions containing more than 8 g/L. With a concentration of 8 g/L of surfactant, the benzoic acid concentration was reduced from 475 to 55 ppm, a reduction of 88%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Weber, M. E.

The two problems are related: calibrated torque information is prerequisite for the GComp model identification; the identified GComp model makes on-line automatic torque sensor calibration possible. In the first part, we propose an autonomous joint torque sensor calibration method, which utilizes combinations of single-joint rotations and an arm's own gravity load. The method determines not only joint torque sensor gains and offsets, but also those of the joint angle sensors. When one joint of a manipulator is rotated, the gravity torque exerted on the joint varies sinusoidally with rotation angle. From the fitted parameters one may extract sensor gains and offsets. A custom designed calibration load is used to provide a reference torque for torque sensor gain calibration. A key feature of the proposed method is that nothing is assumed known about the arm's inertial parameters or of the location of the reference load in the grasp. Experiments are conducted on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm. The second part of the thesis presents a new and simple procedure to identify link mass parameters used for gravity compensation and on-line automatic torque sensor calibration for a robot manipulator. The approach employs a single-joint rotation and a recursive procedure that proceeds distally to proximally. Composite mass moments are identified for each link, and are further divided into configuration dependent and independent terms. It is shown that the configuration-independent terms may actually combine contributions from several links. Simulation and experimental results on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm verify the approach.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hollerbach, John M.

Chemicals concentration profiles inside the chips can be obtained at any point of time during impregnation and pulping. The simulation was rendered practical and easy to use by reducing the required input parameters to known operating conditions. Correlations between sapwood and heartwood chips fundamental properties and operating conditions were developed and integrated into the program.

Collision with icebergs represent hazards for both surface and sub-surface facilities. In the latter case, hazards are associated with seabed scouring by the iceberg keel. In both cases, hazard analysis requires estimation of the flux of icebergs and their size distribution. Estimates of the flux of icebergs can be achieved by obtaining separate estimates of iceberg densities and of drift patterns of iceberg velocities. The objective of this thesis is to develop and apply estimation procedures for the density of icebergs using presently available data sets. The most comprehensive of these data sets is compiled by the International Ice Patrol (IIP), starting in 1960. The IIP database comprises data from several sources and for icebergs of varying sizes. In addition, the spatial coverage of surveys does not appear to be uniform throughout the year. Several non-parametric density estimation procedures are investigated. The objective is to eliminate any apparent high densities in the estimates due to the non-uniform coverage of the region during surveys and retain statistically significant features in the spatial variation of densities. Several kernel estimators are examined: (1) a uniform square kernel, (2) a uniform circular kernel, (3) a Normal kernel, and (4) an adaptive kernel. Uniform kernels have the advantage of computational efficiency, however, they do not account for spatial variations in the densities and produce over-smoothing in regions of peak iceberg densities and under-smoothing in regions of low iceberg densities. The adaptive kernel is computationally more demanding, but appears to fulfill all the desired requirements for preserving significant features and eliminating erratic estimates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chouinard, Luc E.

There is often a conflict between good appearance and short cycle time. Injection molded parts can show several types of surface defect. It is believed that wall slip may be associated with some types of defect, because wall slip can modify the distributions of velocity, wall shear stress, pressure and heat flux. The work described here involves an experimental study of the occurrence of flow marks during injection molding of linear polyethylene, and the possible relationship between these defects and wall slip. It also involves the investigation of the feasibility of incorporating wall slip models in the 2.5D computer simulation of the injection molding process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, John M.

The research was undertaken at CANMET's Experimental Mine in Val-d'Or, Quebec. A total of thirteen (13) blasts were studied from November 1994 to February 1995. The analysis of each blast was divided into three stages: (1) Pre-blast: includes structural mapping, rockmass characterization, estimation of the in situ block size distribution and documentation of the blast design. (2) Blast: includes blast vibration monitoring and analysis. (3) Post-blast: includes determination of fragment size distribution, half-cast factors and bootlegs. The blast design was kept as constant as possible throughout the study in order to limit the variation of parameters to the geology-related ones. The results were analyzed to determine any correlation between the rockmass characteristics and the blast results. Only general trends were found: (1) The characteristic size of the fragments obtained after blasting (x$ rm sb{c}$ blast) increases when the characteristic size of the in situ distribution (x$ rm sb{c}$ in situ) increases; (2) The characteristic size of the fragments obtained after blasting (x$ rm sb{c}$ blast) decreases when the adjusted powder factor increases; (3) The half-cast factor (HCF) decreases when the Rock Quality Designation (RQD), RMR and Q values increase; (4) The characteristic size of the fragments obtained after blasting (x$ rm sb{c}$ blast) increases when the RQD, Rock Mass Rating (RMR) and quality index (Q) values increase. Some of these results confirm basic blasting principles whereas others were unexpected. The fact that no statistical correlation could be found is probably due to the geological environment in which the experiments were completed. The rock types encountered have very similar mechanical properties and the quality of the rockmasses did not vary extensively. Therefore, any variance in the results is best explained by the blast performance itself.

At McGill University, a five year five Major Project in Photonic Devices and Systems has been undertaken, with funding from the Canadian Institute for Telecommunications Research. One of the main goals of the project is to develop an optical backplane architecture capable of interconnecting several electronic printed circuit boards with an aggregate bandwidth on the order of 1 Terabit per second. Currently, the project is in its third year in which a representative subset of a Terabit Photonic Backplane is under development. The objectives of this thesis are three fold. First, we motivate the study of optical backplanes by demonstrating that the interconnection network of a Cray T3D Supercomputer can be embedded onto the optical backplane. In particular, we demonstrate that the 3D mesh interconnect of the Cray T3D can be embedded into the "Dual Stream Linear HyperPlane" (9). Secondly, having established a motivation we then provide a detailed review of the functional specifications of an optical backplane. In particular, we provide a detailed review of the June 1995 backplane design (31). Thirdly, having established a motivation and a detailed design we then develop a executable software model of the June 1995 backplane using the VHDL hardware description language. The VHDL model is used to establish the functional correctness of the design. In addition, the VHDL model is used to develop a real-time simulator for the photonic backplane using 4013 Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The real time simulator can operate at a 4 MHz clock rate and can be used to test other electronic components such as the Message-Processors at realistic clock rates.

Humans can be affected by contaminant migration through land and water use. Health risks can arise from ingestion of and dermal contact with contaminated water and soil, as well as through inhalation of contaminated air. Quantitative estimates of risks are calculated for both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic contaminants. Soil and sediment systems are very heterogeneous and are characterized by uncertain parameters. Concepts of fuzzy set theory have been used in the programme to take uncertainty into account. Uncertain input parameters are represented by fuzzy numbers.
