The purpose of the study was to inquire into the number of South Asian youth that had ever considered committing suicide; determine whether there were any predicting factors; and gain insight as to "why." It was found that close to 30% of the sample had considered suicide and that gender, place of birth and a self-rating scale of depression were significant variables. Of those who had admitted to having considered suicide, 'family pressures' was cited as the number one reason.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>John, Lindsay (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv68n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rk04z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Asian American children -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Youth -- Suicidal behavior -- Ontario.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h99t"><dcterms:title>Time course of neuronal degeneration in the pilocarpine model of epileptogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Poirier, Julie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, we investigated the progression of cellular injury using two markers of neuronal degeneration, in a model of hippocampal epileptogenesis. Pilocarpine was used to induce a controlled period of status epilepticus (SE) in six groups of rats. Following a 1--2 week period of apparent recovery, the animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures. A silver impregnation technique for neurons subjected to cytoskeletal stress, the Dark Neuron stain, was used to label hippocampal neurons at each of six selected time points (from 3h--3weeks) following SE. The proportion of labelled cells was then compared to that obtained with the anionic fluorochrome Fluoro-Jade, reported to be specific for degenerating neurons. Results revealed a differential temporal pattern of labelling. The Dark Neuron stain preferentially revealed cells at earlier time points, while with Fluoro-Jade staining was found at a later time point during epileptogenesis. Interestingly, maximal Fluoro-Jade labelling at 1 week post-pilocarpine injection coincided with significant cell loss and gliosis in the CA3 principal cell layer. The two stains, therefore, appear to detect separate processes of neuronal damage during epileptogenesis. This finding highlights the fact that distinct cellular events take place at different stages of epileptogenesis, which may differ significantly from the permanent changes observed in chronically epileptic tissue. Understanding the progression of cellular injury may be important for the development of antiepileptogenic therapy, a potentially valuable complementary approach to anticonvulsant therapy for the treatment of chronic epilepsy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De Koninck, Yves (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f806.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h99t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf661"><dcterms:title>Organotins in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and sediments from the Saint-Lawrence River</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Regoli, Lidia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Toxic antifouling agents such as tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) have been released in aquatic ecosystems through the use of antifouling paint applied to ship hulls, pleasure crafts and fish nets. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha ) as a biomonitor for investigating the geographical variations of organotin bioavailability along the St. Lawrence River. Organotins TBT and TPT and their degradation products were first measured in the soft tissues of zebra mussels collected from along the River. High concentrations of TBT were found in mussels from Bassin Louise, a marina in Quebec City (1442 ng/g wet weight). TPT concentrations were elevated at 2 sites near Quebec City (252 and 530 ng/g wet weight). A follow-up study assessed the extent of the distribution of organotins from the contaminated marina to the River system by measuring organotin concentrations in zebra mussels and in sediments collected River near Quebec City. The highest concentration of TBT was found in Bassin Louise (1078 ng/g wet weight) and elevated concentrations were found in two other marinas. The concentrations decreased sharply to background levels just outside the marinas. All butyltins were detected in all sediments analysed. There was a significant correlation between TBT in sediments and mussels. These studies suggest that organotin contamination may remain a problem in localized freshwaters in the St. Lawrence River.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, Laurie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mr77n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf661</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zebra mussel -- Saint Lawrence River.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Organotin compounds -- Bioavailability -- Saint Lawrence River.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848s41v"><dcterms:title>Sedimentology, diagenesis and reservoir characteristics of the Devonian Simonette (Leduc Formation) and Ante Creek (Swan Hills Formation) fields : a comparison between a limestone and dolomite field, west-central Alberta basin</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rock, Luc.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Simonette and Ante Creek reservoirs are part of a series of extensive Upper Devonian reef complexes or buildups in the West-central Alberta Basin.

Ante Creek's lithofacies are similar to other Swan Hills buildups, and can be subdivided into 7 buildup stages. The Leduc Formation in Simonette can be subdivided into 6 buildup stages, however, facies recognition is difficult as primary textures are obliterated by pervasive replacement dolomitization. Ante Creek and Simonette had a similar diagenetic sequence, except that the relative amounts of the different diagenetic products change between both fields. Vuggy, moldic, intercrystalline, and fracture porosity types predominate in the dolomite Simonette reservoir.

There are several well known, inexpensive analyses that have been developed for virtual call resolution. We present a new flow insensitive and context insensitive analysis called reaching type analysis in this thesis. We present the analysis rules for two variations of this analysis, variable type analysis and a coarser grained version declared type analysis. Reaching type analysis is based on an analysis that builds a type propagation graph where nodes represent variables and edges represent the flow of types due to assignments. We have implemented variable type analysis and declared type analysis, and two existing analyses, class hierarchy analysis and rapid type analysis, in the Soot framework and compared their relative success at building accurate call graphs for complete applications. Method inlining is a compiler optimization in which the method call is replaced by the body of the method being called.

Previous studies have shown that expression of the CEACAM1 isoform containing the long cytoplasmic domain (aa 448--521 in mouse; CEACAM1-L) inhibited tumor growth in vivo, while the expression of the CEACAM1 isoform bearing the short cytoplasmic tail (aa 448--458 in mouse; CEACAM1-S) had no effect. Therefore, the long cytoplasmic domain contains determinants which are crucial for the growth inhibitory phenotype. We have demonstrated that sequence elements within the C-terminal region of CEACAM1-L are responsible for the inhibition of colonic tumor cell growth. Mutation of Tyr488, Va1518 and Lys519--521 averted CECAM1-L's tumor suppressive activity. Furthermore, the role of CEACAM1's adhesive properties in the tumor inhibition phenotype was also investigated. Truncation of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM1 abrogated CEACAM1's ability to sustain intracellular adhesion but had no effect on the tumor inhibitory function. Hence, while the adhesion domain is not implicated in CEACAM1's tumor inhibitory activity, the C-terminal region of the long cytoplasmic domain plays an important role.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beauchemin, Nicole (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064770w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc554</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s431f"><dcterms:title>Investigations of metal carbonyl complexes as potential catalysts for the alternating co-polymerization of imine and CO into polypeptides</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lafrance, Danny.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study is to investigate the potential use of transition metal carbonyl complexes for the sequential insertion of CO and imines, with the ultimate goal of developing an imine/CO co-polymerization catalyst.

Unlike the PNS, Wallerian degeneration is very slow in the injured adult mammalian CNS. This slow removal of myelin, which contains axon growth inhibitors, contributes to the failure of CNS regeneration. Via its metabolic products, PLA2 may help mediate myelin breakdown and macrophage recruitment for debris clearance in Wallerian degeneration. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was used to assess whether PLA2 expression correlates with differing rates of Wallerian degeneration. Indeed, cytosolic (cPLA2) and secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) are strongly upregulated early (five hours) in the crushed adult rat sciatic nerve (PNS) and continue to be expressed for up to ten days, i.e. during the period of myelin breakdown and phagocytosis. In the injured optic nerve (CNS) however, both forms of PLA2 are upregulated very late (eight weeks) after lesioning. Furthermore, in C57BL/Wlds mutant mice, a strain that undergoes delayed Wallerian degeneration in injured peripheral nerves and also has a null mutation for the story type II sPLA2, no cPLA 2 expression was observed up to ten days post-crush (duration of study) in contrast to the wild-type mouse. Blocking cPLA2 activity in transected sciatic nerves of C57BL/6J mice, also deficient in sPLA2 type II, markedly slowed myelin breakdown and phagocytosis. Together, these observations show strong evidence for the involvement of both forms of PLA 2 in mediating rapid Wallerian degeneration.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>David, Samuel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb35h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257g88f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rq58j"><dcterms:title>Spiral irradiation in stereotactic radiosurgery</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dubé, Frédéric, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to deliver a high and uniform radiation dose to the target volume and a minimized dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. Various linac-based radiosurgical techniques are used clinically: multiple non-coplanar converging arcs, dynamic arc rotation, and conical rotation. The techniques differ in their beam distribution over the patient's head. A study of the beam distribution characteristics for the clinical linac-based radiosurgical techniques is presented. Two spiral linac-based radiosurgical techniques are developed: the uniform dose-rate spiral irradiation and the dose-rate-weighted spiral irradiation. Both exhibit the same spiraling beam entry trace over the patient's head; however, they differ in their beam distribution along the spiral. The dose-rate-weighted spiral irradiation provides a uniform beam distribution over the 2pi solid angle available in radiosurgery. The currently existing techniques and the spiral techniques are then compared using the cumulative dose-volume histogram (CDVH) tools available with the McGill Treatment Planning System (MPS). The dose-rate-weighted spiral technique leads to lower dose inhomogeneities within the target volume and better dose conformity within the target. Moreover, it also encompasses smaller volumes of tissue at all isodose levels with larger differences at low isodose levels. A conclusion is reached that the dose-rate-weighted spiral irradiation technique offers interesting advantages over the currently used clinical linac-based techniques.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorsak, Ervin B.

The fauna were unevenly distributed both spatially and temporally amongst the pools. The occurrence of taxa was similar in pools in the same geographic location. The habitat characteristics of each pool, coupled with their proximity to a permanent waterbody and their accessibility to organisms, perhaps influenced the distribution of the various taxa. A successional pattern was observed in which filter-feeders and detritivores appeared first, followed by predators. After drought, a similar pattern was seen in pools that were replenished by summer rains, but taxon diversity was lower.

In a competitive environment, real loss and reactive-power allocation is an ancillary service provided by the transmission providers or by the Independent System Operator (ISO). Under a monopoly, the price charged for these services was embedded in the overall electricity tariff which recovered the costs associated with this and all other ancillary services. Under competition, however, real losses and reactive generation may have to be charged separately according to the level of use of such services required by each individual real power transaction. This is particularly so for bilateral transactions transferring real power across the network during which process real and reactive losses are incurred and must be generated from the available sources. The setting of a corresponding tariff is a challenging problem, the main reason being that it is difficult to allocate the total system losses and reactive load among the individual transactions in a fair and systematic manner. This thesis develops and tests an approach which systematically allocates real losses and reactive generation components among the bilateral bus-to-bus real power transactions in the presence of an arbitrary number of other simultaneous transactions. These power components are calculated based on the load flow equations under the assumption that the network voltage profile remains constant and within limits. The main technique used is called "incremental loss allocation" and is described in detail in this thesis. The question of monetary compensation for the power allocation services is not pursued here. Instead, the focus is placed on calculating the real and reactive-power allocations for each bilateral transaction on the basis of which fairer tariffs could be developed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, F.

Due to the high velocity of detonation in the condensed explosive cord (6--7 km/s), the rapid chemical energy release along its length generates a quasi-cylindrical blast wave in the surrounding combustible mixture. For a sufficiently strong detonating cord, the generated blast wave is observed to decay to a stable Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conical detonation. Below a certain critical energy, the blast wave decays to low velocities without initiating detonation. In the critical regime of initiation, measurements of the combustion front velocity and direct flow visualization indicate that the blast wave decays to sub-CJ velocities before the onset of detonation. The onset of detonation is associated with discrete explosion centers. This phenomenon is similar to what has been previously observed for spherical initiation, suggesting a universal mechanism of detonation initiation. The critical shock radius at which the onset of detonation occurs is correlated to the detonation cell size (lambda) of the mixture, consistently yielding a radius of 4 to 8lambda. Using the invariance of the explosion length R0 in the critical regime of initiation for spherical and cylindrical detonations, it is shown how the critical radii and critical energies scale between the two geometries, clarifying the correct length scales that should be used in the theory of direct initiation of detonation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, John M.

Operated under ambient extraction and HCl stripping conditions, 0.95 F OPAP was found to be a highly suitable extractant for the removal of iron(III) from strong synthetic ZnSO 4-H2SO4 solutions and for the preparation of concentrated iron chloride strip solutions. Its major advantages included: very low sulphate co-extraction; reasonable zinc co-extraction; very low chloride back-extraction; and sufficient iron build-up and acid balance when a 'moderate strength' HCl-FeCl2 strip feed (3.38 N HCl-58.5 g/L Fe(II)-9.7 g/L Fe(III)) was used. Certain advantages were exhibited by 1.25 F D2EHPA over 0.95 F OPAP. These included a greater relative stability in aqueous streams, slightly better Fe3+/Zn2+ selectivity, and a comparable iron(III) loading capacity (~20 g/L) when operated at 50°C. However, major drawbacks with D2EHPA were identified which included significant sulphate co-extraction (approximately twenty times greater than 0.95 F OPAP) and ineffective stripping and hence poor iron build-up ( &lt; 100 g/L) with the 'moderate strength' strip feed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Demopoulos, G.

The response of this specimen was compared to two specimens previously constructed and tested at McGill University (Castele, 1988). Each specimen was designed and detailed according to the 1984 CSA A23.3-M84 Standard with a force modification factor, R, of 2.0 (NBCC 1995). The first specimen represented a deficient subassemblage before retrofit. The response of the retrofitted specimen using steel corner angles and batten plates was compared to the response of a specimen retrofitted using reinforced concrete sleeving (tested by Castele, 1988). The test specimens were instrumented to enable detailed strain, load and deflection measurements at critical locations during the testing procedure. The results of the two retrofit specimens provides some insight into the rehabilitation of older structures containing "weak column" or deficiently designed and detailed columns. In addition, three full-scale column specimens were constructed and tested under monotonic axial compression to determine the effectiveness of the two column retrofitting techniques used in the subassemblage specimens. These tests provided a means of assessing the assumptions used in predicting the responses of retrofitted columns.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Denis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc77x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf679</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r749b"><dcterms:title>Disrupting binary divisions : representation of identity in Saikati and Battle of the sacred tree</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mukora, Wanjiku Beatrice.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>By using two Kenyan films, Saikati (1992) by Anne Mungai and Battle of the Sacred Tree (1994) by Wanjiru Kinyanjui, this thesis explores the representation of identity in contemporary Kenyan society. Through a theoretical focus on African feminist thought which stems out of literary criticism, this study posits that in order for an understanding of identity to take place, then the discussion must extend beyond the binary divisions of tradition and modernity. This study offers a history of cinema in Kenya from the colonial administration era till present day to illustrate that the legacy of colonialism has been very influential in contemporary Kenya. I have used film as a tool to expose the non-static nature of identity, contrary to colonial discourse present in films about Africans during colonialism. Although both films examine different social topics, this study highlights that the processes of determination and formation of identity, as represented in both films, are situational, circumstantial, and dependent on personal choice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pericard, Alain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n518q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r749b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feminism -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>National characteristics, Kenyan.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3197xn582"><dcterms:title>Le sacré dans trois romans de Victor-Lévy Beaulieu /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rouleau, Caroline.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Victor-Levy Beaulieu's novels all centre around the search for the sacred, a quest for meaning and the Absolute which is accomplished through self-degradation and transgression.

By means of an analysis of three essential aspects of Beaulieu's writing---the relationship to time and space, the role of women in the male character's universe, and the function of violence---we will show how the author represents, in his novels, the complex interplay of (i) the two modes (the sacred and the profane) of existence, (ii) the bipolar nature of the sacred itself and (iii) the complicity linking taboo and transgression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Everett, Jane (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731584b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xn582</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Holy, The, in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beaulieu, Victor Lévy, 1945- -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903184x"><dcterms:title>Family vs. full time : women's redesign of organizational practice through job sharing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pepper, Jennifer.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Balancing the spheres of employment and family can be an overwhelming task for many employed family members. Jobs are often inflexibly structured and reward systems in organizations are often based on restrictive definitions of career "commitment". As a result, these outmoded organizational structures and erroneous assumptions can penalize employees with family responsibilities. Through their initiation and maintenance of job sharing arrangements, women are actively challenging the validity of such organizational practices. Job sharing allows one to remain active and effective in his or her chosen career while devoting more time to home, family and personal pursuits. Women and men's experience as family members, parents, and employees is constrained by socially constructed notions of gender. Their different actions and experience in this regard affect how they attempt to balance their employment and family responsibilities, as well as how they perceive the job sharing option.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pericard, Alain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k99g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903184x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organizational change.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Job sharing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women employees.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap2676x58f"><dcterms:title>The security of women in the Ottoman Empire /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sancar, Selin H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The issue raised in this thesis is the importance of dealing with the security of Ottoman women--from the 16th century to the Tanzimat (Reform) Era (1839--1876)--and the significance of this subject in understanding the Ottoman society in general. The thesis raises the point that if sources such as court records, fetvas (religious verdicts), and travelers' reports draw a somewhat different picture of the Ottoman woman from the popular image of the "oppressed woman," then it is important to know how this picture differs. Examination of these sources shows that they actually confirm one another from different perspectives. The thesis also explores how the metaphysical underpinnings of Ottoman society provided an atmosphere conducive to women's security. It attempts to find an answer to the underlying question, 'What motivated these women to take action?' by examining their physical, financial, and marital related security.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turgay, A.

Although unexplored by academics, Ducharme's vision of the school touches an significant number of issues at various levels of complexity. In our introduction, we examine the challenge of defining the issues and the scope of the school, and we consider a variety of frameworks for our analysis. The initial portion of the thesis itself takes us through Ducharme's writings, following the thread of this theme and identifying important references. Following this inventory, our second section examines the ways Ducharme's school addresses issues of authority in popular culture through its vision of Literature and History. We also see links to the other classic ducharmian themes of "subversion and salvation". Finally, we propose a model of the fanciful ducharmian school as it emerges from the text of these three novels.
