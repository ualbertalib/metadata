It explores the operations of power over women's bodies by analyzing the way in which the maternal body is constructed in the discourses of law, medicine and culture. Chapter One provides a theoretical context for this thesis. It examines the organization of knowledge and its relationship to power within the Western liberal tradition. Power is implicated in the production and dissemination of knowledge about the maternal body in two ways. First, scientific knowledge is privileged in legal and cultural discourses with the effect that knowledge claims based on experience are discredited. Second, scientific knowledge about the fetus, divined through the routine application of diagnostic technologies, has generated new opportunities for scrutinizing the maternal body. This information has been used to create expectations about which bodies are appropriate for reproductive purposes. These points are explored in Chapters Two and Three. Chapter Two is a study of cultural discourses about two women whose pregnancies were condemned on the basis that their bodies deviated from the ideal maternal body. In these stories, each woman was represented as a bad mother for pursuing her pregnancy against medical advice. Chapter Three is a study of the law's response to women who have failed to comply with medical advice deemed necessary for fetal well-being. It analyzes the strategies and implications of legally regulating pregnant women. Overall, this thesis poses a challenge to the way that the maternal body is represented by excavating the partial nature of the claims upon which these representations are based. Further, it argues for a re-conceptualization of the maternal body.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>van Praagh, Shauna (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117r06s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n0829</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anthropology, Cultural.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women's Studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cd065"><dcterms:title>International aircraft leasing : impact on international air law treaties</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pompongsuk, Prasert.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Aircraft leasing is a method of fleet acquisition. It was known to none at the outset of the air traffic era; as a result, international air law treaties were not formulated upon the concept that realized the practices as such. The moment international aircraft leasing materialized, many regimes of international air law became unsuited to the situation. On the one hand, public international air law treaties have faced the problems ranging from safety oversight responsibilities and aircraft accident investigation to airport charges and criminal jurisdiction. On the other hand, private international air law treaties have faced the problems ranging from applicability of the 1952 Rome Convention and preferential rights under the 1948 Geneva Convention to aircraft engine leasing and the idiosyncrasy of leasing transactions. This study is not aimed at scrutinizing leasing transactions but at examining the aforementioned difficulties, especially the issues of public international air law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278w40z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cd065</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mh65g"><dcterms:title>Compensation for human rights violations against Hungarian Jewry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Peresztegi, Agnes.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is no comprehensive monograph dealing with the complex legal issues of compensation for the damage done to European Jews by the Nazi regime.

Inter-American relations, previously defined in the setting of the "Cold War", currently gravitate to a large extent, around the production and trade of illegal drugs. In this new framework, the economic dependency of developing nations provides the United States with enough power to implement unilateral strategies aimed at the achievement of U.S. national interests, through the execution of a coercive diplomacy supported by the threat of economic sanctions. In this context, the government of the United States has advanced the narcotics question as a pretext to obtain political, legislative and judicial changes in Latin American countries, through the "narcotics certification process", which pretends the adoption and implementation of a flawed, prohibition law enforcement oriented antidrug strategy. The certification process, besides its futility in terms of providing a solution to the narcotics dilemma, causes irreparable damage to producer and transit countries, constitutes an obstacle in their development process and a violation of their national sovereignty.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Glenn, J.

For these countries, economic integration became not only a tariff issue, but a strategy for development; hence the term "developmental regionalism". This thesis is a study of the concept of developmental regionalism in West Africa. It concentrates on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which was formed in 1975. It is argued that as a strategy for development, the ECOWAS integration effort was inadequate because of undue reliance on tariff reductions--- so called "negative integration" measures. It is suggested that to facilitate a more cohesive integration program, countries in the region ought to adopt positive integration measures in the form of common policies on money and payments, industrialization and most significantly, a common policy on investments. With respect to investment regulation, it is my argument that because liberalization of investment laws at the national level failed to attract the desired flow of foreign investment to the region, ECOWAS Member States ought to harmonize their regulatory framework with a view to ultimately adopting a single legal regime for international investment. As a framework for analysis, I adopt the criteria of economic efficiency. This is a cost/benefit analysis of the transformations that occur as the result of contractual transactions. Where the costs to the parties exceed or are likely to exceed the benefits of the transaction, it is said to be inefficient. Using these criteria, I argue that in order to inject a level of fairness in investor/host state relations, and to avoid the costs of FDI to host societies exceeding the gains therefrom, international law ought to make binding prescriptions to govern corporate conduct. Based on this reasoning, I suggest a framework for improving the investment climate in West Africa.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mestral, A. L.

This thesis will present the institutional and legal issues of the GNSS which have been recently discussed in the framework of ICAO. The certification issue to ensure the safety of civil aviation will be considered. The possibility of the legal system for the existing GNSS will correspondingly be examined. The thesis will also discuss the impact on developing countries in respect of utilizing the existing GNSS as a sole-means navigation system in considering whether a guarantee of quality and continuity of the services in long term is needed, and if so which alternative it is likely to take.

International air transport liberalization was initiated by the domestic deregulation of the US. After that, the US began exporting its liberalization policy to the international air transport market through liberal bilateral agreements. Since the early-1990's, the US has concluded numerous open skies agreements. Corresponding with the US liberalization policy, the EC initiated its regional liberalization and the EU achieved a fully open aviation market within the EU region through three liberalization packages. While liberalization of air transport has been proceeding in the international market, Japan was seeking to amend the Japan-US Civil Air Transport Agreement of 1952, which was modeled on Bermuda I. The development of Japanese and US carriers made the agreement unsuitable for the reality of the Japan-US market. At the same time, the ambiguous capacity clauses of the agreement caused serious interpretive disputes. Japan was seeking a restrictive agreement while the US desired an open skies agreement. It became evident during air transport negotiations. Japan and the US concluded an interim agreement in January 1998. The agreement of 1998 grants six carriers (three carriers for each country) unlimited third and fourth freedom rights and greatly liberalizes fifth freedom rights. The agreement also guarantees other Japan and US carriers very liberal third and fourth freedom rights and some limited fifth freedom rights. Furthermore, the agreement permits code-sharing in the Japan-US market for the first time. Although the two countries managed to reach on agreement, Japan must amend the Japanese Aviation Act for more efficient code-sharing between Japan and US carriers and solve its serious airport congestion problem in order to expand services under the new agreement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408030c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x350r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644t72r"><dcterms:title>Open skies and its recent impact on the Asia-Pacific region</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hu, Hong, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The primary intention of this thesis is to examine open skies policy and its far-reaching impact on the Asia-Pacific region. In order to achieve this, we will describe the historic evolution of economic regulation in civil air transport, which laid the foundation for an open skies regime. Moreover, the scope of an open skies regime on a global scale is addressed. Then, a detailed study of the essential elements of bilateral open skies agreements is undertaken. Afterwards, an analysis of the current economic air transport regulation in Asia-Pacific is conducted. With the emergence of the open skies trend, most Asia-Pacific nations began to liberalize their air transport industries. Yet, bilateral agreements remain the primary means to attain this goal. More necessarily, several Asia-Pacific countries' air transport policies will be comprehensively examined. This examination includes Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. Finally, a perspective for liberalization via a hybrid of bilateral and sub-regional open skies arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Michael (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77ss05h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t72r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- Asia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airlines -- Deregulation -- Asia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405sc51j"><dcterms:title>Les systemes informatises de reservation, cadre legal et perspectives d'avenir /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Herman, Thierry.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The methods of distribution of air transport services evolved tremendously through the years. Based on the airlines' internal reservation systems, the Computerized Reservation Systems (CRS) became the key element of today's distribution process. Their operation involves different parties: consumers, system vendors, be they air carriers or not, other air carriers and subscribers. CRS operation generated many problems, mainly when they were almost exclusively carrier owned. In my opinion, in the absence of specific regulations, competition law and antitrust laws were likely to address these issues efficiently, particularly through the application of the essential facility doctrine. However that may be, specific regulations were adopted in the United States, Europe, and within the ICAO framework. If these regulations proved to be efficient to solve CRS related problems, one may regret their lack of uniformity. Indeed, having in mind the nationality of the predominant CRS on the market, uniformity among these regulations would have created, de facto, a universal legal framework. CRS' industry having a strong international flavour, many disputes will go beyond the limits of a single jurisdiction. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, M.

However, the regulatory framework of international air transport services has for decades been dominated by narrow, nationalistic views. The increasing globalisation and trans-nationalisation of international trade in general and airline activities in particular question this status quo and puts pressure on the regulators to create a liberal framework, in which airlines can co-operate without impediments. This thesis looks at the current trends in the liberalisation of international air transport services. In a first step, the world-wide developments are discussed, in particular "open skies" and regionalism. Then, by using the US-German civil aviation relations as an example, the methods and motives of liberalisation in a bilateral relationship are analysed. In a last step the driving forces behind liberalisation of air transport services are discussed, a new approach towards aviation is proposed and an outlook is given on the prospects for future aviation agreements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>van Tenema, Peter (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f3483.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vw160</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk99x"><dcterms:title>The evidentiary value of Bills of Lading and Estoppel : a comparative study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Giermann, Heiko A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This comparative thesis addresses the evidentiary value of bills of lading and estoppel under the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules, the law in the United Kingdom and the United States.

The investigation proceeds by examining first recent moves within the European Community to adjust environmental policy to the principle of subsidiarity. The analysis then adopts a comparative approach and discusses various issues for Canadian environmental policy arising from the Canadian division of powers. The Canadian division of powers is shown to operate with much more narrow principles and rules than under the EC-Treaty with the resultant overlap in concurrent policy-making necessitating various forms and techniques for policy-coordination. A final part of the inquiry engages economic theories of federalism, in particular recent prescriptions for greater decentralization of environmental policy that have informed the debate on subsidiarity. These theories are shown to be deficient in furnishing an adequate account of why individuals would accept regulatory competition without assurances as to a guaranteed minimum of environmental quality irrespective of a particular level of material wealth. The study, therefore, concludes that on a redistributive understanding of environmental policy, central agents, corresponding in their territorial span to the geographical reach of 'markets' have an important role to play.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mestral, Armand de (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fr079.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr490</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics, Theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cw25m"><dcterms:title>"A most vexatious burden" : jurisdiction in Canadian correctional law</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Campbell, Mary E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The origins of two jurisdictional issues in Canadian correctional law have long puzzled experts. First, why is sentence length of two years set as the dividing line between prison and penitentiary custody? Second, why are prisons under provincial authority and penitentiaries under federal authority? This thesis traces the origins of both rules and posits reasons for their genesis. Evidence is presented to document that the two-year "rule" first arose in England in 1706 as a cap on the length of sentences of imprisonment. Its subsequent application in British North America where it was transformed into a jurisdictional "split" was not uniform, and it was eventually imposed on the Lower Provinces after Confederation, following the Upper Canadian model. Previous theories respecting the federal/provincial division of powers are reviewed, and new material is presented which suggests a more pragmatic, Maritime-based explanation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Healy, Patrick (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rz66v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cw25m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht893"><dcterms:title>Copyright activities on the internet : the role of the fixation criterion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bayer, Alexander, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Internet today is one of the media receiving the most attention.

This thesis addresses the applicability of current copyright law to works and activities on the Internet. To this end, copyright laws of the United States, Canada and other Commonwealth countries will be compared. It places emphasis on whether or not the storage of works in the transitory computer memory may be considered fixed in a copyright sense. Thus, it first examines the meaning and scope of fixation. Thereafter it provides an examination of the works which are protected on the Internet. Finally, the exploitation rights in this digital environment are investigated by examining activities on the Internet and the possible rights they involve, given the fixation criterion. To conclude, the thesis summarizes general observations and reflects more widely on possible future approaches to new technologies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gendreau, Ysolde (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Glenn, H.

This thesis presents a new approach to mobile robot localization that avoids the selection of landmarks and the use of an explicit model. Instead, it uses the low level primitive features from video data, and learns to convert these features into a representation of the robot pose. The conversion from video data to robot poses is implemented using a multi-layer neural network trained by back-propagation. In addition, a key aspect of the approach is the use of the confidence measure to eliminate incorrect estimate components of pose vectors, and dead reckoning to complement the neural network estimates. Finally, the approach is generalized to allow a mobile robot navigate in a large environment. Presenting a number of experimental results in several sample environments, the thesis suggests the accuracy of the technique is good while the on-line computational cost is very low. Thus, accurate localization of a mobile robot is achievable in real time.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dudek, G.

These modifications can lead to an increase in the coding efficiency and/or an improvement in the speech quality. Two different methods have been developed for this purpose. In the first approach we derive the LP parameters such that the glottal excitation model matches as closely as possible a target waveform. The latter contains slowly evolving pulses representing voiced speech excitation. The simulation results indicate that the target matching method results in an increase in the pitch prediction gain which is a measure of similarity of successive pitch pulses. The frame-to-frame variation of the LP coefficients is also lowered with respect to the conventional linear prediction analysis. In the second method, we enforce the smoothness on the evolution of LP parameters by directly including their variation in the LP error function. A novel scheme to dynamically control the contribution of this additional term is also proposed. Experiments indicate that this method can considerably reduce the fluctuation of LP parameters while the overall prediction gain of the LP filter is maintained.

A literature review was conducted to explain the use of different types of rock mass classifications, as well as different types of in situ and dilatometer testing techniques for estimating and determining of modulus of deformation in the rock. Series of in situ dilatometer tests were conducted to determine the modulus of deformation of the rock mass and to compare them with the physical properties results obtained by static and dynamic laboratory testing on core specimens. The major goal of the work presented here is to find a correlation between in situ modulus of deformation with different type of rock mass classifications, physical properties of the rock and static and dynamic modulus of elasticity determined by laboratory testing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hassani, F.

Traditionally, pixel-based techniques such as view correspondence are employed to obtain refined motion-parameter estimates between observations and a nearest-neighbour approach is used to map segmented sets of measurements to part models. Since a hard decision is made after each observation, these methods tend to fail when events such as self-occlusions, large variations in viewpoint or spurious measurements introduce ambiguity in the mapping between measurements and part models. In order to cope, the model-data association problem must be relaxed to allow multiple interpretations. This thesis addresses the data association problem as it applies to three-dimensional dynamic object modeling. By tracking the state of the part models across subsequent views, I wish to identify possible events that explain model-data association ambiguities and represent them in a Bayesian framework. Thus several association hypotheses are obtained and lead to many possible interpretations of the object's structure, each being assigned a probability. Rather than making a decision at every iteration about an ambiguous mapping, I look to the future for more information to disambiguate it. Experimental results carried out on a selection of objects are illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, Frank P.

Biological removal of iron to produce drinking water was established on one full-scale and two pilot-scale plants at two sites in France. Results show that below a minimum DO concentration of approximately 0.3 mg/L, residual iron concentration was related to ORP in the filtered water. Above the minimum DO requirement, ORP on the order of approximately 500 mV consistently reflected effective iron treatment and residual iron concentrations less than the French norm for potable water of 0.2 mg/L. Secondly, two catalytic materials of filtration known as Ferrolite MC2 and Purolite were investigated on pilot-scale for their capacity to oxidize iron and manganese. Results showed that both materials eliminated dissolved iron to below detection levels regardless of DO or filtration rates up to 15 m/h (Ferrolite MC2) and 20 m/h (Purolite). During the trial period where no filter regeneration was carried out, the elimination of dissolved iron and dissolved manganese, respectively, were 100% and 77% for Purolite and 100% and 65% for Ferrolite MC2 for a raw water with 3.47 mg/L of dissolved iron and 0.317 of dissolved manganese. Purolite filtered a total volume of 1127 L or 137 L/kg of catalytic material and Ferrolite MC2 filtered a total of 1457 L or 217 L/kg.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicell, J. A.

A theoretical model based on the convolution between a tissue matrix and a point spread function, representing respectively the RBC aggregates and the characteristics of the ultrasound system, was used to examine the influence of the scatterer shape and size toward the backscattered power. Both scatterers in the form of clumps of red blood cell aggregates and rouleaux were modeled. The simulated results were used to postulate potential scatterer shape and size leading to the "black hole" phenomenon, a hypoechoic zone observed in ultrasonic B-mode images. It is concluded that the ultrasound backscattered power does not always increase with the size of the aggregates, especially when they are no longer Rayleigh scatterers. New potential causes of the "black hole" phenomenon were also proposed based on the model, in addition to the proposals suggested by earlier researchers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cloutier, G.

One particular research area is the development of representations for the pressure-strain correlation which reliably account for the effects of solid walls with complex geometries. This thesis is a theoretical and numerical study of a fairly recent method: elliptic relaxation. There are two challenges in using this method: (1) the determination of appropriate boundary conditions for the elliptic relaxation equations, and (2) the numerical implementation of those boundary conditions in non-Cartesian geometries. In this thesis, a set of 2D boundary conditions are derived via an asymptotic analysis of the Reynolds stress transport equations through the viscous sublayer. 1D and 2D finite volume numerical models to solve two elliptic relaxation models, the k-epsilon- vv model and a Reynolds stress version, are developed. These formulations are then used to compute the steady flow through stationary and rotating plane channels, and through a plane diffuser. The results are compared with benchmark direct numerical simulation and experimental data.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hedberg, Peter (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj75t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tt809</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m167s"><dcterms:title>Entropy : a measure of process flexibility</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shuaibi, Eyas S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this research, entropy is proposed as a measure of flexibility. First, entropy is presented by tracing its origins in thermodynamics to its role in information theory. Properties of entropy that make it a suitable measure of flexibility are outlined. After that, the strategic importance of flexibility is established. Then, previous research on definitions of flexibility and different measures of flexibility are discussed, as well as entropic measures developed by other researchers. This leads to proposing a entropy as general measure of process flexibility that can be used on a dynamic basis, i.e., along a time continuum. A mathematical model is developed as well as the application of entropy within the model. A computer simulation of a job shop model is used to test the measure through a number of different scenarios. Results of the simulation show that entropy succeeds in measuring flexibility when the relative demands of products change, but is not successful when the relative demands do not change or change a little. It is concluded that entropy is a relative measure that can be used to monitor process flexibility with time, but needs to be combined with other parameters to be of more practical use.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomou, Vince (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj44b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m167s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Industrial.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
