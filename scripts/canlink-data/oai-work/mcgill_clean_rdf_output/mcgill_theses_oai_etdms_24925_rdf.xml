Two teachers and a total of 101  kindergarteners from a private kindergarten located in Taipei, the capital city of  Taiwan, were chosen for this study. Both qualitative and quantitative data were  gathered in the form of classroom observations and student and teacher interviews.  This analysis revealed that format was the literary element that students responded  to the most. However, factors such as the variance in the students' cognitive level,  age, exposure to the target language, teaching method and personality may have  affected the results. Consequently, teachers need to take into consideration other  literary elements when it comes to storybook selection. Results from this study can  be used firstly in developing criteria on how to select storybooks for young EFL  learners and how these storybooks can be integrated into the EFL classroom.  Secondly, this study can provide information to help further our understanding of  how stories motivate children in learning languages, and how stories can be  integrated into the EFL classroom. Thirdly, the data from this study can be useful  to writers and illustrators of children's books. Finally, it is hoped that this  project can also inspire other researchers in pursuing this topic for further  study.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Turner, Carolyn (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zt93f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g451</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Preschool) -- Taiwan -- Taipei</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children's stories</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3n203z74q"><dcterms:title>A rhetorical tale : neurochemistry and the efficacies of antidepressants in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cuffe, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent work in anthropology has speculated on how developments  in molecular biology and medicine might bring about new bodies, selves, and forms of  sociality. This thesis explores how herbal and pharmaceutical antidepressants  differently affect experiences of one's neurochemistry. It does so in two ways.  First, it outlines the historical 'social life' of pharmaceutical antidepressants,  including their co-production with depression, and the neurochemical body in a  particular style of reasoning in biological psychiatry. Second, it presents and  analyzes claims made for the efficacy of antidepressants made in vernacular North  American books, advertisements, and pamphlets. Although the claims for both herbal  and pharmaceutical antidepressants allude to the same realms of value---those of  science, nature/history, and personal experience---their different social lives  enable different access to the neurochemical body.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Allan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq29j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n203z74q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antidepressants -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antidepressants -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gt27h"><dcterms:title>Predicting termination from behavioral consultation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Blidner, Aron</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main objective of this study was to investigate whether  parental perceptions of the emotional, behavioral and social skills functioning of  children with conduct problems, differed for parents who completed the behavioral  consultation process (N = 40) compared to those who prematurely withdrew ( N = 11).  A series of between group analyses were conducted to examine whether parental  perceptions existed. Parents who prematurely withdrew from the behavioral  consultation process reported significantly greater incidences of anxious and  depressed behavior in children, than parents who remained in consultation F(1,49) =  4.24, p = .0448. Similarly, using the Wilks' criterion, overall estimates of  emotional and behavioral functioning, combined with social skills functioning were  also significantly affected by group membership, F(3,47) = 3.22, p = .0310. Using  the same variables in a logistic regression analysis, a test of the full model with  all three predictors compared to the constant only model was statistically reliable  phi2 (3, N = 51) = 10.26, p = .0336, indicating that the predictors, as a set,  reliably distinguished the perceptions of those who completed the consultation  process, compared to those who prematurely withdrew. This model accurately predicted  77.7% of parents' group membership. The results of the study will be discussed in  terms of their usefulness for future consultants to identify families at risk for  prematurely withdrawing from the consultation process, so that additional resources  can be offered to encourage their continued participation in the consultation  process.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sladeczek, I.

The thesis concentrates on the writings of several of the most  important intellectuals of the XVIII century who took part in the heated debate as  to the value of Calderon's work: Blas Nasarre y Ferriz, Tomas Erauso y Zabaleta,  Nicolas Fernandez de Moratin, Cristobal Romea y Tapia, Jose Clavijo y Fajardo and  Francisco Mariano Nipho. The first two chapters of the thesis deal with the way by which  the image of Calderon has been used in order to support certain ideological  convictions, in particular, a certain way of understanding Spanish national  identity. Chapter three examines the polemics itself, from its beginning in 1749  until the mid-sixties of the XVIII century.

This is typically referred to as the channel effect. In the air  gap, the detonation products behave as a piston, which drives the precursor air  shock wave ahead of the detonation. Since the shock wave runs ahead of the  detonation, it preconditions the explosive and the detonation propagates into  shocked explosive. This can affect the detonation in various ways, depending on the  nature of the explosive. Properties such as heterogeneity, porosity and sensitivity  of the explosive will determine how the precursor shock will affect the detonation  propagation. Four different coupling mechanisms have been identified and are  discussed in this thesis. They have been called: precompression, detonation  initiation, surface ignition and dead pressing. In the present study, three cases are investigated  experimentally: precompression, detonation initiation and the case where no coupling  occurs. The goal is to elucidate the respective propagation mechanisms. It is found  that boundary layers on the channel walls significantly affect the precursor shock  wave propagation. This effect is modeled and the results are compared to  experiments. When the explosive is PETN powder, the detonation is found to  accelerate to 1.5 times the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Experiments performed indicate  that this is due to precompression of the PETN. Again this effect is modeled and  compared with experiments. It is also demonstrated that in the present experiments,  coupling via initiation does not occur. However, experiments were performed to  determine why the explosive is not initiated by the precursor shock wave. It is  found that the initiation delay for the strength of precursor shock generated is  simply too long for any coupling to occur.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Higgins, Andrew J.

The panel is shown to be very rich in dynamics,  including stable flat/buckled state, limit cycle oscillation, and chaos. The  complexity of the dynamics of the panel is presented in a diagram of stability  regions, Lyapunov exponents and two bifurcation diagrams with respect to the  in-plane load and the flow velocity. Several new phenomena have been observed,  including the co-existence of multiple symmetric limit cycles and the pairing of  asymmetric limit cycles. Moreover, reduced order models of the aeroelastic system  are constructed by means of proper orthogonal decomposition. The performance of the  reduced order models with a striking low dimensionality is tested, and the reduced  order models are shown to be accurate and robust for predicting the dynamics of the  aeroelastic system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Epureanu, B.

Continuous cooling conditions were employed, with interpass times of 20--200s and  strains of 0.2 and 0.35 applied at a strain rate of 2s -1. It was observed that for similar Nb contents, the Tnr increased  with Si level, but appeared to saturate at long interpass times. In addition, high  strains also reduced the influence of Si on the Tnr. This behaviour can be  attributed to the acceleration of the Nb(C,N) precipitation kinetics by the addition  of Si. With increasing interpass time or strain, the precipitates start to coarsen  and, in consequence, the pinning effect due to precipitation is reduced. Therefore,  under these conditions, the effectiveness of Si addition in raising the Tnr is  diminished.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, John J.

The injection ratio is varied in two ways. The velocity integral  scale at the injection point is varied by changing the mandoline downstream  position. Increasing the velocity scale, ℓ₀ (i.e., increasing the mandoline  downstream position), increases the rate at which the scalar variance decays and  reduces the integral length scale of the scalar.

Total RNA and genomic DNA were  extracted from individual male adult worms of IVM-selected and unselected strains of  H. contortus. A fragment of the P-gp gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of  individual worms and RFLP analysis was performed on the PCR product to genotype the  corresponding worms. The homozygous worms that possessed polymorph A, B or X were  identified.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beech, Robin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Prichard, Roger (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b08d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp56t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drug resistance.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Haemonchus contortus.</dc:subject><dc:subject>P-glycoprotein.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ivermectin.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tp95p"><dcterms:title>Biochemical and genetic approaches to understanding the functions of the protein tyrosine phosphatase-sigma</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thibault, Stéphanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>PTP-sigma, a developmentally regulated receptor protein tyrosine  phosphatase of the LAR family, is highly expressed in the nervous system and is  involved in axon guidance. In this study, two potential substrates of PTP-sigma have  been detected by substrate trapping and two-dimensional electrophoresis. In  addition, an expression pattern of PTP-sigma in adult non-neural mouse tissues has  been established and opens new research avenues for the function of PTP-sigma. The  high levels of PTP-sigma in fat led us to look into a possible role for this enzyme  in insulin signaling. Insulin stimulated PTP-sigma knockout adipose tissue showed an  hyperphosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR). GH-deficiency is predominantly  responsible for glucose homeostasis defects of PTP-sigma knockout mice and could  mask the effect of the absence of PTP-sigma in insulin signaling in vivo. To  overcome this, adipocytes were isolated. Upon insulin stimulation of PTP-sigma  knockout adipocytes, an increase in IR and a decrease in Akt phosphorylation were  observed, suggesting that the IR could be a substrate of PTP-sigma and that  PTP-sigma could be involved in the regulation of the activation of Akt. The  elucidation of the mechanisms of action of PTP-sigma in insulin signaling may lead  to the development of new treatments in diabetes and obesity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tremblay, Michel L.

In the  nervous system of the marine mollusk Aplysia, there are only two major PKC isoforms,  the calcium-activated PKC Apl I and the calcium-independent PKC Apl II, and both  PKCs are persistently activated during intermediate memory. We monitored the  PDK-dependent phosphorylation of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II using phosphopeptide  antibodies. PDK phosphorylation of PKCs was not sensitive to inhibitors of PI-3  kinase, PKC, nor to expression of a kinase-inactive PDK. Phosphorylation of a kinase  inactive PKC was reduced, likely due to dephosphorylation. Localization of  PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II using immunocytochemistry revealed an enrichment of  phosphorylated PKC Apl II at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that increased  PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II is important for persistent kinase activation. PKC  phosphorylation at the PDK site is not affected by the presence of a kinase-inactive  form of PDK.

The fungus was grown aerobically at pH 4.5, and a temperature of 28  +/- 2°C, using a shaker speed of 100 rpm. The highest enzymatic activity was  obtained at 36 h of Mucor rouxii's growth. The protein content of Mucor rouxii was a  function of incubation time and it increased in the course of the fungal growth up  to 3 days. The enzyme was partial purified by ammonium sulfate  fractionation, followed by ion exchange chromatography using a Fast Protein Liquid  Chromatography (FPLC) System. The specific activity in the 60--85% ammonium sulfate  fraction showed higher specific activity (51.44 U/mg) and a 2.2-fold purification as  compared with that of the crude extract (24.27 U/mg). The fraction after ion  exchange chromatography step showed a specific activity of 233.65 U/mg, representing  about 7.2-fold purification compared to the crude extract. This ion exchange  fraction showed protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 45 to 75 kDa on  SDS-PAGE (12%). The enzyme showed optimal activity at a temperature of  50°C, and more than 90% of its activity was retained after 30 min incubation  at this temperature. The optimal pH activity of chitin deacetylase from Mucor rouxii  ranged from 5.5--6. The enzyme retained more than 80% of its activity in the pH  range of 4.5--8.5 after 1 h incubation at room temperature, suggesting that this  enzyme is quite stable in the slightly acidic to alkaline pH range. However, a lower  pH (&lt;4) and a higher pH (&gt;9) caused the enzyme to lose more than 60% of  its activity. It was shown that the chitin deacetylase did not require the  following metal ions (Co+2 and Mn+2) for activity. However, Mn+2 slightly increased  the enzyme activity. The activity of the enzyme was also inhibited by  EDTA.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Simpson, B. K.

We used a tropospheric chemistry box-model called  MOCCA (Model of Chemistry Considering Aerosols) coupled with a simple cloud droplet  model in the presence and absence of ozonolysis. The results obtained reinforce the  hypothesis that ozonolysis of alkenes can play a role in the sulfate production in  cloud droplets. In fact, we observed that ozonolysis could, in a situation of a high  pH, slow down the in-cloud oxidation and can possibly lead to an overall negative  impact on the in-cloud sulfate production over an average cloud lifetime.

A translation for causal networks is given  to allow for behavior of the two algorithms to be compared for the same networks,  and the comparison is discussed based on empirical results. The acausal algorithm is  seen to exhibit different, but not necessarily superior, convergence properties for  the networks tested.

The CAG  repeat (encoding glutamine) expansion is thought to confer a novel, toxic gain of  function to the protein that resulting in neuron-specific cell death. The mechanism  of cytotoxicity in these diseases is unknown, but often centers on the shared  pathological characteristic of protein aggregate formation. Recently, the  calcium-dependent enzyme transglutaminase has been implicated in aggregate formation  in several of these disorders. Cellular processes such as proteolysis, calcium  homeostasis, gene transcription, and mitochondrial function are likely affected by  polyglutamine-expanded proteins and contribute to pathogenesis. Expansion of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor leads to  the X-linked disorder spinobulbar muscular atrophy. To examine underlying disease  mechanisms we investigated the link between polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor  and transglutaminase. We found N-terminal androgen receptor fragments to be a  substrate for transglutaminase, and cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded androgen  receptor exhibited ligand-depended proteasome dysfunction. This effect was prevented  by the presence of cystamine, a transglutaminase inhibitor, suggesting involvement  of a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction in disease pathogenesis and providing a  potential basis for the development of therapies for CAG-repeat expansion  disorders.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trifiro, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8060373.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p22t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
