In most instances these areas are situated in Canada and it is here that the problems concerning the health of these birds are important. It is fairly safe to say that the major infestations by internal parasites are contracted in the breeding grounds due to the tremendous numbers of birds congregated in a comparatively small area. This is undoubtedly the case when infestations are present in young birds. Although our knowledge of the trematode parasites of these birds has been considerably increased during late years, by many publications in the United States, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the distribution of species. In order to make a contribution towards a further knowledge of the internal parasites encountered in these birds a study of the parasites collected in eastern Canada during the general survey work of the Institute of Parasitology was made. The species described in this paper were unidentified specimens present in the collection of the above mentioned Institute during the winter of 1937-38.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.

During this development, commercial improvements were stressed, and until comparatively recent times, the theoretical issues involved were largely neglected. In this field, much has been accomplished, so that a sound basis is provided for the present work. In a difficult problem such as this, complicated by the heterogeneity of wood as well as by the uncertain chemical atructures and properties of many of its constituents, close co-operation between the organic and physical chemist is desirable, and should accelerate the solution of many problems confronting the sulphite technician. The present investigation is a study of two variable conditions - temperature, and liquor composition - which influence the delignification of spruce wood in sulphite solutions. It is, therefore, a study of the mechanism and kinetics of the chemical reactions involved in the sulphite process, approached from a physico-chemical viewpoint.

The multiplicity of soluble sugars makes the problem a complicated one in any cases, and ncessitates the use of a large number of separate methods. In commercial sugar products sucrose is usually the chief constituent, and methods for its determination have been widely studied. The ordinary methods for sucrose determination are, polarimetric, densimetric, and refractometric. With the exception of the polarimetric method, these have been adapted, 'by calculation, from determinations of the total solids of the saccharine material, an appropriate correction being applied where necessary for the inorganic matter present. Each of the above methods possesses certain advantages, and it is frequently desirable to employ a second method to check the accuracy of the first one used. This can be done, however, only if it is known that by both methods comparable results can be obtained (45). Comparisons have been made of pairs of methods, and in some cases the results of analysis by three methods have been published, but there ia no record of comparisons of all the methods, using sugar solutions ot known composition as standards, with the addition of artificial ash in varying amounts to approximate natural products.

Hyperfunction of the adrenal cortex occurs in cases of adrenal cortical hyperplasia, adrenal cortical tumors, and in Cushing's Syndrome. The clinical features of Cushing's syndrome are hypertension, localized obesity, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, polycythemia and skin changes. The clinical features of the adrenogenital syndrome are sex-reversal or precocious maturity.

Delays in the progress of the cyclotron scheme led to the suggestion that some project be undertaken using naturally radioactive sources. The appearance of the work of Bohr on the nature of nuclear reactions indicated that the scattering of alpha particles by the light nuclei might be expected to provide more immediate information concerning nuclear structure than had hitherto been supposed. These considerations led the writer to select the large angle scattering of alpha particles by light nuclei as a subject for experiment. [...] Using a scattering chamber filled with hydrogen at 10 cm. pressure, designed to permit the counting of alpha particles scattered through angles up to 158¬∫, the number scattered into a given solid angle has been compared with the corresponding number from a gold target. Assuming that the latter obeyed Rutherford's law of scattering, the departures from this law in the case of the light elements could, thus, be found.

[...] The purpose of this investigation was to develop a method of fractionation which could be applied to soils and soil extracts, and which would establish the nature of some of the organic and inorganic phosphorus components present in soil. [...] It has been known for many years that the total phosphorus content of soils cannot be used as a true measure of the capacity of different soils to supply available phosphorus to plant roots. On the other hand so called availability methods do give a good indication of the fertility status of soils. This has been explained by the fact that the buffered acid extracting solutions presumably dissolve a definite group of phosphorus compounds. It is also well known that acid extracting solutions dissolve widely different amounts of phosphorus from different types of soils. There is thus good evidence that the soil phosphorus does not exist in a uniform condition. The fractionation of the various forms in which phosphorus does exist in soils, is therefore a problem of vital interest. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DeLong, W.

In the production of a good quality white pulp from wood, two main steps are involved, namely the "cooking" of the wood, and the bleaching of the raw pulp obtained. [...] Of the two main types of chemical pulps used commercially, namely, (a) acid or sulphite pulps, (prepared by heating under pressure with acid bisulphite solutions), and (b) alkaline pulps (prepared by heating under pressure with aqueous alkalies), the latter present by far the greater problem from the point of view of bleaching. Kraft pulps are especially difficult to bleach to a permanent white colour. The final colour is almost always slightly yellowish despite the fact that the "chlorine consumption" of these pulps is much larger than with sulphite and soda pulps. At this point it may be advisable to define the terms kraft and sulphate, since the careless use of these terms often leads to confusion. Sulphate pulp is produced by any alkaline  "cooking" process in which the alkali lost is replaced by the addition of sodium sulphate in the regeneration of the "spent-liquor". Kraft is a type of sulphate pulp which has been intentionally undercooked to obtain a pulp of high strength. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hibbert, H.

Fine grinding is perhaps the most significant process in any milling operation, and forms a commensurate percentage of the unit milling cost. There has been for many years a wide divergence of opinion as to what constitute best operating conditions in a grinding plant. This divergence of opinion was mainly due to a lack of suitable methods of measuring the true efficiency of fine grinding operations. The efficiency of a fine grinding or crushing operation is the ratio of the amount of useful crushing work done to the amount of work (power) applied to the crushing operation. Modern experimental technique has made it possible to measure both of these factors, and though this technique is not available to general practise, much more certain information is being obtained for use in general practise. [...] This study has led to a knowledge of the amount of work (power) absorbed in actual crushing and grinding. The measurement of the amount of useful crushing work done was a source of embarrassment to fine grinding investigators for many years. Two diametrically opposed methods were proposed, and as both were based on theoretical calculations, neither could be eliminated until practical data had been gathered and impartially interpreted.

It is not always easy, however, to interpret experimental data by the hypotheses which theories, in this branch of chemical study, propound. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Steacie, E.

The southwest corner of the township is six miles due east of the town of Amos, on the north line of the Canadian National Railway. It may be reached by a motor road that runs north from the town of Amos for about ten miles to the colonist settlement of St. Maurice de Dalquier, and thence two and a half miles east. A winter landing field for planes has been cleared on the Central Duverny property to the northeast. Purpose of the thesis.- The object of the thesis is to describe the geology of the Fontana property, with special reference to the occurrence and origin of the gold deposits of the district. The information on which the thesis is based, was collected during the writer's employment as geologist by the Fontana Gold Mlnes Ltd., extending over a period of one year. During the winter, 1938-1939, laboratory studies were carried out at McGill University. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gill, J.

Members of the older professions - medical, clerical, legal, teaching - and business men, their wives, their mothers, their daughters and sisters, meet with professional workers around conference tables, budget and are responsible for income, and give special services to particular social agencies. The term volunteer is older than the term social worker, and there is difference of opinion as to its scope. In some cities those people who serve on boards of management, restrict that designation to the younger people who have definite duties in the weekly routine of social agencies. Elsewhere it applies to both types of service. In this study it is used in the wider significance to include all those who serve one or more social agencies in any capacity, without financial remuneration.

The adjuvant may or may not have toxic qualities in itself, depending on such factors as the species of insect concerned and the meteorological conditions at the time of application. The effect which an adjuvant has upon nicotine may be due to either physical or chemical factors but more probably to a combination of both. Physically, the adjuvant may bring about more effective spreading and sticking, with greater ability to withstand cranging climatic conditions. The adjuvant may also produce a smothering effect. Chemically, as an "activator" , it may hasten the evolution of free nicotine by the reaction of the basic and acidic radicals of the soap and nicotine sulphate. An adjuvant may also act chemically by producing an affinity between itself and the surface of the solid, through chemical combination with contaminants on the surface or by dissolving protective coatings, such as wax.

At the time the treatment of the ore at this property consisted of direct cyanidation followed by flotation, the flotation concentrate being shipped by rail and water to the Tacoma Smelter of the American Refining and Smelting Co. Ltd. Since the investigation concerns itself with the extraction of gold from arsenical ores by the cyanide process, a short history of the development of the cyanide process is included, as well as a summary of previous work treating arsenic ores.

Most of these studies have been concerned with the effect of external factors, such as light, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration on the rate of photosynthesis by the plant. These studies have yielded valuable information, but the actual mechanism of photosynthesis is yet unknown; a new line of attack is necessary before the chemioal changes involved in the photosynthesis of carbohydrates by the whole plant can be elucidated because these changes are complicated by other processes, such as respiration, which are going on at the same time; furthermore, there are many substances present which do not play a direct part in the process.
