We solve this equation numerically and analytically to compute the current transmitted through the triple dot. We show that the current exhibits oscillations of period h/ne with n&gt;2 when the magnetic flux threading the ring is varied, and that under certain conditions the amplitude of the n=3 period is much larger than the amplitude of the n=2 period.

Ce processus de vieillissement naturel est long et l'industrie est présentement à la recherche de procédés non chimiques qui permettraient d'accélérer le vieillissement des grains de blé afin d'améliorer des farines de qualité supérieure rapidement après la récolte.          Dans cette étude, l'effet de vieillissement accéléré des grains fraîchement récoltés sur les propriétés physico-chimiques et thermiques des constituants de la farine a été étudié. Le vieillissement a été accéléré en exposant les grains de blé dont la teneur en eau était entre 12 et 18% (base humide), à des températures allant de 30 à 50°C pendant des périodes de temps allant de 2 à 8 jours.          La variété de blé AC Walton a été utilisée pour les essais sur le vieillissement accéléré. Les résultats ont indiqué que l'augmentation de la température et du temps de stockage ont eu pour effet de réduire les teneurs en amidon et en protéines, et que ces dernières n'avaient pas été affectées par la teneur en eau des grains de blé. De plus, les farines obtenues à partir des grains ayant subits les traitements de vieillissement accéléré ont exhibé des températures de gélatinisation supérieures à celles des farines faites à partir de grains frais non-traités. Cette étude a permis d'établir les relations mathématiques entre les paramètres (température, durée, et teneur en eau) utilisés pour accélérer le vieillissement du blé et les qualités boulangères des farines obtenues. </dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Aging of freshly harvested wheat grains for several years helps in enhancing the characteristics of flour components, thereby improving their functionality in bread making. This usual process of aging is highly time consuming, hence there is a need for an alternative process for improvement of the baking quality of flour in a shorter period of time of storage.        In this study, effect of accelerated aging of the freshly harvested grains on physico-chemical and thermal properties of the flour constituents has been studied. The aging is accelerated by storing the wheat grains at a temperature between 30˚C and 50˚C for a period of 2-8 days with moisture contents of 12-18% w.b. (wet basis).        Laboratory work on the chosen cultivar A.C. Walton was carried out. It was found that the total starch content and protein content of the flour decreased at the elevated temperatures and with longer storage periods, irrespective of the moisture content of the grains. On the other hand, the thermal properties of the aged wheat flour enhanced with the increase in the gelatinization temperature of starch, as compared to the freshly harvested grains.        Hence the effect of accelerated aging of wheat grains on the physico-chemical and thermal properties of the flour was studied. The regression model developed clearly explained the effects of the three parameters including storage temperature, moisture content of grains and duration of storage, on the baking qualities of the flour.       </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>G S Vijaya Raghavan (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2774028j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xj56f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture - Food Science and Technology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rj075"><dcterms:title>Evaluation and optimization of cranberry seed oil extraction methods</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2012</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thyagarajan, Palaniappan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'huile de graines de canneberges est une huile de qualité qui peut être mise en marché pour ses propriétés fonctionnelles "santé" issues de sa composition particulière en acides gras oméga 3, 6 et 9 et de sa forte concentration en antioxydants. Il existe peu ou pas d'information sur la teneur en huile de la graine de canneberge, cependant l'industrie alimentaire s'intéresse à l'extraction de cette huile, qu'elle effectue présentement par pressage à froid, malgré un faible rendement. Afin de palier à ce problème, une étude a débuté afin d'analyser les rendements en huile obtenus par différents procédés d'extraction dont l'ébullition à reflux, les microondes et les ultrasons.  L'ébullition à reflux améliore l'extraction en améliorant la diffusion du solvant par la chaleur, tandis que dans le cas des microondes et des ultrasons, c'est plutôt la particularité des ondes qui influencent l'extraction. Les objectifs de cette recherche ont donc visé à obtenir de bons rendements en huile avec une forte teneur en α - tocophérol. Lors des essais préliminaires, de meilleurs rendements ont été obtenus avec des graines moulues (10.11 ± 0.2%) en comparaison avec des graines non moulues (8.17 ± 0.3%), ainsi tous les essais d'extraction ont par la suite été faits avec des graines finement moulues et tamisées (1mm). L'hexane (10.2 ± 0.2%) s' est avéré plus efficace pour l'extraction qu'un mélange d'hexane: éthanol (7:3) (6.45 ± 0.1%). L'étude de l'extraction de l'huile s'est concentrée sur quatre facteurs opérationnels soit le ratio d'échantillon/solvant, la température, le temps et la puissance appliquée pour l'ébullition à reflux, et l'extraction microonde et par ultrasons.  Nos résultats ont démontré une augmentation du rendement en huile avec une augmentation du ratio échantillon/solvant à 10g/100 ml d'hexane, à une température de 70°C pour l' ébullition à reflux avec un rendement de 11.19 ± 0.1% tandis qu'avec l'extraction microonde, les meilleures conditions furent pour un ratio d'échantillon/solvant de 5g/30ml d'hexane, et une puissance de 125W, donnant une rendement en huile de 24.15 ± 0.3% à une température de 66⁰C. En comparaison, l'extraction ultrason, pour un ratio d'échantillon/solvant de 5g/30ml d'hexane, à une intensité de 150W, le rendement en huile a été de 32.35 ± 0.3%. Ainsi, les meilleurs résultats en terme de rendement en huile pour les différentes méthodes d'extraction sont classés comme suit: Ébullition par reflux &lt; Microonde &lt; Ultrason.  L'avantage de l'extraction par ultrasons fut son haut rendement en huile, pour un procédé rapide, à température peu élevée. Le rendement maximal en huile a été obtenu par l'extraction ultrason avec 1.61 g. L'analyse de la qualité de l'huile, en particulier la teneur en α - tocophérol a été effectuée par spectrophotométrie à 520 nm et les résultats ont démontrés que la teneur en α - tocophérol était grandement affectée par la température, à 70⁰C dans le cas de l'ébullition par reflux avec 0.266 ± 0.02 µg, tandis qu'avec l'extraction microonde à la puissance de 125W au ratio de 5g/30ml d'hexane, la teneur en tocophérol était de 0.346 ± 0.007 µg, tandis que pour les ultrasons, la teneur en tocophérol était de 0.428 ± 0.01 µg pour une puissance de 100W.  L'extraction par solvant, jumelée avec les microondes ou les ultrasons, libère une plus grande concentration en α - tocophérol des cellules de la plante en comparaison avec la pression à froid.  En conclusion, l'extraction par pression à froid obtient une huile de meilleure qualité que l'huile obtenue par ébullition par reflux, tandis que l'extraction par microondes et par ultrasons est fortement recommandée pour un meilleur rendement en huile et une plus haute teneur en tocophérol. </dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cranberry seed oil is a fine quality oil which can be marketed for its many beneficial functions to human health due to the presence of a unique combination of omega- 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids and the high concentration of antioxidants. Although there is no available clear data about the oil percentage of cranberry seeds in literature, an experiment was done to analyze the oil yields obtained through different processes such as heat reflux, microwave and ultrasound, both quantitatively and qualitatively. During preliminary experiments, better oil yields were obtained with ground seeds (10.11 ± 0.2%) in comparison with unground seeds (8.17 ± 0.3%) , and hence the seeds were made into a fine powder using a blender and the fine powders were separated by sieve (1mm). Hexane (10.2 ± 0.2%) was also found to be more efficient in oil extraction than Hexane: Ethanol (7:3) (6.45 ± 0.1%). The oil extraction process was based on four major operating factors namely the sample/solvent ratio, temperature, time and applied power for the heat reflux, microwave and ultrasound extraction. The results showed that the oil yield increased with an increase in sample/solvent ratio at 10g/100ml of hexane, temperature of 70⁰C in heat reflux which provided an oil yield about 11.19 ± 0.1% while in the case of microwave, best conditions were for a sample/solvent ratio of 5g/30ml of hexane, power at 125W, which gave an oil yield of 24.15 ± 0.3% maintaining the temperature at 66⁰C. In comparison, with ultrasound extraction at a sample/ solvent ratio of 5g/30ml of hexane, and a power at 150W, the oil yield was 32.35 ± 0.3%. The best yield results obtained for the tested methods for extracting oil from seeds were found and compared as: Heat reflux &lt; Microwave &lt;Ultrasound. The advantage of ultrasound was a relatively high yield over other methods with a short process time and lower process heat from the applied power. Analysis of quality in oil particularly the concentration of α - tocopherol was estimated by spectrophotometry at 520 nm and results found that α - tocopherol concentration was greatly affected by temperature at 70⁰C in case of heat reflux which retained around 0.266 ± 0.02 µg while in the case of microwave at power 125W and ratio 5g/30ml of hexane the tocopherol retained was around 0.346 ± 0.007 µg whereas in ultrasound the tocopherol was retained upto 0.428 ± 0.01 µg on applying power at 100W. The solvent extraction with hexane coupled with microwave or ultrasound energy released a greater amount of α - tocopherol from the plant matrix than for cold pressed method. For conventional cranberry seed oil extraction the cold pressed method was a better option than heat-reflux method in terms of oil quality, otherwise newer techniques such as MAE and UAE are highly recommended both in terms of increased oil yields and increased tocopherol content.   </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Valerie Orsat (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vs26f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rj075</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture - Food Science and Technology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bq26t"><dcterms:title>Suppressive activity of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in an animal model of spontaneous CD8+ T cell-mediated demyelinating disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2012</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Crystal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le laboratoire du Dr. Fournier a généré une lignée de souris (les souris L31) qui développe de façon spontanée une maladie du système nerveux central qui conduit à la perte de la gaine de myéline et qui est dépendante de la presence de lymphocytes T.

A subset of CD4+ regulatory T cells that express the transcription factor Foxp3 have been shown to regulate autoimmune responses. In order to investigate this population's role in disease development, the goal of my M.Sc research project was to functionally characterize the CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population in L31 mice.We found that regulatory T cells from L31 mice were impaired in their ability to suppress the proliferation of effector T cells in vitro. In part, this was because B7.2 (CD86) expression impeded regulatory T cell suppressive activity. However, regulatory T cells delayed the onset of neurological symptoms in vivo. Although L31 Treg are not suppressive in vitro, our in vivo data suggest that they have a regulatory function in L31 disease development.

En effet, c'est lors de cette période mouvementée que notre planète s'est pour une ultime fois libérée des conditions glaciales qui perduraient depuis des dizaines de millénaires, et souvent marquées par la présence d'imposante calottes glaciaires dans l'hémisphère nord.  Il est bien connu que ce changement climatique fut également accompagné d'un déclin sans précédent de plusieurs espèces de grands mammifères terrestres, y compris une extermination rapide et brutale du mammouth laineux.  En raison d'une diète composée en partie de végétaux provenant d'arbres prolifiques durant cette période, il y a de fortes raisons de croire que les ceux-ci auraient pu contribuer au maintien d'une faible densité forestière au sein de leur habitat.  Par conséquent, leur extinction aurait contribué à une rapide émergence d'une variété de petits arbres feuillus tant en Sibérie qu'en Béringie, provoquant par la même occasion une réduction considérable de l'albédo de surface, qui à son tour aurait entrainé une augmentation globale de la température.L'objectif visé par cette étude est de quantifier l'impact potentiel qu'aurait pu avoir une extinction majeure de la mégafaune sur le climat de la Terre, par le biais d'une modification de la carte végétale menant à une hausse de la température.  Afin d'examiner en détail la rétroaction de processus biogéophysiques à ce changement de température, nous employons le modèle de complexité intermédiaire de l'Université de Victoria (UVic) avec des scénarios plus ou moins réalistes, dont une catastrophe aux proportions exagérées servant à déterminer les limites de que peut offrir le modèle UVic.  Parmi les cas plus terre-à-terre figurent quelques tests de sensibilité menés sur des paramètres tels que le taux de déboisement des mammouths, la grandeur de leur habitat, ainsi que l'année de leur extinction.  D'autres expériences ayant été menées portent sur un étalement graduel d'un déclin des populations de mégaherbivores, ainsi qu'une simulation laissant libre cours aux échanges de carbone entre l'atmosphère et les autres constituants du système climatique, en autres mots une libre variation du niveau de CO2 dans l'atmosphère.En général, nous obtenons des résultats qui se conforment assez bien avec ceux d'études similaires.  Dans le cas d'un scénario catastrophique, nous enregistrons une baisse de l'albédo terrestre équivalent à un peu moins de 0.006, donnant lieu à une hausse de la température se chiffrant à 0.175°C globalement.  Quant aux expériences plus réalistes, les résultats en très grande majorité confirment notre intuition.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>The end of the Pleistocene marked a turning point for the Earth system, as climate gradually emerged from millennia of severe glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere. It is widely known that the deglacial climate change then was accompanied by an unprecedented decline in many species of large terrestrial mammals, featuring among others the near-total eradication of the woolly mammoth. Due to a herbivorous diet that involved the grazing of a large number of trees, their extinction is thought to have contributed to the rapid and well-documented expansion of dwarf deciduous trees in Siberia and Beringia, which in turn would have resulted in a significant reduction in surface albedo, leading to an increase in global temperature.In this study, we use the UVic ESCM to simulate various scenarios of the megafaunal extinctions, ranging from the catastrophic to more realistic cases, in order to quantify their potential impact on the climate system, and investigate the associated biogeophysical feedbacks between the growing vegetation and rising temperatures. The more realistic experiments include sensitivity tests based on the timing of extinction, tree clearance ration, and size of habitat, as well as a gradual extinction and a simulation involving free (non-prescribed) atmospheric CO2.  Overall, most of the paleoclimate simulations and the sensitivity tests yield results that correspond well with our intuition.  For the maximum impact scenario, we obtain a surface albedo increase of 0.006, which translates into a global warming of 0.175°C; these numbers are comparable in magnitude to those in similar studies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jaime Palter (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Lawrence A Mysak (Internal/Cosupervisor2)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rj08f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dh23q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Earth Sciences - Atmospheric Sciences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bn145"><dcterms:title>Leptin as a molecular modulator of neuroinflammation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2012</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Integrated Program in Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nelson, Eric</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The adipocyte derived hormone, leptin, represents an important link betweenmetabolic status and immune function and may be a contributor to the onset ofinflammatory illness.

Fatigue, a common symptom of MS, is a multidimensional concept encompassing a subjective lack of energy and fatigability i.e. a central and peripheral decline in motor performance. Reduced intracortical inhibition correlates with greater self-reported fatigue in MS patients but whether it relates to central and peripheral fatigability is unknown. The project's purpose was to determine the contribution of reduced intracortical inhibition to the different fatigue dimensions among MS patients. The project also explored if MS patients have lower levels of intracortical inhibition than healthy controls after controlling for size of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Intracortical inhibition, the predictor variable in the regression analyses, was measured in 31 right-handed patients with relapsing-remitting MS using two TMS methods (short-interval intracortical inhibition ratios and contralateral silent periods) over the primary motor cortex representation of the right first dorsal interosseus muscle. The outcome variables were as follows: a) Self-reported fatigue as reported on a Rasch-analyzed composite fatigue scale, b) central fatigability, the latency for the motor threshold to return to baseline and the reduction in MEPs after a maximal contraction task, and c) peripheral fatigability, the decline in muscle electromyographic signal post exercise. Intracortical inhibition in MS patients was also compared to healthy controls after controlling for MEP size in a regression analysis. Among MS patients, intracortical inhibition did not predict self-reported fatigue, ps &gt; .37. Intracortical inhibition also did not correlate with central or peripheral motor fatigability, ps &gt; .20. Small MEPs were related to greater short-interval intracortical inhibition ratios (or less inhibition), r = -0.41, p &lt; .02. However, MS patients showed normal levels of intracortical inhibition even without controlling for MEP size, ps &gt; 0.08. Intracortical inhibition may not be the underlying cortical hyperactivity in MS patients with high fatigue. Lower levels of intracortical inhibition also do not lead to greater central and peripheral motor fatigability. The effect of small MEPs on intracortical inhibition should be controlled by stimulating at a higher intensity relative to the motor threshold among MS patients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lisa Koski (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tc94w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx47m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Neuroscience </dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hd502"><dcterms:title>The interrelationship among maternal infection, folate and vitamin B12 status, and offspring growth in Indigenous Panamanians</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2012</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Williams, Brock</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Interrelationship among Maternal Infection, Folate and Vitamin B12 Status, and Offspring Growth in Indigenous Panamanians.
