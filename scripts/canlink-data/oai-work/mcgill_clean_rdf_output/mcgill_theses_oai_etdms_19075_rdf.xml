It is shown that the back-scattering coefficients of metal discs of radii one to six to wavelengths can be measured with considerable accuracy using a lens thirty-three wavelengths in diameter. Backscattering by circular cylinders also is discussed. Perturbations of the back-scattered fields, due to diffraction by the finite lens aperture are evaluated theoretically. Two new features of the diffraction fields associated with lenses are explained: the field in the plane of a circular aperture, due to incident spherical waves, is predicted by an empirical equation; the field near the surface of a dielectric lens is explained qualitatively. Investigations on an isotropic artificial dielectric, and on a lens constructed from it, are described.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.

The spectra of the radio frequency and the audio frequency noises corresponded.

Out of the increased need for knowledge of such structural functional relationships has grown the branch of histological study known as histochemistry. Its researches are dedicated to the development of new and useful chemical, physical and biological techniques which may be applied at the cellular or tissue level for the elucidation of such varied functions as, for example, enzyme action, secretion, or reproduction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.

No extensive study on the growth rate of the Arctic char has been found, nor has growth been the subject of more than superficial attention in the small number of works discovered which have dealt with it. Migratory habits have been discussed more frequently, but observers have not been sufficiently long at one place to observe extensively the migratory movements of a single population.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stanley, J.

In 1952 several proposed methods of evaluating comparative yield trials were compared with the "Standard Method" presently in use at Macdonald College. Inconsistent exceptions precluded the possibility of separating varieties into three distinct classes according to their green yield ranks, with the object of eliminating the class with the lowest yield. A "Whole Ear Method" in which unchopped ears were sampled was of comparable accuracy to the "Standard Method" of harvesting. "Methods of Combining Green Plant Materials" and the "Standard Method" produced comparable data; complications of field operation inherent in the former methods preclude their extended use. It may not be necessary to samp1e every replication for percentage dry matter estimations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brawn, R. I.
