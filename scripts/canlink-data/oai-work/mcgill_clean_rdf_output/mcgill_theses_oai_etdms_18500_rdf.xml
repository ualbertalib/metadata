On that circumference Fenneman placed climatology, biogeography, commercial geography, political geography, mathematical geography, and physiography (geomorphology); all of which overlapped, in both data and techniques, the territories of related disciplines. If geography consisted of no more than an aggregate of these peripheral subjects, said Fenneman, it would have little right to exist.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baird, P.

The results show that the instrument is suitable for the routine analysis of gas samples. In addition, the relative abundances of the two stable isotopes of potassium were determined and found to be in agreement with accepted values. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watson, H.

The area, which covers about 400 square miles, lies in the north central part of the province. The city of Truro, with a population slightly in excess of 12,000, is situated in the approximate centre of the map-sheet. Cobequid Bay, an eastward extension of the Bay of Fundy, divides the western half of the mapped area into north and south parts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, T.

Extensive measurements of burning velocity of propane air mixtures over the range of initial temperatures of 0 to 640 Â°C have been made with burners of several lengths and diameters. Prediction of relative burning velocity values on the basis of the simplified thermal and diffusion theories was made.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mordell, D.
