The basic principles of Plastic Design are presented, illustrating the formation of plastic ''hinges", and their rotational properties. The beam line method for semi- rigid connections, originated by C. Batho, is shown, and a theory presented using this beam line to find the required semi- rigid connection which will transfer the hinge rotation from the beam to the connection. Experiments are described in which this theory was verified. Two connections were tested to obtain their moment-rotation characteristics. Then two statically indeterminate structures using the same types of connections were tested to demonstrate that all plastic hinges formed at the same load. Finally, the advantages of this method are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>De Stein, J.

In reality there are two questions, but the latter grows out of the former if the former receives an affirmative answer. Even if the question about authenticity were to receive a negative answer, the investigator would find it necessary to account for the saying, its meaning, and intention, though of course these would not then be ascribed to Jesus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Johnston, G.

W. T. The seismic investigations were a part of a continuing, comprehensive, Arctic research program directed by the Polar Continental Shelf Project (P.C.S.P.). The P.C.S.P. was created by a Federal Cabinet directive in 1959 and is a division of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys. The seismic operations in the summer of 1960 were of a preliminary and reconnaissance nature designed to measure the thickness of the sedimentary section in as many localities as possible and to lay the foundations for detailed investigations in following years.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saull, V.

Furthermore, it has been shown that estrogen induces great increases in the serum lipid. This increase in large measure represents an increase in phospholipid and it is associated with an increase in serum phosphoprotein, which is also evoked by estrogen. It is further known that estrogen induces great increases in the level of the serum calcium especially of the non-diffusible traction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Common, R.

This is done within the framework of a static, cut-off theory. It is round that this potential corresponds to that which would be obtained by an appropriate selection of terms in the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation series solution. The transcendental equation for the potential thus formed is then solved exactly; and this is compared with the one-meson- exchange potential of ordinary perturbation theory.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sharp, R.

When the same author or authors published two or more papers in the same year, to avoid confusion, the papers are indicated in their order of publication by adding to the year small letters of the alphabet. Thus Moore, Sandberg and Watne published two papers in 1960. The first is listed as Moore, Sandberg and Watne (1960 a), and the second as Moore, Sandberg and Watne (1960 b).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, D.
