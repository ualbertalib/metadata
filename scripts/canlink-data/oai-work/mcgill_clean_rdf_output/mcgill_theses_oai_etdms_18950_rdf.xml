The older picture, based on the anatomical findings of Cajal and on the Sherrington reflex, was that signals from the receptors made their way to the cortex via the well-defined sensory pathways, were then sorted out as by an immense switchboard, and if they had a clear route continued through to the motor system. The problem of learning was to discover the laws whereby the connections of the hypothetical switchboard became changed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.
