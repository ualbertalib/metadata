The method relies on special video hardware capable  of simultaneously generating low-speed, high-resolution frames and high-speed,  low-resolution frames. The algorithm follows an estimate-and-correct approach, in  which a high-resolution estimate is first produced by translating the pixels of the  high-resolution frames produced by the camera with respect to the motion dynamic  observed in the low-resolution ones. The estimate is then compared against the  current low-resolution frame and corrected locally as necessary for consistency with  the latter. This is done by replacing the wrong pixels of the estimate with pixels  from a bilinear interpolation of the current low-resolution frame. Because of their  longer exposure time, high-resolution frames are more prone to motion blur than  low-resolution frames, so a motion blur reduction step is also applied.

Mathematically, the PIST method is a new iterative  technique for solving eigenvalue problems. It gives both eigenvalues and  eigenfunctions within a prescribed eigenvalue spectrum. The method requires storing  only a small number of vectors but allows one to calculate eigenvalues and  wavefunctions with far fewer matrix-vector products than the conventional Lanczos  method used for solving eigenvalue problems. We present here a numerical solution of  the scalar Helmholtz wave equation using the PIST technique in solving the  associated eigenvalue problem. In this work, we first convert the scalar Helmholtz wave  equation to an eigenvalue problem: we use the basis function expansion method, i.e.  by expanding the unknown electrical field function in a complete set of orthogonal  basis functions, the differential equation can be converted to a matrix eigenvalue  equation. The propagation constants and mode field distributions can be obtained  from the solution of the corresponding matrix eigenvalue problem. The method can handle any type of eigenvalue spectrum, in  particular if the eigenvalue spectrum contains only one guided mode. Furthermore the  algorithm can give distinct orthogonal eigenfunctions associated with degenerate  propagation constants. We have written a user-friendly and modularized computer  program. The program can handle arbitrary index profiles and geometrical shapes by  merely changing the input files that describe the index profile. The method proves  to be efficient, versatile, and requires less memory than popular finite difference  and finite element methods. We show examples of its application for optical waveguide  modeling in finding the propagation constants and mode field distributions of  various waveguides and couplers. For couplers, the method can give the global  evolution of the electrical field.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chen, Lawrence R.

These solutions were found in very good agreement with the  available high order conical flow solutions obtained by Carafoli, Mateescu, and  Nastase.

This subject is of great interest in the polymer  industry, since MWD affects the processing and final properties of polymers, and gel  permeation chromatography (GPC), normally used for determining MWD, has several  limitations. There are two main types of method for inferring the MWD from  rheological data. The first one involves empirical transformations that lead  directly to a MWD, whereas the second type involves the inversion of an integral  that gives the relaxation modulus G(t) of a polydisperse polymer in terms of its  MWD. A comparison of the reliabilities of these methods for use with samples having  a wide variety of polydispersities is lacking, especially for materials with high  polydispersities. This study presents a comparison of the MWD predictions of four of  these techniques in terms of their performance with groups of HDPEs, LLDPEs and  polypropylenes having polydispersities from two to six and various molecular  weights. It was found that the viscosity transform (as modified by Wood-Adams) and a  modified time-dependent diffusion reptation model proposed by des Cloizeaux (TDD-DR  model) are, to a certain extent, satisfactory methods for use with polymers having  moderate to high polydispersities, whereas the modulus transform is reliable only  for narrow distributions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dealy, John M.

It also records a significant subsolidus overprint due to circulation of  post-magmatic fluids. Annite, the ferrous-iron-dominant member of the biotite  series, represents up to 20% of the typical nepheline syenites. Hand samples cover the complete range of freshness, from  unaltered to hydrothermally modified rocks. Identification of minerals and  estimation of their abundances and compositions were obtained with optical  microscopy and electron-microprobe analysis. I also used a combined approach of  X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron  microscopy. With respect to annite composition, Fe/(Fe + Mg) varies from  0.74 (porphyntic nepheline syenite) to 0.98 (poikilitic nepheline syenite).  Concerning the habit of annite, the melt composition controls the order of  crystallization, which then in turn controls whether the annite is bladed and  skeletal or oikocrystic. The rock from the Poudrette dyke is a hypersolvus nepheline  syenite in which the bladed annite was a liquidus phase; therefore, the order of  crystallization was "normal" (mafic mineral first), whereas in poikilitic  nepheline syenite, this order was reverse. The proportion of Ti decreases with  Fe/(Fe + Mg), whereas that of Mn increases; F and Cl contents are very low in spite  of their availability. The application of n-alkylammonium cation exchange reveals the  presence of planar structural defects as a result of dehydrogenation-type reactions.  The annite records the results of oxidation during cooling, i.e., open-system  behavior in this degassing pluton.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hj71h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096770s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mineralogy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs29w"><dcterms:title>Dechlorination of environmentally recalcitrant chlorinated aromatic compounds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yuan, Tao, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chlorinated aromatic compounds are an important group of  compounds.

It is largely unknown which particular genes involved in tumor  progression require SMAD4 for their transcriptional regulation. Smad4-/- murine  fibroblasts were shown to display normal growth inhibition in response to TGF-beta  and we hypothesized that in Smad4-/- tumors there are as yet unidentified  physiological targets of Smad4 involved in tumor progression. A cDNA microarray was  performed on Smad4+/+ and -/- murine fibroblasts with and without TGF-beta  stimulation in order to identify genes that were deregulated in the absence of  Smad4. Several potential novel targets were identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and  Northern analysis. Consistent with the role of Smad4 as a tumor suppressor, when  Smad4 is inactivated, fibroblasts appear to present with an increase in factors that  enhance angiogenesis and a decrease in factors that inhibit the degradation of the  extracellular matrix. This could potentially lead to an increased vascularization of  tumors and an augmentation of metastatic ability.

The optimal temperatures for  biocatalysis were determined to be 37.5¬∞C for Lipase N, and 55¬∞C for  Lipozyme IM and Novozym 435; the optimum agitation speed was 100 rpm. Using Lipase  N, maximum hydrolysis of 1.66 mumol free fatty acids/mL was obtained after 1.5 days  of incubation, while with Lipozyme IM, maximum hydrolysis of 8.1 and 8.5 mumol free  fatty acids/mL was obtained after 1 and 4 days, respectively. With Novozym 435, the  highest hydrolysis of 4.0 and 6.1 mumol free fatty acids/mL were found after 2 and 9  days, respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kermasha, Selim (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kk21q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150j84n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lipase.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phenols.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Esterification.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Food -- Biotechnology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipids in human nutrition.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f886d"><dcterms:title>The expression of CDP/Cux in mammals /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Poirier, Madeleine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Knowing the tissues, cells, and sub-cellular compartments where  a protein is expressed can provide important insights about its biological and  physiological roles. CDP/Cux is a transcription factor that is proteolytic processed  as cells progress from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. With the aim of  investigating CDP/Cux expression in tissues and in tissue culture cells, I  characterized a panel of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against various  regions of the protein. I established an immunohistochemistry assay and demonstrated  that CDP/Cux is expressed in certain epithelial cells in several tissues. Using the  technique of immunofluorescence I studied the localization of CDP/Cux proteins  throughout the cell cycle. I obtained results suggesting that CDP/Cux isoforms may  localize to different compartments during S phase. Finally, using 3 different  antibodies, I showed that cathepsin L, the potential protease that cleaves CDP/Cux,  may translocate to the nucleus during progression through the cell  cycle.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nepveu, Alain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g571b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f886d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv935361x"><dcterms:title>Understanding the role of atypical antipsychotic medication from the patients' perspective : a cross-sectional survey comparing risperidone and olanzapine on subjective dimensions of outcome Brent M.

The Java Virtual Machine Specification of valid bytecode is much  less restrictive than the Java Language Specification of valid Java source programs.  For example, bytecode has unstructured control flow, loose local typing, and few  restrictions on method modifiers. By contrast, the Java language has highly  structured control flow, strong local typing, and many restrictions on its method  modifiers. The goal of this thesis was to build a tool that could correctly  decompile the widest range of verifiable Java bytecode back into compilable Java  source. This includes bytecode coming from other source languages, bytecode that has  undergone certain types of obfuscation, and optimized bytecode. To accomplish this  goal we created the Structure Encapsulation Tree data structure and a set of new  decompiling algorithms. The algorithms fall into three categories: regular control flow,  exceptional control flow, and idioms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, L.

The HHP treatment caused 10 to 20% denaturation of lysozyme  whereas microwave irradiation caused 20 to 40% denaturation, with more destruction  to the lysozyme in the presence of glucose compared to the control. The extent of  glycation was also higher with the high pressure samples, causing 60% glycation upon  8 hours of high pressure exposure, but decreasing to around 40% thereafter.  Microwave irradiation brought about 40% glycation to the lysozyme samples upon 20  min of irradiation. BSA, on the other hand, was more susceptible to damage by high  energy exposures. BSA samples were denatured to a greater extent compared to  lysozyme, up to 80% upon the prolonged exposures, but in all treatments, glucose  seemed to act as a protectant contrary to the case of lysozyme. The extent of  glycation detected was also minimal, ranging from 8 to 20%. The feasibility of analyzing glycated proteins using  pyrolysis-GC/MS was also investigated. Taking advantage of the formation of a  diagnostic marker---2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one---upon  pyrolysis of glycated proteins, the intensity of this peak was used to correlate the  extent of glycation. The intensity of this peak in the pyrograms of glycated  lysozymes was found to increase linearly with increasing incubation times and  subsequently with the sugar loads of the glycated lysozyme. In addition, using the  pyrograms as unique fingerprints, the extent of structural changes between modified  and unmodified proteins were also assessed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yaylayan, V. A.

Points-to  analysis is a technique for computing this information that has been studied  extensively over the last decade. Most of this research has focused on points-to  analyses for C. The behaviour of points-to analysis on higher-level languages such  as Java appears very different than on C. Moreover, most proposed points-to analysis  techniques were evaluated in disparate analysis systems and benchmarks, making it  difficult to compare their effectiveness. To address these issues, this thesis introduces SPARK, a  flexible framework for experimenting with points-to analyses for Java. S PARK is  intended to be a universal framework within which different points-to analyses can  be easily implemented and compared in a common context. Currently, SPARK supports  equality- and subset-based analyses, variations in field sensitivity, respect for  declared types, variations in call graph construction, off-line simplification; and  several points-to set propagation algorithms. A substantial study of factors affecting precision and  efficiency of points-to analyses has been performed as a demonstration of SPARK in  action. The results show that SPARK is not only flexible and modular, but also very  efficient compared to other points-to analysis implementations. Two client analyses that use the points-to information are  described, call graph construction and side-effect analysis. The side-effect  information can be encoded in Java class file attributes, so that, it can later be  used for optimization by other compilers and virtual machines. SPARK has been demonstrated to be a flexible and efficient  framework for Java points-to analysis. Several experiments that could be performed  with it are suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462611b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dm961</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zx12k"><dcterms:title>The solar cycle as a possible modulator of ecosystem functioning on the decadal time scale : new evidence from North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) feeding scars and climatic data</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Klvana, Ilya</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) feeding scars on  trees were used as an index of past porcupine abundance in the Bas St. Laurent  region of eastern Quebec, Canada. The frequency distribution of scars revealed that  porcupine populations have fluctuated regularly over the past 130 years in the Bas  St. Laurent region, with superimposed periodicities of 11 and 22 years. This  porcupine population cycle has closely followed the 11 and 22-year solar activity  cycles. An analysis of local temperature and precipitation data revealed a close  relationship between fluctuations in annual precipitation and both the solar cycle  and the porcupine cycle. These results suggest that the solar cycle has sufficiently  important effects on the climate along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence  estuary to influence terrestrial ecosystem functioning to the point of setting the  rhythm of porcupine population fluctuations. This is the strongest available  evidence of a top-down cascading effect of solar variability on ecological systems  at the decadal time scale and local spatial scale. These results confirm and extend  those obtained by others at greater temporal and spatial scales and provide exciting  opportunities for future research on the extensively debated topic of solar  variability and its impact on our planet.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berteaux, Dominique (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc445.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx12k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>North American porcupine -- Climatic factors -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Bas-Saint-Laurent.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rodent populations -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Bas-Saint-Laurent.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Climatic changes -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Bas-Saint-Laurent.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Solar cycle.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mg10p"><dcterms:title>Chemokine receptors on airway epithelial cells and their potential role in regulating mucin production</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kontolemos, Mario</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Chemokines, small molecular weight chemotactic cytokines, are  produced mostly by airway epithelial cells and are known to play an instrumental  role in the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Studies have documented a dramatic  increase in the chemokine levels in the airways of asthmatics and many other studies  have shown the induction of these chemokines by cytokines and growth factors in  airway epithelial cells in vitro. Thus, given the high levels of chemokines in  asthmatic airways and abundant evidence supporting strong interactions between  cytokines and epithelial cells, we hypothesized that chemokine receptors are present  on airway epithelium, and that chemokines may act through these receptors to  increase mucin production. Here we demonstrate constitutive expression of chemokine  receptors CCR3, CCR5 and CXCR4 in the A549 cell line by Western blot and  RT-PCR. The results of this study show that chemokine receptors are  present on airway epithelial cells and that chemokines may act as a stimulus for  epithelial cell mucin gene expression. Our novel finding that several CC chemokines  upregulate the expression of MUC5AC mRNA might be an important mechanism regulating  airway epithelial cell phenotype and function under conditions of inflammation in  asthma.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamid, Qutayba (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf246.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg10p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g8169"><dcterms:title>On the geometric layout of graphs : complexity and approximation results</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kitching, Matthew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the expanding computer science field of Graph Drawing,  methods are developed to draw graphs in order to fulfill certain criteria, including  minimizing the number of edges that need to be removed to make a drawing planar.
