When this reaction is applied to the determination of copper, it provides a very sensitive method that can detect, and measure accurately, concentrations as low as 0.1 µ.g. of copper. For this particular determination, the dithiocarbamic acid derivatives function as the reagent. It should be possible, however, to apply the same reaction to the determination of dithiocarbamio acid derivatives by using the copper component as the reagent. If the determination was limited to the dithiocarbamic acids as such the method would have little biological value since these acids do not seem to occur in nature. But since amines can be converted into the corresponding dithiocarbamic acids, and these in turn into the brown coloured copper complexes, the reaction could become a measure of the amines. The amino acids, having the characteristic amino group, should possess this property of amines. One of the important applications of the determination of copper is in relation to the keeping quality of foods. Milk powder was given special attention because of its increasing importance as a food. It is generally agreed that concentrations of copper of the order of 10 p.p.m. will favour the development of off-flavours in milk powder in a relatively short time. It is recognized also that varying amounts of copper may be introduced into the milk [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

The electrons travel through two cavities which are resonant to an electrical oscillation having a wave-length of 10.7 cm. Simple radar equipment is used to generate a peak power of 110 kilowatts which comes in a pulse lasting one micro-second and occurs one thousand times per second. With one-half of the power dissipated in each resonator, the resulting electric field strength is 92,000 volts/cm. over a distance of 2.5 cm. The maximum voltage across the accelerating gap is 2.5 x 92,000 volts. Owing to the time taken in traversing this 2.5 cm. gap, the electrons acquire 36% of this voltage in the first cavity and 56% in the second. The highest possible efficiency, which occurs when the electrons are travelling at almost the velocity of light, is 90%. This method of accelerating electrons is readily adaptable to 30 or 40 resonators which, when supplied with a total power of 2 1/4 megawatts, might be expected to yield 7 Mev. electrons. The entire wave-guide system would not exceed 12 feet in length.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

This method was first successfully applied by Van de Graaff. The large voltage involved leads to an obvious difficulty of insulation which results in extremely bulky and expensive equipment for voltage outputs of only several million volts. This insulation difficulty has been overcome in two ways. One method is to enclose the equipment of high potential in a container, which is then either evacuated or filled with freon at high pressure. That has been applied by Herb at the University of Wisconsin, ( ) and resulted in a condensed version of the Van de Graaff, entirely enclosed in a tank 20’ long 5 1/2’ diameter, but developing a voltage difference of over 2 M.E.V. The second method is to eliminate the high voltage involved by giving the ions a large number of relatively small increments of energy. The simplest device of this second type makes use of a number of hollow cylinders arranged in a straight line, and connected alternately to opposite poles of a high frequency oscillator. [...] It was therefore decided to investigate the problems connected with a Linear Electron Accelerator, consisting of a number of Resonant Cavities coupled to a wave guide, and suitably phased for an electron to acquire energy each time it crosses the gap of a Cavity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

The correlation of microbial growth factors with animal vitamins was a recent development. Indeed, as recently as 1936, B.C.J.G. Knight (15) stated, “It is not unlikely that some of the animal vitamins may be required by bacteria, but at present it has not been shown that any pure animal vitamin is required as an essential nutrient by any”. The work covered in this thesis concerns itself with one vitamin, namely, riboflavin. At first it was proposed to investigate the use of waste materials as substrates for the bacterial synthesis of riboflavin. However, four years elapsed before the work was completed and chemically synthesized riboflavin had become very cheap. The commercial production of riboflavin from waste materials was, therefore, considered unfeasible. Nevertheless, the investigation was continued and many strains of riboflavin synthesizing bacteria were isolated. Methods for the fluorometric and microbiological assay of riboflavin were applied to bacterial cultures. Riboflavin concentrates have been prepared from some of these cultures. At the same time species of bacteria which required riboflavin for growth and some of the conditions for the synthesis of riboflavin by Vibrio perimastix were investigated.

Of these, 666 exhibited a strong fumigant effect, while the difluoro analogue rapidly lost its toxicity. In compounds having two phenyl groups para substitution in both phenyl radicles is essential for high toxicity. No other halogen can replace the chlorine atoms on the phenyl groups and still leave the compound with a high residual toxic effect. There is a suggestion of an inverse relationship between toxicity and the length of the para-substituted radicles, with alkoxy and alkyl substitutions.

This has resulted in the development, in recent years, of special techniques for obtaining and analyzing experimental results. In particular, there has been great improvement in experimental designs, to which modern statistical methods may be applied in a satisfactory manner. While some statistical techniques have long been recognized as valuable in the reduction of large masses of data to comprehensible form, it has been only recently that exact methods of treating small numbers of observations have been worked out. Most biological data is of the latter sort. The methods have been found of great value in agricultural investigations, while notable improvements have been made in the field of biological assay. The difficulties which are encountered in biological assay are multiplied many times when the responses used are “subjective” rather than “physical.” Such is the case when panels of judges are used in assessing the quality of foodstuffs.

To the neurosurgeon, in planning and executing an excision of cortex, it becomes a matter of paramount importance. He wants to know what areas can be removed without affecting speech, and if known speech areas have to be removed, what the chances of recovery will be. Dr. Wilder Penfield has accumulated, since his arrival at McGill University, a unique series of cases in which he has performed cortical excisions for the treatment of focal epilepsy. These cases form the basis of this study. Most of the information has been obtained from the hospital records of the patients. Eleven cases reported here were seen and followed by the author.

To-day this industry has ceased to be merely an alternative source of rubber, and has achieved the status of a major industry with an annual capacity of one million tons. The maintenance of this position, in a peace time economy, depends on its ability to produce a low cost product with properties approaching or surpassing those of natural rubber. The properties of the present GR-S type synthetic rubber, are mainly controlled by the action of the chain transfer agents or modifiers used in its production. These modifiers act to control the physical properties of the polymer through the medium of regulating the chain length and the chain length distribution, i.e. the homogeneity of the polymer. In the absence of such control, a product would be produced containing much insoluble material of the cross-linked type, which is difficult to process and some low molecular weight polymer which lacks mechanical strength, along with the desirable medium-high molecular weight product. It is the purpose of this investigation to study some of the possible causes of this anomalous behaviour of tertiary hexadecyl mercaptan.

It was not until the first half of the Nineteenth Century that the gonads were recognized as being ductless glands, and capable of secreting a substance into the blood-stream. That the testis is normally the main source of the androgenic substance in man and other animals was first indicated experimentally by Berthold in 1849 (4). He removed the testis of four roosters and replaced one testis in an unusual abdominal position in each of two capons. He killed these two capons six months later and found that because of the testicular grafts, “these animals remained male in regard to voice, reproduction, instinct, fighting spirits, and growth of comb and wattles”.

It was found that urgencies variously growing out of Montreal’s cultural bifurcation, the social and horizontal mobility of the population type of the area , and its intermediary class position reinforced by ecological factors have tended to isolate a smaller sub-area with a somewhat less homogeneous population, creating thereby an institutional gap. With regard to the adolescents mainly involved this came to approximate a “wrong side of the track” situation. Actual experience of discrimination and conscious rejection by differentiated individuals of the institutional facilities of the superordinate group resulted in segregation and gave rise to the typical adolescent delinquent gang and to emancipation of its members from traditional moralities. It is felt that this study to some extent may show how delinquent patterns become established in contrast to the many and exhaustive studies of the transmission of delinquent patterns in areas where this kind of behavior and attitudes are traditional.

While control of the insect by trapping the larvae in tree bands had been practiced since 1846 (Slingerland, 1898), it was only about the time of Fletcher’s appointment that the use of poison sprays for the control of this insect had become well established. From the time of his earliest reports, he recommends both methods of control. The available records indicate that for awhile after the turn of the century the codling moth markedly decreased in importance as an apple pest, following the use of bordeaux-arsenical sprays in the Annapolis valley. About 1924 it apparently started increasing in importance so that by 1930 it again became a major pest in a few restricted areas, particularly that around Berwick. In 1927 Brittain (1927) was still able to say that, “The control of the codling moth is not the problem in Nova Scotia that it is in many other apple growing sections and the ordinary sprays or ousts, applied immediately after blossom fall and again in two weeks time, are usually sufficient to keep it in control”. By 1937, however, it threatened to make commercial apple growing impracticable in a few orchards in the Berwick area unless special methods of control were used against it. Until the present project was started in 1939, no special biological study of this insect had been made in the Annapolis valley[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.

The bicarbonate ion is under respiratory control, but the other electrolytes, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and sulphate are regulated by the kidney. Maintenance of normal plasma values of the various ions is an indication of the degree of success attained by the regulatory mechanisms of the kidney (129). Intracellular fluids are in osmotic equilibrium with the extracellular fluids. Sodium is the dominant kation of the extracellular fluids, while potassium is the chief cellular base. The degree of hydration in the two main divisions of body water depends upon the relative proportions of sodium and potassium. The water of the body is in a dynamic state, in which an exchange of water freely occurs across cell membranes to meet the exigencies of the continually occurring processes of metabolism (425, 74, 315). A historical review of the literature concerning the role played by the endocrine glands in the metabolism of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium and phosphorus follows in the next section.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selye, H.

In clinical psychological work, especially in diagnostic testing, it is often useful to have a rough idea of the mental age of a patient. This can be obtained from the Stanford-Binet (1937) Vocabulary List, for which mental age equivalents are available. However, one of the tests most commonly administered in a diagnostic situation, the Wechsler-Bellevue Adult Scale, includes a vocabulary subtest, but this does not yield mental ages*, and one would have to administer the Stanford-Binet Vocabulary Test as well. This procedure is time consuming for the psychologist and undesirable from the patient’s point of view. A mentally ill person usually does not enjoy mental tests, and two tests that to the patient appear practically the same may irk and irritate him unnecessarily. To circumvent the above difficulty scores on the Stanford-Binet Vocabulary could be estimated from those on the Wechsler-Bellevue Vocabulary, provided the two tests had a sufficiently high correlation. This paper offers a comparison between the Wechsler-Bellevue Vocabulary and the (1937) Stanford-Binet Vocabulary; it also supplies a table for estimating scores on the latter from scores on the former. Also, an attempt was made to gauge roughly the equivalence of the two tests, since it would be useful to know to what extent they could be interchanged for purposes of retest and follow up studies.

An examination of the variety of substances required to serve these purposes reveals that the subject matter concerning nutrition may be resolved into four main categories: (1) the mineral elements that are necessary to sustain growth and how they effect certain physiological processes to which bacterial cells are known to be subjected; (2) the trace elements that are required in the substrate; (3) the part played by growth factors; (4) the requirements for organic carbonaceous and nitrogenous compounds.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray, P.

One is the increasing interest in the adult toad since Hogben (‘30) has established the usefulness of Xenopus as a human pregnancy test animal. Many investigators since that time have elaborated on this discovery, among them Weisman (‘38), Elkan_(‘38), Landgrebe (‘39), et al.; the information on the clinical aspects of the adult toad has recently been summarized by Weisman and Coates (‘44). Secondly, detailed work on the embryology of the tadpole has been justified in view of the truly remarkable developmental and morphological deviations in the larva from so-called “typical” Anuran characteristics, especially as regards the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems. So unique are the peculiarities of the Xenopus tadpole, that the latter, from an academic viewpoint, becomes one of the most interesting vertebrate forms. No previous exhaustive work on the larva is on record. [...] Both Bles and Dreyer failed to recognize the extraordinary singularity of the morphology of the late larva of Xenopus, and a great many statements in their papers remain of purely speculative character. In the present report, the embryonic period of Xenopus laevis is described in the form of standard tables of normal development. Larval development has arbitrarily been divided into four phases; each of these, beginning and terminating with the appearance of certain characteristic external features (Table I), is separately discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berrill, N.

Treatment of this compound with strong hydrockloric acid yields a new sulphonium salt, for which a tentative structure has been proposed.
