One issue of importance is that an increase in the muscle-to-electrode distance (MEdist) acts as a low-pass filter, filtering out the high frequency components of the EMG power spectrum (the MEdist filter). Due to the numerous factors which can influence the EMGdi, control of signal quality is also of utmost importance. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the effect of the MEdist filter on EMGdi, as measured with a multiple array esophageal electrode, (2) to take advantage of the MEdist filter in order to locate the position of the diaphragm with respect to the electrodes, and (3) to evaluate the influence of changes in chest wall configuration on EMGdi center frequency (CF) values, while controlling for both signal quality and the MEdist filter. Five normal male subjects performed static contractions of the diaphragm at seven predetermined chest wall configurations. The EMGdi was measured with an array of eight steel rings mounted on a catheter, forming seven sequential pairs of electrodes, with an interelectrode distance of 10 mm. EMGdi signal quality was evaluated by computer algorithms. The pair of electrodes whose EMGdi signals (and power spectrums) were the least influenced by the MEdist filter was assumed to be closest to the diaphragm. The results of the study indicated (1) EMGdi power spectrums and their associated CF values were strongly affected by the position of the diaphragm with respect to the multiple array esophageal electrode. CF decreased by approximately 1 Hz per mm displacement away from the diaphragm. (2) By controlling for the MEdist filter, there was no relationship found between changes in chest wall configuration and CF values. These data demonstrate that changes in chest wall configuration, and hence diaphragm length, do not influence the CF values of the EMGdi, if the distance between the electrodes and the diaphragm and signal quality are controlled for.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grassino, Alex (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g2318.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r052b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak35696483"><dcterms:title>A dialogue manager for a spoken dialogue system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hermannsdóttir, Sigríður Helga</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One way to reduce the complexity of the speech recognition is to use syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information to predict the next input of the user.

The dialogue model is data driven and the dialogue manager is integrated into a generic dialogue system.

Fatigue intensity was relatively high at two days and two weeks, but had significantly declined to a relatively "normal" level by six weeks postpartum. However, 25% of the mothers were still reporting "severe" fatigue at six weeks. The contributing factors most frequently identified by the mothers were labour and delivery issues (2 days), sleep pattern disturbances, and infant care issues (2 &amp; 6 weeks).

A Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) was used for the enzyme purification. The enzyme was purified to 216 fold over the crude extract with a recovery of 18%. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 120 kDa on Native-PAGE and 56 kDa on SDS-PAGE suggesting that carboxypeptidase Y from Kluyveromyces fragilis consists of two subunits. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were pH 6.0 and 35$ sp circ$C, respectively. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DIPF) and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and caused an average 50% loss of activity when incubated with various metal cations. The apparent K$ sb{ rm m}$ and V$ sb{ rm max}$ values obtained for n-benzoyl-L-tyrosine-p-nitroanilide (BTPNA) and carboxybenzoxyphenylalanylalanine (Cbz-Phe-Ala) were 5.1 mM and 13.4 $ mu$mole/min/mg and 2.98 mM and 22.58 $ mu$mole/min/mg, respectively. Carboxypeptidase Y hydrolysis on the tryptic digests of $ alpha sb{ rm s1}$- and $ beta$-casein showed that the enzyme randomly removed five and three hydrophobic peptides, respectively and greatly reduced the size and heights of the other peptides analysed on Reversed Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, Byong H.

This enhanced visuospatial performance is interpreted as being the result of knowing and using a visual and spatial grammar. An alternative explanation is that this enhanced visuospatial performance is due to sensory compensation, that is, a heavy reliance on vision throughout development due to deafness. The present study tested this alternative explanation. Eight congenitally and profoundly deaf adults (4 women, 4 men) who did not know sign language and eight normally hearing controls (4 women, 4 men) were tested on four visuospatial tasks requiring mental rotation in two and three dimensions (Card Rotation, Paper Form Board, Space Relations and Spatial Visualization). Subjects were matched for age, sex, and education. Spatial solution strategy and handedness were also assessed. Results showed that both groups were significantly faster and more accurate on the two-dimensional tasks than on the three-dimensional tasks. Additionally, hearing women and deaf men were significantly faster than the deaf women over all tasks. The two groups used similar solution strategy for all tasks except Spatial Visualization, where more deaf subjects used a mental rotation strategy. These findings suggest that sensory compensation per se does not lead to enhanced visuospatial skill.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mayberry, Rachel (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c64z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z308b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666677s"><dcterms:title>The HBx protein encoded by Hepatitis B virus transactivates or represses RNA polymerase II and III promoters by direct interaction with preinitiation complexes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Antunovic, Jovan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The hepatitis B virus X gene product, HBx, is a promiscuous viral activator and it stimulates transcription of both pol II and III promoters. HBx also interacts with tumour suppressor p53 protein. In vitro transcriptional studies using the human U6 pol III promoter, showed that addition of HBx after preinitiation complex formation resulted in a 3 to 8 fold increase of transcription, whereas addition of HBx prior to preinitiation complex formation resulted in repression. The two-fold repression observed in transient transfection analysis and the activation observed in vitro was dependent on the presence of an upstream octamer element. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBx into a stable U6 preinitiation complex was confirmed by employing high performance liquid chromatography on a 4000A methacrylate polymer, which permitted the purification of human U6 preinitiation complexes. This methodology was initially developed using the RNA polymerase III VA$ sb{ rm I}$ gene and allowed for a 10$ sp5$ fold enrichment in VA$ sb{ rm I}$ transcription preinitiation complexes. Additionally, transient transfection analysis in Calu-6 cells showed that HBx could inhibit the transactivation of the pol II p53 responsive TATA-box driven reporter plasmid. In vitro studies using the same reporter plasmid established that the addition of HBx prior to or after preinitiation complex formation resulted in the same two-fold inhibition. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the ability of HBx to function as a corepressor or as a coactivator.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cromlish, J. A.

From an examination of the general problem and a survey of previous research, it appears that the central problem of numerical computational geometry is how to deal with degenerate and nearly degenerate input. For some applications, such as solid modeling, degeneracy is often intended but we cannot always ascertain its existence using finite precision. For other applications, degenerate input is unwanted but nearly degenerate input is unavoidable. Near degeneracy is associated with ill-conditioning of the input and can lead to a serious loss of accuracy and program failure. These observations lead us to a discussion of problem condition in the context of computational geometry. We use the Voronoi diagram construction problem as a case study and show that problem condition can also play a role in algorithm design.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr68f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r710</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn9998728"><dcterms:title>The regulation of foreign direct investment in Mexico and the North American free-trade agreement</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nadeau, Christian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis*, after presenting an overview of Mexico, examines the new business environment prevailing in Mexico focussing on the laws and regulations affecting foreign investments and and foreigners in Mexico. It then compares Mexico's foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations with those of Canada and the United States in relation to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement of 1988. Since Mexico's FDI concerns and policies are similar those of Canada, this comparison provides useful perspectives for a prospective analysis of acceptable FDI regulations in a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The adoption by Mexico of industrialized country standards and principles has led to the negotiation of a NAFTA between Canada, the United States and Mexico. Further investment liberalization will be a major part of the price Mexico will need to pay for the sucessful conclusion of NAFTA. Such liberalization will benefit Mexico's development provided that it retains a few of the prevailing restrictions and the legal means to implement future policies on investment, thus ensuring for itself a part of the benefits of FDI.

In concluding that a natural monopoly/oligopoly does not exist, Chapter II will analyse the policy being antitrust enforcement in the industry. Chapter III will then use the implementation of S 408 of the Federal Aviation Act (FAA) by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as an example of such a policy. Finally, the remaining chapters are dedicated to an analysis of the CRS industry. By using this industry as an example, the writer will suggest that, by removing barriers to entry through aggressive use of S 411 of the FAA, the future may see new entrants enter the market.

They are ideological constructs embedded in a social process of knowledge production.

By living and recording the dilemma of being unable to act as his intellect mandated, he developed an innovative concept of will.

He wrote the first treatise on jurisprudence in Islam, a work in which he discusses the nature and sources of Islamic law and develops a legal methodology designed to interpret those sources. Al-Shafi'is legal theory is based on two principles: an insistence on following the scripture and traditions and a restriction on the use of reason. Furthermore, al-Shafi'i established the hierarchy of the four sources of law: the Qur'an, Sunnah, ijma' and qiyas. In the centuries that followed, al-Shafi'is legal theory was to have a great influence. The Hanbali and the Zahiri schools of law arose in an environment that was considerably influenced by al-Shafi'i and his followers. The founders of these two schools strictly followed revelation and restricted the use of reason: Dawud al-Z ahiri even refused to consider qiyas as one of the sources of law. Although not all aspects of al-Shafi'is theory gained acceptance among later scholars, these scholars nevertheless owe much to al-Shafi'i for his efforts at systematizing the method of deriving law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc36f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb64q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shāfiʻī, Muḥammad ibn Idrīs, 767 or 8-820</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agq67jt317"><dcterms:title>A database for an intensive care unit patient data management system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fumai, Nicola</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Computerization has had a large impact on hospital intensive care units, allowing continuous monitoring and display of physiological patient data. Treatment of the critically ill patient, however, now requires assimilating large amounts of patient data. Computers can help by processing the data and displaying the information in easy to understand formats. Also, knowledge-based systems can provide advice in diagnosis and treatment of patients. If these systems are to be effective, they must be integrated into the total hospital information system and the separate computer data must be jointly integrated into a new database which will become the primary medical record. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a computerized database for an intensive care unit patient data management system being developed for the Montreal Children's Hospital. The database integrates data from the various PDMS components into one logical information store. The patient data currently managed includes physiological parameter data, patient administrative data and fluid balance data. A simulator design is also described, which allows for thorough validation and verification of the Patient Data Management System.

Surfer identity is shown to be derived from the act and the setting of surfing itself, from the individual's personal background and motivation for surfing, and from the social interaction among surfers on and off the water. Influences on the identity of surfers as a group include the surfers' own feeling of separateness from American society, surfer communication via the surf economy, the strong association of surfing with adolescence, and the portrayal of surfer symbols in the national media. The outward form of the "surf culture" changes in response to these influences, but the basic identity of surfers remains the same over time.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj386.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kj37x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Surfing -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surfers -- California</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fd95z"><dcterms:title>L'essai littérature au Québec (1970-1990) : un projet de liberté</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Przychodzen, Janusz, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes and analyzes the context and the evolution of the Quebec literary essay between 1970 and 1990. It is supported by a body of texts which, in our opinion, reflect the structure of contemporary essayistic discourse in Quebec. By studying three dimensions of the Quebec essay--the socio-political, the personal and the feminist--we will attempt to understand and interpret the various modes through which the essayistic "I" deals with its cultural and ideological contexts. Beyond this principal goal, we offer an account of recent studies on the definition of the literary essay. This vast panorama of Quebec essay is accompanied, in the second part of this work, by the bibliography of texts published during the last two decades. In order to facilitate a clearer assessment of the development of the "genre" in question, we have appended a chronological listing of these texts.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz83j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd95z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Essay</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian essays -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qb92c"><dcterms:title>A study of the effects of a theatrical performance program (wheelchair dance) on the mood states of adolescents who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kaldis, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigated the mood states of adolescents who have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

For women, in particular, literacy has become linked with a variety of issues such as personal growth and development, ways of knowing and the effects of patriarchy on their lives. This study attempts to gain a deeper understanding of the personal meanings of literacy in the lives of a group of women. It examines the meanings women assign to literacy in their daily lives. It explores how literacy fashions and alters women's perceptions of themselves and their place in the world. It also illustrates the dynamics of qualitative research on the participants.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t57d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh83x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women's Studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education, Adult and Continuing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj96023029"><dcterms:title>Petrogenesis of the pyroxenite units in the Muskox intrusion, N.W.T.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>DesRoches, Valérie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The layered series of the Muskox Intrusion can be divided into four megacyclic units on the basis of field mapping, each beginning with a thick olivine cumulate and succeeded up section by a variety of pyroxenitic and gabbroic cumulates. A systematic change in the order of appearance of orthopyroxene in the pyroxenite units of the layered series is correlated with a decrease in Mg no. (Mg/Mg + $ Sigma$Fe in cation units) at which clinopyroxene joins olivine on the liquidus, and spike-like increases in LIL/HFS ratios, which require that the composition of the magma of the Muskox Intrusion changed through time across the layered series. Mixing of residual liquid with primary liquids replenishing the chamber can explain the upsection decrease in the Mg no. of clinopyroxene at the base of successive pyroxenite units, but this mechanism cannot account for increased ratios of LIL to HFS incompatible elements observed in the olwebsterite of Megacycle #3 and the first websterite of Megacycle #4, because these ratios are not significantly fractionated by closed-system crystal fractionation. Contamination of the parental magma with melts from the paragneiss country rocks can reproduce the observed increase in the ratios of K/Ti and K/Zr. The gabbroic layers of Megacycle #1, #2, and #3 are especially enriched in LIL/HFS ratios, indicating the presence of a highly contaminated magma layer above the uncontaminated magma which crystallized much of the ultramafic series. The spike-like enrichment in LIL/HFS ratios in the pyroxenites suggests that episodic events of mixing occurred between an evolving uncontaminated magma and a highly contaminated magma, accumulated at the roof of the magma chamber.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw713.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96023029</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gv786"><dcterms:title>Selsyn-C : a self-synchronizing parallel programming language</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ding, Weiren</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In thesis thesis we report the design and implementation of a new self-scheduling parallel programming language, SELSYN-C. As parallel processors become more accessible to a broad range of programmers, the development of simple to use and effective programming languages becomes increasingly important. Our approach to the challenge of parallel programming language design and implementation is two-fold: (1) the design of simple extensions to C that are both easy to use for the programmer, and useful for effective compilation, and (2) the design of efficient and effective scheduling strategies that can be automatically supported by a compiler and associated run-time environment. We outline our approach by presenting: (1) our motivation, (2) an overview of the extensions to C that form the SELSYN-C programming language, and (3) the development of a new scheduling mechanism that can be used to effectively compile SELSYN-C programs for a real parallel processor, the BBN Butterfly GP-1000. Different scheduling strategies for this mechanism were studied via several experimental tests and the results of these experiments are reported. A source-to-source compiler supporting the SELSYN-C language has been implemented. Included in this thesis is a description of both the compiler and associated run-time environment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs613.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv786</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182n314"><dcterms:title>Obeah in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in Trinidad : an empirical study of an indigenous healing system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roach, Roslyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ce discours vient du postulat que toute societe et culture contient son propre systeme de croyances et un modele de solutions aux problemes de la vie.

On both tasks, the children recognized written words that form part of their sign lexicon more accurately and more quickly than words that do not. In the production task, the younger children made fewer errors on written words that share formational correspondences with their signed equivalents, whereas the older children did not. In the lexical decision task, the children recognized words that they signed correctly in the production task more accurately and more quickly than those words they fingerspelled correctly. These results indicate that deaf children organize their recognition of written words around their knowledge of sign language.

One aim was to determine how forest age after clearcutting affected woodland amphibians. Path analysis was used to compare different causal effects of forest age on Plethodon cinereus density in 22 deciduous forests of 30, 60 and $&gt;$90 years old. Repopulation of Plethodon followed forest litter recovery, 30 to 60 years after clearcutting. However, the effect of forest age was overridden by that of microtopography and soil texture. Rana sylvatica seemed also sensitive to clearcutting while Bufo americanus, Ambystoma maculatum and A. laterale seemed much less sensitive. A second aim was to determine the status and habitat of stream salamanders at the northern edge of the Adirondacks. Sixty stream sections were sampled. Eurycea bislineata was widespread (in 47 sites) and abundant, especially where rocks were numerous on the shore. The distributions of Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (8 sites) and, to a lesser extent, of Desmognathus fuscus (11 sites) were positively correlated with altitude and the presence of forest. It is proposed that these locations might offer the temperate and oxygenated waters needed by these species during winter and summer.
