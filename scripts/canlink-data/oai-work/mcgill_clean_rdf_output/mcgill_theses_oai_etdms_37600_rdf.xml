Clock genes are also known to be rhythmically expressed outside the SCN and outside the brain. While these peripheral circadian oscillators are functional, their expression is chiefly coordinated by the central circadian pacemaker of the SCN. This thesis presents the first evidence of a functional circadian oscillator in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Measuring levels of RNA transcripts in PBMCs sampled throughout specific behavioural protocols permitted the characterization of these peripheral circadian oscillators in humans. The expression of clock genes HPER1, HPER2, and HPER3 peaks early after the time of typical awakening and demonstrates a significant circadian rhythmicity in PBMCs sampled from healthy young men that persists in time isolation and under the constant behavioural conditions of a constant routine (CR). The functional circadian oscillator in human PBMCs is also observable in the presence of the sleep/wake cycle. Using frequent sampling over 72 hours, it was determined that the patterns of HPER1 and HPER2 expression are comparable when sampled in the presence of a habitual sleep/wake cycle or during a CR. The expression of HBMAL1 in PBMCs was more variable under different behavioural conditions. The pattern of light and darkness exposure including bright light during night shifts, shielding from morning light and sleep in darkened quarters can induce adaptive phase delays in the endogenous circadian rhythms of cortisol secretion in night shift workers. In the presence of such a light intervention, the cortisol rhythm in night shift workers re-assumes an appropriate temporal alignment with the shifted sleep/wake schedule and cortisol levels peak near the shifted time of awakening. Following nine days of simulated night shift work, HPER1 and HPER2 expression in PBMCs is aligned to the shifted sleep/wake schedule of a typical night shift worker in the presence of a comparable light/darkness intervention. This thesis will consider the implications of a functional clock in human white blood cells in light of the demonstration of a functional and shiftable circadian oscillator in human PBMCs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2366526.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj1396295</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67wr99b"><dcterms:title>Regulation of RBP1BCAA transcriptional repression activities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Binda, Olivier.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Normal cellular proliferation is controlled by two major pathways, the pRB and the p53 pathways. It is believed that one or both of these two pathways is disrupted in all tumour cells. The functions of pRB are disrupted by viral oncoproteins, which displace important cellular components from a highly conserved region known as the "pocket". The first cellular "pocket"-binding protein identified is the retinoblastoma binding protein 1 (RBP1). RBP1 and the RBP1-like protein BCAA are inherent subunits of the chromatin modifying transcription repression complex mSIN3A/HDAC. By linking the pRB protein to this repression complex, RBP1 is believed to mediate repression of E2F-dependent transcription, thereby regulating cellular proliferation. RBP1 and BCAA repress transcription in both HDAC-independent (R1) and HDAC-dependent (R2) manners. I show in this work that, as with RBP1, BCAA can associate with the mSIN3A/HDAC complex via a direct interaction with the SAP30 subunit. The region responsible for this interaction (R2) mediates HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression. The latter is regulated by the NAD+-dependent enzymatic activity of the class III histone deacetylase longevity factor SIRT1, which is recruited to the mSIN3A/HDAC complex via the tumour suppressors ING1b/ING2 and probably acts by deacetylating HDAC1. The HDAC-independent repression activity of both RBP1 and BCAA is regulated by post-translational modifications. The R1 repression activity can be further dissected into a domain that targets basal transcription (R1alpha) and one that represses both basal and activated transcription (R1sigma). SUMOylation of the R1sigma region is essential for its repression activities. SUMOylation of R1sigma is itself regulated by the overall local amino acids charge. In agreement with published results demonstrating that a negative charge in the vicinity of the PsiKxE site allows interaction with a positively charged patch on the SUMO E2 ligase enzyme UBC9, neutralization of lysine positive charge by acetylation of R1sigma allows SUMOylation whereas mutation of lysines to arginines conserves the positive charge and hinders SUMOylation. The biological relevance of RBP1 and BCAA transcriptional repression activities is highlighted by their requirement for induction of cell growth arrest and terminal cell cycle withdrawal or cellular senescence.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741w92w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wr99b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3015601"><dcterms:title>Experimental and finite element investigation of springback of aerospaceautomotive sheet metal products</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ragai, Ihab.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Springback is a phenomenon that occurs when nonhomogeneous elastic and plastic deformation occurs throughout a component during forming processes. Since the elastic deformation is recovered when the forming load is removed, geometrical changes occur. Springback is particularly important in sheet forming; therefore, in order to provide formed parts of close tolerances it is essential to first have a good understanding of the factors which affect springback and to be able to determine the extent those factors have. It is also important to be able to predict springback under different conditions so that it can either be minimized or properly accounted for in the process design. This research presents work done thus far on understanding and predicting springback in sheet metal forming of stainless steel 410 and inconel 718, which have a wide range of usage in the aerospace industry as well as dual-phase steels 6001300 and 600/400 which are used in the automotive sector. The role that the anisotropy plays in the springback is assessed in this work. The effect of normal anisotropy on springback for the aerospace materials is considered while the automotive materials were considered perfectly isotropic and only the effect of forming conditions was studied. In order to characterize the materials and their anisotropic behaviour, a series of mechanical tests is conducted. These tests include standard uniaxial tension and uniaxial tension-compression tests. Moreover, a series of simple multiplebending experiments were conducted on the aerospace materials (steel and Ni based alloys) to examine the effect of specimen orientation on the springback in simple bending. Furthermore, since process conditions have an obvious effect on springback and one of the most important of these is the blank holding force, 2D draw bending experiments are conducted with varying blank holding force to assess its role in springback of the formed part. The combined effect of anisotropy and blank holding force was also studied for the aerospace materials. Finite element simulations that include only either classical isotropic hardening or kinematic hardening did not show close agreement with the experimental findings especially for springback prediction. Therefore, to properly simulate springback a material model that combines both hardening effects, along with the material anisotropy, has been developed in this work. The developed finite element model implements isotropic hardening as well as kinematic hardening based on the Mroz multiple-yield surface formulation. Hill's 1948 yield function with normal anisotropy is considered. The developed material model has been tested by simulating the tension-compression experiments and a good agreement was reached. Furthermore, to demonstrate the model capability, bending experiments were simulated. Springback angles predicted by the model reflected those obtained experimentally for the simple multiple-bending experiments. Moreover, draw-bending experiments were simulated with the developed material model, which showed good agreement with the experiments. Finally, the capability of the model can be readily extended to cover real forming operations, which will reduce cost and enhance the quality of the formed parts.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000424d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3015601</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r740d"><dcterms:title>Potato tuber protein and its manipulation by chimeral disassembly using specific tissue explantation for somatic embryogenesis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ortiz-Medina, Estela.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Potato is a major part of the human diet in many countries of the world, providing substantial levels of carbohydrate, protein, and vitamins. This study examined the tuber protein content. In the first part of the research, total soluble protein (TSP) and patatin concentration were determined in periderm, cortex, and pith, in tubers of 20 important potato cultivars. TSP concentration was greater in periderm and lesser in cortex and pith tissues. Patatin was present in all tuber tissues but with the opposite pattern, less in periderm and greater in cortex and pith tissues. For intercultivar comparisons, a means of converting the specific tissue-based TSP and patatin data (dry weight) into a uniform weight whole tuber basis was developed. This relied on conversion factor values that were generated from percent weight tissue proportion and percent dry matter for each tissue layer. Cultivars with relatively more or less TSP and patatin in each tissue layer, and on a whole tuber basis, were identified. In the second part of the study, disassembly of chimeral (Russet Burbank) and putatively chimeral (Alpha, Bintje, Red Gold) tubers into their component genotypes was evaluated as a strategy for the production of intraclones with altered protein content. Explants were selected from tissue with greater or lesser protein levels and somatic embryogenesis was used to produce regenerants from each tissue source. Russeting was used as a phenotypic marker and TSP as a biochemical marker. Russet Burbank was confirmed as a periclinal chimera, although chimeral instability was evident, since some non-chimeral regenerants showed displacement of LI tunic cells with the russeting mutation into the pith. Red Gold was "uncovered" as an LII periclinal chimera (Red-Gold-Red). The value of chimeral disassembly in explaining an important component of somatic variation was clearly seen with this cultivar. The inconsistent TSP distribution in Russet Burbank intraclones proved that TSP was not distributed in a periclinal chimeral manner, as initially hypothesized. However, there was clear variation in protein content in the tubers of non-chimeral regenerants. Periclinal chimeral disassembly and somatic embryogenesis are potentially useful technologies for the production of improved intraclones of potato.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf79n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r740d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Potatoes -- Genetic engineering.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant proteins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Potatoes -- Embryology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff365928w"><dcterms:title>Analysis and design development of parallel 3-D mesh refinement algorithms for finite element electromagnetics with tetrahedra</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ren, Da Qi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optimal partitioning of three-dimensional (3-D) mesh applications necessitates dynamically determining and optimizing for the most time-inhibiting factors, such as load imbalance and communication volume. One challenge is to create an analytical model where the programmer can focus on optimizing load imbalance or communication volume to reduce execution time. Another challenge is the best individual performance of a specific mesh refinement demands precise study and the selection of the suitable computation strategy. Very-large-scale finite element method (FEM) applications require sophisticated capabilities for using the underlying parallel computer's resources in the most efficient way. Thus, classifying these requirements in a manner that conforms to the programmer is crucial. This thesis contributes a simulation-based approach for the algorithm analysis and design of parallel, 3-D FEM mesh refinement that utilizes Petri Nets (PN) as the modeling and simulation tool. PN models are implemented based on detailed software prototypes and system architectures, which imitate the behaviour of the parallel meshing process. Subsequently, estimates for performance measures are derived from discrete event simulations. New communication strategies are contributed in the thesis for parallel mesh refinement that pipeline the computation and communication time by means of the workload prediction approach and task breaking point approach. To examine the performance of these new designs, PN models are created for modeling and simulating each of them and their efficiencies are justified by the simulation results. Also based on the PN modeling approach, the performance of a Random Polling Dynamic Load Balancing protocol has been examined. Finally, the PN models are validated by a MPI benchmarking program running on the real multiprocessor system. The advantages of new pipelined communication designs as well as the benefits of PN approach for evaluating and developing high performance parallel mesh refinement algorithms are demonstrated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526h405.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365928w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electromagnetism -- Mathematics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finite element method.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tetrahedra.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Numerical grid generation (Numerical analysis)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq978019w"><dcterms:title>Bandwith allocation and scheduling in photonic networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saberi, Nahid.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes a framework for bandwidth allocation and scheduling in the Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN). This framework is also applicable to any single-hop communication network with significant signalling delay (such as satellite-TDMA systems). Slot-by-slot scheduling approaches do not provide adequate performance for wide-area networks, so we focus on frame-based scheduling. We propose three novel fixed-length frame scheduling algorithms (Minimum Cost Search, Fair Matching and Minimum Rejection) and a feedback control system for stabilization. MCS is a greedy algorithm, which allocates time-slots sequentially using a cost function. This function is defined such that the time-slots with higher blocking probability are assigned first. MCS does not guarantee 100% throughput, thought it has a low blocking percentage. Our optimum scheduling approach is based on modifying the demand matrix such that the network resources are fully utilized, while the requests are optimally served. The Fair Matching Algorithm (FMA) uses the weighted max-min fairness criterion to achieve a fair share of resources amongst the connections in the network. When rejection is inevitable, FMA selects rejections such that the maximum percentage rejection experienced in the network is minimized. In another approach we formulate the rejection task as an optimization problem and propose the Minimum Rejection Algorithm (MRA), which minimizes total rejection. The minimum rejection problem is a special case of maximum flow problem. Due to the complexity of the algorithms that solve the max-flow problem we propose a heuristic algorithm with lower complexity. Scheduling in wide-area networks must be based on predictions of traffic demand and the resultant errors can lead to instability and unfairness. We design a feedback control system based on Smith's principle, which removes the destabilizing delays from the feedback loop by using a "loop cancelation" technique. The feedback control system we propose reduces the effect of prediction errors, increasing the speed of the response to sudden changes in traffic arrival rates and improving the fairness in the network through equalization of queue-lengths.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gq11j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq978019w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82kc59g"><dcterms:title>Fatty acid biomarker analysis to characterize soil microbial communities in soybean agroecosystems with Sclerotinia stem rot disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jeannotte, Richard.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one the major crops produced worldwide. However, soybean is susceptible to many diseases. Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) disease caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is considered one of the most important fungal diseases of soybean. It can be controlled by chemicals (e.g. fungicides), by breeding cultivars with disease resistance and by cultural control (e.g. increasing the width between rows, reducing plant populations). A promising and complementary method of controlling SSR disease in the field is the application of biological control agents. Biological control agents introduced in a soil environment will interact with other soil food web organisms, as do the pathogenic organism and infected plants, which may change the genetic and functional diversity in soil microbial communities. Profiling these changes may lead to an improved understanding of the interactions between these players (biological control agents, pathogens, soil biota and plants) in the biological control phenomenom, permiting us to exploit naturally-occurring ecological relationships and develop more sustainable approaches to control soybean diseases. Fatty acid biomarkers analysis was used to profile microbial communities in soils. Two laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the methods used for extraction and profiling the fatty acid biomarkers from soil samples with a range of soil properties (clay content, organic matter content), The first study investigated the best solvent mixture for recovering fatty acid biomarkers from soil using an automated pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) system. Solvent mixtures containing chloroform and methanol were more efficient at extracting fatty acids from agricultural soils than hexane:2-propanol and acetone. The second study presented an exploratory pyrolysis-mass spectrometry technique to rapidly fingerprint soil lipids extracted from different agroecosystems. Pyrolysis-mass spectrometry discriminated among soils and crop production systems in the same way as the fatty acid profiling. I also report on the efficicacy of biological control agents to control Sclerotinia stem rot disease in soybean. A two-year study was conducted in soybean fields under conventional or no tillage to determine whether Trichoderma virens (SoilGard(TM)) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (a mixture of Glomus intraradices and G. mosseae ), used alone or in combination, could reduce sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) disease incidence. Generally, SSR disease indicators, as well as the soybean yield, were not affected significantly by the biological control treatments. I then studied whether changes in microbial community composition were related to the inoculation of the biological control agents and the disease incidence in soybean fields. Inoculation of biological control agents changes the expression of many soil fatty acids during both years of the trial. Also, in the plots with severely diseased plants, fatty acids biomarkers of gram positive and actinomycetes bacteria were significantly greater than in plots with healthy plants. I conclude that further improvement in laboratory techniques and procedures will permit researchers to efficiently extract and characterize soil lipids, providing new insight into soil organic matter dynamics and soil microbial ecology. Further study will be needed to verify the efficacy and optimize the application method, dose and timing of biocontrol agents to provide protection against SSR disease in soybean fields.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644w86h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82kc59g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemical markers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum -- Biological control.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil ecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soybean -- Diseases and pests -- Biological control.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js990"><dcterms:title>Discovery and study of exotic radio pulsars</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hessels, Jason William Thomas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have conducted both targeted and wide-field surveys for exotic radio pulsars using the Arecibo, Green Bank, and Parkes telescopes. A survey of 22 globular clusters with Arecibo has discovered 11 millisecond pulsars, almost doubling the number known in these clusters. Ten of the new pulsars are in binaries, and 3 show eclipses. This survey has discovered significantly more very fast-spinning pulsars (Pspin ≲ 4 ms) and short orbital period systems (Porb ≲ 6 hr) than previous surveys of the same clusters. We discuss some characteristics of the globular cluster pulsar population in general, particularly the luminosity function. In observations of the rich, massive cluster Terzan 5 with the Green Bank Telescope we have discovered the 1.396-ms pulsar J1748--2446ad, which is now the fastest-spinning neutron star known. The difficulty in detecting this pulsar, due to its very low flux density and high eclipse fraction (~40% of the orbit), suggests that even faster-spinning neutron stars exist. If the pulsar has a mass less than 2 M⊙ , then its non-rotating radius is constrained by the spin period to be &lt; 16 km. The short period of this pulsar also constrains models that suggest gravitational radiation, through an r-mode instability, limits the maximum spin frequency of neutron stars. Arecibo and Parkes searches of 5 potential ASCA X-ray counterparts to unidentified EGRET gamma-ray sources have revealed the young, energetic pulsar J2021+3651. PSR J2021+3651 is associated with the X-ray source AX J2021.1+3651, which in turn is likely associated with the COS B gamma-ray source 2CG 075+00, also known as GeV J2020+3658 and 3EG J2021+3716. This solves the long-standing mystery of this source's nature. Subsequent X-ray imaging and timing of PSR J2021+3651 with the Chandra observatory revealed a pulsar wind nebula whose morphology is reminiscent of the equatorial tori seen around some young pulsars, along with thermal emission from an embedded point source ( kTinfinity = 0.15+/-0.02keV). An observation in continuousclocking mode reveals a possible pulse detection from the point source. Finally, we discuss two on-going, untargeted surveys of the Galactic Plane. These surveys hope to find exotic pulsars whose properties will elucidate the physics of pulsars, or which can potentially be used to study ultra-dense matter and strong gravity. The PALFA survey at Arecibo is using a 7-beam receiver at 1.4 GHz to cover the Arecibo-visible Galactic Plane. 28 pulsars have been discovered so far, including a few young, energetic pulsars and the youngest pulsar binary system known, PSR J1906+0746. The GBT350 survey at Green Bank is covering the Galactic Plane north of delta = 40°. Despite the 350-MHz observing frequency, the high resolution of these data allows us to maintain sensitivity to fast pulsars. Thus far, 14 pulsars have been discovered, 3 of which were found in time-domain searches for bright, dispersed bursts.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d828s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js990</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amk61rn39g"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of long-hole mine design influences on unplanned ore dilution</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Henning, John Gordon.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Unplanned ore dilution or stope overbreak, which has a direct and large influence on the cost of a stope, and ultimately on the profitability of a mining operation, can be attributed to both the mining process and to geologic setting. The research undertaken in this document, applicable to a wide range of underground mines employing the blasthole mining method to extract tabular orebodies, focuses on examining factors attributable to the generation of unstable stope hanging-walls. The primary objective of the research undertaken is to establish new models for stope and orezone design, with respect to anticipated stope overbreak, focusing on the position and type of stope within the orezone extraction sequence. Identified factors influencing unplanned dilution, such as: induced stress environment, stope geometry, and the setting of individual stopes are considered. The research undertaken incorporates a variety of components, including (i) parametric 3-D numerical modelling to examine influences of individual factors on hanging-wall overbreak, (ii) case example analysis, and (iii) orezone extraction sequence simulation, using 3-D elastic numerical modelling. Design criteria, developed from the parametric modelling, was applied to the orezone sequence modelling to develop trends for stope dilution, as functions of stope design and construction. It was found that hanging-wall overbreak is not significantly influenced by depth alone, and that stopes with large vertical and short horizontal dimensions or stopes having long horizontal and short vertical dimensions are more stable than large square-like stopes. Also, through parametric and case studies, it was demonstrated that, in addition to stope dimension, the amount of unplanned dilution differed according to stope type. Five stope types were identified, based on their position within a tabular blasthole mining sequence. Measured overbreak varies with stope type, with secondary stopes generating a greater volume of hanging-wall dilution than do primary stopes. A pillarless mining sequence will generate less overall dilution than a primary stope: secondary pillar mining sequence.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h3843.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rn39g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ground control (Mining)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mining engineering -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stoping (Mining)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kv507"><dcterms:title>On testing concurrent systems through contexts of queues</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Huo, Jiale.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Concurrent systems, including asynchronous circuits, computer networks, and multi-threaded programs, have important applications, but they are also very complex and expensive to test. This thesis studies how to test concurrent systems through contexts consisting of queues. Queues, modeling buffers and communication delays, are an integral part of the test settings for concurrent systems. However, queues can also distort the behavior of the concurrent system as observed by the tester, so one should take into account the queues when defining conformance relations or deriving tests. On the other hand, queues can cause state explosion, so one should avoid testing them if they are reliable or have already been tested. To solve these problems, we propose two different solutions. The first solution is to derive tests using some test selection criteria such as test purposes, fault coverage, and transition coverage. The second solution is to compensate for the problems caused by the queues so that testers do not discern the presence of the queues in the first place. Unifying the presentation of the two solutions, we consider in a general testing framework partial specifications, various contexts, and a hierarchy of conformance relations.

The location of the open-ended valve which controls the vacuum level was found to have an influence on the condensation. The re-location of valve which allowed air passage to the vacuum container was able to decrease the condensation. The input power for the microwave vacuum drying could not be greater than 1.5 W/g. The continuous use of input power caused the high temperature in the process. The pulse mode (on/off) was recommended for further studies. Water removal and solid gain of osmotic treatment were considered as factors that affect the dielectric properties dielectric constant (epsilon') and the loss factor (epsilon"). The experiment was set up to investigate the influence of osmotic conditions to dielectric properties. Two osmotic agents, sucrose and salt, were used for carrots; but only sucrose was used for strawberries. The effects of variations in sucrose and salt concentrations, solution temperatures, and length of immersion time on the dielectric properties were studied. The empirical models were generated from response surface methodology (RSM) to predict epsilon' and epsilon" for the various ranges of osmotic conditions considered in this thesis. As a consideration of the osmotic pre-drying treatment, it was considered appropriate to maximize water loss (WL) and minimize solid gain (SG). The parameter appropriate to study this situation was WL/SG. The optimum conditions of osmotic process to acquire the maximum ratio of WL/SG were investigated. The results of the optimum conditions for carrots were found to be sucrose concentration 50%(w/w), salt concentration 5%(w/w), temperature 20°C and immersion time 3 hours 38 minutes. The optimum conditions for strawberries were found to be sucrose concentration 60%(w/w), temperature 20°C and immersion time 24 hours. The microwave vacuum drying was then studied as a technique combined with the osmotic pretreatment. The studies were performed on carrots and strawberries. The input power levels 1 and 1.5 W/g with different power modes (continuous, 45s on/15s off and 30s on/30s off) were experimentally studied with a certain condition of osmotic treatment, which was acquired from the previous study. Osmotic treatment prior to microwave vacuum of carrots showed the advantage in most cases; fast drying time, less energy consumption and superior quality aspects except the taste which was affected from the salt. The study of strawberries did not show great advantage of osmotic pretreatment. The drying time and energy consumption of the process with and without osmotic pretreatment were the same but the process with osmotic pre-treatment resulted in better quality of dried strawberries. The microwave vacuum drying of carrots and strawberries after osmotic pretreatment did not show constant rate period in drying rate curve while the processes without osmotic treatment of strawberries showed longer constant rate period than those observed for carrot drying. According to these phenomena, thin layer models of Lewis and Henderson &amp; Pabis were fitted to the observed data which showed excellent fit for the process without constant rate period, but Page's model was a good fit for both constant rate and falling rate period of microwave vacuum drying.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tr12k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs87f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Strawberries -- Drying.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microwave drying.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrots -- Drying.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fw813"><dcterms:title>Analyses of precipitation signal using VHF vertically-pointing radar</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Campos Ortega, Edwin F., 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In addition to a proper radar calibration, quantitative estimation of precipitation from VHF radars requires the extraction of the precipitation signal out of the Doppler spectra. It also requires the proper conversion of this precipitation signal into a reflectivity factor. This research develops a multi-faceted approach for the calibration of VHF vertically-pointing radars, by combining a first calibration method that compares the recorded VHF signal to power coming from a noise generator and a second calibration method that compares recorded VHF signal to cosmic radiation. This approach allows the retrieval of antenna and receiver parameters (such as noise levels, efficiency, and gain), and four other equations for the corresponding errors. In addition, we develop an equation for calibrating Doppler spectra. The analysis is focused on rain observations with VHF radar. We verify the hypothesis that |K|2 = 0.93 for most of the rain observations at VHF band. A signal-processing algorithm for extracting the rain signal out of the VHF power spectra is then presented. This work also derives a general version of the radar equation valid for vertically pointing radars, as well as a particular version of this equation valid for the McGill VHF radar. The study then makes numerical simulations of several profiles of precipitation signal at VHF band, by combining high-resolution profiles of precipitation signal (from a calibrated X-band radar) and the VHF antenna pattern in our general version of the radar equation. The analyses indicate that VHF reflectivity at gates above the melting layer is artificially enhanced by the precipitation signal collected from the side lobes. This work also studies the effect of precipitation in the scattering properties of clear air. We analyze several cases of stratiform and convective rain, occurring in a continental mid-latitude environment (Montreal, Lat.45.41°N, Long.73.94°W). For these cases, Doppler spectra taken by a VHF vertically-pointing radar were used to retrieve simultaneous co-located values of precipitation intensity (rainrates) and degrees of refractive index fluctuation (structure-function parameter for refractivity turbulence, Cn2). We validated these retrievals using co-located, calibrated measurements of precipitation signal at X-band. The comparison between equivalent reflectivity factors at X and VHF bands agrees within 1 dB. The study includes rainrates between 0.3 and 78 mm/h, and Cn2 values between 10-16 and 10-12 m-2/3 , retrieved from the VHF spectra at 2.5 km height. The study finds that the occurrence of rain is associated with distinctive changes in the structure of air refractive index fluctuations, and that these changes are of a turbulent nature for the most intense rainrates.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n2695.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fw813</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atmospheric Sciences.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xn882"><dcterms:title>The molecular role of Bicaudal-C in Drosophila oogenesis /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chicoine, Jarred.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bicaudal-C (Bic-C) encodes a KH-type RNA binding protein required maternally for anterior patterning of the Drosophila oocyte and correct migration of the centripetal follicle cells. In Drosophila, premature translation of the germ-plasm determinant Oskar in Bic-C mutant oocytes suggests a function for Bic-C in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Purification and microarray analysis of Bic-C containing ribonucleoprotein complexes revealed that Bic-C associates with multiple transcripts encoding functionally-related components of the Wnt/Frizzled/Dishevelled signaling pathway that regulate actin dynamics, in addition to its own mRNA. Using transgenic reporter constructs, Bic-C was demonstrated to destabilize its own mRNA via cis-acting 5' UTR elements. When auto-regulation was bypassed and Bic-C was over-expressed in the female germline, premature cytoplasmic streaming was induced, disrupting axial patterning through displacement of both Gurken (Grk) and oskar. These phenotypes can also be induced by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with pharmacological agents and are similar to those described for hypomorphic mutant alleles of orb, which encodes a CPEB-like protein that promotes polyadenylation of target mRNAs. The Bic-C overexpression phenotypes require its RNA binding activity, are substantially enhanced by mutations affecting orb and poly(A) polymerase, and are suppressed by mutations affecting the deadenylase CCR4 and its accessory protein NOT3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that Bic-C associates with components of the deadenylase complex and with components of an ER-associated RNP complex that includes Me31B, PABP and Trailer-hitch. The latter complex is involved in Grk exocytosis. Accordingly, Grk secretion is defective in Bic-C mutants. Taken together, these results support a model whereby Bic-C antagonizes Orb function by negatively regulating the expression of Orb target mRNAs, through recruitment of the deadenylase machinery, that are involved in coordinating cytoplasmic movements. Furthermore, this work identifies a novel function of Bic-C in dorsal/ventral patterning by promoting Grk secretion.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720j040.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xn882</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Oogenesis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drosophila -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1c18dk954"><dcterms:title>Elliptic units in ray class fields of real quadratic number fields</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chapdelaine, Hugo.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Let K be a real quadratic number field. Let p be a prime which is inert in K. We denote the completion of K at the place p by Kp. Let ƒ &gt; 1 be a positive integer coprime to p. In this thesis we give a p-adic construction of special elements u(r, ??) ∈ Kxp for special pairs (r, ??) ∈ (ℤ/ƒℤ)x x Hp where Hp = ℙ¹(ℂp)  ℙ¹(ℚp) is the so called p-adic upper half plane. These pairs (r, ??) can be thought of as an analogue of classical Heegner points on modular curves. The special elements u(r, ??) are conjectured to be global p-units in the narrow ray class field of K of conductor ƒ. The construction of these elements that we propose is a generalization of a previous construction obtained in [DD06]. The method consists in doing p-adic integration of certain ℤ-valued measures on ??=ℤpxℤp pℤpxpℤp . The construction of those measures relies on the existence of a family of Eisenstein series (twisted by additive characters) of varying weight. Their moments are used to define those measures. We also construct p-adic zeta functions for which we prove an analogue of the so called Kronecker's limit formula. More precisely we relate the first derivative at s = 0 of a certain p-adic zeta function with -logₚ NKp/Qp u(r, ??). Finally we also provide some evidence both theoretical and numerical for the algebraicity of u(r, ??). Namely we relate a certain norm of our p-adic invariant with Gauss sums of the cyclotomic field Q (zetaf, zetap). The norm here is taken via a conjectural Shimura reciprocity law. We also have included some numerical examples at the end of section 18.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33s163m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dk954</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eisenstein series.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quadratic fields.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wh701"><dcterms:title>Three essays on volatility long memory and European option valuation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Desautels Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Yintian, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is in the form of three essays on the topic of component and long memory GARCH models. The unifying feature of the thesis is the focus on investigating European index option evaluation using these models. The first essay presents a new model for the valuation of European options. In this model, the volatility of returns consists of two components. One of these components is a long-run component that can be modeled as fully persistent. The other component is short-run and has zero mean. The model can be viewed as an affine version of Engle and Lee (1999), allowing for easy valuation of European options. The model substantially outperforms a benchmark single-component volatility model that is well established in the literature. It also fits options better than a model that combines conditional heteroskedasticity and Poisson normal jumps. While the improvement in the component model's performance is partly due to its improved ability to capture the structure of the smirk and the path of spot volatility, its most distinctive feature is its ability to model the term structure. This feature enables the component model to jointly model long-maturity and short-maturity options. The second essay derives two new GARCH variance component models with non-normal innovations. One of these models has an affine structure and leads to a closed-form option valuation formula. The other model has a non-affine structure and hence, option valuation is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation. We provide an empirical comparison of these two new component models and the respective special cases with normal innovations. We also compare the four component models against GARCH(1,1) models which they nest. All eight models are estimated using MLE on S&amp;P500 returns. The likelihood criterion strongly favors the component models as well as non-normal innovations. The properties of the non-affine models differ significantly from those of the affine models. Evaluating the performance of component variance specifications for option valuation using parameter estimates from returns data also provides strong support for component models. However, support for non-normal innovations and non-affine structure is less convincing for option valuation. The third essay aims to investigate the impact of long memory in volatility on European option valuation. We mainly compare two groups of GARCH models that allow for long memory in volatility. They are the component Heston-Nandi GARCH model developed in the first essay, in which the volatility of returns consists of a long-run and a short-run component, and a fractionally integrated Heston-Nandi GARCH (FIHNGARCH) model based on Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1999). We investigate the performance of the models using S&amp;P500 index returns and cross-sections of European options data. The component GARCH model slightly outperforms the FIGARCH in fitting return data but significantly dominates the FIHNGARCH in capturing option prices. The findings are mainly due to the shorter memory of the FIHNGARCH model, which may be attributed to an artificially prolonged leverage effect that results from fractional integration and the limitations of the affine structure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bk16k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wh701</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Options (Finance) -- Valuation -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stocks -- Prices -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qh38b"><dcterms:title>Cognitive assessment in a computer-based coaching environment in higher education : diagnostic assessment of development of knowledge and problem-solving skill in statistics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Zhidong, 1957-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Diagnostic cognitive assessment (DCA) was explored using Bayesian networks and evidence-centred design (ECD) in a statistics learning domain (ANOVA). The assessment environment simulates problem solving activities that occurred in a web-based statistics learning environment. The assessment model is composed of assessment constructs, and evidence models. Assessment constructs correspond to components of knowledge and procedural skill in a cognitive domain model and are represented as explanatory variables in the assessment model. Explanatory variables represent specific aspects of student's performance of assessment problems. Bayesian networks are used to connect the explanatory variables to the evidence variables. These links enable the network to propagate evidential information to explanatory model variables in the assessment model. The purpose of DCA is to infer cognitive components of knowledge and skill that have been mastered by a student. These inferences are realized probabilistically using the Bayesian network to estimate the likelihood that a student has mastered specific components of knowledge or skill based on observations of features of the student's performance of an assessment task. The objective of this study was to develop a Bayesian assessment model that implements DCA in a specific domain of statistics, and evaluate it in relation to its potential to achieve the objectives of DCA. This study applied a method for model development to the ANOVA score model domain to attain the objectives of the study. The results documented: (a) the process of model development in a specific domain; (b) the properties of the Bayesian assessment model; (c) the performance of the network in tracing students' progress towards mastery by using the model to successfully update the posterior probabilities; (d) the use of estimates of log odds ratios of likelihood of mastery as a measure of "progress toward mastery;" (e) the robustness of diagnostic inferences based on the network; and (f) the use of the Bayesian assessment model for diagnostic assessment with a sample of 20 students who completed the assessment tasks. The results indicated that the Bayesian assessment network provided valid diagnostic information about specific cognitive components, and was able to track development towards achieving mastery of learning goals.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq515.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh38b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cognition -- Testing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Statistics -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Data processing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848v56w"><dcterms:title>Long-term changes in the organization of lithic technology : a case study from the Imjin-Hantan River Area, Korea</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yoo, Yongwook, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is intended to furnish an explicability of hunter-gather's organizational model on the lithic technology. The fieldwork area is the Imjin-Hantan River Area (the IHRA) located at the midwestern part of the Korean Peninsula. The archaeological sites included in the fieldwork are Jangsanri (ca 0.2 Mya BP), Chongokni (ca 60 Kya BP), Juwolri, and Kawolri (younger than ca 50 Kya BP). In addition, a previously excavated Upper Palaeolithic assemblage of Janghungri (ca 23 Kya BP) is included in the quantitative analysis of lithic assemblages. For the background of the research area, chapter II is devoted to demonstrating the general environment of East Asia and current Quaternary research of Korea. Chapter III furnishes the basic knowledge on the geomorphological environment of the IHRA and the research history in this area for the last three decades was elaborated. Chapter IV is a description on the excavation fieldworks, introduction of the discovered lithic artifacts, and new age determination based on the K-Ar, IRSL, OSL, and AMS dating methods. Chapter V is the general characteristics on the IHRA lithic assemblage. Some descriptive details on the individual artifacts are presented and technological implications of lithic types are delineated. In addition, a general reduction sequence of the IHRA assemblage is proposed. Chapter VI is a quantitative analysis based on the exploratory data analysis (EDA); some geometric variables of artifacts were operationally defined for the purpose of acquiring more implicative analytical units. As a result of the analysis, it is revealed that the distinct interassemblage variability of raw material composition and of the morphological features of small tools and blanks constrained by differential reduction intensity can be explained in the context of the long-term-based strategic changes executed by the IHRA hominins. Chapter VII, based on the results from the fieldwork and lithic analysis, attempted to reconstruct the geological history of the IHRA in terms of hominid's land use patterns and relevant survival strategies. As a final remark, some unsolved issues were diagnosed and future research was expected for the continual research of the IHRA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j9478.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848v56w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Korea (South) -- Antiquities.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stone implements -- Korea (South).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225g31d"><dcterms:title>Asymmetric heavy-tailed distributions : theory and applications to finance and risk management</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhu, Dongming, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis focuses on construction, properties and estimation of asymmetric heavy-tailed distributions, as well as on their applications to financial modeling and risk measurement. First of all, we suggest a general procedure to construct a fully asymmetric distribution based on a symmetrically parametric distribution, and establish some natural relationships between the symmetric and asymmetric distributions. Then, three new classes of asymmetric distributions are proposed by using the procedure: the Asymmetric Exponential Power Distributions (AEPD), the Asymmetric Student-t Distributions (ASTD) and the Asymmetric Generalized t Distribution (AGTD). For the first two distributions, we give an interpretation of their parameters and explore basic properties of them, including moments, expected shortfall, characterization by the maximum entropy property, and the stochastic representation. Although neither distribution satisfies the regularity conditions under which the ML estimators have the usual asymptotics, due to a non-differentiable likelihood function, we nonetheless establish asymptotics for the full MLE of the parameters. A closed-form expression for the Fisher information matrix is derived, and Monte Carlo studies are provided. We also illustrate the usefulness of the GARCH-type models with the AEPD and ASTD innovations in the context of predicting downside market risk of financial assets and demonstrate their superiority over skew-normal and skew-Student's t GARCH models. Finally, two new classes of generalized extreme value distributions, which include Jenkinson's GEV (Generalized Extreme Value) distribution (Jenkinson, 1955) as special cases, are proposed by using the maximum entropy principle, and their properties are investigated in detail.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qp02f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225g31d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Risk assessment -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Finance -- Statistical methods.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7h149t81n"><dcterms:title>Robespierre und die unvollendete FranzÜsische Revolution im Werk von Gertrud Kolmar (1894-1943)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mutter, Gisela.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study deals with Gertrud Kolmar's literary texts, those that center upon the topic of the French Revolution. It endeavors to examine her poetic discourse dealing with the possibility of an alternative political leadership in a time of crisis. The texts comprise the essay "Bildnis Robespierres," the Robespierre cycle of poems, and the play Cecile Renault. These texts, in which Robespierre takes center stage, stand out from within the complete works of Kolmar. They were written between the fall of 1933 and March 1935 and may be read as texts of resistance against the Nazi dictatorship. Since these texts have to be seen as a direct reaction to the historical developments of the period, they are being closely examined herein, hoping to unearth their political and ideological intent. Drawing upon the theories and conclusions of New Historicism, which assumes that the writer and her subject cannot exist outside their socio-historical environment, important historical influences have been taken into consideration, in an effort to establish possible aspects that have entered into Kolmar's literary message. A close reading of these texts demonstrates that, by first using the genre of the essay, Kolmar searched for a positive alternative paradigm of power to counter the fascist totalitarian regime. She finds this ideal in the figure of Robespierre because of his virtue and strong sense of justice. Because Kolmar interprets the Revolution as incomplete--since the Jacobin adhered to his principles up to his death--these texts may be considered as a revolutionary call to take up the fight for human rights once again. In her poems, Kolmar poetically creates a model of ideal leadership in the figure of Robespierre. She propagates his strict and harsh rule, as he presented himself to his fellow citizens and accepts violence as necessary in order to establish justice. Thus, Kolmar's model is problematic, since it mirrors, and therefore, confirms the given dictatorial power structures of the National Socialists. In an attempt to justify the use of violence and force, Kolmar immerses her protagonist in the messianic-idea. In her play, she adheres to her model of Robespierre as a messianic figure. But in the light of the altruistic attributes and the fate of the young Cecile Renault, whom Robespierre sacrifices, he appears questioned in his role as the only possible redeemer figure. Therefore, this last Robespierre-text reveals an expanded awareness and an altered attitude of the author towards her historical environment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935715n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149t81n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Robespierre, Maximilien, 1758-1794 -- In literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kolmar, Gertrud, 1894-1943? -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>France -- History -- Revolution, 1789-1799 -- Literature and the revolution.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687n43v"><dcterms:title>Metadata for phonograph records : facilitating new forms of use and access</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lai, Catherine Wanwen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation presents a new metadata design, as part of a large digitization management system being developed, to assist in the consistent creation of digital libraries of phonograph records. The Metadata provides digital libraries with an effective tool for the description, discovery, management, control, delivery, and sharing of digital objects of phonograph record. The metadata design is the outcome of two pilot projects for the digitization of phonograph records that took place at the Marvin Duchow Music Library at McGill University. The new design offers an approach to maintaining and using digital sound and ensures the long-term viability of digital libraries of phonograph records. The dissertation discusses key areas of preservation and addresses the most common retrieval problems of music in digital libraries. These problems include challenges in the digital context of bibliographic control, cataloging, distribution, and copyright protection. The dissertation revisits traditional cataloging approaches, summarizes historical music cataloging and metadata development, sets up preservation principles and rationales for digitizing phonograph records, and presents state-of-the-art techniques for preserving phonograph records in the digital domain. The dissertation contains three main parts. The first is an introduction to the new metadata design for phonograph records. The second is a metadata dictionary, which assigns precise syntactic and semantic meanings to metadata elements, to guide digitizers working in libraries, archives, museums, and heritage sectors. These will be followed by two case studies of phonograph record digitization projects using the Metadata and the Data Dictionary. The dissertation concludes by examining three challenges that are critical to future development in both the preserving of and access to phonograph records: the issue of interoperability between different metadata standards, the need for usability and quality evaluation of digitization management systems, and the importance of further development in digital library retrieval services and tools.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v678w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687n43v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cataloging of audio-visual materials -- Standards.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metadata.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Digital libraries.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bk17v"><dcterms:title>Islamic law in Canada : marriage and divorce</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Manjikian, Sevak.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Islamic Law in Canada: Marriage and Divorce provides an analysis of how Canadian society and the Canadian judicial system have responded to the use of the Shari'a to resolve issues relating to Islamic marriage and divorce in Canada. This dissertation explores two instances where Canadian society has been forced to address the role of the Shari'a in Canada and its interaction with Canadian laws and values. The first involves the debate that took place in Ontario over the last decade concerning the use of Islamic arbitration in family matters. This public debate ultimately led to the rejection of faith-based arbitration in that province, a decision apparently consistent with traditional Canadian attitudes towards multiculturalism. The second area of interaction between Canadian and Islamic law is within the Canadian court system itself. In particular, Canadian judges are occasionally required to grapple with Islamic family law issues when rendering judgments on certain cases that appear before them. This dissertation will examine a number of such cases in order to illustrate how the Shari'a has been addressed by Canadian judges. The overall aim of this work is to situate Islamic law within Canada's liberal framework. It is argued that although Canadians are amenable to certain levels of diversity, values that fall outside mainstream liberalism are not granted recognition. This dissertation will also demonstrate that the failure to legitimize Islamic arbitration represents a lost opportunity that would have broadened the scope of Canadian justice to include minority voices. The decision to reject faith-based arbitration will motivate some Muslims to seek justice from ad-hoc bodies of authority. Devoid of government oversight, these forms of underground Islamic justice may negatively affect certain members of Canada's Muslim community.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dx65c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bk17v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Marriage law -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic law -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Divorce -- Law and legislation -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahq37vs79g"><dcterms:title>Morphological variability in second language Spanish</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McCarthy, Corrine Lee.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Research on morphological variability in second language (L2) acquisition has focused on the syntactic consequences of variability: that is, whether or not morphological variability entails underlying syntactic deficits. The interrelationship between morphological features in their own right has been largely ignored. This thesis addresses the representation of L2 features by investigating the use of default morphology---the outcome of systematic substitution errors employed by speakers of L2 Spanish. It is hypothesized that underspecified features act as defaults; by assumption, those features that are unmarked are underspecified. Evidence to support this hypothesis comes from two sets of experiments conducted on intermediate- and advanced-proficiency L2 Spanish subjects (L1 English). The first set of experiments addresses verbal morphology, and consists of a spontaneous production experiment on person, number, tense, and finiteness, and a comprehension task on person and number. The second set of experiments addresses gender and number in nominal morphology, and consists of a spontaneous production experiment on determiners, an elicited production experiment on clitics and adjectives, and a picture-selection task on the comprehension of clitics. Across tasks and across verbal and nominal domains, errors involve the systematic substitution of underspecified morphology. The observation that morphological variability extends to comprehension, and is qualitatively similar to the variability found in production, counters the suggestion that variability is strictly a product of mere performance limitations on production. Finally, the systematicity of substitution errors suggests that the natural classes of features such as gender, number, tense, and person are acquirable in an L2, regardless of whether or not these features have been instantiated in the native language.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795c98q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vs79g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Spanish language -- Study and teaching -- English speakers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Morphology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161b42k"><dcterms:title>Contributions to the modelling and control of two-wheeled mobile robots</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nasrallah, Danielle Sami.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Wheeled mobile robots moving on uneven terrain are attracting interest at an impressive pace. In the work reported here two distinct architectures of two-wheeled mobile robots are proposed. The first architecture, corresponding to the case where the two wheels linked by a frame lie in a vertical plane, constitutes the material of our earlier research and is laid out in the appendix. The system being unilaterally constrained by the environment, slipping or losing contact with the ground can occasionally occur. Therefore, nine distinct topologies are identified and accounted for in the model describing all the possible motion modes of the system. The mathematical model is formulated using the Natural Orthogonal Complement (NOC) and takes into account the terrain geometry. Additionally, the model includes necessary conditions for the switching between the distinct topologies. The second architecture pertains to an Anti-Tilting Outdoor Mobile robot, ATOM, composed of two spherical wheels and a cylindrical central body. The spherical shape of the wheels allows the robot to restore its posture after flipping over, thus giving it the anti-tilting property. Moreover, this particular shape ensures pure-rolling motion on uneven terrain without resorting to any adaptive structure; i.e., without increasing the complexity of the system. Here, also, the mathematical model is developed using the NOC, while taking into account the terrain geometry. Moreover, constraints on the terrain curvatures are derived in order to ensure pure rolling. Although the design of ATOM is simple, this brings about new challenges in terms of control. According to its structure, ATOM pertains to the class of Mobile Wheeled Pendulums (MWP). A feature common to MWPs, that is not encountered in other wheeled robots, is that their central body, which constitutes the platform of the robot, can rotate about the wheel axis. Therefore, aside the nonholonomy aspects encountered in conventional wheeled robots; the central body stabilization problem is pointed out here and rigorously treated in order to avoid unstable zero-dynamics. For that, an intrinsic dynamcal property, referred to as the natural behaviour of the system, is brought forward and employed to control the heading velocity of the robot using the inclination of the central body. Moreover, a particular selection of the generalized coordinates and the system outputs allows a global stabilization of the system without resorting to any linearization. Furthermore, a posture control (preceded by a velocity and orientation control) is proposed based on sliding mode and Lyapunov function for navigation. Finally, the robust aspect of the controller is underlined by showing the control behaviour versus an over/under estimation of system parameters.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698c933.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161b42k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax346d8292"><dcterms:title>Characterization of the Stachybotrys elegans' genes regulated during its interaction with Rhizoctonia solani</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morissette, Danielle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Stachybotrys elegans is a mycoparasite of the soilborne plant pathogen fungus Rhizoctonia solani. The mycoparasitic activity of S. elegans is correlated with the production of cell wall-degrading enzymes such as chitinases. This study details the cloning and characterization of the cDNA, sechi44, that encodes an extracellular endochitinase. The expression regulation of sechi44 was altered when S. elegans was in interaction with its host, R. solani, and also when the mycoparasite was grown on minimal media amended with different carbon and nitrogen sources. Direct contact with R. solani significantly upregulated sechi44 expression which followed a cyclical pattern suggesting that this gene has a role not only in mycoparasitism, but also in linear growth of the mycoparasite. The addition of high concentrations of glucose and ammonium triggered a decrease of sechi44 expression suggesting that sechi44 is subject to glucose and ammonium repression. In a separate study, several genes (1016 clones) whose transcription was substantially up-regulated during the mycoparasitic interaction were identified using SSH and microarray analysis. Twenty-five percent (261 clones) of these were sequenced and assigned to putative functions. Among them, 15 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified in R. solani whose functions were related to defense while the majority of ESTs were identified in S. elegans and assigned functions related to toxin metabolism, pathogenic process, stress response., multidrug resistance, apoptosis, transport, ATP synthesis, replication, transcription and DNA repair, translation, transduction, protein degradation, and ribosomal protein. The overexpression of 13 selected genes of S. elegans was validated and confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). The temporal gene expression of nine genes was monitored when the mycoparasite was grown on R. solani (host) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (non-host) mycelia and sclerotia. Some genes such as seglu, selec, and se151 were completely inhibited by the presence of non-host hyphae suggesting that these genes play an important role during mycoparasitism. Also, the absence of these corresponding transcripts suggests that the non-host produces transcription inhibitors. As expected, gene expression of cytochrome P450 was highly up-regulated early after germination of S. elegans conidia. This is in agreement with our finding in the EST data mining study, in which a role in toxin production was assigned to cytochrome P450.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945w13j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d8292</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stachybotrys elegans.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rhizoctonia solani -- Biological control.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956m16d"><dcterms:title>Breaking the ice : Qallunaat teachers' journeys to Nunavik</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mueller, Caroline.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This inquiry focuses on Qallunaat (non-native) teachers' perceptions of their lived experiences teaching and learning in the arctic region of Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. Academic underachievement of Inuit children and high drop out rates in northern schools are a great concern for every community. An important contributing factor to the lack of academic success of Inuit children is the high turnover rate of Qallunaat teachers. Social distancing, isolation and cultural dislocation are major problems that many southern teachers find difficult to confront. Through a year-long Action Research Project in Nunavik focusing on eight Qallunaat teachers, I used a narrative inquiry to explore these teachers' shifting perceptions of their experiences as they attempted to adapt to their Inuit host community. Data confirms that without appropriate preparation and support, Qallunaat teachers perceive that they face overwhelming challenges educating Inuit youth and building relationships with Inuit community members. During my work in this northern community, I observed how these teachers seeking direction within such significant cross-cultural tensions, were confronted with profound existential issues. I examined why their southern perceptions and their northern experiences made them question some fundamental values that are at the core of their identities. I used an interdisciplinary dialogical post-colonial framework to situate these Qallunaat teacher voices in the educational contexts of Nunavik. By listening to these teachers, I began to understand how conflicts in identity arose when teachers' attitudes did not match their perceptions of their positionings in their host community. Methods included formal and informal conversations, individual and group interviews, photovoice and journals. I found that Qallunaat teachers can contribute to the North if they learn to position themselves as compassionate observers and listeners. Through dialogue, Qallunaat teachers can create shared spaces to better understand the particular needs of Inuit community members and consider alternatives and solutions. I provide recommendations to the Kativik School Board that might better prepare and support Qallunaat teachers. This study has direct implications for policy regarding pre-service and in-service education for educators within the Kativik School Board, Quebec Ministry of Education and the McGill Faculty of Education.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kf95h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956m16d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teachers -- Québec (Province) -- Nunavik.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Teachers -- Attitudes -- Case studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
