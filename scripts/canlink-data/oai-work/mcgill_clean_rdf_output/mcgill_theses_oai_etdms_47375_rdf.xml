Besides quoting relevant bibliography, writings from the composer himself and recordings were used as sources. An overview of Prado’s biography and piano works sets the context of the present study. The correspondences between the musical text and extramusical references were identified in order to examine how the composer musically conveys such references. Performance implications of the associations were analyzed, providing suggestions for pianists who wish to perform these works.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gandelman, Salomea (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hc689.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zx30s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prado, Almeida.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Piano music -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236501h"><dcterms:title>Some psychological considerations in the education of superior children.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1928</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duckworth, John Martin Cumming.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis does not purport to present anything new on the subject of the education or superior chi1dren.

It was established as a specialized discipline at the end of the 1950s. In this paper, I argue that it has since developed into a hybrid discipline as composers and performers alike have pushed the technical and expressive boundaries to embrace the acoustic and the electronic, as well as the potential of dance and the dramatic or conceptual. The complex challenges posed by the repertoire are explored under three headings: sonic and physical organization, gesture, and rapid mastery. The paper then presents the results of three contrasting case studies that document how I have pushed the boundaries of performance practice in my work through different composer collaborations. The case studies are: 1. Aphasia-Dialogue (2014) by M. Applebaum (chor. by D. Espinosa) 2. 150pF for body capacitance (2014) by H. Morales and D. Espinosa 3. Six Drawings by Randall (2012) by D. Adamcyk and D. Espinosa These works expand the solo multi-percussion repertoire. Through the creation of new instruments and techniques, the works also heighten the possibilities of the performing body as a multi-faceted instrument that cuts across different artistic disciplines—music, the visual arts, and dance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferguson, Sean (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dj478.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2365032</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music and technology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Academic theses.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Performance art.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Percussion instruments -- Performance.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nd988"><dcterms:title>Contemporary Rock Formations: Rock Elements in Classical Music</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2015</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Krowicki, Marek</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Les oeuvres classiques contemporaines qui comblent le fossé entre la musique classique et rock peuvent le faire en incluant des éléments rock.

Mais si les compositeurs incluent des éléments rock dans leurs oeuvres, il devient important de pouvoir reconnaitre et catégoriser ceux-ci afin que l’interprétation puisse être juste et éclairée. Cette thèse propose d’étudier l’intégration de quelques éléments rock choisis dans deux oeuvres contemporaines classiques pour clavier: « Keyboard Triptych » par Steven Gellman pour synthétiseur et piano, 1 joueur, et « Piano Sonata No. 1 » par Kris Becker.

Inclusion of these elements has been generally frowned upon, as modern classical composers are encouraged to write music that is abstract, bizarre, and different from anything heard before. When composers do include rock elements in their music, it is important to be able to recognize and categorize these elements for an informed interpretation. This study examines the inclusion of selected rock elements in two contemporary classical keyboard pieces: Steven Gellman’s “Keyboard Triptych” for synthesizer and piano, 1 player, and Kris Becker’s “Piano Sonata No. 1”. The study serves as a guide for other performers exploring other rock-influenced works for a more complete picture of the music, discouraging blind focus solely on classical elements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hashimoto, Kyoko (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Biamonte, Nicole (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Stubley, Eleanor (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Laimmon, Sara (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816q33v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nd988</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Music -- 21st century -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Musical analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rock music -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- 20th century -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asj1394917"><dcterms:title>Public and private ownership in the hydro electricindustry of Canada.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1929</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kelland, Frank J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Certain significant factors in the hydro electric industry of Canada emphasize the importance of this industry and the part it plays in the nation's domestic and industrial life.

It should be added that to be 'insurance', the method used must be on an actuarial basis, although it need not be contributory. There are four main emergencies which Social Insurance is designed to provide against, namely: industrial accidents, sickness, unemployment and an impecunious old age. I shall in this monograph deal, first, with the theoretical aspect of Social Insurance, and, secondly, with the application of the principles to Canadian conditions. I shall limit the subject matter to a discussion of Workmen's Compensation, National Health Insurance, and Unemployment Insurance. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Forsey, E.

The wide range of the Canadian climate, both in time and place, both regular and irregular, throughout the Dominion, has always exercised a restrictive influence on Canada's economic and commercial life. Seasonal fluctuations, particularly in agriculture, construction, forestry, traffic and trade, inevitably mean a seasonal rise and fall in the volume of employment, which in turn entails variations, in time and place, of purchasing power.

Secondly, we may study the energy supply of the muscle, its source, and the manner in which it is made available. Our knowledge of the energy supply of the muscle has developed to the extent, that, in al1 probability, we know more or the reactions taking place in the muscle cells than of those in any other cells of animal tissue.

In eyery case investigated all three carbon atoms of the ring bear substituents.

It is true, however, that there are no organized schools among primitive peoples, but nevertheless there is education; schools were not necessary because education was largely incidental; in fact, education and living were almost synonymous. Any special training that had to be given was in the hands of the priest, medicine man, or tribal chief, but such training was of short duration and consisted mainly of an initiation ceremony given at puberty. As time went on the amount of specialised knowledge increased to such an extent that the communication of this knowledge was entrusted to one special person, the teacher. The child now had two types of education, the informal arid the formal. Until the Industrial Revolution informal education played an important part in every child's life, while formal education played a relatively unimportant part.

Biochemical investigation of their nature will give an indication of the organic synthetic processes which take place in the secretory cells producing them.
