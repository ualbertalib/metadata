These proteases share with the subtilisins the presence within their protein structure of a signal peptide, a prosegment, and a conserved catalytic region. However, they also possess additional P and COOH-terminal domains, which are not observed in subtilisins, but are present in their eucaryotic yeast counterpart, kexin. While the function of the P domain has been investigated, that of the COOH-terminal domain, excepting transmembrane and cytosolic tail structures of some convertases, remains unresolved. In the present manuscript, the convertases' COOH-terminal domain function was investigated through the studies of two models of multiple convertase isoforms. These isoforms, which arise through differential splicing, are structurally identical, except within their COOH-terminal region. Studies by protein overexpression in cultured mammalian cells of multiple Drosophila furin isoforms and analysis of the cleavage products generated by these enzymes in coexpression with different substrates permitted to demonstrate that structural modifications of the COOH-terminal domain do not affect the cleavage specificity of the adjoined protease. However, particular COOH-terminal assemblages may affect the processing efficiency displayed by these enzymes. Further cellular localization studies by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of two PC5 isoforms demonstrated that specific structural motives present in the COOH-terminal domain of these proteins are indeed implicated in the subcellular localization of these endoproteases, a fact which may ultimately affect their cleavage efficiency and substrate selectivity. In conclusion, in some convertases' COOH-terminal domains, distinctive structural motives are involved in the sorting of these endoproteases to the appropriate subcellular compartment(s), and likely influence the trafficking of these proteins through the secretory pathway.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Seidah, Nabil G.

What distinguishes SPOTT from other behavioral architectures is that it is able to guarantee task completion for navigational tasks under many different scenarios. SPOTT provides a bridge for linking behavioral (i.e., reactive) and symbolic control and has actually been interfaced with the logical reasoning system called COCOLOG. One of the roles of the symbolic reasoner is to help guarantee task completion in the situations where SPOTT is not able to solely do so. In essence, SPOTT is a real-time AI system which is responsible for dynamically adapting to changing environmental circumstances in order to successfully execute and complete a set of navigational tasks for an autonomous mobile robot. SPOTT consists of a behavioral controller, a local dynamic path planner, and a global path planner, as well as a map database and a graphical user interface. The behavioral control formalism is called TR+ and is based on an adaptation and extension of the Teleo-Reactive (TR) formalism. TR+ rules make decisions which affect actuator control and map database maintenance. A dynamic local path planner continually polls the map database in order to navigate around newly encountered obstacles. The local dynamic path planner is based on a potential field method using harmonic functions, which are guaranteed to have no spurious local minima. The global planning module advises the local planning module in order to position and project the global goal onto the local border. A real-time and parallel implementation of SPOTT using a message passing software package called PVM has been developed and tested across a collection of ten to fifteen heterogeneous workstations.

The normative impact of culture on international human rights is viewed from the perspective that culture is adaptive and flexible. African-lslamic culture, as exemplified by the Sudan, is no exception. The first part of this thesis advances a theoretical framework for recognition of cultural diversity and its impact on human rights. Recognition of change as an integral part of culture is vital for a successful mobilisation of internal cultural norms to the support of international human rights. An important conclusion is that ruling elites and those engaged in human rights violations have no valid claim of cultural legitimacy. The second part of the thesis examines the notion of human rights in traditional Africa and under Shari'a with a specific focus on conceptions of the individual, the nation-state and international law. It is argued that the African-Islamic context is an amalgam of both communitarianism and individualism; further, that the corrupt and oppressive nature of the nation-state in Islamic Africa demands an effective implementation of human rights as set out in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. It is suggested in the third part of the thesis that three of the rights included in the African Charter are paramount to effective human rights protection in Islamic Africa: the right to self-determination, the right to freedom of expression and the right to participate in public life. These rights are examined within the Sudanese context in order to provide a more concrete illustration of their potential implementation. The dynamics of Sudanese culture are explored to exemplify a culturally responsive implementation of these rights. This thesis contributes to the debate on the role of culture in enhancing the binding force of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It aims to inspire pragmatic discussion on the need for effective protection of human rights in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of Africans under existing ruthless and shameless regimes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Toope, Stephen J.

In the "mixed" transport regime where both mesoscopic and ballistic features play a role, for the first time I have analytically calculated the non-universal conductance fluctuations. This mixed regime is reached when impurities are distributed near the walls of a quantum wire, leaving the center region ballistic. I have discovered that the existence of a ballistic region destroys the universal conductance fluctuations. The crossover behavior of the fluctuation amplitude from the usual quasi-1D situation to that of the mixed regime is clearly revealed, and the role of various length scales are identified. My analytical predictions were confirmed by a direct numerical simulation by evaluating the Landauer formula. In another direction, I have made several studies of conductance or resistance oscillations and fluctuations in systems with artificial impurities in the ballistic regime. My calculation gave explanations of all the experimental results concerning the classical focusing peaks of the resistance versus magnetic field, the weak localization peak in a Sinai billiard system, the formation of a chaotic billiard, and predicted certain transport features which were indeed found experimentally. I have further extended the calculation to study the Hall resistance in a four-terminal quantum dot in which there is an antidot array. From my numerical data I analyzed the classical paths of electron motion and its quantum oscillations. The results compare well with recent experimental studies on similar systems. Since these billiard systems could provide quantum chaotic dynamics, I have made a detailed study of the consequence of such dynamics.

Stable transformation is induced by E1A in combination with the E1B gene or another oncogene such as activated Ras. E1B encodes two major proteins, 55K and 19K that are each able to transform cells in cooperation with E1A but with greater efficiency when both are present. The E1B-19K protein is believed to function in a manner homologous to the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene by preventing apoptosis which is induced by the E1A proteins. The E1B-55K protein binds to the p53 tumour suppressor and is believed to function by abrogating p53 activity. Apoptosis induced by E1A is believed to be caused by the increase in the levels of p53 and subsequent induction of p53-dependent programmed cell death. In the present studies, evidence is shown indicating that E1A-induced apoptosis during adenovirus type 5 infection can occur independently of p53 as well. The E1A gene encodes two major proteins, a 289-residue (289R) and 243-residue (243R) species which differ only by a unique 46 amino acid region in the larger polypeptide. This region corresponds to the CR3 domain of E1A which is a potent transactivation domain known to activate expression of many cellular and early viral genes. E1A-induced p53-independent apoptosis was found to be dependent on the expression of the 289R protein and the subsequent transactivation of one or more early viral genes. This p53-independent apoptosis can be blocked by the E1B-19K protein but not by 55K. As shown in previous studies, the 243R E1A protein was demonstrated to induce apoptosis that is dependent on p53. Direct evidence is provided here that E1B-55K can block p53-dependent apoptosis. The E1B-55K protein is believed to function by binding p53 tethering a transcriptional repression domain to p53. Mutants of 55K which cannot bind p53 are also deficient for transformation. In these studies, three phosphorylation sites have been mapped to a highly conserved region in the carboxy-terminus of 55K at positions Ser-490, Ser-491 and Thr-495. A mutant (pm 490/1/5A) in which these phosphorylation sites were converted to alanines resulted in 55K becoming completely defective for cooperation with E1A to transform primary cells. Interestingly, the pm490/1/5A mutant was still able to bind to p53 as efficiently as the wild-type protein. Previous work has shown the 55K protein possesses an intrinsic transcriptional repression activity when localized to promoters, such as by fusion with the GAL4-DNA-binding domain, even in the absence of p53. Such repression activity was found to be totally absent in the carboxy-terminal mutants of 55K. In addition, the phosphorylation mutants of 55K were completely deficient for blocking p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus phosphorylation of the 55K protein appears to regulate transformation, transcriptional repression, and apoptosis by the p53 tumour suppressor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, Philip E.

This mollusk may be a useful sentinel species for bioaccumulation of heavy metals and organic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. The zebra mussel's capacity to bioaccumulate cadmium at environmentally relevant exposure and to sequester metals in metal-binding proteins, metallothioneins, was investigated. Elevated (relative to control) concentrations of Cd$ sp{2+}$ were detected in Dreissena exposed to $ ge$2 $ mu$g Cd/liter suggesting that zebra mussels cannot regulate Cd$ sp{2+}$ of trace exposure concentration. More than 85% of the measured Cd$ sp{2+}$ was bound to metallothioneins. Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) was assessed as a model species for potential impacts of zebra mussels on higher trophic levels. The feasibility of incubating and rearing scaup in semi-natural conditions was evaluated. A series of biomarkers was assessed in 3 groups of scaup fed a contaminant-free diet or diets containing zebra mussels from the St-Lawrence River or Lake Erie. Lesser scaup proved to be a suitable species to raise in captivity providing daily water misting through out incubation and strict hygiene conditions during brooding. A hatching success of 89% was achieved. Appropriate housing, feeding and bathing conditions yielded low (3%) post-hatching mortality. Phagocytosis and respiratory burst activities of heterophils of scaup were suppressed after 6 weeks of feeding on zebra mussels, compared to the control group. These two heterophilic functions were negatively correlated with the incidence of pododermatitis (bacterial feet infection), suggesting a suppression of the non specific immunity. Increased liver/body mass ratio and decreased hepatic vitamin A (retinol and retinyl palmitate) concentrations were observed in scaups fed zebra mussels. Lipid accumulation and glycogen overload were found in the livers of scaups fed mussels from the St-Lawrence River and the Lake Erie groups, respectively. These immunological, biochemical and histopathological biomarkers show promise for monitoring "early" injury and may help in the understanding of health impairment of different species of waterfowl exposed to xenobiotics via contaminated food sources.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Whoriskey, Fred (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t75r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257g786</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water -- Pollution -- Toxicology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aythya -- Effect of water pollution on.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Halocarbons -- Toxicology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zebra mussel -- Effect of water pollution on.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h85g"><dcterms:title>Purification and characterization of collagenases from the skeletal muscle of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes Americanus)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Teruel, S.

The trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities of the crude extract diminished with purification. A comparative study of the collagenase fraction from ion-exchange chromatography (IEX-1) and the commercial collagenase fraction from Clostridium histolyticum indicated that the two enzymes were similar with respect to their response to temperature but differed with respect to their response to pH. The enzymes differed slightly in terms of their thermal and pH stabilities. The winter flounder collagenase fraction from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) had a higher optimum pH temperature than the IEX-1 fraction as well as the commercial collagenase. However, both SEC and the IEX-1 extracts had the same optimum pH. The collagenase fraction from SEC had a slightly lower thermal stability than the IEX-1 fraction and the commercial collagenase. The higher catalytic efficiency (V$ sb{ rm max}$/K$ sb{ rm m}$') and the lower $ Delta$G values for C. histolyticum collagenases showed that bacterial collagenases are better catalysts than winter flounder skeletal muscle collagenases for the PZ-peptide hydrolase reaction at 37$ sp circ$C and pH 7.1.

The enzyme activity in the presence of EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline were recovered upon addition of low levels of calcium and zinc ions, respectively.

To be effective as a toxin, MPTP must be metabolized by monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) to form MPP$ sp+.$ The latter compound leads to the degeneration of the dopaminergic cell bodies of the substantia nigra (SN) and striatal dopamine (DA) depletion that are reminescent of PD. The toxic effects of MPP$ sp+$ are related to the inhibition of NADH dehydrogenase activity in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This event leads to the rapid depletion of ATP synthesis and loss of membrane potential to further enhance free radical formations. Similar respiratory deficits are reported in PD. The major antioxidant enzymes in the CNS are superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and catalase (CAT). SOD catalyses the dismutation of superoxide (O$ sb2 sp{ cdot}$) radical into H$ sb2$O$ sb2$, while GSH-PX and CAT convert H$ sb2$O$ sb2$ to H$ sb2$O. Lipid peroxidation and SOD activity are increased in PD brains, whereas CAT and GSH-PX remain unchanged or reduced. This observation is suggestive of a deficiency in dealing with excessive H$ sb2$O$ sb2$ formation which exacerbates iron-catalysed free radical generations. To date however, it is unclear if the alteration in SOD activity observed in PD is sufficient to enhance free radical formation and, consequently, to increase lipid peroxidation. We were able to demonstrate that, despite marked alterations in SOD and CAT activities in the SN and striatum of MPTP-treated mice, lipid peroxidation remained unaffected. These results suggest that factors other than antioxidant enzymes play a pivotal role in the modulation of peroxidative damage to lipids as observed in PD.

The complex, comprised of three main intrusive centers, contains subvolcanic rocks, plutonic rocks, and localized occurrences of altered granite. In this study, the field, petrographic and mineral chemical characteristics of the complex are investigated, a model of evolution of the subvolcanic rocks is formulated, and the mode of genesis of the parental melt are proposed. The Fe-rich mafic minerals documented in the subvolcanic rocks suggest a comagmatic suite, and low f(O$ sb2)$ at the time of crystallization (ca. QFM). The subvolcanic rocks are inferred, from mica chemistry, to have equilibrated with a fluid phase characterized by low average $f sb{ rm(HF)}/f sb{ rm(HCl)}$ values ($10 sp{-1.74}$ at 773 K); values of the same ratio are higher in plutonic rocks (10$ sp{-0.67}$ at 673 K), and they are even higher values in the drusy and mineralized variants of the biotite granite. The occurrence of orthoclase, orthoclase + microcline, and microcline reflects decreases in the degree of undercooling, related to size of intrusive unit, and in the An content of sanidine$ rm sb{ss},$ which precluded complete ordering. The successful conversion of a monoclinic precursor to microcline indicates an increase in degree of volatile build-up and retention, and in extent of rock-fluid interactions in the subsolidus range of temperatures. The temperature of closure was between 450 and 300$ sp circ$C for orthoclase-bearing rocks, and between 450 and 300$ sp circ$C for those with microcline $ pm$ orthoclase. This granite also contains dark enclaves, formed by mingling of a hybrid magma with the evolved, but not on a scale that noticeably affected its geochemical features. Petrologic modelling of the felsic subvolcanic rocks show that the rock suite could have evolved by 29% Rayleigh fractionation of liquidus phases (cumulate: sanidine$ rm sb{ss}$: 88%, fayalite: 6%, hedenbergite: 5%, ilmenite: 1%). Trace element evolution requires 50% fractionation of the same phases. This disagreement, between the major and trace element models, results from the role of zircon, chevkinite, and allanite, not required in the major-element model. Selective trace-element enrichment followed by nonmodal melting of a lower crustal rocks, of granulitic composition, could produce the required parental melt by 20 to 60% melting.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Martin, Robert F.

This work investigates the binding of heavy metal ions (Cd, Cu, Zn), light metal ions (Ca, Na) and protons to biomass of the brown alga Sargassum. The mechanism of metal binding was confirmed to be ion exchange. A novel multi-component sorption isotherm model for cation binding was derived to aid in predicting the biosorption performance of the new biosorbent. This model considers chemical binding to free sites on the biomass and ion exchange (1:2 stoichiometry for divalent ions). It is based on chemical equilibrium constants and assumes competition of all cations for the same binding sites. Two main binding sites (carboxyl and sulfate) were characterized in terms of their respective quantities and pK$ rm sb{a}.$ Only two model parameters had to be determined for each metal cation (binding constants) and one additional parameter for each binding site (site quantity). The two-site model successfully described metal and proton binding at different pH in mono- and di-metal systems. It was possible to predict the complete equilibrium sorption state, residual metal concentration in solution and metal uptake by the biosorbent, from the known initial state for varying amounts of biomass and different initial pH values. In order to account for the effect of ionic strength and electrostatic attraction, the above mentioned biosorption model was expanded by incorporating a version of the Donnan model and/or a Gouy-Chapman double layer model. The charge density of the biomass was characterized and intrinsic binding constants were derived. Correlations to account for biosorbent particle swelling were established. For the specific case of linear increase of swelling with the number of free sites, an explicit sorption isotherm equation was derived that includes the Donnan model in an easy-to use-way. Using the parameters obtained from pH titrations at different ionic strength, it was possible to predict the effect of ionic strength on Cd binding. The influence of Ca on Cd binding was predicted from experiments with Cd and Ca, respectively, in mono-metal systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Volesky, B.

To investigate pulmonary monitoring techniques using pressure and flow signals, I developed a comprehensive computational model of subjects breathing spontaneously or with the support of an assist-ventilator. The model was used to quantitatively assess measurement techniques for dynamic intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP$ rm sb{i})$ and inspiratory work of breathing. The results demonstrate that some means of correction for both expiratory muscle activity and cardiogenic oscillations on esophageal pressure is necessary if dynamic PEEP$ rm sb{i}$ and work of breathing are to be measured accurately on-line. I also conclude that the discrepancies between static and dynamic PEEP$ rm sb{i}$ are caused by heterogeneity of the expiratory flow limitation. An adaptive filter to reduce the cardiogenic oscillations on esophageal pressure was developed and validated in a computer simulation. In four intensive care patients, the adaptive filter markedly attenuated the apparent cardiogenic oscillations and reduced the standard deviation of the measured PEEP$ rm sb{i}$ by 57%. Investigation of the interactions between patients and a pressure support ventilator using the computer model confirmed our present understanding of patient-ventilator asynchrony and indicated that patient and ventilator form a highly nonlinear dynamic system, so that the optimal ventilator settings most likely vary between patients and with time. In the second part of this thesis, I investigated the importance of inaccuracies in conventional Finite Elements for thoracic Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) imaging. Augmenting the number of first-order Finite Elements did not efficiently reduce these inaccuracies.

The 24-hydroxylase is the first enzyme in the C-24 oxidation pathway that degrades the vitamin D hormone to its final inactivation product, calcitroic acid. We demonstrated that: (i) the aberrant increase in 24-hydroxylase activity in Pi-deprived Hyp mice is specific to the kidney and is the result of an increase in enzyme Vmax, immunoreactive protein and mRNA abundance; (ii) the increase in 24-hydroxylase mRNA in both Pi-deprived Hyp mice and 1,25-(0H)$ sb2$D$ sb3$-treated normal littermates can be ascribed to an increase in the transcriptional activity of the 24-hydroxylase gene; (iii) 24-hydroxylase transcripts in normal mice, Pi-deprived Hyp and normal mice and 1,25-(OH)$ sb2$D$ sb3$-treated normal mice are localized to the proximal tubule by in situ hybridization; and (iv) recombinant human growth hormone administration normalizes the aberrant increase in 24-hydroxylase but that this response is not sufficient to correct serum 1,25-(OH)$ sb2$D$ sb3$ levels in Pi-deprived Hyp mice.

Considerable investigations have been conducted on, firstly, the characterization of the fracture topography and secondly, on the assessment of the influence of fracture topography on the mechanical behavior, particularly the dilatancy of the discontinuity. The studies of the mechanical behavior of fracture surfaces have invariably been concerned with the examination of the mechanics of the contact surfaces, to the virtual exclusion of the progress of failure zones into regions adjacent to the contacting fracture surfaces. This thesis conducts a computational assessment of the role of geomaterial plasticity and surface topography on the behavior of a fracture. The computational modelling takes accounts of the irregularity of the joint surface, the frictional and elasticity characteristics of the contact zones, the elasto-plastic failure of the material and incompatible deformations that arise during shear of an irregular fracture surface. The computational shear responses are compared for the cases where a regular fracture surface exhibits identical shear behavior in the presence of geomaterial plasticity. For an irregular joint, it is observed that the shear behavior is relatively unaffected by material plasticity. Variation of dilatancy with shear cycles, however, can be directly attributed to the presence of material plasticity. Plastic energy dissipation is related to the normal restraints specified. Shear behavior of a specific joint appears to depend mainly on the interfacial behavior of the limited number of asperity contact during shear. The surface geometry of these asperities governs the dilatancy and their slopes control the peak shear resistance. The thesis also examines briefly the influence of initial separation of joints on the shear behavior.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selvadurai, A. P. S.

The oxidation not only harms the operation by contributing to melt losses, but the processing of the oxides present in the melt and refractory is also costly in time and money. Refractory accretions formed due to the interactions between the oxide-layer and base refractory material, especially alumina-lined ones, are a significant problem for the industry. Aluminum alloys containing magnesium are known to oxidize much more easily and rapidly. In the foundry, oxidation of molten aluminum-magnesium alloy is more prominent than that of pure aluminum. Magnesium has a higher affinity for oxygen, causing it to oxidize more easily than aluminum. In previous studies of oxidation of aluminum alloys, it has been found that strontium additions to the alloy reduce the amount of oxidized layer in an undisturbed melt. The effects of strontium additions on the oxidation behavior of commercial A356, A357 and 5182 aluminum alloys were investigated by monitoring sample weight gains with time with a thermo-gravimetric balance at 700, 750, and 800°C. Sample surfaces were examined using electron microscope and x-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that in the absence of Sr, the A356 and A357 samples gained substantial amounts of weight through the preferential oxidation of magnesium. Samples containing strontium had significantly lower weight gains. For the high magnesium-containing 5182 alloy, an increase of incubation period before the onset of significant oxidation is associated with the presence of strontium. This change in oxidation behavior was linked to the presence of strontium containing oxide species in the oxidizing surface.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Drew, R. A. L.

The objective is to build a system that uses a passive sensor and an active viewer to accumulate information for disambiguating the depth sampling process involved in surface reconstruction. The viewer is considered to be restricted to a short baseline. Several ideas from the fields of optical flow, stereovision, and shape from motion will be drawn from and modified in the context of an active vision system. The thesis begins by examining the optical flow estimation problem. Several algorithms are compared under the novel heading of maximal estimation theory. Each algorithm is decomposed into three parts: pixel-estimation, sub-pixel estimation and confidence measurement. The components are compared separately. A flow algorithm is then obtained by combining different components. A Bayesian framework is adopted to provide a simple approach for propagating information in a bottom-up fashion in the system. This will also be used for combining information both temporally and spatially in the context of a Kalman filtering scheme. The last part of this thesis examines how an active component can be integrated into the system to provide quicker convergence to the depth estimate. This approach is based on statistical grouping of image gradient features. Synthetic and real experimental results are generated in each section. These results support ideas presented in the thesis, and suggest a basis for further research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, Frank P.

First, I designed and tested a stair-traversing controller, which allows RHex to ascend and descend a wide variety of human sized stairs. I tested the stair-ascending controller on nine different flights of stairs, and the stair-descending controller on four different flights of stairs. Rhex was run ten times on each flight, and met with only a single failure out of the one-hundred-and-thirty attempts. Second, we built and tested three competing leg designs. The second and third leg designs proved adequate for use on RHex, enabling dynamic and off road behaviors. The stair controller and leg design processes both drew on lessons from biology, in a process in we call "functional biomimesis". This framework guided us while we mimicked the functionally important features of animal morphology and behavior, while ignoring those features that are irrelevant to locomotion. We compared these advances with previous work in the field, including work on wheeled and tracked vehicles, as well as stair-traversing legged robots. Finally, RHex is a new robot, so we present an overview of RHex's basic mechanical and electrical designs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv387.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xg650</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193b662"><dcterms:title>The design of low-voltage high-frequency CMOS LC-based oscillators /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mostafa, Ahmed.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With the rapidly accelerating world of communications, there has been an increased interest in monolithic integration.

Through optimization of a simple LC oscillator, a 4 GHz circuit operating at a supply voltage as low as 0.85 V was implemented and measured. Optimization of a symmetric LC oscillator realized frequencies of 10 and 12.5 GHz. A novel oscillator architecture combining both high-frequency and low-voltage operation is also proposed in this thesis. This new oscillator structure allows for two tuning mechanisms, thus increasing the tuning range of the oscillator.

However, in a lossless network, the MS is always zero unless some lines are congested. Therefore, other ways to collect the required network revenue must be thought of.

These are simple to implement but suffer from drawbacks such as potential negative generator profits.
