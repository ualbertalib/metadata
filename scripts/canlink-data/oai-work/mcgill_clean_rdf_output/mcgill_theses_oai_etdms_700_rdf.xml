These tumors arise from the metanephric blastemal cells that do not follow the normal course of cellular differentiation, but instead continue along the path of proliferation. A Wilms' tumor predisposing gene, WT1, situated at 11p13 has been cloned and spans 50 kb of genomic DNA. It encodes a putative transcription factor, with an NH$ sb2$-terminus rich in proline and glutamine residues and a COOH-terminus composed of four zinc fingers of the Cys$ sb2$-His$ sb2$ type. The WT1 gene is alternatively spliced, giving rise to four mRNA and protein isoforms, encoding polypeptides ranging in size from 45-49 kDa. Although some Wilms' tumors occur in familial setting (1-2%), most cases occur as a sporadic form. Of the sporadic tumors analyzed to date for WT1 mutations, only the zinc finger domains have been evaluated.We have investigated the status of the complete WT1 gene in 101 tumors to document the frequency with which WT1 is mutated in sporadic and hereditary Wilms' tumors. We have identified homozygous, hemizygous and heterozygous mutations in 10 tumors, of which 7 were found to occur within the zinc finger domain. Our results indicate that the frequency of mutations (insertions, deletions, base substitutions) in sporadic tumors is $ sim$6%. We have been able to identify novel mutations in addition to already documented ones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pelletier, J.

However, the influence of parallel gliding in log frequency upon fusion is not understood. The present experiment investigated fusion in relation to different types of parallel and non-parallel log-frequency motion of three concurrent tonal glides. The main hypothesis was that parallel motion on log-frequency-by-time coordinates favors fusion. It was reasoned that a higher degree of fusion of the glides evokes fewer auditory images. Fusion was thus measured by asking eighteen subjects to rate the number of distinct sounds perceived in various gliding stimuli. On test trials, subjects received a pair of stimuli in succession and had to judge which one contained more sounds and to rate the size of the difference on a 7-point scale. Each stimulus was a complex of three sinusoidal tones, gliding in frequency. Each 1400-ms three-glide complex was either increasing or decreasing in frequency, and the spacing among its components was either small, medium or large. The stimuli were aligned in one of five ways: (1) harmonically related, parallel, and therefore unequally spaced in log frequency, (2) inharmonic, parallel, and equally spaced in log frequency, (3) inharmonic, parallel, and unequally spaced in log frequency, (4) non-parallel and diverging in log frequency, and (5) non-parallel and converging in log frequency. Results showed that more sources were perceived under the three parallel conditions than under the two non-parallel ones (p $&lt;$ 0.00001). Moreover, as the spacing between gliding partials increased, more distinct sounds were heard (p $&lt;$ 0.00001). These results suggest that both spectral spacing and non-parallel log-frequency motion segregate concurrent glides. A multiple regression analysis showed that parallel log-frequency gliding promotes fusion over and above the contribution of average spectral spacing and harmonicity (p $&lt;$.0001).

Intercrop yield can be improved by selecting for compatible cultivars and by efficient spacing arrangements of the component crops. A field experiment was conducted in the 1990 growing season to compare two spacing arrangements for the pepper/bean intercrop, to observe the effects of three bean cultivars on the system, and to examine whether there is any interaction between cropping system and bean cultivar. Three bean cultivars (Frenchie, Earliserve, and E-Z Pick), differing in their morphology and time to maturity, and one pepper cultivar (Hybrid Bell Boy) were used in the study. In the intercrop, the beans were sown at 50% of the optimum bean monocrop density while the peppers were planted at 100% or 50% of the optimum pepper monocrop density, resulting in 50:50 and 100:50 pepper/bean intercrop treatments. The experiment was repeated the following growing season with the addition of light transmission measurements, an $ sp{15}$N experiment to test for the possibility of nitrogen transfer, and the addition of three monocrop treatments (one for each cultivar) with the same intra-row spacing as in the intercrops. Beans were generally the dominant crop for both years. When compared to the optimum monocrops on a per plant basis, intercropping increased bean yields by 52% and 31% and decreased pepper yields by 49% and 21% in 1990 and 1991, respectively. The LER (Land Equivalent Ratio) ranged from 0.96 to 1.23 in 1990 and from 1.09 to 1.42 in 1991, with the 100:50 intercrops usually having the higher values. Frenchie and E-Z Pick were best suited for intercropping in 1990 and 1991, respectively. The overall increase in yields in intercropping was probably due to the larger bean intra-row spacing and the greater utilization of light, water and nutrients, as well as the increased population pressure in the 100:50 intercrop.

Theoretically, the two mechanisms can be segregated by delivering the stimulation during a naturally-triggered saccade (colliding saccade paradigm, Schlag-Rey et al., 1989), thereby creating a difference between the eyes' position at stimulation onset and their position at saccade outset. If derived from a retinal error signal, the electrically-evoked vector trajectory should be modified to compensate for the intervening change in eye position. If the saccade is derived from a motor error signal, the vector trajectory should be the same as when stimulating the same site while the eyes are immobile. This study describes the results of the application of the collision test in conjunction with the stimulation of 16 sites throughout the Superior Colliculus of 3 head-free cats. The main result of these tests--whether applied in conjunction with stimulation of superficial (where cells have visual activity) or deeper layers (where cells have motor activity) sites--is an absence of compensation indicating that the gaze saccades were derived from a motor error signal. Compensating saccades were only found in 6% of the cases with superficial layer stimulation sites while they were found in about 12% of the cases with deeper layer sites.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guilton, D.

CheA receives information regarding the chemical composition of the extracellular milieu from transmembrane chemoreceptor proteins and conveys this information to CheY, a cytoplasmic protein that directly influences the swimming behaviour of the cell. The research presented in this thesis focused on understanding the interaction of CheA with ATP and ADP; it led to our development of a minimal kinetic model describing CheA autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation and enabled determination of kinetic constants describing CheA-nucleotide interactions and phospho-transfer. This information was utilized to study the nature of two activating mutations generated in CheA; isolation and characterization of these mutants are described. Our results support the notion that modulation in CheA's autokinase activity may arise from conformational shifts in the protein that result in enhancements in CheA's affinity and intrinsic reactivity with ATP. Further studies were performed to examine the contribution of each CheA protomer to the mechanism of autophosphorylation that involves CheA dimers. Our results indicated that trans-phosphorylation between CheA protomers may involve catalytic residues that act both in cis and in trans to the autophosphorylation site and that the two protomers of a dimer make non-equivalent contributions to the ATP binding site. The effect of pH on CheA's kinase activity was also examined. The presence of two distinct proton dissociation events that affect CheA's activity in the absence of chemoreceptors is discussed in the context of the pH-taxis response of E.coli.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stewart, R.

The hypothesized policy-induced structural change is estimated through a dummy variable accounting for shift in supply associated with implementation of the policy. It is found that structural change induced by the restructuring policy shows a negative impact on the output supplied and welfare of society.

A clonal cytogenetic abnormality (i.e. the Philadelphia or Ph chromosome), resulting from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), is found in over 95% of patients. A hybrid gene is created at the breakpoint of Ph, derived from the ABL proto-oncogene (9q34) and from the BCR gene (22q11), which results in the expression of a 210 KDa fusion protein tyrosine kinase called P210BCR/ABL (P210). Expression of P210 alone is generally believed to be sufficient to induce chronic phase CML but, the deregulation of additional genes appears to be required for progression to CML blast crisis, as inferred by the presence of secondary cytogenetic abnormalities in over 80% of patients. To investigate the potential significance of P210 expression in the induction of genetic instability associated with CML progression, I studied cytogenetic changes in a murine cell line (32D) which expressed P210BCR/ABL from a retroviral vector. Using Giemsa-trypsin banding technique, I found a common marker chromosome t(4;12) in 13 subclones, a second new marker t(2;17) in 3/13 subclones and, additional clonal marker chromosomes in all of the subclones examined. Six subclones consisted of two or three karyotypically distinct cell populations. This study demonstrates that BCR/ABL can directly induce both numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities in hematopoietic cells. This murine cell model may provide a useful tool to further study the causal relationship of cytogenetic instability and cooperative molecular events involved in the initiation and progression of CML.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Laneuville, P.

The lithosphere is approximated by a thin layer having a uniform initial thickness, and the flow of material is assumed to be governed by a power law rheology. The solutions are calculated for velocity fields, crustal thickness distributions, stress and strain rate fields, and topography variations. The effects of the physical parameters (rheology, density etc.) are investigated through two non-dimensional parameters: n, the power law exponent in the constitutive relation between stress and strain rate, and Argand number Ar, which is a measure of the relative importance of the buoyancy force to the viscous force. The lack of deformation in central Iran and the southern Caspian block, is considered, by including lateral heterogeneities in the rheology of the lithosphere. The results show that heterogeneous models with non-Newtonian materials for n greater than 3 and $ rm1&lt;Ar&lt;10$ can best approximate tectonic features of Iran. The models are successful in providing reasonable agreement between the estimates of crustal thickness and strain rates, obtained from seismic observations, and those predicted from the theory.

These findings motivate a study of transport phenomena in multifractal media, particularly diffusion. In studying the diffusion properties of one-dimensional universal multifractal resistivity fields, a relation for the diffusion exponent $d sb{w}$ is derived and is found to depend only on $K(-1)$, the value of the moment scaling function $K(q)$ of the resistivity field for the $q=-1 sp{th}$ order statistical moment. This relation is subsequently verified through Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion on these systems. The one-to-one correspondence that exists between statistical moments and orders of singularity suggests that one order of singularity, namely $ gamma sb{-1}$, is of special importance to diffusion on multifractals, as is confirmed by simulations performed using fields that have been thresholded. Although convergence is quite slow, in the limit of an infinitely large range of scales a dynamical phase transition occurs about this particular singularity. The relation derived for the diffusion exponent breaks down for those multifractals where the $q=-1 sp{th}$ order moment diverges, which is typical of a multifractal phase transition. In these cases $d sb{w}$ must be estimated by taking into account the sample size.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lovejoy, Shaun (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t1248.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95052387</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53wx899"><dcterms:title>The protection of the newborn myocardium</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shum-Tim, Dominique</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Definitive repair of complex congenital cardiac defects in early life has become the recent trend in pediatric cardiac surgery.

Adequate protection of the heart, not only during the period of corrective surgery, but also certain pre-ischemic events remain of paramount importance to the success of these operations. Profound systemic hypothermia followed by total circulatory arrest is widely used for the correction of congenital cardiac defects in the newborn. It involves a period of cold systemic perfusion on cardiopulmonary bypass before circulatory arrest is established. Using an isolated perfused piglet heart model, the first study demonstrated that prolonged cold perfusion of the immature heart could be detrimental in itself. When followed by a period of ischemic arrest, it further potentiated the myocardial injury and induced severe irreversible contracture. Further extension of this study showed that verapamil administered prior to prearrest cold perfusion could indeed minimize the functional and ultrastructural damage of prolonged myocardial cooling.

The basic data model we develop, the one-pass, multi-channel, multi-dimensional autoregressive (OPMCTDAR) data model, describes data as the linear superposition of a causal, multi-channel, two-dimensional, deterministic AR filter with a stochastic innovation which is assumed to have minimum-variance, and to be uncorrelated and Gaussian. Two-pass and four-pass extension of this basic model (TP or FPMCTDAR) are also developed in this work as a generalization of the AR data models described by Gregotski (1989), Gregotski et al. (1991) and Jensen et al. (1990, 1993). Direct inversion for the parameters of the one-pass data model is employed in the inversion processes of two-pass and four-pass data models. Least-squares estimates of the causal AR filter coefficients are used to deconvolve original data sets to recover the assumed minimum-variance innovation process. Two-channel, two-dimensional synthetic data modelling examples are presented to prove the validity of this inversion scheme for these data models. I show that two-pass and four-pass inversion schemes extended from those of the corresponding single-channel case work for the only special cases of TP or FPMCTDAR data models. I employ two-dimensional z-transform for the mathematical derivation of the data models and the discussion on the stability of the multi-channel system functions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jensen, Olivia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97ks43d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vd51n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am326m385w"><dcterms:title>Unique immunologic determinants of neuroblastoma x spinal cord cell hybrids</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shaw, Ivan Ting-kun, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cell biology of the motor neuron--the cell targeted in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other human neurodegenerative diseases--is not well understood, partially since little is known of the molecules defining its phenotype. Using the motor neuron-like somatic cell hybrid NSC$ sb{34}$ (Cashman et al. 1992), we developed a panel of polyclonal antibodies recognizing unique epitopes on this cell line. Screening of a preliminary panel demonstrated that virtually all surface epitopes were shared with the N18TG2 neuroblastoma parent but following absorption of the antisera with N18TG2 cells, hybrid-specific surface reactivity was observed. A second panel generated in animals tolerized to N18TG2 showed similar hybrid-specific reactivity without requiring preabsorption. Immunoblotting revealed several unique NSC$ sb{34}$ bands ranging in size from 40 kDa to over 120 kDa, as well as several bands shared with N18TG2; parallel blots showed that these were not NCAM or neurofilament subunits. This antiserum also recognized epitopes of NG108-15 cells (Nirenberg et al. 1983) induced into a motor neuronal phenotype, suggesting that some of the NSC$ sb{34}$ gene products have a role in motor neuron function. Digestion of cell homogenates with endoglycosidases prior to immunoblotting eliminated the NSC$ sb{34}$ reactivity, suggesting that all unique NSC$ sb{34}$ epitopes (including those cross-reactive with induced NG108-15) were localized to glycoconjugates. Our work indicates that it is possible to characterize the molecules of the motor neuron phenotype, but that the focus may have to shift from searching for unique proteins to unique glycoconjugates or (protein)-carbohydrate combinations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cashman, Neil R.

The selections were conducted at the E. A. Lods Agronomy Research Center of Macdonald Campus of McGill University from 1984 to 1988. Individual plant selections were based on dry matter yields of 25 plants. Within each of 16 grids, the five highest yielding genotypes were selected (i.e. 80 genotypes overall) and allowed to interpollinate. Equal weights of seeds from each of the 80 selected plants were mixed in each cycle. Evaluation trials were carried out in both sward and spaced stand from 1989 to 1993 to assess the effectiveness of selection in improving dry matter yield. Several other morphological and physiological characteristics of cycles were recorded to find possible associated changes. Three cycles of RRPS were not effective in increasing forage dry matter yields. The lack of response may be due to a narrow genetic base in the source populations and/or the population size under selection may have been too small, resulting in inbreeding depression. Another explanation for the ineffective selection may be non-random pollination among selected plants. The selection for forage yield produced some minor changes in other characteristics. There was a tendency towards increased plant height and circumference in orchardgrass; however, for timothy, height and circumference were reduced by selection. Cycle 3 of Avon orchardgrass was one day later in maturity and there was also a tendency for later maturity for timothy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Coulman, B. E.

Two experiments are presented, exploring the sensitivity of 20 children, aged 2;11 to 3;11 (mean 3;6), to changes in adjective interpretation across unrelated and related kinds. For instance, children were tested on their understanding that a nonsense adjective picked out sub-kinds of toy bears and balls on the basis of unrelated attributes. They were also tested on their understanding that the opposites "big" and "little" could describe the same individual object when typed by basic level and superordinate level kinds (e.g. that a little bat could be a big toy). Children's responses were near perfect, indicating that the basic logical framework for predicable interpretation used by adults is in place by age three.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macnamara, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v71b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bw535</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Language.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Adjective</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692t8343"><dcterms:title>Risk factors for Wilms' tumour : analysis of a case-control study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sharpe, Colin R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Brazilian Wilms' Tumor Study Group carried out a case-control study of Wilms' tumour (WT) to identify risk factors for the development of WT.

Pediatricians interviewed parents of 109 cases and 218 controls. Increasing levels of parental education and family income were associated with the diagnosis of WT, probably the result of selecting a hospitalized control group. The positive association between high family income and WT was strongest among the cases diagnosed early, and absent among the cases diagnosed late. Parental occupational exposure to pesticides or herbicides before the pregnancies of the subjects was identified as a risk factor, with a significant trend for increasing risk with increasing cumulative frequency of use. Also identified as risk factors were maternal consumption during the pregnancy of coffee in excess of 2 cups/day and of dipyrone, an analgesic (both among the lowest income group), and of alcoholic beverages (among the most educated).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franco, Eduardo L.

The DSC runs revealed that the samples were made up of two different types: one showing no glass transition and a lower crystallization temperature, and the other showing a distinct glass transition with a higher crystallization temperature indicating that they are truly homogeneous glasses. The samples showed a Young's modulus that does not seem to reveal any distinct compositional dependence whereas, the tensile strengths showed a distinct decreasing trend with increasing Y content. Values of various mechanical properties and crystallization temperatures obtained in this study are compared to those reported by other groups. We find very high specific strengths in these glasses, which combined with their excellent ductility makes them ideal structural materials. The effect of annealing is also examined and it is found that the samples lose a large proportion of their tensile strength and ductility when annealed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Altounian, Z.

We also studied the effect of methionine the immediate precursor of SAM. Administration of methionine to the rat increases brain SAM, but little is known about its behavioral effects. Long-Evans rats were given SAM and methionine orally at different doses and tail-flick latency was measured at various times. Both methionine and SAM increased tail-flick latency, but methionine did so at a lower dose. A biochemical study showed that methionine was more effective than SAM in raising brain SAM probably because it is transported better into brain. The biochemical measurements were not consistent with the idea that the effects of SAM and methionine were mediated by an increase in brain 5-HT. Folate deficiency can lower brain SAM levels and cause depression. Thus, methionine, which raises brain SAM, may overcome the effects of folate deficiency. Seven day food records were done by 26 psychiatric outpatients who were stable on lithium treatment. Eight patients had mean daily folate intakes below those recommended. Some of those with low folate intake had high methionine intake consistent with the idea that methionine could substitute metabolically for folate deficiency. Daily methionine intakes ranged from 13 to 304% of the recommended intake. As methionine had behavioral effects in the rat at doses much less than the daily dietary intake this raises the question of whether varying daily intakes of methionine in humans have behavioral implications.

In the small intestine, the establishment of an electrochemical Na+ gradient at the apical membrane of the villus absorptive cell is crucial for net nutrient and electrolyte absorption. Na,K-ATPase is made up of a large (112KDa) catalytic $ alpha$ subunit, and a glycosylated (35KDa) $ beta$ subunit. Thus far, 3 isoforms for both the $ alpha$ and $ beta$ subunit have been described. We sought to characterize both age-related changes and regional changes in levels of small intestinal Na-K ATPase activity and subunit isoform expression (except $ beta$3) during the postnatal development of the rat. In the proximal small intestine, the specific activity of Na,K-ATPase measured in subcellular fractions gradually rose, while in the distal segment, this rise was less marked. A proximal to distal gradient in Na,K-ATPase activity was demonstrated in post-weaned rats. Only $ alpha$1 and $ beta$1 subunit isoforms were detectable by Western blotting and their expression paralleled the age-specific and regional changes observed in the levels of Na,K-ATPase activity. In addition, the glycoprotein $ beta$1 demonstrated an increase in molecular weight during ontogenesis. The results of this study show important changes in the activity and subunit isoform expression of the Na,K-ATPase during postnatal development of the rat.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wild, Gary E.

By virtue of identity-related assumptions including 'nation-state', 'nationalism', and 'sovereignty', which rest on an exclusive binary distinction between "self" and "other", this foundation is inadequate and anachronistic as a theoretical lens through which to understand the dynamics of contemporary Europe. Chapter 1 reveals the inadequacy of existing theories of European integration, and Chapter 2 traces this inadequacy to the issue of identity, tying it in with a modern identity crisis. It is argued that the theory and practice of European integration in the 1990's depends on a fundamental reconceptualisation of identity, to eliminate the conceptual rigidity of exclusive self/other binary distinction, and so to provide the basis for a new kind of European identity. In Chapter 3, the framework of a new "non-fixed", "non-essential" and pragmatic identity (and therefore European identity), beyond the self/other boundaries of contemporary thought, is elaborated through the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida, and its effect on the study and practice of European integration is assessed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c890.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br492</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>European federation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Europe -- Economic integration</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s440d"><dcterms:title>In the presence of mine enemies : anti-semitism in the Alberta Social Credit Party</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stingel, Janine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines anti-Semitism in the Alberta Social Credit Party under the Aberhart and Manning regimes. It is based on various archival sources from the Glenbow Archives-Institute in Calgary, Alberta, the Premiers' Papers at the Provincial Archives of Alberta in Edmonton, contemporary press reports, and the Social Credit Party's national organ, the Canadian Social Crediter. It argues that anti-Semitism in the Alberta Social Credit Party was not the purview of a marginal, extreme wing of the Party, but that it was an integral element of Social Credit ideology. This ideology was espoused by most Social Crediters, including premiers Aberhart and Manning. When Ernest Manning purged the Movement of its anti-Semites in 1947-1948, he was attempting, unsuccessfully, to eradicate the very essence of Social Credit ideology. The consequence of thirty-six years of Social Credit rule is the persistence of an Albertan political culture which breeds provincialism and intolerance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zucchi, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw54f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s440d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alberta Social Credit Party</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antisemitism -- Alberta</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rg47q"><dcterms:title>Female bodies, male politics : women and the female circumcision controversy in Kenyan colonial discourse</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Snively, Judith</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the end of the 1920s in Kenya, Protestant Missionaries, government authorities and Christian Kikuyu clashed when missionaries sought to prohibit female circumcision among their adherents. The mission discourse emphasised the negative moral and physical effects of female circumcision on individual women, while that of the government stressed the function of female circumcision in maintaining the body-politic. The colonial discourse, as whole, is marked by a striking division between issues concerning women and those deemed political. Thus, women seldom appear as actors in historical narratives of the female circumcision controversy, which is generally represented as a nationalist movement initiated by, and of concern to, men. This thesis presents alternate readings of the relevant colonial records. By examining the processes that functioned to exclude women from the political discourse it provides a different interpretation of the controversy as one in which women did indeed play a central political role, indirectly controlling the issue through men, who were regarded by the colonialists as the legitimate representatives of tribal interests. The thesis explores indirect methods of eliciting the perspectives of women which are muted or absent from the historical record.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galaty, John G.
