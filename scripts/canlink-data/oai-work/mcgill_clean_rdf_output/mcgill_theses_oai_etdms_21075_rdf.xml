The method was demonstrated using 3-O-allyl-sn-glycerol 33 which was regiospecifically converted to 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-O-TBDMS-stearoyl)-3-O-allyl-sn-glycerol 43 by the sequential acylation of the primary and secondary hydroxyls. The allyl group was removed in two steps by isomerization to a vinyl ether and hydrolysis with N-bromosuccinimide in aqueous tetrahydrofuran. A new method for the conversion of the 1,2-diacylglycerols to phosphatidylcholines under acid-catalyzed conditions was developed. The diacylglycerols were treated with (2-bromoethyl)-($ 2$-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-phosphoramidite 51 in the presence of tetrazole as catalyst, the phosphite triester was oxidized, and the neutral phosphate triester was treated with trimethylamine to simultaneously deprotect the phosphate and convert the bromoethyl substituent to the choline function. A modification was introduced to extend the synthetic strategy to unsaturated phosphatidylcholines. The starting material was 3-(4-methoxybenzyl)-sn-glycerol 30 (3-PMB-sn-glycerol). Diacylation of the hydroxyls with 13-tetradecynoic acid 64a followed by Glaser oxidation gave 1,2-(13,15-octacosadiyn-1-28-dioyl)-3-PMB-sn-glycerol 66. The 4-methoxybenzyl ether was cleaved using bromodimethylborane at $-$78$ sp circ$C in methylene chloride. The diacylglycerol 67 was converted to the phosphatidylcholine as before. Sequential acylation of 30 with palmitic acid and 15-hexadecynoic acid 64b followed by Glaser oxidation gave 2,2$ sp prime$-(15,17-dotriacontadiyn-1,32-dioyl)-bis- (1-palmitoyl-3-PMB-sn-glycerol) 72, which was converted to the bis-phosphatidylcholine 75 in the same manner as 66.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8060615.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977v70v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z162q"><dcterms:title>Contrasting origins of Sn-W mineralization in western Thailand</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Linnen, Robert L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Investigations of pegmatite, stockwork and replacement deposits, using geological, whole-rock and mineral chemistry, fluid inclusion, and stable isotope data, were undertaken to establish some of the controls of mineralization in the western Thai Sn-W belt.

Limited data on the Takua Pit Thong replacement suggest that cassiterite was deposited from aqueous fluids at $ ge$500$ sp circ$C, but metamorphic aqueous-carbonic fluids were also involved. The depth of emplacement was one of the major controls on mineralization style.

But these individuals, mostly defenders of President Truman's foreign policy, also believed in this cold war context that an attenuation of restrictionism in immigration would provide numerous advantages to the nation. If their attitude seems dictated by considerations that were both pragmatic and idealistic, it generated non-negligible results. Thus, the granting of a quota to India in 1946, the act on the war brides in 1945, as well as the legislation affecting the refugees in 1950, were among the measures mainly ascribable to the activities of these politicians.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf378.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm80w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>New York (State) -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>New York (State) -- Politics and government -- 1865-1950</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w311h"><dcterms:title>Independent and correlated properties in artifact and natural kind concepts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McRae, Ken, 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The roles of independent and correlated properties in real world object concepts were explored.

Friends' deviance is a consistent correlate of adolescent deviance, yet the quality of the friendship within which deviance occurs has not been assumed to have any bearing on its incidence. The development of egalitarian relationships at adolescence is theorized to promote social and emotional maturity, qualities that could inhibit deviance. This research examined whether the quality of friendships inhibits adolescent deviance and also whether it modifies the expected association between adolescents' and friends' deviance. The quality of parent-adolescent relations is consistently linked to adolescent deviance, but is considerably less influential if contrasted to friends' deviance. This research sought to determine whether the quality of parent-adolescent relationships modifies the expected correlation between adolescents' and friends' deviance and whether the effect holds if parents themselves are deviant. Subjects were assessed in Grade 7 (N = 173) for general deviance and again in Grade 10 (N = 167) for alcohol use. A subsample of 131 were analyzed for long-term effects. In all analyses, friends' deviance, as expected, emerged as the most significant correlate of adolescent deviance, particularly for males. The quality of friendship was not found to be related to deviance at Grade 7, but was associated with lower drinking at Grade 10 for adolescents who had drinking friends. Additionally, longitudinal analyses showed that adolescents who had deviant friends at Grade 7 and whose friendships were of poor quality were at risk for later drinking. The quality of parent-adolescent relations modified the effect of deviant friends for females at Grade 7, but did not predict drinking at Grade 10.

The chlorotriphenylmethyl sulfides were found to decompose in the presence of 1,3-dienes to yield products which are consistent with the trapping of diatomic sulfur. The reactions of the chloro(triphenylmethyl)sulfides were examined and used to prepare a series of mixed sulfides containing 1-4 sulfurs. A novel extrusion of sulfur in the reaction of chloro(triphenylmethyl)monosulfide with thiocarbonyl compounds was investigated. The thermal decomposition of the sulfides as solids and in solution were examined. The solvent dependent desulfurization of sulfenic sulfonic thioanhydrides was investigated in the anticipation of discovering a diatomic sulfur intermediate. The extrusion was shown to involve the concatenation of sulfur atoms until a stable sulfur ring could be extruded. The X-ray crystal structure of bis(triphenylmethyl)disulfide was determined and was discussed in relation to other hindered disulfides.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt445.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s255</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010q87p"><dcterms:title>The confessional and apologetic aspects of Gordon Kaufman's thought : an interpretation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stoesz, Donald B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several contemporary theologians have maintained that the proper setting for Christian theology is an ecclesiastical one.

Other have argued that this circumscribed "confessional" approach is not enough. Biblical stories and religious convictions are not only rooted in faith communities but are also reflected in universal concerns. The reciprocal relationship between text and reader, church and world, requires a broadly-based "apologetic" method. These two models are used to evaluate Gordon Kaufman's epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, and theologies of revelation, divine agency, and construction. One of the surprising discoveries of this dissertation is that his relative theory of knowledge and employment of a Christian categorial scheme undergird a confessional approach. The thesis nevertheless concludes that his thought is oriented towards a realistic empirical method. The discussion ends with a recommendation that Kaufman link his apologetic concerns to a more identifiable corporeal structure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c132k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q87p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Theology, Doctrinal -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kaufman, Gordon D.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182m00x"><dcterms:title>"I have set the land before you": a study of the rhetoric of Deuteronomy 1-3</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Slater, Susan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation inquires into the introductory character of Deuteronomy 1-3 through a study of its rhetoric.

This neuropeptide hormone plays important roles in the physiology of reproduction. The gene encoding OT has been cloned in several species including human, rat, cow and, most recently, mouse. Although the gene sequences were known for some time, no information about the mechanisms regulating the OT gene promoter in any of the species has become available. This has been due, in part, to the absence of a cellular system expressing the endogenous OT gene. As a first step, the present thesis research was oriented towards the identification of a suitable cellular system for the investigation of OT gene expression. The cell line which responded to these needs was the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a. In these cells, the transfected human OT gene promoter was highly active as opposed to all the other neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines tested. Using this system, we began investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone induced and cell-specific expression of the OT gene. First, we determined that the OT gene promoter is regulated by estrogens. By 5$ sp prime$ and 3$ sp prime$ deletion analyses, we identified an estrogen response element (ERE) at position $-$164 to $-$152 which bears resemblance to the ERE consensus sequence. This ERE is necessary and sufficient for mediating the estrogen induction of the human OT gene promoter. The sequence of the ERE is GGTGACCTTGACC, and the underlined nucleotide represents the deviation from the perfectly palindromic ERE consensus sequence. By testing the effect of other members of the steroid hormone receptor family on the OT gene promoter, we found that the promoter responded strongly to retinoic acid (RA). Mapping of the RA response element (RARE) showed that four direct repeats of TGACC motifs were required for optimal RA induction. Interestingly, two of these TGACC repeats are contained within the ERE, whereas the other TGACC repeats are located downstream of the ERE. When the estrogen and RA treatments were performed simultaneously, additive and interfering interactions were observed. Additive effects resulted when the ERE and RARE were intact in the human OT promoter. By contrast, RA repressed estrogen induction by 50% when one of the two downstream TGACC repeats was mutated. Therefore, we speculate that in the latter case, the RA receptor forms in the presence of RA, an inactive complex with the two TGACC motifs that overlap the ERE and thus, prevents the estrogen receptor from forming a transcriptionally active complex with the ERE. The specific expression of the human OT promoter in Neuro-2a cells was shown to involve three cell-specific DNA elements located in the proximal promoter region between $-$49 to +36. These cell-specific elements, referred to as PPE 1, 2 and 3, are crucial for the elevated baseline expression observed in Neuro-2a cells. All these three elements contain highly conserved regions among species. Of note, PPE 2 contains the purine rich sequence GAGAGA which resembles the binding site for the GAGA factor and for the transcription factor PU.1. Each of three proximal promoter elements bound a specific factor(s) from Neuro-2a nuclear extracts, as assayed by gel-retardation. Moreover, PPE 1, 2 and 3 could synergize with the ERE or with the human metallothionein II$ sb{ rm A}$ glucocorticoid response element.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r870h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pd72f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q233p"><dcterms:title>Women telling stories about reality : subjectivity, the generation of meaning and the organizing of a union at Yale</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gregg, Nina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This qualitative study of women's responses to the organizing of Local 34 at Yale University provides an empirical grounding for feminist theorizing of women's generation of meaning. Based on interviews with clerical and technical workers, the study illuminates the relationship between experiences and meaning. Subjectivities of gender, race and class contribute to meanings made and actions taken by union supporters and opponents in the context of social change. Building upon feminist theory, the study suggests that the relationship between experience and meaning is a basis for action. The interviews offer examples of women's negotiation of multiple subject positions as they seek to sustain their identities in their responses to the possibility for change represented by the union. The research method, itself an encounter between subjectivities, undergoes scrutiny as a meaning-generating practice with implications for feminist theory and politics. Assessment of the strategic value for feminism of identity politics points to the exclusionary effect of appealing to a unified identity against which subjectivities work, whereas a politics of location admits the many positions from and within which meanings are made. The study builds upon and extends the analytic tools and insights of feminist theory and contributes to feminist strategies for social change. Rather than reinforcing the expected classifications of pro- and anti-union women, of working and middle-class women, of white women and women of color, this project calls for looking beyond these categories in order to build theories and practices that accommodate the specificity as well as the commonalities of women's lives.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sd49d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q233p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Communication</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meaning (Philosophy)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r3823"><dcterms:title>Copper matte vacuum purification</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Allaire, André</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An investigation of copper matte vacuum purification was undertaken.

The model was used to predict the overall refining rates for variables such as temperature, matte grade, oxygen activity and chamber pressure of the melt. A series of experiments was undertaken to characterize the dust produced during vacuum refining of copper matte. An attempt to selectively condense the vapours produced during the vacuum refining experiments was carried out. The "Lift-Spray" vacuum refining process was used to refine 15 to 40 kg batches of molten copper matte containing 35 to 78% copper. The removal rates of lead, bismuth, arsenic, antimony, selenium, nickel and silver were measured under different levels of matte grade, chamber pressure, lifting gas flow rate and dissolved oxygen content in the melt. The ranges of the variables under study were from 10 to 600 pascals chamber pressure, 0 to 40 normal milliliter per second of lifting gas flow rate and 10$ sp{-16}$ to 10$ sp{-7}$ atmosphere of oxygen activity. In conclusion, LSV refining of copper matte was shown to be a promising process. Furthermore, scale-up to industrial size is now possible. The scale-up dimensions compare well to the dimensions of the RH degassing unit presently used in the steel industry.

This thesis examined effects of EAAs and modulators of EAA receptor activity on the release of ($ sp3$H) dopamine ( ($ sp3$H) DA) from dissociated cell cultures of ventral mesencephalon. The results provide evidence that multiple EAA receptor subtypes are present on DA-releasing neurons and participate in regulating this release. NMDA, quisqualate and kainate, preferred agonists for respectively named EAA receptor subtypes, stimulated Ca$ sp{2+}$-dependent, tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive ($ sp3$H) DA release, with 3 distinct profiles of sensitivity to antagonists and of ontogenic development in culture. Low concentrations of the endogenous EAAs, glutamate, homocysteate, homocysteine sulfinate, cysteate and cysteine sulfinate evoked Ca$ sp{2+}$-dependent ($ sp3$H) DA release through activation of NMDA receptors, although non-NMDA receptors mediated effects of these agonists at higher concentrations ($ geq$100 $ mu$M, depending upon the EAA tested). Aspartate induced ($ sp3$H) DA release that was mediated solely by the NMDA receptor. Glycine potentiated NMDA-evoked ($ sp3$H) DA release when the test was made under nominally Mg$ sp{2+}$-free conditions, but caused strychnine-sensitive inhibition of the NMDA response in the presence of 1.2 mM Mg$ sp{2+}$. It is suggested that these results demonstrate how voltage-dependent blockade of the NMDA receptor by Mg$ sp{2+}$ may regulate sensitivity of NMDA responses to convergent inputs. Micromolar concentrations of the psychotomimetic agent, phencyclidine (PCP) blocked NMDA-evoked ($ sp3$H) DA release. At higher concentrations ($ geq$100 $ mu$M), PCP-related compounds stimulated TTX-insensitive ($ sp3$H) DA release. This stimulatory effect was not due to actions of these compounds at the PCP/NMDA receptor, sigma binding site, dopamine uptake site, or cation channels for Ca$ sp{2+}$ or Na$ sp{+}$, but may have been caused by K$ sp{+}$ channel blockade.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w8137.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kt60q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah989r384n"><dcterms:title>Mechanisms of airway narrowing during allergic responses in the rat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Du, Tao</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mechanisms of allergen induced airway narrowing, during allergen induced early (ER) and late (LR) responses, and airway hyperresponsiveness were investigated in vivo using the ovalbumin (OA) sensitized Brown Norway (BN) rat. ER and LR were induced by aerosolized OA. The lungs were fixed using a quick-freezing technique to maintain the pathological alterations as close as possible to their in vivo conditions. The results from both morphologic and morphometric studies showed that during the ER and LR, airway narrowing was mainly caused by airway smooth muscle contraction, but not by airway wall thickening or mucus. These findings were supported by intravenous administration of Evans blue which was used as a measure of vascular leakage. The degree of airway narrowing during the early response was greater in the large intrapulmonary airways than in the small intrapulmonary airways. Airway narrowing during the late response was limited to the large intrapulmonary airways. These findings were closely related to the mast cell distribution which progressively increased from small to large intrapulmonary airways in normal BN rats. These findings suggests that mast cells may play an important role in both early or late responses. In order to study structural mechanisms of airway hyperresponsiveness, increased airway responses to inhaled methacholine were induced by repeated inhalational challenge of sensitized BN rats with OA. Quantitation of airway smooth muscle, airway wall area and epithelial area demonstrated that increased airway hyperresponsiveness was associated with the increased amount of airway smooth muscle but not with airway wall thickening. There was a correlation between the quantity of airway smooth muscle in large airways and the change in airway hyperresponsiveness. Hence, it is possible that an altered quantity of airway smooth muscle is an important mechanical contributor to airway narrowing in human allergic asthma.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr01d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r384n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f2028"><dcterms:title>Investigation of a closed-loop thermosyphon</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bernier, M.

A new model is proposed to couple the local results of numerical simulations performed in the heated and cooled section of a thermosyphon with a one-dimensional analytical model. The numerical simulations are based on a finite-volume numerical method which was formulated for the solution of laminar mixed-convection flows in vertical pipes with (or without) conjugate conduction in the pipe wall. Experimentally, a closed-loop thermosyphon was specially designed and constructed for this study. In the closed-loop, the power input is supplied by a semi-transparent gold-film which provides a uniform wall heat flux while enabling flow visualization. The proposed model was successfully validated against experimental data obtained in this study. Results obtained with the proposed model also indicate that traditional one-dimensional models can significantly overpredict the average velocity in thermosyphons when strong mixed-convection effects are present in the heated and cooled sections. It is also shown that conduction in the pipe wall can significantly affect the velocity and temperature fields in mixed-convection flows. Photographs of flow visualization experiments in mixed-convection flows are also presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/000000841.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2028</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tm815"><dcterms:title>Independent domains of a trifunctional enzyme</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hum, Dean W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The human folate-dependent trifunctional enzyme methyleneH$ sb4$folate deydrogenase-methenylH$ sb4$folate cyclohydrolase-formylH$ sb4$folate synthetase catalyzes three sequential reactions in the interconversion of one-carbon folate derivatives. In its native conformation the enzyme is composed of an amino-terminal dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain and a larger carboxyl-terminal synthetase domain. A cDNA clone encoding the human trifunctional enzyme was isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis yielded the complete deduced primary structure of 935 amino acid residues, and revealed the general location of a putative linker region joining the two major functional domains of the enzyme. The human cDNA clone, when expressed in E. coli can produce the active full length trifunctional protein. As well, the two major domains of the human protein can be expressed as independent functional enzymes. A rapid protocol was derived to purify the full length enzyme and the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain, when over-expressed in E. coli. In the native enzyme, the two functional domains are separated by an interdomain region of 19 residues which are not essential for catalytic activity. The human trifunctional enzyme and the two major domains can separately rescue a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ade3 mutant.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq61j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm815</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry,

(Hamid)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite significant improvements in total knee replacement surgery, loosening of the tibial prosthesis remains a major cause of failure of the procedure. Because of the limited fatigue life of the earlier fixation method which used PMMA as a bonding cement, biological fixation obtained by growth of bone into porous surfaces of the replacement prosthesis has become an attractive alternative. It is well established that bone ingrowth is strongly dependent on the relative displacement at the bone-prosthesis interface. Therefore, adequate immediate fixation is required to achieve durable biological fixation. In the absence of bonding cement, screws and press-fitted pegs are commonly used for initial fixation. The comparison of performance of these two methods in reducing relative displacement at the tibial prosthesis through both numerical and experimental approaches is the focus of this study. A three dimensional finite element model of the resurfaced tibia was developed and analyzed using the finite element formulation of "contact" implemented in the ADINA software. The frictional effect at the interface was also included in the model. Two types of fixation strategy were modelled: the press-fit and screw fixation. The press-fit was modelled by overlapping the bone elements into the peg elements at the peg-hole interface. The screw fixation was modelled based on the effect of the tightened screw in introducing initial compressive force at the bone-prosthesis interface. A photomicrographical technique linked with a video digitizing and image processing system were used to measure the relative displacement at the tibia-prosthesis interface. The measurements were performed for both screw and press-fit fixations. Both the finite element analyses and measurements reveal that first, the interface relative displacements obtained by the two methods are in the same order of magnitude; second, the screw fixation significantly reduces the interface relative displacements in comparison with press-fit fixation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ahmed, A.
