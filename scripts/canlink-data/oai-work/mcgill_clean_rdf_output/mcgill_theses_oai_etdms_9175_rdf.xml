Within the limits of experimental error, however, no difference could be detected. The variation of sensitivity of quartz spirals used for weighing has been investigated, and an equation has been deduced for making suitable corrections. It was also found that the sensitivity varies with the weight suspended on the spiral, but to a much smaller extent. Measurements made with several spirals having different sensitivities indicated that the correction factors are practically independent of the sensitivity within limits, and that the average value of these constants may be used with a considerable degree of accuracy.

No attempt was made to isolate any organic sulfur-containingcompound as the purpose of this investigation was to determine if the sulfur bears any definite relation to phosphorus or nitrogen.Since no evidence could be obtained of the existence of protein sulfur in the muck soil, it was concluded that the sulfur was not present as organic protein sulfur,and is therefore different from nitrogen in this respect. Sulfur has been shown to be different from phosphorus in that no sulfuric acid is split off on acid hydrolysis,showing the absence of an ester-like linkage, and that sulfur is present in the humic acid obtained by acidificationof the dilute alkaline extract of the muck soil. Evidence has been presented to arhow that the sulfur is very closely related to the lignin-like complexof the muck soil, and since the lignin is the substance most resistant to decomposition in the soil, this mayaccount for the much higher content of sulfur in organic as compared with inorganic soils.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

Until the publication of Dr. Frank Underhill's provocativemonograph on the development of national parties some thr~e years 1 ago, the history of Canadian parties had appeared only as an incidentalin the biography of some public man. Joseph Pope sketched, with the broadest of strokes, the Conservative party in his study of Sir John A. Macdonald.Substantially the same plan was followed by both Dr. Skelton2 and by the late Sir John "v"Jillison3 in their biographies of Sir liilfrid La.urier. Ofpolitical chronicles there were, of course, a great number but they were usually apologetic in tone. 4 Equally cursory have been the referencesmade to Canadian political parties in the standard constitutional histories which have been content to assume rather than to examine. 5 This neglectis a striking commentary on the unwillingness of Canadian scholars to grapple with the fundamentalsof government for, in the parliamentary systemunder which we live, the political party is the driving force of government. While, therefore, a study of the French-Canadian Conservative partymay traverse much of the ground covered in biographies, constitutional histories and so on, it does so with different emphasis and for a differentpurpose.

These data would indicate that marked differences in nutritive value may exist between herbage representing only ten days growth when taken at different parts of the season. The effect of small increases in lignin upon the digestibility of the various food fractions would indicate that it is not only the amount, but also the mode of deposition of the lignin which determines its effects upon digestibility and nutritive value.

Thus there is a peculiar interest in the study of reactions in which a "molecular" mechanism seems of necessity to be involved. Such a reaction is that forming the basis of this present investigation, namely, the reaction between propylene and hydrogen chloride in the liquid state. A further flavor of interest has been added in the facts that the phases studied have been concerned with both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, and more, that this catalysis has been due to water. Finally, this reaction has played an important part in the development of the theory of discontinuity of state at the critical temperature, and any bearing the results obtained might have on statements previously made in this respect has been a rather important part of the work.

The ore deposits of Bralorne Mines and Pioneer Mines are described particularly with regard to structural features. The vein bearing fissures of these deposits are, believed to be the result of compressive stresses originating southwest of the area. The ore shoots are believed due to various causes, among which the faulted and branched nature of the vein fissures are considered of prime importance. The presence of soda-rich rocks in the vicinity of the ore deposits is stressed, with the belief that such rocks have been developed by changing conditions in the differentiation of a normal magma stem. These conditions have given rise to the albite-rich diorite, the albite granite, related dykes, and subsequently the ore deposits themselves.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osborne, F.

The meristem and wood insects concerned in this study were all members of the order Coleoptera, families Cerambycidae (roundheaded borers), Buprestidae (flatheaded borers), Scolytidae(barkbeetles and ambrosia beetles), and Curculionidae (weevils). The coniferous logs under consideration were cut from tree species of pine, spruce, balsam, and hemlock, all found in Eastern Canada. The present study considers the attractiveness of such logs to oviposition by the barkbeetles and woodborers as influenced by a number of factors enumerated below. Furthermore it investigates the effect of some of these factors upon the subsequent development of these insects after establishment. Of necessity, such a field experiment can only indicate a number of trends but since most of the operating factors cannot be considered independently with any accuracy, the writer believes that an extensive rather than an intensive survey is all that is justified at present.

While the period under consideration at present is preliminary to the tremendous development of the years following 1660, it is of obvious importance to the story as a whole and the scarcity of reliable source material is regrettable. My research has been confined to sources available in Canada, but I am led to believe that there remains little of importance in France concerning this period which may not be seen in transcript at the Public Archives, Ottawa. Consequently it is unlikely that existing material would necessitate any substantial revision in the conclusions arrived at; though the discovery of new sources, such as for instance the records of the Company of New France, would clear up many points that are now obscure. Let us hope such a discovery will soon be made. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Adair, E.

A. Gibbs, by his description of a thermoelectric blood flow recorder of small bulk and simple construction, enormously expanded the application of the well known physical principle of the thermocouple to physiological research. Since its introduction, and that of the somewhat similar invention of Schmidt, the instrument has been of especial·value in problems relating to the cerebral circulation. Much of the work, such as that of Lennox and Gibbs (1933, 1934, 1935), is based on qualitative estimations of variations in the total blood flow through the brain. The thermocouiple has been put to a yet more interesting use in the detection of focal changes in flow, which use is exemplified by the work of Schmidt, and, at the Montreal Neurological Institute, by that of Norcross, Penfield and Erickson in animals and Penfield in human patients during operative procedures. [...] It will be seen that the problem is twofold and I have analysed the experimental findings under two main heads - the nature of the activity responsible for the circulatory changes, and the cortico-subcortical connections as revealed by the method. During the course of the work facts bearing on the problems of the central vasomotor tracts came to light and have been included, together with observations on autonomic functions recorded on several occasions.

As we write, it is a record of fact that, while in biological circles there are explanations of the evolutionary process other than that of "Natural Selection" as suggested by Darwin, yet the theory of evolution has met with such universal acceptance that it is now taken for granted; not only does it provide a background for biological thought, but it has given a method - and in many cases a terminology - to the study of origins and developments in many diverse realms of thought. Even the critics of Darwin have become his beneficiaries; nowhere is this more clearly seen than amongst theologians from whose number came many sharp criticisms of Darwin, both in the years immediately following and for some years after the publication of "Origin of Species" and "Descent of Man". Today, theologians make use of the thought of evolution in their treatment of comparative religions, showing Christianity as the goal of the evolutionary process in religious development, as well as making use of the concept in other branches of theological study.

It soon became evident, however, that the pupillary changes constituted but one element of complete oculomotor nerve palsy. An investigation has been made of eleven clinical cases, seven of whom failed to recover and were examined at necropsy, and of fifteen experimental procedures carried out on Macacus Rhesus monkeys. Each clinical case examined at necropsy and each successful experimental animal showed signs of ipsilateral third nerve palsy, and in each there was found a herniation of the ipsilateral hippocampal gyrus over the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli pressing on the third nerve. As the work progressed it became evident that there were two other features sometimes associated with ipsilateral third nerve signs and herniation of the hippocampal gyrus. These were ipsilateral hemiplegia and infarction of the occipital lobes. The former was present in one clinical case and in two of the experimental animals. The latter was discovered at necropsy in four patients but it was not found in any of the experimental animals. Both these features have already been described in the literature, and although not entirely original as far as this work is concerned, it has been considered fitting to include them in this report [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cone, W.

[Location and Accessibility]The Orland Gold Mines property is located two miles southeast of Aldennac Siding and south of the main line of Nipissing Central railroad. La Mine D'Or Champlain Ltée property lies to the west and the Adeline Lake and Kekeko properties to the east. The Orland group consists of six claims situated in lots 27 to 40 range 4 and seven claims lots 34 to 40 range 5. The property is accessible by means of the Hasamac wagon road which crosses the property. [Method of Investigation]A detailed geological map was made on the scale of 200' to the inch. The townships had been divided into strips or ranges one mile wide running east and west. From these north south picket lines were cut out at intervals of 858', which were chained consistently in the north to south direction and staked every two hundred feet. Outcrops were located by the pace and compass method using these lines as controls. While the mapping was in progress, stripping, trenching and test pitting were carried on in an effort to locate ore deposits. This was partly supervised by the author. Fourteen holes were drilled later at various points to test certain sections where evidence of mineralization was found.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>O'Neill, J.

Gaseous reactions are best suited for such a study, as the kinetic theory best describes the behaviour of gases. Ordinary considerations of chemical reactions, as shown by the reaction formula, do no more than consider the reactants and products and give no hint as to the mechanism. Clues to mechanisms come from a study of the kinetics, i.e. by a study of the reaction velocity and the application of certain well known relationships, which tell accurately the number of molecules entering into the reaction. In general, reactions can be classified into unimolecular and dimolecular reactions; the supposedly multimolecular reactions can be shown to consist of a series of rapid unimolecular and/or dimolecular steps. A few tarmolecular reactions are known, but these are exceptions. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Steacie, E.

It was found, in many cases, that the numbers not represented followed some simple law so that, although a certain form failed to represent an infinite number of integers, these integers could be determined by a definite set of formulae. It is easy to see that no number of the form 4^h(8n+7), where h and n are integers &gt;= 0, is a sum of three squares. Legendre proved, conversely, in 1798, that all positive integers not of the form 4^h(8n+7), are sums of three squares, i.e. if N if W &lt;&gt; 4^h(8n+7), h, n &gt;= 0, then N = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 where x, y, z are integers.
