It lies approximately six miles northwest of the Horne mine of Noranda Mines Limited at Noranda, Quebec. [...] The copper-zinc-gold-silver ores are obtained at present from the Waite section, the former Waite-Ackerman- Montgomery mine. [...] A large body of similar ore is being developed in the Amulet section. This is the Amulet lower A ore-body which was disclosed by diamond drilling during the spring of 1938. During the summer of 1939 that part of the property lying between F shaft (Amulet section) and the property boundary about one mile to the west was mapped by the writer on a scale of lOO feet equals 1 inch. [...] This half-mile wide strip includes two of the four dalmatianite areas which are found on the Waite-Amulet property. Thin sections made from a representative suite of specimens of rock gathered from this area were studied and compared with a similar suite of specimens from the Amulet lower A ore-body and from the Waite ore-body. Similarities and differences in the rocks of the three localities were noted. Few definite conclusions could be reached because of the limited amount of study possible. It is hoped, however, that the material presented will be of some service in arriving at a more complete understanding of the processes of ore-deposition in this area.

The cells which secrete acid or pepsin have been identified, but the secretory process is as yet unknown. Fortunately, certain of the factors which influence gastric secretion are known, and this knowledge enables us to control our experimental procedures so that standards of gastric secretion may be obtained. Pavlov described his gastric pouch as a mirror of the main stomach. It is no less true that many bodily states are mirrored and reflected by the gastro-intestinal tract, especially the stomach. This would justify a study of the relationship between the stomach and some other organ or gland which controls some aspect of the internal environment of the body. Such a study might not only determine the inter-glandular relationship but might give us an insight into the normal functions of the glands by making more conspicuous those subtle differences which are usually obscured.[...] The purpose of this study was to make an investigation of the relationship between the parathyroid and gastric glands and the factors concerned in the production of ulceration of the gastro-intestinal tract. The data to be presented in this thesis represent the results of about 350 experiments and over 6,000 separate analyses. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Babkin, B.

Over a period of years the officers of Sir George Williams College had acquired many insights into the peculiar problems of adult students in the evening division of its Faculty of Arts, Science and Commerce, and had evolved administrative practices and instructional methods to meet the situation. They felt, in the fall of 1938, however, that the time had come to make a thorough analysis of the nature of that particular part of its student body and to seek objective answers to such questions as, What are the significant characteristics of evening college students? What factors common to employed adult students have an important influence on their achievement? How can conditions for adult college study be improved? This study was undertaken in an attempt to answer these questions, particularly for Sir George Williams College, but also for the benefit of other institutions of higher learning which offer, or may offer, similar facilities for adults.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hughes, J.

That is, since the phenomenon is a function of both M and B, we may write P = f(M,B) and any increase in the complexity of M involves a corresponding simplification in B, and vice versa." {Bridges (Alexander, 1928)} This formula no doubt applies to the concepts concerning any field of investigation at a given time. But, since M and B are both variables, it would seem from a survey of the literature over an extended period that P must necessarily be increasing. So it appears to most biologists interested in relating the problems of genetics with chromosome structure and behaviour. Not only to these people, at close range, does P appear to be increasing, but the rapid advances in the field of investigation are even attracting the attention of those not fundamentally interested in this branch of biology. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the not so long ago "upstart science" of genetics has begun to have important implications in other fields of endeavour, however secure the specialists in those fields may have considered themselves in their self-complacent isolationism.

The original purpose was to carry out an investigation on the ozonization of unsaturated organic acids with the object of establishing more evidence for possible constitutional relationships between ozonides and peroxides, the latter having been the subject of considerable research in the MeGill University laboratories. This investigation, which was cut short by the advent of war, was launched from two seemingly different points of attack. The first, based on the ozonolysis mechanism advanced by Harries and his coworkers, concerns itself with methods for the quantitative estimation of hydrogen peroxide liberated by the hydrolysis of ozonides in solution. The second, founded on physicochemical principles, deals with the variation of the refractive index during ozonization. Section II is an innovation when compared with dissertations presented under more normal conditions. It is the material compiled for a fourth year Honours course in Chemistry. This section has one part on the analytical testing of explosives to which particular attention is drawn in that it has been dealt with much more fully in accordance with its significance and importance to Honours Chemistry students at this time. The third section is the presentation of the results of a study of the characteristics of mink oil.

The changes in the bones result in outward symptoms which may be recognized clinically, such as, enlargement of the wrists, knees and ankles, bowed legs, and the rachitic rosary. In normal growth of bone, there appears, on the diaphysial side of the narrow cartilage, a continuous layer of empty cartilage cells forming an almost straight line. Growth of the bone is obtained by the degeneration of a new row of cartilage cells and ossification of the former row. In rickets, the degeneration of the cartilage cells ceases and consequently there is no ingrowth of capillaries and ossification cannot occur. Since this cessation of degeneration does not affect all cells at the same time, the epiphysial cartilage, on the diaphysial side, becomes irregular. The prevention and cure of rickets may be brought about by the inclusion of vitamin D in the diet provided calcium and phosphorus are also present in adequate amounts. When vitamin D is fed to rachitic animals, ossification begins again in the empty cartilage cells. A new row of empty cartilage cells will generally appear within twenty-four hours of ingestion of the vitamin. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McFarlane, W.

Arthur Murphy, Fielding's first official biographer, insisted that: "When he had contracted to bring on a play, or a farce, it is well known by many of his friends now living, that he would go home rather late from a tavern, and would, the next morning, deliver a scene to the players written upon the papers which had wrapped the tobacco, in which he so generally delighted." In spite of the fact that many later critics, notably Thackeray, took this remark to mean that Fielding in his youth was a literary Bohemian, it is now generally agreed that it proves no more than that the man's financial troubles often forced him to write hastily and without much revision.

As a result, the demand for human plasma has become greater than the supply. The great value of protein feeding in the overcoming of infection, the protection it affords against liver damage, (Radvin 1940) and the relation of plasma protein level to the healing of wounds have all recently been emphasized by Whipple and his associates, (1940 and 1941). They point out that homologous protein introduced intravenously can supply such deficiencies where it is available in sufficient amounts, (Daft Robscheit, Robbins and Whipple 1938). The problem is how to tap the unlimited reservoir of heterologous plasma obtainable from the larger domestic animals. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meakins, J.

Of recent years the consumption of such fresh vegetables has greatly increased, which in turn has brought about the necessity of storing vegetables in order to have a continuous supply. Celery is one of the most important stored vegetable crops and at the same time one of the most hazardous to store. In spite or its importance, very little experimental work has been done as yet on vegetable storage problems. Because low temperature is probably the most outstanding means of prolonging life of stored products, commerce has used it extensively and through common experience has come to use methods which yield fair results. However, it is well known to those concerned therein that storage conditions could be improved greatly. Moreover, it is a fact that storage facilities to-day are usually inadequate even in the light of the limited actual knowledge on the matter (Cook, 1935), and it goes without saying that great advances could be made if the storage problems were thoroughly investigated. One way, and probably the most efficient way, of tackling the problem is to find the katabolic activity of the product while in storage.It is with this object in mind that this work was undertaken. In the choice of our techniques effort was mas to avoid overlapping or repeating previous work, but to complete it.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scarth, G.

This is true whether the strength is increased by pressure on the wet sheet or by beater treatment. Two explanations have been made for this relationship, an increase of fibre-to-fibre bonds and increased flatness of the fibres with increased strength. It has not been possible to separate these two effects. The anisotropy of cellulose as a dielectric has been established and a method devised whereby the axial and transverse values of the dielectric constant of the cellulose fibril could be measured. [...] These results have been interpreted in terms of the relative freedom of groups on the cellulose chain and it has been suggested that absorption and dispersion in cellulose· is probably due to displacement of hydroxyl groups restrained by secondary and coordinate valence forces rather than to rotation of glucose anhydride rings. A dielectric value versus water content curve has been obtained and found to agree with previous measurements. This curve definitely shows that the first water sorbed on cellulose is strongly held and has a low dielectric constant. Attempts to calculate the dielectric constant of the sorbed water from the dielectric values have shown the impossibility of such calculations on the basis of present knowledge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

The first of these, called by Chapman, "Autecology·, deals with some single species of plant or animal 1n relation to its environment or to some restricted part of its environment. This approach has the obv1ous advantage of limiting the field and eliminating many complexities. Its disadvantages l1e in the fact that it tends to over emphasize some isolated part of what ought to be a broad and complexly interrelated structure. The other aspect of Ecology, called ·Synecology' by way of contrast, takes as its material some complete community of organisms, treating it as a whole composed of integrated units, the species present. Such an undertaking is extremely difficult due to the interplay of so many factors, both physical and biotic. It makes use of all of the available information of Autecology and adds to it a vast amount of other data peculiar to its broader outlook. It is this latter aspect of Ecology which must finally establish the major principles of the science. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wynne-Edwards, V.
