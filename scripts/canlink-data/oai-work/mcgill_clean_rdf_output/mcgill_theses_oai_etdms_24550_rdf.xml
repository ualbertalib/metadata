Deethylatrazine was the only metabolite found in any significant quantity in soil in 1988 and in groundwater in 1989. Deisopropylatrazine was detected in groundwater at the beginning and at the end of the 1988 season and levels were similar in both fields. Metolach or was never detected in groundwater. GLEAMS predictions favourably compared to field results at the 0-20 cm depth in both years. Half-life, however, had to be reduced by half in 1989 since higher temperature had increased dissipation. GLEAMS has not predicted leaching past 20 cm in either field in 1988 and 1989. During a dry summer, such as 1988 and 1989, leaching is mostly due to macropore flow and desorption of residues, two processes which are difficult to predict with existing models.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw31h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2452</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Herbicides -- Environmental aspects -- Qu√©bec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atrazine.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Leaching.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qb10w"><dcterms:title>Breeding biology and habitat selection of American crows in Saskatchewan parkland habitat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ignatiuk, Jordan B.

Clutch size and hatching success did not differ between years or areas, but in 1987, nests at St. Denis produced nearly twice as many young as at Elstow. Crows nested in willow, aspen, and other trees. Nest trees were larger than randomly-selected trees in both years and areas. At St. Denis, the area near active crow nests had, on average, more permanent wetlands, a greater proportion of pasture and wetland, and less area of cultivation than areas adjacent to random sites. At St. Denis, successful nests were closer to permanent water and had more permanent wetlands nearby than depredated nests, but discriminant function analysis could not correctly distinguish successful nests in either area. Selection of nest characteristics to evade predators does not appear to provide predictable advantages to breeding crows.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st84t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb10w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corvus brachyrhynchos -- Saskatchewan -- Habitat.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corvus brachyrhynchos -- Reproduction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cm183"><dcterms:title>Receptor-mediated endocytosis of testicular transferrin by germinal cells of the rat testis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Petrie, Robert G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study examines events of the Sertoli cell iron delivery pathway following the secretion of diferric testicular transferrin (tTf) in to the adluminal compartment of the rat seminiferous epithelium. The unidirectional secretion of tTf by Sertoli cells was verified, in vivo, and it was shown that this protein is internalized by adluminal germ cells. It was further determined by Scatchard analysis that this internalization was mediated by high affinity transferrin binding sites on the surface of round spermatids, numbering 1453/cell and displaying a K$ sb{ rm d}$ = 0.6 $ times$ 10$ sp{-9}$ M. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from adluminal germ cells, namely spermatocytes, round spermatids and elongating spermatids, indicated that these cells expressed Tf receptor mRNA and ferritin mRNA in levels inversely related to their stage of maturation. Finally it was determined that following binding and internalization in round spermatids, Tf became associated with the endosomal compartment and was recycled back to the cell surface. Diferric tTf binds to Tf receptor on the surface of adluminal germ cells, is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the apotTf-Tf receptor complex is recycled back to the cell surface where apotTf is released into the adlumenal fluid.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v658v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm183</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732db052"><dcterms:title>Effects of mus mutations on mitotic recombination in Aspergillus nidulans</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhao, Ping, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nine mutagen sensitive (mus) mutants of Aspergillus nidulans were analyzed for effects on recombination.

Early passage clonal bovine mammary epithelial cells (clone LMH17) gave rise to several established cell lines (MAC-T lines) after being cotransfected with plasmids containing the temperature sensitive mutant SV40 large T antigen gene (pBAPSV40TtsA58) and the bacterial phosphotransferase gene (pSV2-neo). Unlike other cell types which were transformed after being transfected with SV40, MAC-T cells maintained many characteristics of non-transformed cells: MAC-T cells were serum and anchorage dependent, showed contact inhibition, and were not tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice. However, Southern transfer analysis revealed an integrated SV40 gene and cells showed no senescence after 50 passages. These cells are morphologically indistinguishable from parental LMH17 cells and retain the typical morphology of mammary epithelial cells. Positive cytokeratin immunostaining and the absence of vimentin staining indicated that these cells were epithelial in origin. MAC-T cells grew rapidly on plastic substratum with a doubling time of approximately 17 hours and became differentiated when grown on floating collagen gels in the presence of prolactin. The differentiated phenotype was characterized to include (1) the ability to form secretory domes with a lumen from a pavement of columnar cells; (2) increased casein mRNA abundance; (3) increased alpha S and beta casein secretion; (4) increased number and size of casein secretory vesicles; and (5) increased lactose synthesis and secretion.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td287.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm65w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cell lines.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clone cells.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lactation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epithelial cells.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505165x"><dcterms:title>Description et distribution de la communaut√© de poissons √† Wemindji, Baie de James, et √©cologie de la morue du Groenland (Gadus ogac)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morin, Bernard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The coastal fish community of Wemindji, eastern James Bay, was studied to describe seasonal utilization of the Maquatua River estuary and the adjacent coastal waters by marine and anadromous fishes.

Leo), is a perennial forage legume that has difficulty in establishing stands due to slow seedling growth, weed competition and herbicide sensitivity. The development of herbicide resistant cultivars would be of economic importance. Resistant lines were isolated after sequential selection at the callus, shoot and whole plant levels to the sulfonylurea (SU) herbicides Harmony (DPX-M6316, code name for methyl 3- ( ( ((4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5,triazine-2-yl)amino) carbonyl) amino) sulfonyl-2-thiophenecarboxylate), or Classic (DPX-F6025, code name for 2(( (4-chloro-6-methoxypyrimidine-yl)amino carbonyl) aminosulfonyl)benzoic acid ethyl ester. In field and growth chamber tests the Harmony regenerant lines displayed an increased tolerance as compared to control plants from tissue culture, and from seed. Results of the evaluation of callus cultures of regenerated mutant lines signify stability of the resistance. Outcrossed seeds collected from field trials, and tested in vitro for herbicide resistance, indicate that the trait is heritable and that resistance may be due to reduced sensitivity of acetolactate synthase to SU inhibition.

Various scholars are cited in support. Gabriel Moran is a major resource in developing religious education as an academic field. He helps teachers to teach religion itself rather than about religion. Stanley Hauerwas broadens religious education to include character development. His emphasis on the self-agency of the moral agent helps teachers to educate character. His use of narrative encourages teachers to be inclusive and non-judgmental. Religious education must change to accommodate pluralism.

We concluded that the consequences of a large and growing submerged sector can be devastating to the economic variables. Finally, this paper attempts to examine the Canadian underground economy. However, since the studies performed on the Canadian underground economy are limited, the task of both reviewing the literature, and determining the Canadian policy implications was perplexing.

I approach the text as a drama of interpretations and argue that the individual consciousnesses of different interpreters represent different interpretive strategies, and that these differences suggest distinct structures of community. This approach becomes more focussed in the discussion of Ahab and Ishmael as representatives of two contrasting interpretive possibilities, of "reading" the text as a "pasteboard mask" which conceals a stable identity and single "truth," versus "reading" the text of the "defaced" and hence indeterminate surface of changing "meanings." Each strategy implies a different way of conceiving "space" as the "place" where community is formed, and though critics frequently perceive the ending of Moby-Dick as a paradoxical conflict between these two visionary quests, I suggest that Ishmael's survival presents a possible resolution, where Moby Dick becomes the narrative of filling space with many narratives to create the text Moby-Dick.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh79c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc825</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Melville, Herman, 1819-1891.

It offers an improved time complexity of O($a sp{n}$), as compared with O($n sp{2}$(a + 1)$ sp{n}$) in (1). There are two steps to solving a constraint network. In the first step, all values which can never appear as part of any solution are removed from the domain of their corresponding variable. Smart starting points are used to jump to a branch of the tree which is more likely to hold the path being sought. Then backtracking is used to find all sets of consistent variable/value labelings which describe the solutions. Dynamic variable swapping is used to rearrange the order in which variables are bound, so as to reduce the size of the search tree. The algorithm works efficiently with sparse and fully connected constraint networks.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz45r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p155w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246t159"><dcterms:title>On the performance of time warp</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Krivossidis, Nikos</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There are two major approaches to performing distributed discrete event simulation (DDES): the conservative approach and the optimistic approach (Time Warp). An important area of research within DDES is the performance evaluation of distributed simulation algorithms. We implement Time Warp on an iPSC/2 hypercube and we study the performance of this optimistic approach in the context of queueing networks. The main focus of our study is to determine how the service time means of the logical processes affect performance. We employ two different network topologies, mesh and distributed (ARPANET), and we experiment with a varying number of logical processes. Aggressive and lazy cancellation strategies are explored. As our results indicate, Time Warp achieves significant speedups when the relative difference of the service time means is not high. A small number of IPs and a high degree of asymmetry in the simulated topology have a negative impact on Time Warp's performance.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq776.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t159</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn336"><dcterms:title>Interprocessor communication supports for a multiprocessor dataflow machine</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Monti, Jean-Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dataflow model of computation offers a powerful alternative to the von Neumann based model for exploiting the fine-grain parallelism inherent in scientific computations. Under this model, a program is expressed in the form of a graph, where the data values are carried by tokens, moving on the arcs of the graph. A distinctive feature of dataflow computers is the absence of the conventional program counter. Instead, instruction execution is solely determined by the availability of data which provides ample instruction level fine-grain parallelism. A highly pipelined static dataflow architecture has recently been proposed, based on the argument fetching principle, yielding the McGill Dataflow Architecture (MDFA). In this thesis, an inter-processor communication mechanism is proposed. With this mechanism, a multiprocessor MDFA system can be constructed, based on a distributed memory organization. An efficient inter-processor synchronization and communication support is presented, for sending and receiving data through an interconnection network. An Interprocessor Communication Unit (ICU) has been designed to implement the above mechanism in the MDFA. A simulation testbed has been implemented to study the performance of the multiprocessor. It includes an assembler, with multiprocessor extensions, and a multiprocessor simulator. An analysis based on the simulations results is presented, focusing on the impact of long latency operations on program performance.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb54d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn336</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451j694"><dcterms:title>Purification and characterization of carboxymethylchitin-coated liposomes encapsulating hemoglobin as potential blood substitutes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mobed, Maryam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To increase the survival time of the liposome-based artificial red blood cells in vivo, bovine hemoglobin-loaded liposomes (LEHb) are coated with a polyanionic polymer.

In order to predict the in vivo response, the necessary experiments for the in vitro system characterization have been carried out. The purified LEHbs display a unimodal size distribution in the submicron range. Analysis of the lipid/Hb content of the liposomes reveals that the variations in the Hb encapsulation efficiency (E$ sb{ rm Hb}$) as a function of the initial Hb concentration (Hb) $ sb{ rm o}$ are insignificant compared to the net augmentation of E$ sb{ rm Hb}$ as a function of the increasing initial lipid concentration. Meanwhile high (Hb) $ sb{ rm o}$s are necessary for the preservation of oxyhemoglobin.

The CMOS technology was used to implement the design of the custom VLSI chip. Data flows in the systolic array in such a way that it is not only used when input but resued by every systolic cell in a pipelined fashion.

In the second chapter, we will analyse the components of bearing witness in Elie Wiesel's writings regarding to the enunciation and commitment, the pragmatic aspect and the difference between bearing witness and reporting.

For therapists specializing in adapted access one of the main challenges involves prescribing and customizing suitable input devices since objective procedures to facilitate this process are lacking. The two papers presented in this thesis aimed to respond to this limitation. In the first paper the adapted access process was viewed within the context of a human factors model. A critical review of the literature relating specific human factors criteria (e.g. digit loading) to ergonomic solutions (e.g. input/output efficiency) substantiated clinical approaches to adapted device prescription and customization. Two case studies were used to illustrate the application of this approach to physically disabled individuals. The second paper investigated therapists' abilities to judge the mechanical characteristics of switches. Objective data characterizing the activation force-displacement trajectories for eight commonly used adapted switches were collected and compared to clinicians' subjective evaluation of the same characteristics. The major finding was that although therapists' subjective estimates of activation force and displacement were reasonably good there were specific areas of weakness that should be rectified with quantitative, objective data. It is anticipated that these two papers will enhance the application of microcomputer usage for physically disabled individuals.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v07g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d100x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rx84k"><dcterms:title>Characterization of the regulatory region of the Mu-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa transposable phage D3112</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wragg-L√©gar√©, St√©phanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bacteriophage D3112 is a Mu-like transposable bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D3112 phage has a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 38 kb with a genetic organization similar to that of coliphages Mu and D108. Cloning and DNA sequencing of the D3112cts15 left end has revealed a unique large open reading frame spanning nucleotides 892 to 170 of the lower strand. A polypeptide of an apparent molecular weight of 19.6 kDa was visualized by SDS-PAGE when this ORF was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. By an in vivo functional assay, it was shown that the presence of 1174 bp of the D3112 left end on an E. coli-P. aeruginosa shuttle vector in P. aeruginosa prevented lytic development of superinfecting D3112 phage, indicating that the cloned fragment encodes the D3112 (c) repressor. By an in vitro functional assay, it was shown that a crude extract, containing overexpressed repressor (c), appeared to bind specifically to a 277 bp fragment of the D3112 left end. This fragment was also bound specifically by purified E. coli IHF protein. These protein-DNA interactions, and their location, suggest a role in transcription and regulation of the repressor (c) gene for this fragment. Preliminary purification steps of the D3112 repressor (c) show no interaction with weak ion exchange and precipitation by 60% (w/v) ammonium sulfate.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk30g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx84k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333336f"><dcterms:title>The role of the xanthine oxidase enszymatic system and allopurinol in the ischemia reperfusion injury of experimental skin and myocutaneous flaps /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Picard-Ami, Luis A.

Oxygen derived free radicals have been implicated in a variety of pathological processes including the ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) occurring in skin flaps. Previous work with experimental rat skin flaps has suggested that the xanthine oxidase (XO) enzymatic system may be the major source for these toxic radicals. Before the clinician and the patient can benefit from these experimental findings an animal model which closer resembles the clinical setting needs to be tested. In the laboratory I examined the role of XO and its potent inhibitor allopurinol in the IRI of skin and myocutaneous flaps. I have found negligible levels of XO enzyme in pig and human skin when compared to the rat. I have also found that no beneficial effect on survival could be observed by treating the flaps with several different dose regimens of allopurinol. Based on my results I conclude that it is unlikely that xanthine oxidase is of major importance in the IRI of skin flaps.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603qz64r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333336f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nz27d"><dcterms:title>Progressive changes in somatosensory cortical maps in 2 week old kittens following low thoracic (T12) spinal cord transection</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chau, Connie W.
