In each experiment, participants identified forward and backward letters presented unilaterally to each visual field and thus to each hemisphere (VF-H). The main findings were as follows: (1) For the five-year-olds, no VF-H differences were found in the speed of identifying either forward or backward letters or in the difference in speed between forward and backward letters. (2) The seven-year-olds identified forward letters faster than backward letters in the right visual field-left hemisphere (RVF-LH) with the contralateral, right hand, and the boys, unlike the girls, also showed this difference in the left visual field-right hemisphere (LVF-RH) independent of the responding hand. (3) Performance of the nine-year-olds was similar to that of the seven-year-olds. (4) Adults identified forward letters faster than backward letters in the RVF-LH with each hand, whereas in the LVF-RH this difference was found for the ipsilateral, right but not for the contralateral, left hand. Support was provided for the Corballis-Beale (1976) hypothesis, and discussion centered on the implications of the results for the development of cerebral lateralization of memory for the normal left-right orientation of letters in normal and reading disabled children.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs748.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sh11j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cerebral hemispheres.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Memory in children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Alphabet.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebral dominance.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Left and right (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nx93s"><dcterms:title>Apokalypsis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1978</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cardy, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to analyze my piece for orchestra and chorus, Apokalypsis, which was written in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Music in Composition.

While in seeds of both species contents of goitrin and volatile isothiocyanates were inversely correlated, there was little variation in thiocyanate ion and total glucosinolate contents. Major synthesis or accumulation of different glucosinolates occurred at different times during the growing season in the sequence after seeding: indolyl glucosinolates yielding thiocyanate ion at the 2-week stage; glucosinolates yielding volatile isothiocyanate hydrolysis products at the 4-week stage; and progoitrin yielding goitrin at the 6- or 8-week stage. These glucosinolates were generally higher in roots of both species grown on organic soil than on loam soil. During ontogeny of both species, the content of volatile isothiocyanates generally were positively correlated with top/root ratio, while growth rate was positively correlated with thiocyanate ion content. While the contents of goitrin and volatile isothiocyanate tended to be higher in early-seeded (May 27) crops, the thiocyanate ion contents tended to be higher in late-seeded (June 21) crops. The occurrence of boron deficiency symptoms in roots of hydroponically-grown Snow Ball turnip (0.1 ppm boron treatment) was associated with an accumulation of high quantities of glucosinolates and reducing sugars.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq43c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515p23v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Glucosinolates -- Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rutabaga -- Composition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turnips -- Composition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thiocyanates</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hw25c"><dcterms:title>A simplified method for freeze-fracture radioautography /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kan, Frederick Wai Kwong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new, simplified technique for the radioautography of freeze-fracture specimens has been developed using freeze-fractured liver tissues from rats given injection of ('3)H-thymidine following partial hepatectomy, or intestine from rats given injection of ('3)H-fucose. The specimens are fractured, replicated with platinum and carbon, and freeze-dried in-vacuo in about six hours. The replicated side of the specimen is covered with Ilford L(,4) emulsion for radioautography. After exposure and photographic processing, the emulsion is protected in three ways before removing the tissue underlying the replica by digestion in sodium hypochlorite solution: its silver grains are coated with gold, a carbon layer is evaporated over it, and grease is applied over the carbon layer. The specimen is then taken through hypochlorite and the grease dissolved in Freon 14 before it is mounted on grid for electron microscopic examination. The validity of the technique was tested in two ways. First, freeze-fracture radioautography of the liver tissues from rats given injections of ('3)H-thymidine showed a label distribution identical to that in routine radioautographs. Secondly, the localization of ('3)H-fucose was traced to the E-face of intestinal microvilli.

The connecting piece forms by deposition of dense material around the centrioles during steps 8-15. Newly-synthesized proteins are incorporated into this structure throughout this period. The outer dense fibers exist in step 8-14 spermatids as slender fibrils associated with the axonemal doublets. During step 16, they undergo rapid growth, assuming the form of the mature fibers. This results from massive deposition of proline- and cystine-containing proteins onto the fibrils. The fibrous sheath develops from a framework comprised of two longitudinal columns and a series of circumferentially-oriented ribs which is assembled during steps 11-15 in a distal-to-proximal direction along the flagellum. New ribs originate from proline-rich fuzz-coated filaments which arise within the flagellar cytoplasm.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zr58q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc537</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257f933"><dcterms:title>The synthesis of methyl trihydroxyeicosatrienoates and related compounds /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Luthe, Corinne Elizabeth.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Efficient syntheses for appropriately derivatized methyl 8R,9(R and S), 11R-trihydroxy-12-oxododeca-5Z-enoates (53, 59) via their respective 5,6-anhydro-3-deoxy-1,2-0-isopropylidene-(alpha)-D-hexofuranoses (18 and 38) are described.

For physically rough surfaces with unidirectional randomness it was shown that hysteresis increases with decreasing roughness dimensions and with increasing standard deviation in the solid surface slope distribution. The wetting of solid surfaces by liquids was investigated by a new tensiometric technique called capillarography. At large roughness wavelengths ((TURN)100 (mu)m) the contribution of concentric sawtooth-shaped regular roughness was found to be close to the values calculated theoretically. At smaller roughness wavelengths ((TURN)1 (mu)m) the wetting is complicated by intrinsic roughness and chemical heterogeneity. High energy surfaces such as platinum and quartz exhibit a regular stick-jump behavior when wetted with water above a very low critical contact line velocity. This is caused by minute amounts of surface active impurities in the system. From the experimental data it can be deduced that surface active molecules diffuse onto and over the solid surface. A relaxation of the contact angle was observed when an initially slow moving contact line was brought to a full stop. This is attributed to the slow establishment of a new equilibrium, possibly by surface capillary waves, involving metastable contact line positions separated by energy barriers. For receding contact angles, the main cause of the relaxation seems to be a stabilization of a liquid film left behind a receding contact line. The observations made in this study contribute to a better understanding of the complicated nature of the wetting of solids.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602164w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w56x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Solids -- Surfaces.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surfaces (Physics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wetting.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Surface chemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752h57q"><dcterms:title>Studies on serum hexosaminidases in experimental shock</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Surgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Baraya-Mil, Hamidou Stephen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The properties of (beta)-N-acetylhexosaminidase (HEX EC 3.2.1.30 and 3.2.1.53) in canine serum during endotoxin induced experimental shock were investigated.

Both HEX A and HEX B as well as a third isoenzyme HEX A('1) are also present in canine tissues. Only HEX A and HEX B are present in the urine. "Shocked" serum contains very high levels of total HEX activity with increased activity of both isoenzymes HEX A and HEX B, as well as the appearance of an additional isoenzyme (HEX A('1)). In shock, HEX A('1) accounted for over 28% of total serum HEX activity. HEX A was diminished while HEX B was significantly higher. HEX A('1) differs in physical and enzymatic properties from HEX A and HEX B of normal serum. It is suggested that HEX A('1) is released from tissues during shock. Methylprednisolone prevented in vitro the intracellular activation of HEX, and in vivo prevented the increase in serum HEX activity during shock.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j6517.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752h57q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kb62b"><dcterms:title>Jane Austen's readers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bander, Elaine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Jane Austen's novels abound with readers "reading" not only texts but also speech, gestures, looks, scenery, events, each other, themselves. Readers in the novels illuminate her assumptions about readers of the novels; unlike eighteenth-century novelists who judged fiction by readers' responses and who tried to manipulate those responses, she accepted that not all readers read alike. Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, and Pride and Prejudice explore different styles of reading and suggest some ways are more successful than others. A good reader observes accurately, reflects carefully, and judges candidly, disciplining subjective feelings with "objective" truths of religion and morality; above all, good readers trust their own educated judgments rather than rely upon external monitors. Readers of the novels share the reading experiences of heroines. In Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion, readers are invited to judge without monitor or narrator to direct them.

August marks the seasonal progression from summer to fall with almost complete type transience. Each type evokes a distinct response in surface climate and energy balance components. Representative type temperature deviations allow the reconstruction of daily and monthly temperature records. Radiative characteristics are defined for each synoptic pattern, yet there is little variation in cloud response to the type catalogue.

The positions 663 and 903 were the most terminal mutation sites in the HBD found to date. The three mutant hARs have been previously characterized biochemically in genital skin fibroblasts. In the family with the Leu820Val substitution, the mother and the grandmother were found to be carriers for the same mutation. To prove their pathogenicity, each of the three mutations has been reproduced in an hAR expression vector that was transfected into COS-1 cells. In COS-1 cells, the complexes from Pro903Ser and Leu820Val had: increased thermolability; increased dissociation rates; decreased affinity; and abnormal transactivation. There was a hierarchy in the severity of the mutations expressed in kinetic and transactivation assays that correlated with the severity of the clinical phenotype. The pathogenicity of the Pro903Ser and the Leu820Val mutations was thereby confirmed. In COS-1 cells, the AR with Ile663Asn had normal thermolability, normal dissociation rates, and normal transactivation, but a decreased affinity.

The work presented in this thesis represents the first step in an approach which involves the use of single-chain monoclonal antibodies as specific reagents to target and disrupt the function of intracellular proteins. The polymerase chain reaction was used for the cloning and modification of the heavy and light chain variable regions of the murine monoclonal antibody produced by the TIB 131 hybridoma. The variable regions of the light and heavy IgG chains were initially amplified from cDNA using degenerate 5$ sp prime$ primers and 3$ sp prime$ primers complementary to the constant region of the appropriate chain. The amplification products were cloned individually, sequenced, then modified to include restriction sites suitable for cloning into an expression vector. The two modified variable regions were cloned into an expression vector, and when expressed in either bacteria or in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, yielded a protein of the expected molecular weight.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Georges, Elias (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67314780.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr28v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Monoclonal antibodies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cytoplasmic filaments.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intermediate filament proteins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eukaryotic cells.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf623"><dcterms:title>The role of neurotensin in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocorticoid regulation /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rowe, Wayne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Central administration of neurotensin (NT) stimulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in freely-moving rats. Increases in adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) were observed 15 min following central (i.c.v.) NT administration and remained elevated for up to 4 hours. Of the two NT fragments tested, NT$ sb{1-8}$ and NT$ sb{8-13}$, only NT$ sb{8-13}$ was found to significantly elevate ACTH and B levels. Moreover, NT$ sb{8-13}$ activated the HPA axis with a temporal profile similar to NT$ sb{1-13}$, suggesting an interaction with the pharmacologically and molecularly characterized NT receptor. Animals pre-treated intravenously with the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonist, $ alpha$-helical CRH, showed attenuated plasma ACTH and B responses to central NT administration. This indicates that CRH receptor activation is necessary for the stimulatory effects of NT on HPA function. Bilateral lesions of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus significantly reduced NT-induced stimulation of ACTH and B release suggesting that the PVN is essential for NT's stimulatory action. CRH turnover studies indicated that acute central NT administration stimulates CRH, but not arginine vassopressin (AVP), release in animals examined 60 min following NT injection. Taken together, our studies suggest that the stimulatory effects of NT on HPA activity occur via specific NT receptors and that one site of action of NT is likely at the level of the PVN where NT elicits the release of CRH.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quirion, R.

Fast-response on board sensors for turbulence, temperature and gas concentrations permitted the spatial mapping of fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, moisture, CO$ sb2$ and ozone. Flux maps were produced in the form of GIS-interpolated 1 km averages, and in the discrete form of those coherent structures of the turbulent process, intermittent in time and space, which dominate the exchange of scalars between the ground and the atmosphere. The magnitude of surface-related mesoscale contributions to the flux was also quantified. Flux observations were compared against radiometrically observed surface temperatures and vegetation indices (NDVI), observed from aircraft and satellite (NOAA AVHRR), and surface characteristics from ground surveys. Flux maps showed the expected correspondence between greenness, evapo(trans)ration (ET) and CO$ sb2$ exchange. Discrepancies between ozone flux maps and maps of greenness, ET or CO$ sb2$ were more pronounced than would be consistent with the hypothesis of stomatal control of ozone uptake. More insight into control mechanisms on ozone exchange is gained by an examination of the spatial coincidence between transporting structures for the various scalars (heat, moisture, CO$ sb2$ and ozone), through the Jaccard coefficient of co-location (J), which showed a lower value ($ rm0.3&lt;J&lt;0.6$) for coincidence in transfer between ozone and moisture than between moisture and CO$ sb2$ ($ rm0.5&lt;J&lt;0.8$). Analysis of J over the various land-use and crop-types in the test area, opens a door to a more differentiated understanding of the physical and physiological driving forces behind ozone uptake by soil and vegetation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schuepp, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b11f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032389w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eddy flux.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meteorology, Agricultural</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atmospheric ozone -- Environmental aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heat budget (Geophysics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k586q"><dcterms:title>Quantification of mRNA levels for LH-beta, FSH-beta, alpha and prolactin in female rats following chronic or acute estrogen treatment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McLaren, Julie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Injection of 2mg of estradiol valerate (EV) to cycling female rats causes cell death among the hypothalamic beta-endorphin population that results in increased mu-opioid receptor binding in the hypothalamic MPOA. We suspect that the subsequent opioid suppression of the GnRH system is responsible for the constellation of defects that occur in pituitary LH production and release. In order to determine the mechanisms by which a defective GnRH pattern affects pituitary LH functions, we quantitated LH-beta and alpha mRNA in EV-injected animals using Northern blot analysis. To determine whether estradiol has direct effects at the pituitary level, we studied estradiol implanted (E2) animals that do not have the hypothalamic lesion. In order to observe possible effects on prolactin and FSH (normal plasma levels) we also quantitated them in EV or E2-treated animals. Our results indicate that LH-beta, but not alpha or FSH-beta RNA are below control levels in both EV and E2 treated animals. Thus estrogen can modulate LH-beta production at both the hypothalamic (EV) and pituitary (E2) levels. Prolactin was sometimes below that of control animals which is surprising since estradiol is a known stimulator of prolactin production.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brawer, James R.

The contributions and weaknesses of several earlier models of classical conditioning are studied. Two new neuronal models are proposed. The first, called the delay-producing connections (or DPC) model, is an extension of the Klopf (1988) and Sutton &amp; Barto (1981) models. The DPC model makes two contributions: (1) it represents the trace of each conditioned stimuli (CS) by differential equations; and (2) it replaces each CS in the activation rule with a trace of the relevant CS. A method is suggested to measure the trace of a CS. The second model, called the adaptive delays (or AD) model, is proposed as an extension of the DPC model to account for the phenomenon of inhibition of delay. Both models reproduce the shape of a CR, the curve of efficacy of conditioning as a function of the interstimulus interval (ISI), the dependence of the optimal ISI on CS duration, the extinction of a CR (even for long lasting CSs as opposed to Klopf's (1988) model), and several other properties of classical conditioning.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marley, A.

Results indicated significant increases in peak force amplitude as viscosity increased. Volume did not significantly influence maximum lingual force amplitudes. Individual subjects demonstrated consistent patterns of asymmetrical force distribution across the lingual margins tested.

Some early B lineage cells are present in the bone marrow (BM), however. In scid mice, we defined three subsets of early progenitor B cells lacking $ mu$ heavy chains (pro-B cells) based on the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and B220 glycoprotein: (a) early (TdT+B220$-$), (b) intermediate (TdT+B220+), and (c) late (TdT$-$B220+). Double immunofluorescence labelling of BM cell suspensions has shown normal numbers of early and intermediate pro-B cells, substantially reduced numbers of late pro-B cells, and an absence of pre-B cells and B cells. Nearly all defective cells, thus, abort at the late pro-B cell stage. Early and intermediate pro-B cells accumulated in metaphase in near-normal numbers after intraperitoneal vincristine administration, apparently not regulated by feedback signals from the B cell pool. The scid mouse provided a system for studies on regulation of pro-B cells and the effectiveness of the deletion mechanism. It was determined that the defective pro-B cells of scid mice were susceptible to the stimulatory effects of an exogenous agent, sheep red blood cells, and a stromal cell-derived growth factor for precursor B cells, interleukin-7, as previously observed in normal mice in vivo. In addition, pro-B cells of scid mice were driven to proliferate by the dysregulated constitutive expression of the c-myc oncogene. In each case, however, all cells aborted soon after reaching the late pro-B stage. Mechanisms by which aberrant cells are deleted from the B lineage, safeguarding against entry of potentially dysregulated cells into the peripheral B cell pool, thus, could not be overwhelmed or evaded by increased proliferative activity of pro-B cells.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Osmond, D.

In order to test styrene for neurotoxic potential and investigate its mechanism of action, primary co-cultures of murine spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-skeletal muscle were used in a simple in vitro neurotoxicity screen. The neurotoxicity of styrene and its major metabolites, styrene oxide and styrene glycol was evaluated after both short and long-term exposure. Endpoints used to characterize neurotoxicity were both morphological and neurophysiological, and included: (1) chromatolysis, (2) axonopathy, and (3) interference with action potential generation. The major findings of this study were: (1) styrene and oxide were acutely cytotoxic to all cell types at concentrations in excess of 2.0 mM and 0.2 mM respectively. (2) There was no evidence of neurotoxicity attributable to styrene or its metabolites, with the exception of a slight chromatolytic effect induced by 0.2 mM styrene oxide in DRG neurons after long-term exposure. It is therefore possible that cytotoxic mechanisms rather than effects on neuron specific processes, underlie styrene's damage to cells of the nervous system. (3) Surprisingly, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a common in vitro solubility vehicle, was neurotoxic after long-term exposure, producing both chromatolysis and axonopathy. This study, therefore also established the upper limit of DMSO recommended for use as a solubility vehicle in long-term in vitro tests.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Durham, Heather D.
