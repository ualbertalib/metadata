Its emergence in the last decade signals a recognition of the failure of development programmes imposed by government directive and of the need for forests to support increasingly impoverished local populations while supplying timber for international markets. Social forestry in Bangladesh has been planned and implemented through the combined efforts of the Bangladeshi government, international aid donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The weight of development organizations in this coalition led to an explicit commitment to recognizing the role of women in such projects, both as the target group most dependent on forest resources for domestic needs and, for that same reason, as the group most knowledgeable about the forest's capacity for meeting local needs. All the components of Social Forestry Programs were examined in two different villages. One village, Shakipur, is close to the local administrative center, while the other, Barsharchala, is more isolated. In both cases, the government had alienated itself from the local population through an aggressive approach to land appropriation. It therefore entrusted popular mobilization and credit distribution to Proshika, a national NGO. Four major conclusions emerge from this research: (1) benefits to women and other target groups have been marginal at best; (2) development planning treats village populations as largely homogenous, ignoring the existence of entrenched power holders who are able to capture the benefits of these programmes; (3) planners also ignore the specificity of local patterns of land ownership, a key factor in the success of participatory projects; and (4) "bottom up" development is in danger of failing because many areas lack a capacity for spontaneous popular mobilization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Von Eschen, Donald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d831s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cj28f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Environmental aspects -- Bangladesh.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic development -- Environmental aspects -- Bangladesh.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social forestry programs -- Bangladesh.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Bangladesh -- Social conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A76537283z"><dcterms:title>Serotonin biosynthesis and receptors in helminths</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hamdan, Fadi F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Serotonin is a very important neuromodulatory agent that affects many physiological and behavioral responses of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In helminths, especially parasitic ones, not much is known about the biosynthesis and mode of action of serotonin or any of the related biogenic amine neurotransmitters, such as catecholamines (dopamine and noradrenaline). In this study, we cloned two full length cDNAs from Schistosoma mansoni encoding tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TPH and TH catalyze the rate limiting steps in the biosynthesis of serotonin and catecholamines, respectively. Both enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified proteins were shown to have TPH and TH activities. This indicates that S. mansoni, and possibly other parasitic helminths, may be capable of synthesizing serotonin and catecholamines endogenously. In the second part of our studies, we looked at the mode of action of serotonin in helminths, in particular the molecular properties of serotonergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). We cloned two helminth GPCRs, one from the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the second from S. mansoni. The C. elegans receptor (5-HT2Ce) was shown to encode a functional serotonin receptor with structural and signaling properties similar to those of mammalian 5-HT2 receptors. However, its agonist I antagonist binding profile differed from previously characterized serotonin receptors. The cloned S. mansoni receptor (SmGPCRx) was found to represent a new structural class of receptor, which shared about the same level of amino acid sequence homology with various biogenic amines receptors, such as serotonin, catecholamines, and octopamine receptors. Additional sequence analysis and immunolocalization studies confirmed that SmGPCRx possesses structural characteristics of a GPCR. SmGPCRx is the first GPCR ever cloned from a parasitic flatworm.

When males are treated with a chronic low dose of cyclophosphamide and then mated to normal females, progeny loss is manifested at the pre- and post-implantation stages of development. The earliest events that lead to embryonic loss were traced to day 2 of gestation when embryos had a decreased DNA synthesis profile and lower cell numbers than control litters. I investigated the hypothesis that chronic exposure of male rats to cyclophosphamide alters zygotic gene expression thus leading to embryonic loss. To assess DNA damage in the embryo, the Comet Assay was performed on 1-cell stage embryos. A significant number of embryos sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males showed the appearance of the Comet indicative of the effect of damaged sperm on the embryos starting from the 1-cell stage. Using a candidate gene approach, the antisense RNA (aRNA), I described the presence of several DNA repair gene families in normal embryos. Progeny sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males manifested a differential expression profile for several of these genes when compared to controls, suggestive of the ability of the embryo to respond to damaged sperm through the major DNA repair systems. To study the functional capacity of progeny sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males, I assessed total RNA synthesis in both groups; while control litters showed a peak of RNA synthesis at the 4-cell stage, the treatment group showed constant low expression throughout the stages examined. I mapped the profile of a number of gene families whose roles are essential for early development in both control and cyclophosphamide-treated groups.

The OT and AVP genes are believed to derive from one common gene by gene duplication and both genes are adjacent to each other on the chromosome in all species studied. Because of the lack of suitable cell lines expressing the OT gene, scientists have taken advantage of the availability of promoter sequences of numerous species to overcome this deficit. Alignment of the OT promoters available revealed stretches of high homology and further analysis of these stretches revealed that they are binding sites for the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors such as the estrogen receptor (ER), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). Here, I identify that the orphan receptors, chicken ovalbumin up-stream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), ErbA-related factor 2 (Ear-2) and retinoid orphan receptor alpha1 (RORalphal) as potential regulators of the OT gene promoter. In contrast to the positive effect of the ER, RAR and TR on the OT promoter, COUP-TFII and Ear-2 have a negative effect on the human OT promoter. The effects of COUP-TFs on the OT promoter are two-fold; they are able to silence or actively repress basal promoter activity and secondly, inhibit the activation by other nuclear receptors via a mechanism of competitive binding. Two additive DNA elements were identified to mediate the effect of COUP-TFII and Ear-2. The first one is a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif spaced by zero nucleotide (DR0) that is embedded in the OT/estrogen response element (OT/ERE). The second element, located downstream of the OT/ERE, consists of three AGGTCA motifs each spaced by four nucleotides. Inhibition of the estrogenic induction only requires the DR0 whereas both elements are required for full silencing of basal activity. DNaseI footprinting and gel shift assays show that recombinant COUP-TFII and Ear-2 are able to bind to the DR0 and the downstream repeats. Mutations that affect the ability of COUP-TFII and Ear-2 to bind to these elements also affect their activity in transient transfection studies. The importance of COUP-TFII and Ear-2 in the regulation of OT gene expression is supported by their expression in the epithelial layer of the rat parturient uterus. The uterus is a known site of OT expression where a dynamic regulation of OT is observed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zingg, Hans H.

Grant (Osborne Grant)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, a philosophy and lexicon for the engineering of biosystems are established. The focus is on a specific class of biosystems ( ecocyborgs) created by combining ecosystems and technological Components. This work is part of the EcoCyborg Project, a highly interdisciplinary research program which concerns the development of a general theory for biosystems engineering, with an emphasis on system autonomy as a design goal. In the short term, the objective is to develop computational models and simulations for use in the study of ecocyborgs as representative instances of substantially autonomous biosystems. Accordingly, in this thesis an explicit conceptual basis is established for the EcoCyborg Project, as well as for biosystems engineering in general. First, in the body of the thesis, a biosystem is defined as a coherent assemblage of entities that is alive to some degree as a whole. The sole criterion for life is considered to be comportment that is somewhat autopoietic , whereby local interactions among the components combine to Continually renew the overall system. Next, concepts related to autonomy, or the formulation and pursuit of proprietary goals, are elaborated. The degree of autonomy of a system is seen to depend on its consciousness, or ability to reason using a model of itself. Hence, a substantially autonomous system requires an ensemble of information storage and processing devices (mind) of the type and sophistication (intelligence ) appropriate for this. The approach that is taken here to the creation of ecocyborgs with such minds is described, and a specific mental architecture is delineated, comprising functionally semidifferentiated, intermediate-scale components arranged according to a semihierarchical control organization. Finally, the characterization of such systems is scrutinized as an epistemic process in which knowledge is generated by an observer, but in which only a limited degree of objectivity is possible. A paradigm appropriate to the engineering of ecocyborgs is defined as an illustration, and associated archetypal concepts and descriptive procedures (such as measures) are given that are useful in this context. Such tools are required by significantly autonomous ecocyborgs because they must characterize themselves. They are also necessary to observers with scientific and engineering agendas.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kok, Robert (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv47w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d594r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biotic communities -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biological systems -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axw42n963t"><dcterms:title>Distributed process cooperation in time warp</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Choe, Myongsu, 1959-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optimistic simulation (or Time Warp) is one of the two major techniques employed in parallel (distributed) discrete event-driven simulation. As opposed to a conservative approach, Time Warp offers great potential to speed up a simulation because it does not rely on the blocking in order to satisfy the causality constraint. By using rollback to correct causality errors and to avoid deadlock, it provides a great deal of parallelism and modeling power. However, it has adverse affects such as memory over-consumption and futile event processing resulting from uncontrolled rollbacks. In this thesis, we propose approaches to solve the inherent problem of load imbalance in optimistic simulations, especially, on a distributed memory MIMD system, thus seeking stability and simulation efficiency at the same time. As promising candidates to achieve these goals, we focus on an efficient GVT computation and the balancing of loads between processors by regulating bursting outgoing message flows or migrating unbalanced loads between processors. First, we suggest a variant of Mattern's GVT algorithm which uses a scalar counter and a partly distributed control to reduce the number of control messages required for GVT computation. We compare it with Bellenot, Samadi, and Mattern's algorithms on simulations of large switching networks---the shuffle ring network, Manhattan street network, and a PCS network. We then propose three different load balancing schemes: a flow control algorithm based on the use of stochastic learning automata, a dynamic load balancing scheme, and an integration of both of these controls. The purpose is to balance loads (measured by a space-time product) between processors. Three control algorithms and a simulation without using any control are compared on the simulations of shuffle ring networks and a PCS network in terms of several measures: simulation elapsed time, number of rollbacks and anti-messages, rollback distances, goodput, and standard deviation of space-time products.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tropper, Carl (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tt35g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n963t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60cz22m"><dcterms:title>Functional regulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cosentino, Gregory P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Translation initiation in eukaryotes represents a major control point at which the expression of cellular genes is regulated. This process involves the activity of several polypeptide eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) which direct the sequential assembly of initiator methionyl-tRNA and mRNA on the ribosome. Two eukaryotic initiation factors, eIF2 and eIF4, are key targets for translational control. eIF2 is necessary to direct methionyl-tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit and phosphorylation of the eIF2alpha subunit leads to a dramatic repression in cellular protein synthesis. The mammalian double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, is an eIF2alpha specific kinase which functions to regulate cell growth and virus replication. Previous studies implied the requirement of PKR dimerization for activation, however the potential association of PKR with itself or with other cellular proteins was ill-defined. We demonstrated that PKR dimerized in vivo and that a PKR mutant with deletion of the catalytic domain retained the ability to dimerize. In contrast, deletion of the two dsRNA-binding motifs in the N-terminal regulatory domain of PKR abolished dimerization. We also demonstrated that PKR interacts with another human dsRNA-binding protein, the TAR RNA-binding protein. Taken together, these data suggest that multimerization of these polypeptides occurs, at least in part, through the conserved dsRNA-binding motif. eIF4F is a heterotrimeric complex that interacts with the 5'-cap structure of mRNA and facilitates the binding of mRNA to ribosomes. eIF4F is Composed of eIF4E (the cap-binding subunit), eIF4A (an RNA helicase), and eIF4G (a 220 kDa polypeptide which serves as a scaffold between eIF4A and eIF4E). In mammalian cells, eIF4F function is modulated by a conserved family of 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). These proteins bind specifically to eIF4E and block its interaction with the eIF4G subunit of the eIF4F complex, thereby repressing cap-dependent translation</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sonenberg, Nahum (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jg590.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz22m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sh96v"><dcterms:title>Investigating the long-term influence of atmospheric acid deposition and forest disturbance on soil chemistry and cation nutrient supplies in a forested ecosystem of southern Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bélanger, Nicolas, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to validate the dynamic model SAFE (Soil Acidification in Forested Ecosystems) in a small deciduous watershed of southern Quebec. SAFE could then be used to: (1) identify which processes are governing acidification, and (2) assess the rates of acidification according to various forest conditions. Soil and soil solution chemistry between unburned and burned zones following fire disturbance seventy-five years ago was examined within the watershed. Results showed two major, statistically significant, differences: (1) higher base status, and (2) lower soil solution N in the burned zone. High quality leaf litter of aspen and birch (burned zone) relative to that of sugar and red maple (unburned zone) has contributed to the enrichment of base cations in the forest floor. The enrichment of the forest floor did not however impoverish the B horizon as seen in other studies. Rather, fire enriched the soil in base cations and buffered the effect of forest regrowth in the B horizon. The MAKEDEP model was used to reconstruct the time-series input files needed to run SAFE. In MAKEDEP, the availability of N determines tree growth which in turn, affects most of the processes involved in nutrient cycling. Regressions of measured deposition at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and that of simulated deposition at the study site suggest MAKEDEP is suitable to model the deposition trends of all elements except Na. SAFE was calibrated for the unburned and burned conditions at the study site. Fire disturbance and forest regrowth have produced different soil chemical composition within the zones as discussed above. SAFE was therefore validated at the study site as a function of its ability to reproduce soil chemistry under unburned and burned conditions. The simulated soil chemistry was in close agreement with the measured unburned soil conditions, but some processes would have to be clarified or accounted for with greater accurately, e.g., biological N fixation and N immobilization by myccorhizal fungi, to reproduce more accurately the measured burned soil chemistry. Simulated soil chemistry in the unburned zone reinforced nevertheless the conclusions of a few historical soil chemistry studies supporting the hypothesis that acid-sensitive forest sites of the United States underwent significant acidification during 1930--1980 during major input of acidity from the atmosphere. Model output suggests that cation nutrient deficiencies could occur in the long-term, but future Al phytotoxic responses are unlikely to occur due to a relatively high projected pH.

The study of larval condition is therefore central to larval fish ecology. In this thesis I sought to (1) carry out an appraisal of the characteristics and the reliability of condition measures now being used, (2) assess the importance of maternal contribution to the nutritional status of larval fish, (3) evaluate the possibility that diel variability in metabolism could lead to serious biasing of the interpretation of condition measures obtained over time, and (4) assess the time course of the condition of larval fishes subjected to periods of intermittent feeding. The experiments described in chapter 2 were designed (1) to assess the impact of female nutritional status on the quality of the eggs and larvae they produced, (2) to determine which of a series of nucleic acid and protein measurements were most responsive to post-hatching starvation, and (3) to determine whether the starvation dynamics of those measures was affected by female source. No significant correlation could be found between any of the maternal traits studied and eggs and larval measures. The results did show, however, that egg size was more variable between-clutches than within-clutch, was independent of embryonic developmental rate, but was positively related to larval size. The existence and ontogeny of circadian (24 hrs.) and ultradian (&lt;24 hrs.) oscillations in the nucleic acids and protein content of larval capelin was investigated in the laboratory experiments outlined in chapter 3. The most obvious long-terms trends occurred during the embryonic period when DNA and RNA content increased constantly, and during the post-yolk-sac period when RNA and protein decreased following sub-optimal feeding. The objectives of the study described in chapter 4 were threefold, (1) to determine which of a series of nucleic acid and protein measurements were affected by intermittent (delayed-fed and delayed-starved) feeding conditions in capelin larvae, (2) to determine the dynamics and shape of the time response, and (3) to determine whether the empirical data gathered were consistent with models developed as a consequence of the review of the literature (chapter 1). Only the dry weight, and the quantity of DNA, RNA, and protein per dry weight differed significantly between starvation and ad libitum feeding controls. Starvation dynamics were less consistent with predictions. Of the indices investigated, the dynamics of the quantity of DNA and RNA per dry weight were the most consistent dynamics with model predictions.

All oral anaerobic spirochetes (OAS) are species within the genus Treponema. They are important causative agents of periodontitis. This thesis examines some aspects of the physiology of OAS. As well, a novel symbiotic bacterium found in the blood of healthy humans was studied as a consequence of my work with OAS. Our lab has been instrumental in rendering routine and reliable growth of OAS in vitro. An inexpensive medium which remains molten at 37°C and solidifies at 25°C was found for the enumeration of colony-forming units of OAS. New Oral Spirochete (NOS) medium with the addition of 0.5% gelatin-0.5% Noble agar met the above criteria. Clinical isolates of spirochetes from the periodontal pocket need to be readily identified. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used on reference strains of Treponema denticola, T. vincentii, T. phagedenis, and T. socranskii as well as a number of clinical isolates in our laboratory collection. The banding patterns observed allowed discrimination between the different spirochete species. Morphological variations such as spherical-shaped cells of T. denticola, termed "spherical bodies" are occasionally observed. The omission of the several individual components from NOS medium (brain heart infusion, yeast extract, rabbit serum, volatile fatty acids, or thiamine pyrophosphate), the age of the culture and the addition of lactic acid, enhanced the formation of these bodies. J. Miklossy (NeuroReport, 1993) reported that spirochetes were found in blood, cerebral cortex and cerebral spinal fluid in autopsied Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects. It was suggested by her that spirochetes could be a causative factor in AD. Our laboratory attempted to duplicate these results and found spirochetes in the blood of only one late stage AD patient suggesting that spirochetes are not one of the causes of AD. During the examination of blood by darkfield microscopy, we observed pleomorphic microorganisms. Blood of a healthy human is a sterile environment. Evidence for the existence of bacteria in blood includes light and electron micrographs of their morphology, and molecular analysis of their 16S ribosomal RNA and their gyrB gene.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, E.

The morphological transition from vesicles to inverted hoops is investigated, and a three-step mechanism is proposed. This mechanism involves a thickening of the vesicle walls accompanied by the formation of the hollow rods in the walls, and a decrease in the size of the original water core. Possible mechanisms of the formation of large vesicles from lamellae, as well as tubules and LCVs from vesicles are discussed. The formation of the self-assembled aggregates with various morphologies is believed to be mainly controlled by the balance of three interactions arising from the core, the corona, and the core-solvent interface. Any factors, such as the addition of salt, which affect the balance will cause morphological changes. Accordingly, the morphogenic effects of added electrolytes, temperature, the common solvent, and the precipitant are studied. The study shows that various morphologies can be prepared from one diblock copolymer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eisenberg, Adi (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f764r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903160b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m830h"><dcterms:title>Activation mechanisms for zymogens belonging to the papain family of cysteine proteases</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Quraishi, Omar.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The activation mechanisms for zymogens belonging to the papain family of cysteine proteases were investigated. This was accomplished using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic measurements, the identification of processing intermediates, and the analysis of the various X-ray crystal structures reported to date. Procathepsin B is a unique precursor of papain-like enzymes in that it is composed of a shorter prodomain; i.e., 62 residues versus &gt;90 residues for those belonging to the cathepsin L-subfamily, and the mature enzyme is composed of a twenty residue insertion termed the occluding loop. In this study, the pH dependence of cathepsin B inhibition by its propeptide was shown to be eliminated upon the removal of this enzyme's occluding loop. Furthermore, variants of cathepsin B carrying the mutation Asp22Ala or His110Ala also displayed a loss of pH dependence for their affinity to the propeptide inhibitor. Similarly, the overall rate of autoprocessing for full-length procathepsin B was shown to be affected by the occluding loop mutations. These results suggest a possible influence of the pH-dependent stability of the occluding loop on the overall rate of processing for this precursor. The addition of the protein-proteinase inhibitor, cystatin C, impeded the overall rate of autoactivation for procathepsin B and procathepsin S and caused the accumulation of processing intermediates for these precursors which were subsequently identified by automated Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequences of these processing intermediates correspond to an area of the prodomains which binds through the substrate-binding clefts of these enzymes, thus suggesting a plausible intramolecular step of processing for this family of zymogens. This unimolecular mechanism was found to rely on the conformational mobility of prosegment residues (i.e., at the C-terminal end). Furthermore, in contrast to what has been observed for zymogens belonging to the aspartic protease family, it was determined that charged residues located at the N-terminus of the mature segment found in propapain do not contribute to the overall pH-triggering mechanism of activation for this precursor. Procathepsin H was determined to be an unusual mammalian member of the cathepsin L-subfamily due to its inability to autoprocess, and the aminopeptidase activity of mature cathepsin H was found to be incapable of converting its own precursor. Furthermore, prosegment residues located near the pro/mature junction of procathepsin H are highly resistant to the proteolytic action of secondary proteases. These findings are consistent with the pre-formation of a disulfide bond within the cathepsin H precursor which links the prodomain to the enzyme using Cys82p and Cys214. Consistent with the findings for procathepsins B and S, the unrestricted conformational mobility at the C-terminal end of the prosegment (i.e., near the pro/mature junction) is an important prerequisite for efficient autoactivation to occur among zymogens of papain-like enzymes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Storer, Andrew C.

While the physiology of the procerebrum is relatively well characterized, the procerebrum's structure and organization has not been previously investigated in detail. The goal of this thesis is to better characterize the structural organization of the procerebrum and to understand how it compares with other olfactory systems. The morphology of the procerebral neurons in the snail Helix aspersa was investigated through intracellular injections of biocytin. The population of cells is heterogeneous, but no formal categorization of neuronal types was possible. The main difference among cells lies in the placement of the cells' neurites. Furthermore, contradicting previous results, certain neurons were found to have neurite projections outside the procerebrum, travelling as far as the contralateral cerebral ganglion. To investigate if differences in sites of arborization represent functional differences, the distribution of synaptic contacts on labelled cells was studied using serial sections and electron microscopy. Neurons with different sites of arborization have distinct patterns of synapse distribution. Cells with arborizations in the procerebrum but not in the internal mass have large varicosities specialized for output. Cells that arborize in the internal mass or outside the procerebrum have mostly input synapses proximal to the soma and mostly output synapses in the terminal region of the neurites. These latter cells appear to transmit information from the procerebral cell body mass to other brain regions. The implications of these data are, firstly, that the procerebrum directly distributes processed information throughout the nervous system. Secondly, the procerebral neuron population may be divisible into two subgroups: intrinsically arborizing interneurons and projection neurons. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which compartmentalization could be achieved in the procerebrum. Compartmentalization is believed to be important for processing olfactory information, is present in most olfactory centres but has not previously been described in the molluscan olfactory system. I propose that varicosities on the local interneurons generate foci of activity in the procerebrum which, in turn, activate specific subsets of output neurons, similar to what happens in other olfactory systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chase, Ronald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd479.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g449w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brown garden snail -- Nervous system.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Smell -- Molecular aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neurons -- Ultrastructure.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abz60cz23w"><dcterms:title>A characterization and performance evaluation of digitally redesigned control systems /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rabbath, Camille Alain.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the characterization and performance evaluation of sampled-data control systems obtained with the digital redesign of continuous-time control systems. The first part of the characterization is concerned with the Plant Input Mapping (PIM) method which is the only digital redesign technique guaranteeing closed-loop stability provided the sampling period is nonpathological. Three modified PIM methods are proposed to solve the issues of reducing the order and the number of controllers present in a PIM-based control system. Furthermore, alternatives to the regular PIM method which utilize classical discretization techniques on the systems relating the reference input to the control input and the controlled output are proposed. To solve the polynomial Diophantine equation involved in the PIM process, a set of guidelines is presented, rendering the approach more systematic. The second part of the characterization investigates the behavior of sampled-data control systems in terms of (i) their responses to reference and disturbance inputs, (ii) their internal and input-output stability, (iii) the controller block transfer functions, (iv) their discrete-time sensitivity functions, (v) the induced norms of the closed-loop systems, and (vi) the transform representation of the control input and controlled output. The main objective of the characterization is to make clear the intuitive idea that a digitally redesigned control system should approach, in a certain sense, its continuous-time counterpart for sufficiently fast sampling frequencies. The time-domain characterization is partly accomplished by employing a continuous-time lifting reformulation of the control systems. The performances of sampled-data control systems are evaluated via the Linfinity, L2 norms and ITAE index of the control-input and controlled-output errors, and the Linfinity-, L2-induced norms of the systems of interest. The variation of the performance measures with the sampling period is clarified and the superiority of the PIM methods over the local digital redesign techniques, for relatively large sampling intervals, is analytically and quantitatively determined. Four simulation examples and one experiment illustrate the effectiveness of the PIM methods over other digital redesign techniques and validate the theorems developed on the characterization of sampled-data control systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hori, N.

The purposes of this study were (a) to compare the psychological responses of children hospitalized in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with those of children hospitalized on a general ward; and (b) to determine whether there was a relationship between children's psychological responses post-hospital discharge and their age, the number and type of invasive procedures to which they were exposed during hospitalization, severity of illness, and length of hospital stay. A prospective cohort design was used to study two groups of children (N = 120). The study group included 60 children who had been hospitalized in a PICU, and the comparison group 60 children hospitalized on a general ward. Data were collected just prior to discharge, at six weeks and six months following discharge, from two metropolitan children's hospitals. Groups were compared on the following psychological responses: (a) the child's sense of control over his or her health; (b) the child's medical fears; (c) intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors related to hospitalization, as indicators of post-traumatic stress; and (d) changes in the child's behavior following hospitalization. In order to examine the possibility of post-traumatic stress responses in these children, the 'Child Impact of Event Scale' was developed in this study as a modified version of an adult measure originally developed by Horowitz and colleagues (1979).

Data from 978 self-administered questionnaires were analysed. Home makers suffered more than nursing aides from low back pain attributed to work. The adjusted odds ratios for home makers were: 1.63 (95% CI = 1.03--2.58) for a first episode of low back pain during 1998--1992, 2.43 (95% CI = 1.05--5.60) for disabling low back pain in 1992, 1.51 (95% CI = 1.13--2.02) for ever having low back pain as of 1992.

There was an excess risk of low back pain in the incident cohort; none in the prevalent cohort. The risk of low back pain was shown to decrease with increasing age, help to move patients, adequate equipment in the bedrooms, sufficient space in the bathrooms of patients. The risk increased with convalescent post-op patients, transfers of patients, seniority greater than 5 years, delivery of children, need of a patient-lift.

A specific super-set of topologically asymmetric platforms and one with actuated holonomic higher pairs are included in the analysis. After PSGP are described and classified, the remainder of the first portion is devoted to the review of the geometric and mathematical tools used in the analysis. A single univariate polynomial is derived which yields the solutions to the forward kinematics problem of every PSGP platform. Kinematic mapping is used to represent distinct displacements of the platform as discrete points in a three-dimensional projective image space. Separate motions of each leg map to skew one-sheet hyper-boloids, or hyperbolic paraboloids, depending on the kinematic architecture of the leg. After two elimination steps the three quadric surfaces are reduced to a sixth order univariate. The roots of this polynomial reveal all solutions to the forward kinematics problem. The procedure leads to a robust algorithm which can be applied to the abovementioned super-set. The inverse kinematics problem of these platforms is solved, in closed form, using the same kinematic mapping. The procedure can be applied to any three-legged planar platform with lower pairs, regardless of symmetry. A workspace analysis and simple criteria for the determination of the existence of a dextrous workspace are presented. Finally, a geometric singularity and self-motion detection method, which does not employ Jacobian matrices, is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zsombor-Murray, Paul J.

A member of the supergene family of Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG), LTC4 synthase catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the biologically active cysteinyl leukotrienes. Pharmacological cross-reactivity between LTC4 synthase and other proteins in the five-lipoxygenase pathway was assessed, leading to the identification of L-699,333 as the most potent LTC4 synthase inhibitor amongst the compounds available, previously reported as a nanomolar five-lipoxygenase inhibitor and a weak LTC4 synthase inhibitor. Compounds that bind competitively to the arachidonic acid binding sites on five-lipoxygenase and five-lipoxygenase-activating protein, were found to recognize motifs that are weakly conserved on the binding site of LTC 4 synthase. L-699,333 was used to study LTC4 synthase catalysis revealing a random, rapid equilibrium mechanism, with strong substrate inhibition imparted by LTA4. Further studies showed that inhibition of LTC 4 synthase activity induced by cellular activation by phorbol esters, was due to direct phosphorylation of the enzyme. The dose-dependent phosphorylation event was found to be specific to TBP-1 cells, time-dependent with implications of negative feedback, influenced by the cellular density, and mediated by protein kinase C.

However, the thesis argues that this approach does not distinguish adequately between policies favourable to the growth and prosperity of developed countries and those pertaining to developing countries in part because the paradigm has an impoverished notion of information, communication, and culture. By fostering this economic paradigm in developing countries, these organizations may, in effect, be imposing an inconsistent model on them in many respects. This thesis explores this conundrum with particular reference to the model's concepts of information, communication, and culture and the consequences of these concepts on the application of the model in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Ghana. The thesis employs case studies to demonstrate the impact of cultural imperatives on the neoclassical economic concepts of efficiency of competition, trade liberalization, currency devaluation, public expenditure reduction, and privatization promoted by the structural adjustment programme. It suggests that some of the failures of the programme may be ascribed to the great differences between the imperatives of neoclassical economics and the cultural realities of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Study one investigated how the status of scientists presenting their research at laboratory meetings influenced distributed reasoning. When the presenter was of high status, the Principal Investigator was an important influence on the distributed reasoning. When the presenter was of low status, other lab members were more likely to contribute to distributed reasoning. Study two examined if social interactions between scientists at laboratory meetings result in minor or major representational change. Also investigated in study two was if the status of the laboratory members influenced the type of representational change that occurred during social interactions. The results showed that a scientist changes her or his representation by generalizing over two or more representations that were discussed during social interactions. The Principal Investigator was a key contributor to representational change involving generalization. Study three examined how dyadic social interactions influenced representational change. It was found that the individual who initiates representational discussion after identifying a problem with her or his representation is the dyad member who is most likely to change her or his representation. Representational change also required that the other dyad member clarify the initiator's representation problem.

In the light of William Caplin's recent theory of formal functions, (Caplin 1985; 1998), the second part of the thesis in a substantial selection of musical excerpts from the eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries, demonstrates that 5 - 6 technique as a contrapuntal analatycal concept, provides an effective model for understanding the development of chromaticism and the extension of the tonal language at multiple structural levels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McLean, Don (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fn47w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r275r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Musical analysis -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music theory -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558f914"><dcterms:title>Bluff-body flow simulations using vortex methods</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Akbari, Mohammad Hadi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Incompressible, viscous, two-dimensional unsteady flows over bluff bodies are simulated via the use of vortex methods. The vorticity domain is discretized into a number of Lagrangian point vortices. The vorticity transport equation is split into convection and diffusion parts, and each part is solved sequentially, rather than simultaneously, in each time step. The convection equation is solved using a "vortex-in-cell" method, and the diffusion equation is either simulated by a random walk method, or solved using a finite-difference ADI scheme. New vorticity is created on the body surface during each time step in order to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition. The no-flow boundary condition is satisfied through proper adjustment of the stream-function on the body surface. Impulsively started flow over an isolated circular cylinder is simulated, and early stages of flow development are studied. Also, the variation of force coefficients and vortex shedding frequency with Reynolds number for fully-developed flows are obtained. Transverse oscillations of a circular cylinder in a cross-flow are investigated, and a lock-in diagram is obtained. Effects of the frequency and amplitude of oscillation on force coefficients and Strouhal frequency are studied. In-line oscillations of a circular cylinder are also simulated, and a similar investigation is performed. Unsteady flow over elliptic cylinders at high angles of attack is simulated. A conformal transformation is used to map the body onto a unit circle, and computations are conducted in the transformed plane. Detailed information on the velocity and vorticity fields around stationary and pitching elliptic cylinders are given. The effects of several parameters on the flow field are investigated. The dynamic stall flow over a pitching NACA 0012 airfoil is simulated. A similar conformal transformation to that employed for the elliptic cylinder is also used in this case. The process of flow separation, vortex formation and release, and flow reattachment during pitching cycles are studied, through streamline and vorticity contour plots. Hysteresis loops for the force and pitching moment coefficients are obtained, and the effects of several parameters on the dynamic stall characteristics of the airfoil are investigated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Price, S.

Significant homologies were found between this protein and the baculovirus protein p10. p10 is also associated with a large network of fibrous bodies produced very late in baculovirus infected insect cells. FALPE and p10 were shown to have the ability to self-associate via a coiled-coil domain found at their amino termini. Self-association of these proteins results in the formation of larger aggregates which constitute the building blocks of the filaments seen within infected cells. The amino acid sequences of both FALPE and p10 proteins of some baculoviruses contain an unusual motif consisting of a number of repeats of the proline-glutamic acid dipeptide. We have identified another Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) protein which also contains a similar motif. This protein was designated p96, due to its apparent molecular weight. P96 is a non-structural protein expressed late in infection and localizes to the nuclear ring zone of baculovirus-infected cells. These characteristics suggested that it may be involved in occlusion body and/or virion morphogenesis. The significance of the proline-glutamic acid (PE) repeats in a variety of proteins is unclear. In the three insect virus late proteins discussed in this thesis (FALPE, p10, and p96) this domain appears to play a role of a rigid arm needed for proper positioning of the functional subdomains of these proteins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richardson, Christopher D.
