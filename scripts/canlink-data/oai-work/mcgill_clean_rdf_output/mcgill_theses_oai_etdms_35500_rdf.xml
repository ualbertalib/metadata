An unanswered question  is whether this decrease in activity can be found for the successive presentation of  similar complex visual scenes. We used a test in which landscape pictures were  divided vertically into three segments. A first segment was presented and followed  several stimuli later by a second segment. Reaction time was faster for the second  segment than for the first one. The presentation of the second segment was  associated with reduced activity in late stage visual processing areas, which  replicates and extends the results on priming of different exemplars of objects, and  with increased activity mainly in frontal and parietal regions, which are known to  be associated with memory retrieval.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666507w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h254x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430537c"><dcterms:title>Strategies for preparing segmentally isotopically labeled proteins for probing domain-domain interactions by FTIR spectroscopy by Sarah Jane Martinez.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martinez, Sarah Jane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a powerful  tool for probing protein structure-function relationships. With the use of isotope  editing, it can also be employed to elucidate protein-nucleic acid interactions.  This technique was used to study the sequence of heat-induced unfolding of the  uniformly labeled 13C regulatory subunit (RSU) of E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase  (ATCase) with its inhibitor CTP. The absorption of CTP in the amide I' region limits  our ability to detect protein conformational changes upon binding of CTP. Therefore,  by labeling the protein with 13C shifts the amide I' band ~ 40 cm -1 and  clearly separates the protein bands from those of CTP. Variable-temperature (VT)  FTIR spectroscopy was then employed to monitor the thermal unfolding of the labeled  RSU in the presence and absence of CTP. In addition, isotope editing was further explored to probe  domain-domain interactions of the two domains of RSU using intein technology. Intein  technology provides a novel means by which isotope editing can be performed to  extract information on protein inter-domain and inter-subunit interactions by  spectroscopic analysis but has not yet been exploited in Fourier transform infrared  (FTIR) spectroscopy. The objective of this project is to present for the first time  the feasibility of segmental labeling through intein-mediated protein ligation (IPL)  for the purpose of studying conformational changes by FTIR spectroscopy, using  ATCase as a model enzyme. In the first phase of this project, the RSU of ATCase,  which houses a Zn-binding domain and a nucleotide binding domain, was reconstructed  from its isolated domains using commercially available intein-base expression  vectors. As steps towards obtaining an isotope labeled RSU, we have fused each  domain to separate inteins. Following affinity purification, the intein tags were  chemically cleaved and the reactive ends of the two RSU domains were ligated  together to form a peptide. Although ligation was successful, improved yields are  required for the FTIR spectroscopic studies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs20d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430537c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proteins -- Denaturation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aspartic acid -- Denaturation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x00p"><dcterms:title>The development of contemporary medical genetics research models and the need for scientific responsibility /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marshall, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Current medical genetics research is dominated by a single  theory that supports the Human Genome Project rationale.

Firstly, the hypotheses are discussed in detail followed by a  subsection in which research evidence based on each hypothesis is cited. Secondly,  these medical genetics hypotheses are situated within the contemporary medical  paradigm. To conclude, the thesis examines in depth the ethical and practical  implications of medical genetics research. A framework of analysis of scientific  responsibility is used to explore these implications. Scientific responsibility, as  presented in this thesis, is a process consisting of three steps: (1) scientific  discourse; (2) the development of the nature of scientific responsibility; and, (3)  effective criticism. Once scientific responsibility is defined, the term is applied  specifically to the field of medical genetics research.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p0967623.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x00p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g8126"><dcterms:title>The effect of clinoptilolite properties and supplementation levels on swine performance /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leung, Stanley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Clinoptilolite is a zeolite and an aluminosilicate that can be  fed to swine in order to reduce nutrients being excreted because of their molecular  sieving properties, high cation exchange capacities, and a high affinity for the  ammonium ion (NH4+). Preliminary research has been carried out on utilizing  zeolite's unique characteristics for dietary supplementation for livestock, however  much of this research is limited and is still in its infancy. The results from this study show that the zeolite with a  particle size distribution either &gt;250 mum or mixed (50% particles greater and  smaller than 250 mum) adsorbed the most NH4+. Macro mineral and heavy metal release  was similar among all particle size distributions tested, but varied between sources  of zeolite. Handling properties of zeolite were not affected by moisture content or  particle size. The feed trial indicated that zeolite supplementation, combined with  a low crude protein and energy diet and at an inclusion level of 4%, showed  potential as a feed additive in swine diets for the purposes of nutrient reduction.  Nevertheless, zeolite seemed to have a greater impact on energy ingestion, as  compared to crude protein. Even at 6% zeolite inclusion in the feed, hog muscle,  kidney and liver tissues showed no significant increase in heavy metal contents, as  compared to those fed any zeolite.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418n780.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g8126</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Clinoptilolite.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Swine -- Feeding and feeds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feed additives.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tp870"><dcterms:title>S-acylation of fully deprotected peptides using thioesters as acyl donors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leung Wai Sang, Stephane, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Diverse eukaryotic proteins require the post-translational  addition of S-acyl chains to cysteine residues for proper function, a process known  as S-palmitoylation, or S-acylation.

In order to facilitate this task, a novel technique employing  readily-prepared long-chain acyl thioesters has been devised. Using  S-phenylmercapto-palmitoyl thioester as well as other acyl thioesters, the  fluorescent-labeled peptide, myristoyl-GCG-caBim, was S-acylated to high  stoichiometry at halftimes as short as 20 min.

The current studies aimed  to investigate the presence of gender differences in the interactions of ethanol and  stress with the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. Methods. Participants  included 12 males and 10 females with no previous personal or familial history of  alcoholism. Plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol were estimated following a placebo  drink, a low and a high dose of alcohol and a psychological stress task performed 30  minutes after the ingestion of the placebo, the low and the high alcohol drinks.  Results. Male participants presented a more pronounced response of the HPA-axis to  both alcohol and psychological stress. Prior ingestion of the low and to a lesser  extent of the high dose of alcohol induced a more pronounced and longer lasting  attenuation of the HPA-axis response to stress in males than females. Conclusions.  There are gender differences in the interactions of ethanol and stress with the  HPA-axis, which may contribute to the gender differences in alcohol  consumption.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f78r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2362556</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Physiological.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychometrics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b591903d"><dcterms:title>Malaria vectors in an irrigated and in a rain-fed division of southern Sri Lanka</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Goodfellow, Angela Mary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Anopheles species composition and relative seasonal abundance  were measured in an irrigated division (low historical malaria incidence) and in a  rain-fed division (high historical malaria incidence) of southern Sri Lanka.

To better understand the role of  these cells in CNS pathogenesis, we have created a mouse model with selective and  conditional ablation of microglia as well as other cells of myeloid origin in  proliferation. To achieve the elimination of proliferating microglia, transgenic  mice that express the suicidal gene herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1  TK) driven by the myeloid specific promoter CD11b were generated. HSV-1 TK is itself  unable to mediate cell death. However, unlike the mammalian thymidine kinase, HSV-1  TK is capable of phosphorylating specific nucleoside analogues such as ganciclovir  which lead during cell proliferation to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death.  Here, we will describe the creation and the characterization of CD11b-TK mouse lines  that can be used to ablate proliferating myeloid cells in paradigms of acute CNS  injury.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547r96p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt95r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795826v"><dcterms:title>Regulation of HIV-1 gene expression by clade-specific Tat proteins</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Desfoss√©s, Yan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The major group of HIV-1 viruses that comprises the current  global pandemic evolved, during their worldwide spread, into at least 10 distinct  subtypes or clades.

The Hu6800 and U133A GeneChipsRTM were used to evaluate the expression  of 446 CHR-X genes in an in vitro EOC model system comprising 4 EOC cell lines and  12 primary cultures of normal ovary surface epithelia. Fifty-one new candidate CHR-X  genes were identified in addition to 49 genes previously implicated in cancer. Many  genes map to regions with frequent genetic aberrations in EOC tumours, or interact  with the known EOC tumour suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2. Candidate genes described in  this study may provide novel markers for histopathological subtypes, or the  tumourigenic potential of EOC tumours. The X-inactive-specific-transcript (XIST) was  absent in two highly tumourigenic EOC cell lines, TOV21G and TOV112D. XIST mRNA is  important for the stability of X-chromosome-inactivation (XCI), as its absence  destabilizes the silencing of genes on the inactive-X. Aberrant bi-allelic  expression of FHL1, a gene subjected to XCI was detected in the cell line TOV21G but  not in the cell line TOV112D. Genotyping assays using polymorphic microsattelite  markers suggested that TOV21G has retained heterozygosity of CHR-X. The majority of  alleles tested for TOV112D were consistent with loss of heterozygosity of CHR-X.  Taken together these findings are consistent with two proposed mechanisms mediating  XIST loss-of-expression in cancer: (1) Duplication of the active-X followed by loss  of the inactive-X (TOV112D); or (2) Reactivation of the previously inactive-X  (TOV21G).</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kn690.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf157</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs22z"><dcterms:title>Heterologous functional interactions of P2X ATP receptors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>B√©langer, Danny</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Part I. In this work we show that P2X3 currents are acutely  modulated by the GPCRs mGluR5 and P2Y2, and by the neurotrophin TrkA receptor,  expressed in nociceptors, in the recombinant Xenopus oocyte system. The  intracellular C-terminal domain of P2X 3 plays an important role in its functional  coupling to TrkA. Preliminary studies suggest a role for PKC in the P2X3-TrkA  cross-talk, but other routes may also contribute. Part II. Neurogenic and  pharmacological stimulation of vascular smooth muscle P2X1 elicits a contractile  response that we found was potentiated by serotonin acting through 5HT2A. We also  found in Xenopus oocytes that P2X 1 currents in the desensitized state are  potentiated by M1 ACh receptors and by phorbol ester stimulation of PKC. Part III.  We have shown in Boue-Grabot et al. (2003) that there was an intracellular negative  cross-talk and physical interaction between P2X2 and 5HT3A receptors. We also found  a functional interaction between P2X2 and GABAA alpha2beta 3 receptor subtypes in  HEK293 mammalian cells and in Xenopus oocytes; and we confirmed the findings of  Sokolova et al. , (2001) in primary cultures of DRG neurons.

The capillary rheometer has  been the only instrument able to operate at spurt stresses up to present time,  because capillary rheometers operate at shear stresses that are out of the range of  rotational shear rheometers. However, a sliding plate rheometer can generate shear  stresses in the spurt range. A comparative study using two linear polybutadiene  samples at 50¬∞C was carried out using these two rheometers. Special  attention was paid to the evaluation of the actual pressure drop in the capillary in  order to determine the true shear stress at the wall. It was found that spurt occurs  only in the capillary rheometer. In other words, the flow curve generated by the  sliding plate rheometer is continuous in the shear stress range where spurt is  observed in the capillary rheometer. Slip velocities were determined using data from  the two rheometers, and the slip velocities for the post-slip capillary flow all  fall on the smooth curve based on sliding plate data, provided that the pressure  drop in the capillary, and not the overall driving pressure, is used to calculate  the wall shear stress.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w786j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f8765</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs57j"><dcterms:title>Design and analysis of micro-mirror based tunable optical delay line</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Soleymani, S.

The past decade has seen a  large research and development activity in this area. In this thesis, design and performance analysis of a tunable  optical delay line which employs pop-up MEMS micro-mirrors have been described. The  delay paths which their lengths are in binary fashion are free-space based delay  lines. Micro-mirrors operate as a switch to redirect the light through delay paths.  One of the main characteristic of this design is to provide constant optical power  loss for different delay times. Computer simulations have been shown to evaluate the  performance of the system to different sources of misalignments. The result of simulations suggests using correction mirrors in  order to decrease the optical power loss due to misalignment. It has been also  concluded that improvement of pop-up micro-mirrors as a main source of misalignment,  will alleviate the performance remarkably.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq26z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs57j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558d85s"><dcterms:title>Artificial cell microcapsules for oral delivery of thalidomide for use in Crohn's disease : design, preparation, and in-vitro analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Metz, Terrence</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A delivery method for the oral administration of thalidomide for  lowering tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNT-alpha), and thus Crohn's disease-related  inflammation in the proximal small intestine, using two separate engineered polymer  microcapsules is explored in this thesis. Membrane formation of both  alginate-polylysine-alginate (APA) and alginate-chitosan (AC) capsules are discussed  and thalidomide encapsulation procedures have been described. In-vitro tests have  been used to monitor capsule degradation and drug release in a simulated  gastrointestinal environment. Also, culture and use of RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage  cells for the simulation of the human intestine is described. Results show two  separate methods of drug delivery by the APA and AC capsules. APA capsules release  thalidomide in a timed-release fashion whereas AC capsules release the drug in a  burst manner. These results implicate the benefits of the use of both capsules to  target separate sites along the small intestine. Also the cultured macrophage  studies conclude that the proposed encapsulation therapy does indeed lower TNF-alpha  levels and could therefore be of benefit for the lowering of inflammation associated  with Crohn's disease. However, further animal study is needed before full potential  of this approach can be realized.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z69v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d85s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752h288"><dcterms:title>On planar dyads, four-bar linkages and image space insights into the design problem</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nie, Jun, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A planar joint dyad consists of two rigid bodies connected by a  P (prismatic) or R (revolute) joint and similarly connected to a fixed third body.

More precisely, we propose a decision feedback symbol-by-symbol decoding  algorithm for the Quasi-Orthogonal code family, that comprises the Quasi-Orthogonal  code and the Improved Quasi-Orthogonal code, by using the QR decomposition. Compared  to optimal joint decoding, this algorithm significantly reduces complexity. For  performance evaluations of the simplified decoding algorithm for the  Quasi-Orthogonal code family over Rayleigh fading channels, we derive upper and  lower bounds for symbol error rate. Furthermore, by using high SNR asymptotics we  investigate the diversity orders provided by different decoding algorithms. The  analysis shows that because of the relative constellation rotation, the diversity  order provided by optimal decoding for the Improved Quasi-Orthogonal code is 4.  Also, because of the error propagation in the decision feedback, the diversity order  provided by the simplified decoding for the Improved Quasi-Orthogonal code is  reduced to 2. All analytical results match well the associated computer simulations.  Finally, we compare the performances of the simplified and optimal decoding for the  Improved Quasi-Orthogonal code over correlated Rayleigh fading channels by using the  "one-ring" channel model. Through computer simulations we show that the  relative performance loss between the simplified and optimal decoding decreases as  channel correlation increases. Therefore, the simplified decoding algorithm is  suitable for highly spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wd30f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s3032</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atd96k315k"><dcterms:title>Organic thin film transistors based on conjugated polymers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chen, Yi, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Thin film transistors with different polymers (PTFTs) as active  channel layers have been fabricated and studied in this work. Three different  fabrication procedures were used to fabricate long and short channel PTFTs on  silicon substrates and long channel PTFTs on glass substrates. It has been shown  that the success rate of fabrication of PTFTs on glass substrates with anodic Al 2O3  gate dielectrics is higher than that on silicon substrates with thermally grown SiO2  gate dielectrics. The characteristics of PTFTs fabricated using several polymers  were studied. Among them, the ones based on regioregualr  poly[3-hexylthiophene-2.5diy] (RR-P3HT) have the best performance with a field  effect mobility (mueff) of about 0.01 cm2/V-s and ION/IOFF value of about 50 when  doped with FeCl3. Results of measurement suggested that FeCl3 doping of P3HT could  lead to a decrease of about 5 orders of magnitude in its contact resistance to Au  electrodes, giving rise to two orders of magnitude increase of its apparent  mobility. Therefore, it can be concluded that the contact resistances are the major  limitation of performance of many PTFTs and need to be studied intensively in the  future.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv73k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k315k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c1034"><dcterms:title>Parents' and teachers' differing views of group work with gifted students</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saunders, Katie, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a previous study by our research group, parents and teachers  of gifted children disagreed about the importance of group work in the inquiry-based  classroom, with parents rating group work as less important than did teachers (Syer  &amp; Shore, 2001).
