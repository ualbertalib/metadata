The object of the present account is, therefore, to give some description of just what Great Britain received when Canada was ceded to her in 1763. The most outstanding characteristics of economic activity in French Canada were inertness and government paternalism, the former usually being attributed to the latter. An attempt has been made to correct this impression to some degree and to arrive at a balance of the various factors which conditioned the economic life of Canada.

There are also some translations of the Finnish ballads from the Kanteletar of Elias Lonnrot. A brief summary of the theories of poetic origins is given, some additional corroborative evidence in behalf of the communal theory of ballad origin included, and a reasonable comprehensive theory suggested. Similarities and differences in form and material among European ballads are analysed. A description  of the later history of the ballad concludes the discussion.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macmillan, C.

It has however, amply justified its existence by throwing light on two of the major problems of chemistry. Suoh problems for example as: the mechanism of reactions and the nature of chemical change, and to some extent the much discussed and investigated question of affinity, the latter prior to the last decade having been studied largely by investigations of systems in their initial and final states, with little or no oonsideration of the path by whichthey reached such states. In addition, much of what we now know concerning the mechanism and use of catalysts, from both the theoretical and practical aspects, is due to investigations carried out in the field of reaction velocities, and to mention only one more instance, our knowledge of the nature of surfaces and their very oonsiderableimportance in promoting chemical reaction.

For this purpose the velocity of reaction between propylene and hydrogen chloride, in the liquid state, was measured over a considerable temperature range. The influence of heterogenous surface and of hydride concentration were determined and the reaction between propylene and hydrogen bromide in various solvents investigated. A review is given below of the previous work in this field. In this connection it will be shown that the investigation has an objective of more far reaching importance than just the elucidation of the mechanism of the particular reaction examined and that the experiments have an essential bearing on the validity of the discontinuity in reaction velocity at the critical temperature, which was discovered in this laboratory.

All varieties of Nature writing are appearing today, from poetry and the light essay to the novel of country life, and the phrase "return to Nature" is on many lips. To study the origin of this literature of rural life is to note the gradual growthof a feeling for natural beauty, and its expression in literature, and in particular, the slow appreciation of the life lived by rural folk on their farms or in secluded hamlets.
