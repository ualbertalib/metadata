The object of this paper however is to bring the explanation of the phenomenon of icterus neonatorwm in accordance with the modern views on icterus in general and with the haemolytic type especially. In the last twenty years radical changes have been made,in regard to the conception of the pathogenesis of the various forms of icterus. These new ideas only slowly have gained entrance into the explanatlon of the physiological icterus occuring in the new born. An attempt is made here to explain the phenomenon of icterus neonatorum on the basis of the modern conception of icterus in general.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tait, J. &amp; Waugh, T.

Selon Goldberg (1) " e Modernisme. dans sed implications plus larges, n'est pas un phénomène limité aux écrivains castellans et ibero-amérioainsde la dernière partie du l8ème siècle et de la première partie du 20ème, mais c'est una manifestation de l'éspr1t qui inonda le monde intellectual de l'ouest, pendant cette période - Surnbourne, Hanptman, Nietzche, Ibsen, Whitman, d'Annunzio et surtout les parnassiens et des symbolistes en France.

Scenery has two main purposes. These are, first, that of utility, by supplying a background for the action, and by reproducing objects mentioned in the text of the play; and, second, that of art, by the giving of pleasure to the eye as well as the creating of illusion. The combination of these two purposes in a setting makes a production live. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macmillan, C.

All the various methods by which an artist may express himself are combined in the art of the drama, for it is a blending of literature, painting, dancing, music and sculpture. But, whereas in the past the art of literature alone was emphasized, today the other arts are regarded as equally important in the production of plays. From 1660, when movable scenery was introduced on the stage, to the present day, the art of' the theatre has greatly developed. It wasduring the Restoration period that the picture-frame stage was introduced and with it came many of the elaborate Italian methods of staging. The English theatre retained this form throughout a great part of the eighteenth century, but in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a passion for realism resulted in an effort to reform the stage.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of the welding process as a means of building up and connecting structural members and the possibilities are only beginning to be recognised. There is still a lack of knowledge of the physical characteristics of welded joints. At present this difficulty is overcome by using a large factor of safety. The problem, then, is to determine the distribution of stress in the component parts of the joint. Within the past three years several attempts have been made to solve this problem.

The results of our studies are considered in respect to both quantitative and qualitative changes in urinary elimination and a comparison is made of the diuresis resulting from the injection of the organic mercury oomplex, novasurol, and that following the inorganic compound, mercuric chloride. Finally, some conclusions are drawn concerningthe mechanism of the process. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stehle, R.

In 1921 Maass and Wright investigated theproperties of pure ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, acetylene, and allylene which are the first members of an homologous series of compounds containing two and three carbon atoms. By this investigation the effect on the properties of the compounds by passing from saturation to various degrees of unsaturation was shown. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.
