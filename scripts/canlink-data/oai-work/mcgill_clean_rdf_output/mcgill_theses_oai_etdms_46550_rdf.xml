En discutant avec le musicologue Bruce Haynes, qui termine actuellement la rédaction de son livre The Pathetick Musician, dans lequel il étudie entre autres les Passions dans les cantates de Johann Sebastian Bach, la réponse à cette question s'est imposée d'elle-même. Il doit certainement exister un lien entre les registrations de Kauffmann et les textes des chorals sur lesquels il a composé ses préludes!

The great difference between the pancreatic secretion in herbivorous animals such as the rabbit and that of carnivorous animals such as the dog and cat, is that the secretion in the herbivors is continuous. This continuity of secretion was assumed by early investigators to be dependent on the unceasing digestive work of the stomach.

The sympathetic nerve is the second secretory nerve supplying the salivary glands, and when it is sectioned there is very little change in the reflex salivary secretion. After section of the parasympathetic nerve supply, the sympathetic nervealone cannot transmit reflex impulses from the mouth cavity to the salivary glands. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tait, J.

The absence of this information is not due in any way to lack of research work on the part of the writer, but arises primarily from the newness of the cellophane industry. The comparatively recent establishment of the industry largely accounts for the lack of literature dealing with it. Furthermore, a large number of patents originally covering the process of manufacturing cellophane has expired, thereby exposing the DuPont cellophane company in the United states and the cellophane subsidiary of Canadian Industries Limited in Canada to merciless competition on the part of outsiders.

Steel has been called the "core of capitalism". The very word is fraughtwith romance. It is the symbol of strength. The ramifications of its production include the ownership of mineral deposits, of coal mines, of huge plants - an integrated whole. The stress and conflict of the present economic era are reflected in the growth of the steel industry. The competitive system generated the desire and necessity of control, and in this process the introduction of huge amounts of capital followed. It was this necessity that led to the trust movement that involved the steel industry. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Forsey, E.
