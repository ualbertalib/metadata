The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is made asymmetrical with respect to the direction of incidence or the beam and the resulting polarization computed. Only one parameter is used to fit the curves to the experimental results. Coulomb interference is taken into account but transparency properties are neglected. The positions of the maxima and minima are well predicted but due to the transparency in many cases the magnitude of polarization is not in the right range. The existing experimental results of scattering on carbon are analyzed in detail showing the importance of the separation or elastic from inelastic scattering.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, R.

A theory for the determination of the dispersion characteristics of these structures has been outlined. Various methods for modifying the characteristics of a slow wave structure to suit travelling wave maser applications are also discussed. Propagation along open comb and meander line structures was studied in the L band. A method was developed for the direct measurement of group velocity. Experimental results indicated that both the modified comb and meander line structures could be used in travelling wave maser circuits in conjunction with solenoids.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>D’Ombrain, G.

Roundness indices based on visual recognition and counting of four grain types were used to study sands from the Alfold in Hungary and the Great Sand Hills in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan sand showed a significant increase in roundness within about five miles. All the sands in the sand plateau of the Alfold are eolian and increase in roundness with the distance from their source (the Duna (Danube) Valley).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Elson, J.

Its foundations have so far not been fully investigated. There are, perhaps, many such branches of mathematics, but the calculus of probability is unique among them regarding the specific course of the development of its fundamental principles. This is bound up with what H. Steinhaus calls the “tavern” origin of probability. A theory of gambling games at first, it gradually extended its range of applicability, becoming finally a mathematical theory of great practical and theoretical importance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Waugh, W.

He showed that amount of exploration decreases over successive trials (Montgomery, 1951). A review of more recent work by Berlyne and Slater (1957) indicates that there have been few advances in the understanding of the determinants of exploration since then. It is likely that this slow rate of progress is related to a common limitation in the treatment of data obtained with exploratory tests.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bryden, M.
