This thesis, focusing on the comedies of Plautus, investigates the question of why the playwrights made specific linguistic choices for female personae. Greek and Roman literary theory stipulated that the speech of women in drama had to be constructed so as to reveal the speakers' feminine nature. Philosophical doctrines that construed gender as a polar opposition evince a fundamental distinction, defining male as 'bond' and female as 'boundless'. The association of female with boundlessness, it is argued, also determines woman's position with respect to speech. A study of Greek New Comedy reveals that the reflections on female nature and expression found there depict woman as adverse to limits, a concept which Plautus seems to have subsequently adapted from his sources. Donatus's scholia to Terence characterize female speech as disorderly and disrespectful of the norms of verbal interaction. Concrete linguistic patterns are rationalized as symptoms of 'softness' and querulousness, both representing the female propensity to violate interpersonal limits. The text of Plautus, examined for meta-textual asides on female speech, confirms the scholiast's observations. An inquiry into the Plautine perception of blanditia reveals that female mannerisms are interpreted as tokens of a contagious moral disorder, and that they earmark the feebleness of female (and effeminate) personae. The otherness of female complaints, emphasized during the performance of palliata by both verbal and para-verbal means, is intimately associated in the text of the comedies with the chaos within women's minds. Female speech patterns in Plautus thus illustrate the concept of infirmitas sexus.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Richardson, Wade (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jg58q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000182p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plautus, Titus Maccius -- Literary style.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3j333401j"><dcterms:title>The French Fifth Republic and populism : a neo-institutional analysis of the Front national</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fieschi, Catherine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of the thesis is to offer an explanation for the emergence and success of the French political party the Front national. The project uses theories of political opportunity structures, neo-institutionalist approaches and a theory of ideological morphology to argue that institutions and ideologies have particular links to one another. This, in turn, leads to the argument that the FN's success can be attributed to the relationships between the institutions of the Fifth Republic on the one hand and fascist ideology in France on the other. It is argued that the gradual presidentialisation of French politics from 1958 onward reconciles two contradictory drives in French politics (the party drive and the rally drive), this reconciliation of the two drives and the institutionalisation of the rally drive grants renewed legitimacy to populist ideas in France. It is also argued that, given the component concepts of fascism as an ideology (its ideological morphology) and the links between ideologies and the contexts (institutional, social, political) in which they emerge, institutional pressures such as those generated by the Fifth Republic and its subsequent presidentialisation accounts for a mutation of French proto-fascism into a type of populist ideology. The FN's modification of its fascist ideology and conversion to an overt form of populism is depicted and analysed as a case study of a party's adaptation to, and exploitation of, the new structures of political opportunity created by the Fifth Republic; one in which populist ideas were more likely than fascist ones to lead to a measure of political success given the institutionalisation of a form of hitherto marginalised rally politics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Meadwell, H.

While it was never the conscious or primary motivation of those Soviet citizens working as shabashniks to challenge the political primacy of the CPSU in their self proclaimed position as the vanguard of the development of communism in the Soviet Union, the scope and the scale of the private economic activities engaged in by shabashniks represented a significant source of the impetus for the eventual decline in the Party's monopoly on political and economic power. This study investigates the place of shabashniks within the Soviet system, their contributions to that system and their part in its eventual decline. The narrative created as a result of this study relied primarily on Soviet newspaper, journal and magazine articles to describe the lifestyles of shabashniks. There were no Russian language monographs available on the subject at the time of this study. This study then combined the existing Soviet discussions concerning the private economic activities of shabashniks and the effects of those activities on the Soviet system, as reflected in the Soviet press, with the information gleaned from conversations the author had while working with and interviewing former shabashniks and Soviet citizens in Russia during the fall of 1994 and the winter 1997.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boss, Valentin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393687.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j282n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Free enterprise -- Russia -- History -- 20th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dissenters -- Russia -- History -- 20th century.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074w93n"><dcterms:title>Development of a weed management system for precision farming</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yang, Chun-Chieh, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The primary objective of this research project is to develop a system for precision spraying of herbicides in a corn field. Ultimately, such a system would permit real-time image collection, processing, weed identification, mapping of weed density and sprayer control using a tractor-mounted digital camera and on-board computer. The initial hypotheses underlying this project were (1) that it is possible to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to distinguish weeds from a crop species (corn in this study); (2) that it is possible to differentiate between weed species; and (3) that precision spraying can significantly reduce the quantity of herbicide needed to protect crop yields, thus reducing both the costs and environmental impacts of such applications. Thus, development of an ANN for this purpose was the main focus of the research project. Since the success of ANN development is primarily dependent on the type of information that it is provided, much of the work involved investigation of different approaches to extracting information from the digital images of field sections and individual objects (weeds or corn plants), as well as analysis of the type of information extracted. The applicability of a given image processing method was evaluated in terms of the image recognition accuracy, as well as the computer time and memory requirements for processing and obtaining ANN output, since speed is of the essence in real-time applications. The greenness method based on a pixel-by-pixel analysis of red-green-blue intensity value of the original images was the most successful and was used in further work. As it turned out, ANN development for this purpose was difficult. While the success rate for recognition of corn plants was high (80% or greater), the success rate for recognition of weeds tended to be low. Improvements in weed recognition were met with decreases in the success rate of corn recognition. Differentiation between weed species was less than desirable. Differentiation between corn and a given weed species was also not as good, particularly when the weed species was similar in appearance to the young corn plant. Therefore, another strategy was developed to recognize weeds in the field by taking images between the corn rows. Previously, the images were taken randomly in the field. The images were processed to obtain percent greenness in each image and this information was used to create weed coverage and weed patchiness maps. Based on these maps, herbicide spraying was decided and spraying amounts were determined. In terms of real-time, it was possible to process the equivalent of one metre of row per second. Although this is slow compared to tractor speed in the field, the computer was not operating under dedicated conditions as one would require for the real-time application. Thus, the results were considered encouraging. The final stage of the work involved an evaluation of the potential herbicide savings from a precision spraying system. This was done by using the weed coverage and weed patchiness maps as inputs to a simulated fuzzy logic controller, and integrating the output of the controller over the field area corresponding to the input images. The simulations with different fuzzy rules and membership functions indicated that the precision spraying approach could reduce the amount of herbicide needed for weed control in a corn field by up to 15%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Prasher, Shiv O.

It may be used for purification of metal containing industrial waste effluents. The issues related to the biosorption process design and optimization were addressed by (1) equilibrium isotherm relationships, (2) biosorption process rate and (3) breakthrough time in a continuous-flow biosorption column. This work investigates these three aspects for the biosorption of the heavy metals uranium and cadmium on protonated Sargassum fluitans seaweed biomass. Biosorption uptakes of uranium and cadmium were evaluated by determining their isotherms at different solution pH values. It was established that the state of uranium in aqueous solution and ion exchange play an important role in the biosorption of uranium. A new equilibrium biosorption isotherm model based on ion exchange of uranium complex ion species was developed. The new model is capable of predicting the effect of proton as an exchanged species and of the metal speciation on the biosorption uptake for a equilibrium batch biosorption system. The end-point titration method was applied in the experimental determination of the biosorption uptake rates of uranium and cadmium at different pH levels. A one-dimensional intraparticle diffusion rate model reflected well the controlling step in the uranium and cadmium ion transport inside the biosorbent. The PDEs of this new model were solved numerically by the Galerkin Finite Element Method (GFEM). Biosorption of uranium was examined in a continuous-flow fixed-bed column at the feed pH 2.5. The biomass binding capacity for the uranium before the breakthrough was as high as 105 mg/g biomass. The elution with diluted hydrochloric acid produced an overall uranium concentration factor of about 25--30. A mass transfer model based on the external and intraparticle diffusion was developed to describe the column sorption performance. The model equations were solved by the Orthogonal Collocation (OC) numerical method. The model-calculated breakthrough curves agreed well with the experimental ones, indicating the potential of the model for process design and optimization.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Volesby, B.

The reactions were studied under low moisture and limiting sugar conditions in the presence and absence of oxygen in a closed system. Several analytical methods, including the fluorescamine assay, total Maillard fluorescence and solubility measurement, size exclusion chromatography, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry were used to follow the glycation reaction. The effect of glycation on the structure of proteins was also studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometric peptide mapping. The results showed that under low moisture conditions, the initial rate of glucation was 5 to 6 times higher than the initial rate of fructation, both in the presence and in the absence of oxygen. The presence of oxygen in the reaction system induced selectivity of the glycation of the protein amino groups during the initial stages of the reaction, due to competition between glycation and glycoxidation. The reaction, however, occurred at a higher rate in the presence of oxygen than in its absence, especially during the latter stages of the reaction. The more reactive glycoxidation products, formed during the initial stages of the reaction also participated in the glycation reaction and increased the involvement of arginine residues in the glycation reaction. The glycation reaction also resulted in a heterogeneous mixture of protein glycoforms with varying degrees and extent of glycation. The heterogeneity of the glycated species was further complicated by the involvement of glycoxidation products in the glycation reaction, resulting in a distribution of different classes of glycoconjugates. Limited glycation improved protein solubility and increased solvent accessibility into the interior of the protein, thereby, increasing protein digestibility.

For the first study, genetic simulation experiments were conducted to address the effects of marker density, method of mapping analysis, and gaps in a marker map on the efficiency of QTL detection and the accuracy of QTL parameter estimation. The simulated genome consisted of seven chromosomes with seven or eight segregating QTL affecting the simulated quantitative trait. A set of six randomly segregating QTL outside the test region was consistently used to represent 40% of phenotypic variation. An individual QTL or a linkage block of two QTL on a target chromosome contributed 10% of phenotypic variation. The marker map was either dense (with markers every 4 cM) or sparse (with markers every 20 cM). The gap in the marker map was either 32 cM or 56 cM. Interval mapping and composite interval mapping were used to map QTL on the target chromosome. A dense map provided more power of QTL detection, better accuracy of QTL parameter estimation, and higher false-positive error rates for the target chromosome than a sparse map. Composite interval mapping provided more power of QTL detection, better accuracy of QTL parameter estimation, and lower false-positive error rates than interval mapping. Presence of a large gap in a marker map affected QTL detection and QTL parameter estimation for a QTL inside or near the gap. The use of a dense map with composite interval mapping was the most efficient combination tested in this study. For the second study, a mixed factorial regression model for interval mapping was developed for conducting QTL-by-environment interaction analysis and for providing inferences about QTL that are applicable beyond the environments used in the experiments. Genetic simulation was used to test the model for the power of detecting QTL-by-environment interaction and identifying the types of such interaction as crossover or non-crossover, and for the accuracy of estimating QTL parameters.

It presents well-known authors but also lesser-known writers who have made an important contribution to the literature of the Ticino and Grigioni cantons. Dating from the 1960s to the present, the corpus bears witness to a remarkable vitality and innovative spirit, which on occasion overflow political borders and find their way into the much larger Italian market. The dynamism of local publishers has contributed to focusing attention on the high quality and importance of the literature produced by Swiss authors writing in Italian. The distinctive character of this literature lies in the unique combination of disparate factors. Italian language, Swiss culture, and European concerns interact with emotional ties to the local communities in a rich social context marked by past misery and a present characterized by advanced capitalism. The choice of authors is based on the desire to trace the evolution of narrative literature during the last four decades and present a wide range of themes and styles. In addition to the renowned Giovanni Orelli, this study considers the equally important works of writers such as Alberto Nessi, Claudio Nembrini, Anna Felder, Elda Guidinetti, Silvana Lattmann, Ennio Maccagno, among others. Very young writers whose first efforts are shaping the future of Swiss literature in Italian are also examined. A special chapter is devoted to women writers. The goal is to identify the style and set of themes which distinguish their contribution from that of their colleagues. The study also discusses the importance of their presence on the literary scene after a time, not so far in the past, when women were confined to writing, in dialect, diaries and letters to relatives who had emigrated. The discussion of the corpus is prefaced by a detailed presentation of the geographical, social and political context which often determines the literary outcome. The importance of this context has also influenced the way in which the texts are approached. The narratives studied reflect and interpret the problems society was facing at a particular time, as well as the intellectual movements that characterize each period. A chronological presentation of each individual author would have fragmented the dynamic background from which his or her works emerge and within which such works must be located. The name of an author will therefore resurface in different contexts when one of his or her works is discussed in connection with the given period or intellectual movement under examination. The literary history of each author, however, can be easily reconstructed through an attentive reading. What emerges at the end of the study is a widened field of knowledge for Italian studies, whose object can no longer be seen to coincide with the literary production within the borders of the Italian state.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bendinelli, Maria Predelli (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Marchand, Jean-Jacques (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128c597.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2958</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Italian fiction -- Switzerland -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adf65v959g"><dcterms:title>Main-chain chirality and crystalline morphology in optically active polyethers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saracovan, Ilie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies reported a unique direction of lamellar twist in banded spherulites of polymers with main-chain chirality, which lead to the suggestion that a correlation exists between the handedness of the helical chain and the twist direction. However, these proposals were presented without identifying underlying reasons for such a correlation. Hence, the goal of this thesis was to identify morphological features that could be ascribed to main-chain chirality, which, in turn, would provide insight concerning the transmission of chirality to asymmetries in various levels of crystalline morphology. Studies at the molecular level, based on chain-packing simulations showed that main-chain chirality leads to the formation of helices of a given handedness but indicated that the helix handedness does not have the ability to generate asymmetric habits at the next higher dimensional level, which is the chain-folded lamella. This was confirmed by the TEM studies of solution-grown single crystals of the R and S polyenantiomers of poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH), poly(propylene oxide) (PPrO) and poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHV). Electron diffraction studies established that chain tilting (considered a root cause of lamellar twisting) is absent in these single crystals. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of an induced chain tilting in stems at growth fronts during fast crystallization from the melt. Indeed, optical microscopy studies of the behavior of spherulites grown from the melt established that the lamellae (fibrils) twist, uniquely in either a right- or left-handed fashion, depending on the chiral identity (R or S) of the polyenantiomer. Although the handedness of the lamellar twist of the R and S polyenantiomers of PECH and PPrO both showed a direct correlation with the handedness of the helical chain, this correlation is not universal. While poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and PHV both form left-handed helices, the directions of lamellar twist are left- and right-handed, respectively. It was also demonstrated that the handedness of spiral patterns developed in banded spherulites of chiral polymers is not rigorously related to the molecular chirality. The overall conclusion is that determination of the ultimate origin(s) of lamellar twisting in banding of polyenantiomers requires further investigations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brown, G.

Buoyancy has, therefore, been proposed as an indicator by which to assess the nutritional condition of marine fish larvae in experiments and in situ. It has also been hypothesized that larval fish experiencing advanced starvation will exhibit increased density due to water loss resulting from osmoregulatory breach and failure. The magnitude of osmoregulation-related changes in density has not been examined and its influence on interpretations of nutritional condition and vertical distributions are unknown. Through a series of controlled laboratory experiments performed on larvae of cod (Gadus morhua L.), I developed evidence that osmoregulatory breach and failure has a strong positive effect on the density of larval fish, and that this effect on density is not limited to larvae experiencing advanced stages of starvation. These effects of osmotic breach and failure are sufficient to obscure effects resulting exclusively from nutritionally caused changes in density. Hence, if not identified and controlled these osmotically driven density changes can bias parameterization of buoyancy-related condition indices. I developed methods for isolating nutritional and osmotic effects. This facilitated the calibration of a nutritionally based density index with which to evaluate the nutritional state of cod larvae. Comparison of the calibrated density assay with a suite of widely used indices of condition (morphometric, behavioural and biochemical) showed density to be superior in its capacity to correctly classify larvae with respect to their nutritional state. The density index was also less subject to bias resulting from uncontrolled changes in larval size.

The mechanism of the dehalogenation process was also examined. The intermediacy of a transitional enolate species was established by the successful isolation of the chalcone condensation product, resulting from reaction with benzaldehyde. A difference in the reactivity of bis(triphenylstannyl) selenide (105) and bis(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) telluride (95) in the dehalogenation process was discerned. An investigation directed at the elaboration of a system capable of generating a diatomic selenium unit was carried out. The thermal decomposition of titanocene pentaselenide (177), in the presence of diene trap 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene (153), was demonstrated to generate the monoselenide adduct 2,5-dihydro-2,3-diphenylselenophene (207). In the process, 1H NMR evidence was obtained for the formation of diselenide 180, indicative of the generation of a diatomic selenium species.

The crude enzymatic extracts were recovered from the homogenized mycelium cells and the partially purified LOX extracts were obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Using linoleic acid as substrate, the partially purified LOX extracts from P. camemberti, P. roqueforti and G. candidum exhibited a major activity, at pH 6.50, 5.50 and 3.75, respectively, and a minor one at pH 8.00. The partially purified LOX extracts exhibited an overall preferential specificity towards free fatty acids, including linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic acids, than that for fatty acid acylglycerols, including mono-, di- and tri-linolein. The Km and Vmax values for partially purified LOXs were investigated. Normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses showed that the LOX activity of the partially purified LOX extracts converted mainly linoleic acid into the corresponding 9- and 13-hydroperoxides (HPODs); however, the production of a relatively important proportion of 10-HPOD, ranging from 4 to 9% of the total HPODs, was also demonstrated with the partially purified LOX extracts from Penicillium sp. The chiral phase HPLC analysis demonstrated the production, by the partially purified LOX extracts from Penicillium sp., of both (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of HPODs, with a slightly higher proportion of the (S)-enantiomers.

This doctoral project had two main objectives. One was to characterize the gait pattern of SCI subjects and compare it to that of normal subjects walking at the same speed. The other objective was to measure the adaptability of their walking pattern to changes in speed, and to find the factors that are limiting their maximal walking speed. The main gait characteristics in SCI subjects found in the first study were: a longer cycle duration, a greater hip excursion, a flexed knee at foot contact and during stance, and changes in the timing and the amplitude of muscle activity. It was showed that SCI subjects could adapt to different speeds, but that their range of speeds is limited. The hip-knee angle cyclographs showed that SCI subjects' intralimb coordination patterns were altered. In normal subjects, even at low speed, the soleus muscle showed a peak of electromyographic (EMG) activity synchronized with push-off, and this peak of activity increased with speed. SCI subjects showed a lower and a flatter profile than that of normal subjects and a diminution of a peak of activity in the soleus muscles at push-off. Increases in treadmill speed in SCI subjects resulted only in a small increase in the amplitude of soleus EMG activity. This increase was not specific to push-off, but rather spread over most of stance duration. The second article showed that maximal stride frequency was the predominant limiting factor of the maximal treadmill-walking speed in SCI subjects. At all speeds, SCI subjects spent longer time in stance, swing and double support phases. The relative time spent in single support is greater at higher walking speed and the difficulty to reduce double support time is a limiting factor.

In order for ion channels to fulfill these roles a number of coordinated events must ensue at the protein level. Newly translated polypeptides entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) must be correctly processed and folded in order to exit. In the case of voltage-dependent ion channels, the channel alpha subunits, which form the channel pore, oligomerize with like (or unlike) alpha subunits and/or auxiliary (beta) subunits, depending on the channel type. Further posttranslational modifications take place within the Golgi apparatus before the channels embark for their final destination. Once there, or prior to their arrival, they interact with cytoskeletal elements that serve to anchor the channel in place and tether accessory elements involved in ion channel modulation and signaling. Here, I have investigated the role of N-linked glycosylation in the surface membrane expression of a K+ channel, human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG), mutation of which can give rise to the cardiac disease long QT. Pharmacological and site-directed mutagenesis reveal that N-linked glycosylation is required for proper channel processing and cell surface expression of HERG as determined through immunoblot, immunocytochemical and electrophysiological analysis. Removal of glycosylation leads to an intracellular retention of HERG. Furthermore, I have examined the subcellular localization of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) in cardiomyocytes using immunocytochemical techniques and found that it exhibits a restricted subcellular localization at the intercalated disc. Along the same line, using the yeast two-hybrid screening technique, I have identified an actin-binding protein, filamin, that directly interacts with and plays a role in the subcellular localization of a prominent heart and brain K + channel, Kv4.2.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shrier, Alvin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr33b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bz96v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak643b2769"><dcterms:title>Male elementary teachers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Penny, William, 1947-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines questions of gender, masculinity, and teaching through an autobiographical exploration of my experiences as a male elementary teacher. Its twofold purpose as a self-study was to inform my own teaching through a perspective look at the entirety of my career to this point and to give my teaching a direction for its final years. In order to provide a context within which to locate this autobiography, biographical narratives of four other experienced male elementary teachers were constructed. The participants were asked, in a series of taped and transcribed interviews/conversations, to relate their experiences as male elementary teachers. The orientation of these biographical constructions followed a life history methodological approach. The participants were asked to trace their careers as elementary teachers and touch on such broad topic areas as: How they became elementary teachers? What has kept them in the classroom? How they see their roles in the context of their female colleagues? What is the future direction of their careers? What are some of the particular issues of teaching that concern them? It was through my own participation in these conversations, and through the subsequent analysis and construction of their biographies that I was able to address these questions as they related to my own teaching. Their narratives provided a contextual backdrop for our shared experiences and a counterpoint to those experiences that are unique to each of us. I call the emergent methodology "contextualized autobiography." It was, in fact, through their narratives that my own story emerged and granted insight into issues of teaching, gender and masculinity as they exist for the male elementary teacher. The study's significance beyond the exploration of self is addressed to the political issue of the calls for more male teachers in elementary education and the assumptions on which those calls are based.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Claudia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k27t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b2769</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Masculinity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Elementary school teachers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w9193"><dcterms:title>Receptor transmodulation in the p75 neurotrophin receptor trkA receptor system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacPhee, Ian J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neurotrophins are a group of molecules involved in the development, maintenance, and death of cells comprising the nervous system. There are two classes of receptors for the family of neurotrophins, the trk (tropomyosin-receptor kinase) family of tyrosine kinases and the p75 NTR receptor. It is the role of p75NTR in regulating trk activation, a process termed receptor transmodulation, that is the subject of this thesis. We discovered that p75NTR activation can inhibit trkA signaling. Following published work that p75NTR activation can lead to the production of intracellular ceramide (Dobrowsky et al., 1994; Dobrowsky et al., 1995), an intracellular signaling molecule, we determined that exogenous ceramide mimicked these effects of BDNF. The data suggest that BDNF may use the ceramide signaling cascade to inhibit trkA activation. To help elucidate the nature by which these results may occur, we examined the phosphoamino acid content of trkA. This analysis revealed that BDNF and C2 ceramide both induce an increase in the serine phosphorylation of the trkA intracellular domain when compared to a lack of either agent. Based on our findings, the presence of a signaling mechanism where trkA activity can be modulated by p75NTR has been postulated. After completing dose-response experiments with C2-ceramide, a time-course experiment was proposed. It was discovered that incubation of PC12 cells with greater than 20 muM C2-ceramide caused an increase in trkA receptor activation. Furthermore, this effect was observed in the absence of ligand, and found to be the result of an increase in trkA dimerization. These data suggest that chronic exposure to exogenous ceramide causes an increase in trkA dimerization, and leads to the activation of downstream targets. The revelation that GM1-ganglioside, a sialic acid containing glycosphingolipid and product of the sphingomyelin cycle, increases trkA dimerization correlates with the temporal nature of our observed changes in trkA activation. It is possible that either ceramide becomes metabolized into gangliosides or that gangliosides and ceramide share some intermediate molecule that mediates the effect.

The biocatalysis of the PPE with a wide range of mono- and diphenols, as substrates, was shown to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase (PPO) activity.

In particular, the psychological experience of orgasm is in need of research attention. The first chapter of this thesis, a critical review of the literature on human orgasm, highlights the dichotomization of the biological and psychological perspectives and the assumption of sex differences in the orgasm response within the literature. A multidimensional approach to describing the orgasm experience in both sexes is advocated, and a three-dimensional model involving sensory, evaluative, and affective dimensions and their respective components is outlined. The second chapter of this thesis summarizes an evaluation of the three-dimensional model using an adjective-rating questionnaire. A sample of 523 female and 365 male university students completed the questionnaire to convey orgasm experiences attained under solitary masturbation and sex with a partner. Results supported the applicability of the model in describing both male and female orgasm, suggesting they involve similar experiences, and revealed the evaluative and affective differences in the orgasm experience as a function of sexual context. Further inquiry into the questionnaire's psychometric properties as a measure of the subjective orgasm experience and the three-dimensional model was conducted and is covered in the third chapter of the thesis. Validity tests entailed investigating the relationships between model components and orgasm intensity, perceived location of orgasm sensation, and relationship happiness and satisfaction. A sample of 503 female and 295 male university students completed the questionnaire to describe orgasm attained through either solitary masturbation or sex with a partner. Good internal consistency of the adjective set was observed. The model again adequately described both male and female orgasm experiences as well, arguing against the reductionist perspective of male orgasm in the literature.

The division was a product of the women's wing of the social reform movement and prevailing theories of gender difference and anglo-superiority. Tracing its nearly twenty years of operations shows how the division, initially regarded as a source of imperial strength and a means of English Canada's cultural survival, came to symbolize the disadvantages of Canada's connection to Great Britain and supposed weaknesses inherent in the female character.

The children in this study represent a cultural and linguistic mosaic of new arrivals, second-generation immigrant and native Montreal families that include Cambodian, East Indian, French, Italian, Lebanese and Portuguese families. Similarly, the three teachers come from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds that include a native Montreal anglophone, an immigrant from Egypt who is fluent in Arabic, English and French, and a second-generation Italian Quebecer who is fluent in Italian, English and French. The diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds of the participants add a further dimension to the research project, that is, an understanding of the dialogic encounters between multilingual children and teachers during literacy events in two languages and two classroom contexts. I draw from Halliday's (1978, 1985) social theory of language use, Bakhtin's (1981, 1984) dialogical theory of discourse and Vygotsky's (1978, 1981, 1986) socio-cultural theory of language and learning to provide a theoretical lens for viewing the childrens' appropriation of literacy meaning making practices. I audiotaped, transcribed and interpreted the literacy events, teachers' discourse and discursive practices and the childrens' literate actions and artifacts for emerging patterns. In addition, interviews were transcribed, coded for emerging patterns and interpreted as socially negotiated texts. The findings led me to four major conclusions. First, while institutional controls such as textbooks, programs, evaluation, and teacher beliefs about literacy continue to maintain power of literacy meaning making practices in these four classroom contexts, the reconstruction and negotiation of this power varies across the classroom contexts and amongst the teachers and children. Second, the teachers' discourse and discursive practices, as well as, situational complexities such as the intersections of cultures, communities, classrooms and languages shape the childrens' literacy perceptions, interpretations and constructions in English and French within and across the classroom contexts. Third, teaching practices for literacy meaning making are neither solely analytical or experiential nor are they solely explicit or implicit. The three teachers' literacy practices appear to be more along a continuum than a dichotomy, that is, they appear to be local, strategic and contexts-related. Fourth, the recognition of a plurality of literacies suggest that childrens' cultural stances and viewpoints need to be considered, as well as, the kinds of literacy experiences they are and are not being asked to engage in their English and French classrooms.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary H.

This study investigates whether the HPA axis contributes to the development of chronic pain in an animal model via direct effects on central pain mechanisms. First, correlations between pain processes and the susceptibility to chronic pain in an animal model that is correlated with HPA-axis function were examined. The results show that, in the Fischer rat, the amount of pain suppression observed during the formalin interphase depression is negatively correlated with susceptibility to polyarthritis. Since the formalin interphase depression mechanisms are within the central nervous system, the results suggest a role for central pain mechanisms in the development of polyarthritis. Hypophysectomy inhibits the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis. To test whether hypophysectomy inhibits adjuvant-induced polyarthritis via central pain mechanisms, the analgesic effect of hypophysectomy was examined in the formalin test. The results show that hypophysectomy specifically prolongs the formalin interphase depression, further supporting that the underlying central pain suppression mechanisms are associated with resistance to adjuvant-induced polyarthritis. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was then investigated as a possible underlying mechanism of the effects of hypophysectomy. Peripheral injection of CRF into inflamed tissue affects pain mechanisms unrelated to the susceptibility to adjuvant-induced polyarthritis. However, central and intravenous administration of CRF preferentially affect the formalin interphase depression mechanisms. The observed dose-response relationships indicate that these effects are due to direct actions of CRF within the central nervous system. In conclusion, the results strongly suggest that the HPA axis modulates the susceptibility to adjuvant-induced polyarthritis via direct effects on supraspinal pain suppression mechanisms. Thus, the HPA axis may contribute to the development of chronic pain syndromes associated with HPA-axis abnormalities, such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, via effects on pain mechanisms within the central nervous system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Melzack, Ronald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j058g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qt71k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arthritis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pain -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hypothalamo-hypophyseal system.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arv042v600"><dcterms:title>Varicose veins : epidemiology and outcomes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kurz, Xavier.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Varicose veins are among the most prevalent medical conditions in western populations, with a prevalence estimated at 25--35% in women and 10--20% in men. Until now, few studies have regarded varicose veins as a distinct clinical entity and have investigated specific risk factors. Their consequences for the patients have not been adequately investigated. The main objective of this thesis was to examine the association between varicose veins and specific risk indicators and outcomes, taking into account the effects of more severe venous disorders often found in combination with varicose veins. This work is based on the VEnous INsufficiency Epidemiological and economical Study (VEINES), a one-year cohort study on venous disorders carried out in Belgium, France, Italy and Quebec. It included 1531 patients sampled among 5688 consecutive patients consulting a physician for a venous disorder. A sub-sample of 150 patients were referred to specialists for clinical examination and duplex investigation of venous incompetence. This study illustrated the problems of the diagnosis and classification of varicose veins, with a specificity of 45% for the diagnosis made by general practitioners. In a case-control analysis, the strongest risk indicators of varicose veins were pregnancy, age and family history. No association was found with other hypothesised determinants (obesity, smoking, history of thrombophlebitis, blood group A). Results of duplex studies support the hypothesis of a distal onset of venous reflux and varicose veins. Using a classification of varicose veins proposed to take account the concomitant presence of other signs of venous disease, varicose veins alone had no impact on a symptom score and on generic (SF-36) and disease-specific quality of life scores. The results suggest that symptoms and presence of varicose veins are independent outcomes, which has implications for clinical practice. A detailed analysis of health service utilisation performed in Belgium also showed that both are independent predictors of resource use.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Abenhaim, L.

Departing from the functionalist approach characterizing previous work on migrants, refugees in this study are defined as developing a particular migrant subjectivity, characterized by uprootedness and the crossing of borders. As well, this study argues that refugeeness is an addition to the general refugee experience. Immigration and refugee policy at the international and Canadian levels is defined as the main discourse in the production of refugeeness . How this state intersects with individual refugees' lives is the focus of this study which seeks to analyze the impact of immigration and refugee policy on refugee claimants in Canada. Deconstruction of immigration and refugee policy discourse provides core elements in understanding the construction of the refugee as an object defined by international law. Further, it is shown that increasingly restrictive policies, arising out of western nations' concerns over sovereignty of their borders have had an impact on the migratory trajectory of refugee claimants and on their pre-refugee subjectivities. It is argued that the process constituting the refugee claimant subjectivity is one of otherization where refugees are dispossessed of their pre-migratory subjectivity, creating a profound rupture with their past and present subjectivities. A qualitative approach is used to determine the subjective experience of claimants in Canada as it relates to three major areas of their lives: work, family and state which constitute the core areas of study in the construction of the refugee claimant subjectivity, as conceptualized by a materialist theoretical model. Conclusions raise issues for policy practices and social work practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Firbank, Oscar (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Nichols, Barbara (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n0323.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vs649</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Refugees -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Emigration and immigration.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m105s"><dcterms:title>Nramp genes : roles in resistance to infection and in iron metabolism</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gruenheid, Samantha.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Nramp1 locus controls the innate resistance or susceptibility of mice to infection with a group of unrelated intracellular parasites which includes Salmonella, Leishmania, and Mycobacterium. Nramp1 is expressed exclusively in professional phagocytes and encodes an integral membrane protein that shares structural characteristics with ion channels and transporters. Its mechanism of action is not known. The intracellular localization of the Nramp1 protein was analyzed in control 129/sv and mutant Nramp1-/- macrophages. Nramp1 was localized to the late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Immunofluorescence studies and direct purification of latex bead-containing phagosomes demonstrated that upon phagocytosis, Nramp1 is recruited to the membrane of the phagosome. cDNA clones corresponding to a second mouse Nramp gene, Nramp2, were isolated. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analyses of full length cDNA clones for Nramp2 indicate that this novel protein is closely related to Nramp1, and that the two genes form part of a small family. The two Nramp proteins share 63% identical residues and are predicted to have very similar secondary structures, including identical hydropathy profiles and predicted membrane organization. Analysis of the distribution of Nramp2 mRNA transcripts in normal mouse tissues by Northern blotting revealed that in contrast to the previously described macrophage-specific Nramp1 gene, Nramp2 mRNAs are expressed ubiquitously. Specific antiserum was generated and used to detect Nramp2 in a number of cell types. Nramp2 is expressed as a 90--100 kDa integral membrane protein that is extensively modified by glycosylation. Subcellular localization studies indicate distinct and non-overlapping localizations for Nramp1 and Nramp2. Nramp2 is expressed primarily in recycling endosomes and also to a lower extent at the plasma membrane, colocalizing with transferrin. Together with the concurrent reports that mutations in Nramp2 result in iron defic</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gros, Philippe (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj84x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m105s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qn71c"><dcterms:title>Mechanism of inward rectification of neuronal nicotininc acetycholine receptors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haghighi, Ali Pejmun.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are wide spread in the nervous system. Ample evidence indicates that many central nAChRs are located at the nerve terminals, where they act to facilitate neurotransmitter release; however, little is known about how these receptors carry out their function. The focus of my study is to understand the mechanism(s) that underlie the function of neuronal nAChRs. Neuronal nAChRs conduct inward current at negative membrane potentials, but conduct little or no outward current at positive membrane potentials, a process known as inward rectification. Inward rectification prevents the ACh-evoked conductance increase from short-circuiting the action potential at the nerve terminal, thereby ensuring optimal depolarization of the terminal and effective neurotransmitter release. Using the outside-out single channel patch-clamp technique, I demonstrate that intracellular polyamines block neuronal nAChRs with high affinity and in a voltage dependent manner; this is true for native nAChRs expressed by sympathetic neurons as well as recombinant alpha3beta4, alpha4beta2 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Given the physiological concentrations of polyamines inside cells, this block can fully account for the strong macroscopic inward rectification. Furthermore, using a combined approach of site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology, I show that the negatively charged residues at the cytoplasmic mouth of the pore (known as the intermediate ring) mediate the interaction of intracellular polyamines with the receptor; partial removal of these residues abolishes the strong inward rectification. Interestingly, I show that the intermediate ring influences the permeation of calcium through the receptor, indicating that a molecular link exists between calcium permeability and inward rectification of neuronal nAChRs. My experiments also show that extracellular polyamines and a polyamine-related toxin, Joro spider toxin, block neuronal n</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, Ellis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs439.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn71c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
