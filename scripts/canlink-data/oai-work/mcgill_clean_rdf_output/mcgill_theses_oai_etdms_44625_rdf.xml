One such target, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  that is overexpressed in a large number of carcinomas including breast, ovarian, and  prostate, is a marker for tumour invasiveness and poor prognosis. Agents of the  quinazoline class have been developed that block EGFR-mediated signaling and induce  antitumour activity in the clinic. However, the major deficiency of these compounds  is that they are cytostatic agents that induce reversible antiproliferative  activities. To circumvent these problems, we designed a novel tumour targeting  approach termed "the combi-targeting" concept. This theory is based on the  fundamental premise that compounds capable of interfering with multiple targets in  the cancer cells are more efficient antitumour agents than the single-targeted ones.  Thus, the "combi-targeting" concept proposes the design of molecules  termed "combi-molecules" or TZ-I to not only bind to the tumour target but  also to be allowed to degrade to another inhibitor I of the same target + a DNA  damaging species TZ, leading to small molecules capable of repetitively blocking one  target while damaging another. Using EGFR as a tumour target, the first TZ-I  prototype SMA41, an anilinoquinazoline containing a triazene tail at the 6-position,  was synthesized. We demonstrate herein that the compound enters the cell by passive  diffusion, degrades under physiological conditions to yield an intact TK inhibitor  ("SMA52") (I) + a short-lived DNA-damaging methyldiazonium species (TZ).  In the EGFR-expressing human tumour cells, SMA41 (TZ-I) behaved as a binary targeted  drugs with ability to: (a) inhibit EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation, cell  cycle progression and growth, (b) induce dose-dependent DNA damage, and (c) inhibit  cell proliferation with greater potency than the released reversible inhibitor (I)  both in vitro and in vivo.

However, researchers sometimes need to modify the reaction system or the enzyme  itself to get reliable selectivity and activity when they deal with unnatural  substrates. To obtain researcher's need, one can change the solvent, modify the  substrates, or alter the enzyme itself. These processes are called medium,  substrate, and protein engineering, respectively. This thesis deals with hydrolases, which are classified by EC 3.  We applied the proper approach to improve their activity and selectivity depending  on the reactions. For the first approach, highly polar ionic liquids were applied to  lipase-catalyzed acylation. Ionic liquids worked reliably in enantio- and  regioselective lipase-catalyzed reactions. In particular, ionic liquids dissolved  polar substrates such as glucose and L-ascorbic acid, thereby facilitating their  acylations. In the second approach to improving enantioselectivity of CAL-B (Candida  antarctica lipase B) in beta-lactam ring opening reactions, we changed the  nucleophile from water to a range of alcohols. Longer, secondary alcohols increased  the reaction rate as well as the enantioselectivity. Molecular modeling revealed  that the high enantioselectivity of CAL-B and the critical role of alcohols. For the  last approach, structure-guided random mutagenesis was applied to increase the  enantioselectivity of PFE ( Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase) toward MBMP (methyl  3-bromo-2-methylpropionate). The homology model was used to select amino acid  residues for mutagenesis near the stereocenter of the docked tetrahedral  intermediate of the substrate. Randomization of these residues yielded a Val122Ser  mutant with E increased to 61 (from 12 of wild type enzyme), as well as a Val122Met  mutant to 36.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kazlauskas, Romas J.

This MA thesis questions the state's strategy in the case of the Monarch Butterfly  Biosphere Reserve, in Mexico, a strategy which is officially based on the  implementation of sustainable development through the participation of local  communities. Working with the assumption that sustainable development is a political  concept that implies a competition between different actors in order to define what  has to be sustained, for whom, by whom, why, and how, I first analyze the factors  that, until now, have impeded local inhabitants' participation. I argue that the  subordination of civil society by the state during the last century is a historical  burden that has debilitated civil society's capacity for effective participation.  Second, I discuss the state's vision of sustainable development and the weight given  to the two conflicting visions held, on the one hand, by local inhabitants and, on  the other, by the environmentalists and biologists. I conclude that the state's  appeal for the participation of local communities is not in recognition of the fact  that local inhabitants have the right to greater input in the definition of  sustainable development in the region, but needs to be understood as a strategy to  achieve rule compliance. Unfortunately, then, while the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere  Reserve may be managed according to a vision of sustainable development, this is not  a vision that has emerged from a dialogue between the state and civil society. Local  support is thus unlikely since transforming local communities into allies would  rather require achieving a compromise based upon genuine dialogue.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f70s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn64m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Natural areas -- Mexico</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monarch butterfly -- Mexico</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Mexico)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pq840"><dcterms:title>Dual-wavelength scanning near-field optical microscopy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>LeBlanc, Philip R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A dual-wavelength Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscope was  developed in order to investigate near-field contrast mechanisms as well as  biological samples in air. Using a helium-cadmium laser, light of wavelengths 442  and 325 nanometers is coupled into a single mode optical fiber. The end of the probe  is tapered to a sub-wavelength aperture, typically 50 nanometers, and positioned in  the near-field of the sample. Light from the aperture is transmitted through the  sample and detected in a confocal arrangement by two photomultiplier tubes. The  microscope has a lateral topographic resolution of 10 nanometers, a vertical  resolution of 0.1 nanometer and an optical resolution of 30 nanometers. Two  alternate methods of producing the fiber probes, heating and pulling, or acid  etching, are compared and the metal coating layer defining the aperture is  discussed. So-called "shear-force" interactions between the tip and sample  are used as the feedback mechanism during raster scanning of the sample. An optical  and topographic sample standard was developed to calibrate the microscope and  extract the ultimate resolution of the instrument. The novel use of two wavelengths  enables the authentication of true near-field images, as predicted by various  models, as well as the identification of scanning artifacts and the deconvolution of  often highly complicated relationships between the topographical and optical images.  Most importantly, the use of two wavelengths provides information on the chemical  composition of the sample. Areas of a polystyrene film are detected by a significant  change in the relative transmission of the two wavelengths with a resolution of 30  nanometers. As a biological application, a preliminary investigation of the  composition of Black Spruce wood cell fibers was performed. Comparisons of the two  optical channels reveal the expected lignin distributions in the cell  wall.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grutter, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t6901.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pq840</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Optics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs49v"><dcterms:title>La critique génétique du Horla de Maupassant /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nolin, Isabelle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The result of formal and thematic research undertaken by the  author in the1880s, Maupassant's Le Horla (1887), owing to its originality, became a  fantastic literature classic.

We aim to evaluate the validity of OCT for glaucoma screening in high risk populations. Methods: Three hundred thirty-three volunteer participants with risk factors for glaucoma underwent imaging of the optic nerve and peripapillary nerve fiber layer using the Stratus version of the OCT. Based on an ophthalmologic examination and frequency doubling perimetry, participants were classified into 4 categories: normal, possible glaucoma, probable glaucoma and definitive glaucoma. The sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios of the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic disc parameters were calculated.  Results: After excluding poor quality scans and missing data, the data of 210 right eyes were analyzed. Six right eyes had definitive glaucoma. Combining the best performing optic nerve head parameters (cup diameter or cup/disk vertical ratio or cup area) and nerve fiber layer parameters (superior average or inferior average or overall average) using AND-logic resulted in a sensitivity of 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24%-94%), specificity of 96% (95% CI, 92%-98%), positive likelihood ratio of 17.08 (95% CI, 7.06-41.4) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.11-1.08).

Network latency and jitter are concerns in this context, although the impact is reduced by the use of predictive techniques such as dead reckoning. These techniques, however, introduce consistency concerns for important and hard to predict behaviours, such as object collisions. In these cases a centralized authority or client/server architecture is typically used to ensure strong consistency, limiting game scalability. In this work we propose a motion-lock protocol for distributed game collision detection and resolution. The motion-lock protocol improves performance of motion prediction by giving stations time to communicate and agree on the detected collisions. This reduces the divergence of object states and post-collision trajectories. Offline and online simulation results show the motion-lock protocol is able to maintain strong consistency in collision count and reduces post-collision deviation with a small sacrifice of 3-4% in responsiveness of player controls. Qualitatively, the visual result of the collision response is greatly improved. With the motion-lock protocol, multiplayer online games can offload basic collision detection and resolution to game clients, increasing scalability without overly sacrificing consistency.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Multijoueurs, des jeux informatiques en ligne distribuent souvent tat du jeu-objet aux ordinateurs clients afin d'amliorer l'extensibilit de jeu et ractivit.

The SC contains a motor map which  encodes saccade vectors topographically. Small saccades are encoded rostrally,  larger ones caudally. More recently, it was shown that the rostral part of the SC  contains a specialized "fixation zone". A group of cells located in the  rostral SC have been called SC fixation neurons (SCFNs). SCFNs via projections to  "omni-pause" neurons (OPNs) seem to play an important role during fixation  behavior by holding gaze on target for a certain period of time through inhibition  of the gaze saccade generator. By comparison, the caudal SC generates saccadic  commands via its direct connections to the gaze saccade generator. When the head is  unrestrained, large gaze shifts are generally made with the contribution of eye and  head (gaze = eye-in-head + head-in-space). For a gaze shift executed in one step,  gaze, eye, and head trajectories are very stereotyped; each part of the trajectory  is correlated in time to another. Consequently, it is difficult to relate brainstem  cells activity to a specific trajectory. A differentiation between the trajectories  can be obtained by the use of multiple-step gaze-shifts that cats often use  naturally. Multiple-step gaze shifts are gaze displacements that are composed of a  variable number of gaze saccades separated by periods of steady fixation. The main  goal of this thesis was to relate cell activity of both SC cells and OPNs with  specific features of the multiple-step gaze shifts. The study of SC cells during  multiple-step gaze shifts revealed that neither SCFNs nor cells on the SC motor map  encode the complex motor sequence of steps and plateaus in multiple step gaze  shifts. They are concerned with keeping track of the difference between current gaze  position and the final intended gaze destination independently of how the gaze  displacement is achieved.

First,  the elements essential to environmental education field trips were identified from  the literature. Second, these elements were incorporated into a questionnaire that  was administered as a pre/post test to elementary school students visiting an  extensive indoor environmental education facility located in Montreal. Finally, 24  environmental education programs at eight institutions in Montreal were observed to  investigate the extent and methodology of implementation of the essential elements.  With regard to the chief institution, it was concluded that (1) the educational  programming appeared to significantly increase environmental knowledge, and (2) the  environmental attitudes were most strongly correlated with student background.  Program observation at the eight institutions demonstrated that a wide array of  environmental topics was presented, but there was insufficient instruction of  environmental issues and action strategies. The list of observed implementation  methodologies and the study conclusions could prove useful as a research-based  foundation for effective environmental education field trip program  development.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j617x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q201d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>School field trips</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental education</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53ww34h"><dcterms:title>Sylvain Rivière, écrivain régionaliste contemporain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Charpentier, Alain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Quebec knew a long tradition of regionalistic literature since  the novel of the soil, tradition with which the writers of Quebec broke for a long  time. However, certain writers still practice a regionalistic form of literature,  which does not have anything to see with the novel of the soil. Within the literary  institution, the regionalistic writers of today seem to belong to a sphere of  distinct production. In order to delimit the space occupied by the contemporary  regionalistic writers, we based ourselves on the theory of the literary field of  Pierre Bourdieu and the theory of the institution of the literature of Jacques  Dubois. So as to apply the model of Bourdieu and Dubois to a typical example of  contemporary regionalistic writer, we chose to concentrate us on the career of  Sylvain Riviere, Gaspesian writer born in 1955. Sylvain Riviere seems to be the  regionalistic writer par excellence, who devoted the most part of his work to his  region, Gaspesia and the Magdalen Islands. The example of Sylvain Riviere shows us  that in spite of his marginality, the regionalistic writer is able to find his place  inside the contemporary literary field.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg86d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww34h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rivière, Sylvain, 1955- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Regionalism in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian literature -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gaspé Peninsula (Québec) -- In literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jb96j"><dcterms:title>Autofictional practices : self-fashioning in Diana Thorneycroft's self-portraits</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chassin de Kergommeaux, C.

Chapter 1 discusses the history and key debates in  autobiography theory, the ways gender has been introduced into the analysis of  autobiography, and non-literary forms of autobiography. Chapter 1 also briefly  discusses the (Western) history of art by women. Chapter 2 examines Thorneycroft's  oeuvre and selected responses to it. Chapter 3 presents an analysis of autofictional  practices through an examination of Thorneycroft's photographic self-portraits,  thereby questioning the distinctions between autobiography and autofiction and  suggesting that there is considerable overlap in their definition.

It is known that RS codes can correct more erasures than errors, and, thus, Error-and-Erasure Decoding (EED) has a potential to outperform Error-Only Decoding (ED). In order to mark the low reliability symbols as erasures, an erasure marking technique should be established. Previous works show that a threshold can be employed to mark symbols as erasures, and the selection of the threshold is critical to the performance of RS codes with EED. However, methods to determine suitable and optimal thresholds have not been investigated in those works. In this thesis, the use of RS codes in quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and correlated fading channels and their performance are investigated. At first, the focus of the investigation is on the derivation of the optimal thresholds for the erasure-marking technique in AWGN and i.i.d. fading channels. By employing the obtained optimal erasure thresholds, the performance and capacity of the system using EED and ED are derived and compared. It is shown that EED outperforms ED over both AWGN and i.i.d. fading channels. Specifically, the performance and capacity improvement provided by EED is significant over i.i.d. fading channels, and increases when the fading in the channel is more severe. Hence, EED is preferable to ED over i.i.d. fading channels, especially when the fading is severe. The use of RS codes is further investigated over correlated fading channels through a RS coded QAM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over multipath fading channels. The investigation focuses on the effects of number of resolvable taps, which represents the multipath fading channel, on the fading correlation between sub-carriers, the choice of interleaving depth and the performance of the RS coded QAM OFDM system. The results indicate that, while the increase in number of resolvable taps introduces more frequency selectivity in fading, it reduces the fading correlation between sub-carriers. As a result, for the same RS coded QAM OFDM system, its performance is better with shorter interleaving (and hence shorter delay) in multipath fading channels with more resolvable taps.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Le code de Reed-Solomon (RS) fait parti d'une importante classe de codes à maximum distance séparable (MDS), et a été largement utilisé dans plusieurs systèmes de communications (avec ou sans fil) pour contrôler les erreurs de transmission. Il est bien connu que le code RS peut corriger plus d'effacements que d'erreurs et donc le Décodage d'Erreur-et-Effacement (EED) peut potentiellement surperformer le Décodage d'Erreur (ED). Pour marquer les symboles à basse fiabilité en tant qu'effacements, il faut établir une technique convenable pour marquer les effacements. Les études effectuées antérieurement ont montré qu'un seuil peut être utilisé pour marquer les symboles en tant qu'effacements, et que la sélection du seuil est un élément déterminant dans la performance du code RS avec EED. Cependant, aucune de ces études n'a élaboré sur la méthode pour trouver un seuil convenable et optimal. Dans ce mémoire, l'utilisation et la performance du code RS dans un système à modulation d'amplitude en quadrature (QAM) passant à travers un canal de bruit blanc Gaussien additif (AWGN), un canal à évanouissement indépendamment et identiquement distribué (i.i.d.) ainsi qu'en présence d'évanouissement corrélé sont enquêtées. Premièrement, l'enquête se porte sur la démonstration du seuil optimal pour le marquage d'effacement dans le cas des canaux AWGN et i.i.d. En utilisant ce seuil d'effacement optimal, la performance et capacité du système avec EED et ED sont démontrées et comparées. On observe qu' EED surperforme ED dans le cas d'un canal AWGN ainsi qu'à évanouissement i.i.d. Rayleigh et Nakagami-m. En particulier, l'amélioration en performance et capacité obtenue en utilisant EED est significative dans le cas des canaux à évanouissement i.i.d., et augmente lorsque l'évanouissement du canal est plus sévère. Par conséquent, EED est préférable à ED lorsqu'il s'agit de canaux à évanouissement i.i.d.. L'utilisation du code RS dans un système QAM est enquêtée d'avantage dans les canaux à évanouissement corrélés à chemins multiples. L'enquête se porte sur l'effet que le nombre de chemins résolubles, qui représentent le canal à chemins multiples, a sur la corrélation de l'évanouissement entre sous-porteuses, le choix de profondeur d'entrelacement et la performance du système QAM OFDM avec code RS. Les résultats indiquent que, malgrès l'augmentation de sélectivité fréquentielle introduite en ajoutant plus de chemins résolubles, la corrélation fréquentielle entre sous-porteuses diminue. On en conclut donc que la performance d'un système QAM OFDM avec code RS s'améliore avec un entrelacement plus court (et par conséquent un retard plus court) lorsque le nombre de chemins résolubles dans un canal à évanouissement corrélé à chemins multiples augmente.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tho Le-Ngoc (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967409s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k764h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Electronics and Electrical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac247ds559"><dcterms:title>Water calorimetry-based radiation dosimetry in iridium-192 brachytherapy and proton therapy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sarfehnia, Arman</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'objectif premier de ce travail est de déveloper un standard de référence pour des sources à haut taux d'irradiation Ir-192 utilisées en curiethérapie ainsi qu'un autre standard pour un protocole calorimétrique d'irradiation par balayage focalisé avec proton de l'eau inerte à 4 °C.

The measurements were performed using an in-house built water calorimeter and a parallel-plate calorimeter vessel. The dose measurement results of the McGill calorimeter were validated in high energy photon beams against Canada's national established primary standard at the NRC. The measurements in brachytherapy were performed with a spring-loaded catheter holder which allowed for the Ir-192 source to come directly inside the water calorimeter. The COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS software was used to solve the heat transport equation numerically for a detailed geometrical model of our experimental setup. In brachytherapy, reference dosimetry protocols were also developed and used to measure the dose to water directly using thimble type ionization chambers and Gafchromic films with traceable Co-60 (or higher energy photons) calibration factor. Based on water calorimetry standard, we measured an absolute dose rate to water of 361±7 μGy/(h•U) at 55 mm source-to-detector separation. The 1.9 % uncertainty on water calorimetry results is in contrast with the current recommended AAPM TG-43 protocol that achieves at best an uncertainty (k=1) of 2.5 % based on an indirect dose to water measurement technique. All measurement results from water calorimetry, ion chamber, film, and TG-43 agreed to within 0.83 %. We achieved an overall dose uncertainty of 0.4 % and 0.6 % for scattered and scanned proton radiation water calorimetry, respectively. The water calorimetry absorbed dose to water results agreed with those obtained through the currently recommended IAEA TRS-398 protocol (measurements made using an ionization chamber with a Co-60 calibration factor) to better than 0.14 % and 0.32 % in scattered and scanned proton beams, respectively. In conclusion, this work forms the foundation for a primary standard in Ir-192 brachytherapy and scanning proton radiotherapy using water calorimetry. Not only have we been able to directly and absolute measure the absorbed dose to water, but the uncertainties of dose results over the current accepted protocols have been improved dramatically.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jan Peter Frans Seuntjens (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t895j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds559</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics - Medical</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hc60s"><dcterms:title>Improv ed: changing thoughts about learning</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ross, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>L'improvisation a été longtemps considérée un élément intégral de travail artistique, mais a suscité moins d'attention vis à vis les manières dont elle peut informer l'éducation et l'apprentissage.

This dissertation explores understandings central to improvisation, interrogates how they are embodied in music (Western classical music, jazz and African drumming) and theatrical practices, and uses them to problematize values in curricular design and modes of classroom instruction. Improvisation is presented as a means of confronting indeterminacy and negotiating change, concepts that are discussed first in philosophical and anthropological contexts. These theoretical frameworks serve to foreground notions of performance and agency, particularly as they are actualized in creativity and play. Jazz (as well as its adoption in Knowledge Management) and Process Drama are offered as practices that utilize open-ended, interactive structures to highlight creative collaboration. These artistic forms of engagement are shown to integrate features central to cognitive and social development, and should therefore be regarded as fundamental elements of educational praxis. It is argued that improvisation-based curricula display the following features: they foster learner creativity and aesthetic sensitivity, promote democratic interaction, and validate student subjectivities. These dynamics, which foreground dialogic encounter, are considered to be of particular importance in language arts. The applied use of improvisation in the classroom is shown to complement leading theories and pedagogical approaches in education, resonating strongly with situated cognition, constructivism and the works of Vygotsky, Dewey, and Lave and Wenger.

Accordingly, this inquiry deals with gender-based crimes as a case study and with fair labelling as a legal principle and a theoretical framework.  This topic is both critical and timely, and contributes to the existing scholarship in many different ways. This study is the first legal analysis to focus on the dilemma of prosecuting and punishing wartime gender-based crimes in the statutory laws of the international criminal tribunals and the ICC with reference to the principle of fair labelling. Moreover, this inquiry emphasises that applying the principle of fair labelling to wartime gender-based crimes would help the tribunals in delivering fair judgements and breaking the cycle of impunity for these crimes. Finally, this thesis presents a modest model of coherent legal analysis for reconceptualizing, defining, and labelling gender-based crimes that would assist the tribunals in their efforts to reformulate and amend their basic laws, a substantial step towards effectively identifying and prosecuting gender-based crimes.   This analysis consists of four interrelated chapters, including an introduction and a conclusion. The introductory chapter begins by outlining the central focus and theoretical legal framework that guides my investigation and analysis of the dilemma of prosecuting gender-based crimes in the ad hoc international criminal tribunals and the ICC.

Par conséquent, cela conduit à des verdicts et à des peines inconsistantes ainsi qu'à une poursuite judiciaire inadéquate de ces crimes. Bref, cette thèse utilise les crimes sexistes en tant qu'étude de cas et le fair labelling en tant que principe juridique et en tant qu'encadrement théorique.  Ce sujet est à la fois critique et opportun. De plus, cette étude contribue à la scolarité existante de plusieurs façons. En effet, il s'agit de la première analyse juridique qui se concentre sur le dilemme entourant la poursuite judiciaire et les peines des crimes de guerres sexistes dans les lois constitutives des tribunaux étudiés, et ce, sous l'optique du principe du fair labelling. De plus, cette étude souligne que l'application de ce dernier principe aux crimes de guerres sexistes aiderait les tribunaux à formuler des décisions justes et à briser le cycle de l'impunité entourant ces crimes.

Les granules et les particules d'ARN transportent les ARNm aux sites locaux dans les neurones et ce mécanisme de transport s'avère essentiel pour différents processus cellulaires incluant le guidage axonale. Toutefois, les mécanismes responsables de la formation des granules d'ARN ainsi que la régulation de la traduction durant le transport et aux sites de synthèse locaux dans les neurones ne sont pas bien compris. Deux études protéomiques dans les neurones ont identifié plusieurs membres de la famille DEAD box (DDX) hélicase d'ARN comme étant des composantes des granules d'ARN. Ces études ont également confirmé que Staufen2, une protéine qui se lie à l'ARN, fait partie des granules d'ARN.

RNA granules and RNA particles both transport mRNAs to local sites in neurons - a mechanism also required for processes such as axon guidance - but mechanisms of granule formation and regulation of translation during transport and at sites of local synthesis in neurons are poorly understood. Two proteomic studies in neurons have identified multiple members of the DEAD box (DDX) RNA helicase family as components of RNA granules. These studies also confirmed the presence of RNA binding protein Staufen2 in RNA granules. We suggest that these proteins can be used to distinguish different types of RNA granules and these have distinct functions in the cell. METHODS: Fluorescently tagged proteins were overexpressed in hippocampal cultures to determine the amount of colocalization between various pairs of proteins. Antibodies against known RNA granule and ribosome markers were used to identify RNA granules. siRNA probes were designed to knockdown Staufen2 in both hippocampal slices and dissociated cultures to study the role of Staufen2 in mGluR-LTD. mRNA constructs were tagged with MS2 binding sites to follow the fate of the mRNA in cells exposed to an mGluR-LTD stimulus (DHPG) or where Staufen2 was knocked down. RESULTS: We identified puncta in hippocampal neurons with distinct DDX protein compositions: in particular DDX1:CGI-99 puncta are generally distinct from DDX3 punctawhile the conjunction of DDX1 and DDX3 identifies a motile ribosome-containing RNA granule present in both axons and dendrites that is similar to a biochemically isolated RNA granule.

Acetylation carried out by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) is one of the most extensively-studied histone modifications. The ATAC (Ada-Two-A Containing) complex is a multiprotein HAT complex. The complex is unique because it contains two acetyltransferases known as GCN5 and ATAC2, along with greater than 10 additional subunits. GCN5 is a mammalian orthologue of PCAF, and they are mutually exclusive in the human ATAC complex. Recent studies of this complex revealed intricate association among its components. It has been shown that different ATAC complexes contain different components and exhibit different substrate specificities. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling ATAC activity and assembly are poorly understood. To gain insight into this and its functional consequences, I sought to study the activity of ATAC2, and to elucidate the contributions of each of the HAT enzymes in assembling the ATAC complex. From this work, each HAT domain of the acetyltransferases was shown to be responsible for the association with different subsets of ATAC components. And ATAC2 was discovered to bridge GCN5 and PCAF with other ATAC components. Therefore, acetyltransferase domains are not only important for acetyltransferase activity but also for complex assembly. Moreover, the HAT domain and the PHD domain of ATAC2 are both required for enzymatic activity. Additional preliminary data suggest that ATAC2 may affect the anchorage-independent proliferation of transformed cells. These findings not only reveal the essential roles of the HAT domains in the activity and assembly of the ATAC complex, but also open the possibility for ATAC complex regulation.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Le  remodelage de la chromatine induit par l'ensemble de modifications post-traductionnelles d'histones joue un rôle important dans la régulation de l'expression génique.  De ce fait, plusieurs études scientifiques ont examinées le mécanisme d'acétylation d'histones par les enzymes histone acetyltransferase (HAT).  Le complexe multiprotéique ATAC (Ada-Two-A Containing) comprend deux enzymes HAT.  D'après plusieurs études récentes, l'association des composantes de ce complexe est très élaborée.  Différentes conformations de ce complexe contiennent  une variété de combinaisons de sous-unités éprouvant des affinités enzymatiques distinctes envers certains substrats spécifiques.  Ceci dit, l'ensemble des processus cellulaire qui gère  la combinaison des sous-unités et l'activité enzymatique du complexe ATAC sont peu connus.  De ce fait, afin d'élucider le rôle biologique des enzymes HAT par rapport  à l'assemblage des composantes de ce complexe,  j'ai étudié l'activité enzymatique de la sous-unité ATAC2.  D'après mes résultats, l'acétylation des substrats d'ATAC2 dépend du domaine HAT de cet enzyme.  Ainsi, les domaines HAT et PHD sont tous les deux indispensables à  son activité enzymatique.  De plus, ATAC2, GCN5 et PCAF s'associent avec divers sous-ensembles hétérogènes du complexe ATAC.  Subséquemment,  ATAC2 participe activement à l'événement de liaison entre GCN5, PCAF  et les autres composantes du complexe.  Les données supplémentaires préliminaires suggèrent qu'ATAC2 peut affecter l'anchorage-indépendant prolifération des cellules transformées. Les résultats de mon étude démontrent le rôle d'ATAC2 en ce qui concerne l'activité enzymatique et  la formation du complexe ATAC, et ouvrent également la possibilité pour le règlement du complexe ATAC. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Xiang-Jiao Yang (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z53z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv476</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology - Molecular</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225b423"><dcterms:title>Microfabrication and post-CMOS integration techniques for a reconfigurable wafer-sized circuit board</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Radji, Moufid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The WaferBoard(tm) rapid prototyping platform for electronic systems is proposed as a tool to help meet today's tight delivery time, performance and reliability constraints.

Strikingly, these policies and programs are based on a body of literature that largely excludes the voices of older adults.  Understanding how older adults perceive, experience and respond to social isolation is important if current policies and programs aim to better meet their needs.  This qualitative phenomenological study sought to fill this gap in the literature by exploring how six older adults perceived and managed their social isolation.  All participants resided in a rent-geared-to income complex in Montreal and all were identified as socially isolated by their service providers.  The study revealed that older adults actively protect themselves from social isolation by engaging in purposeful activities within their homes and housing communities, and by engaging in low-risk social interactions.  Policy and practice implications emerging from these findings include the significance of critically examining notions of aging well and the potential importance of fostering safe common spaces within housing facilities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tamara Sussman (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qm42q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j588</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Sciences - Social Work</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb4948909"><dcterms:title>Closed-loop control of plasma osmolality in patients with central diabetes insipidus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zaarouri, Kamel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le Diabète Insipide Central est un désordre qui est caractérisé par la sécrétion diminuée d'une certaine hormone dans le corps humain appelé l'hormone antidiurétique (ADH).

Les inhomogénéités matérielles, les variations de géométrie, les tolérance de fabrication ou encore les phénomènes d'usure en service comptent parmi les nombreuses sources de variabilité des paramètres de modélisation qui conduisent, au niveau de la réponse dynamique des structures, à des incertitudes qu'il est nécessaire de quantifier. En pratique, l'approche probabiliste paramétrique est souvent privilégiée pour sa facilite des mise en oeuvre ainsi que pour l'efficacité des algorithmes utilisables. Dans le cadre de simulations de Monte-Carlo, qui consistent à évaluer de façon répétée un modelé en fonction d'un grand nombre de réalisations de paramètres aléatoires (détermines expérimentalement ou estimes), les coûts de calcul peuvent s'avérer prohibitifs si des modelés éléments-finis de haute fidélité sont utilises. L'objectif de cette thèse est de diminuer l'effort nécessaire à l'évaluation de la réponse de systèmes incertains en développant des techniques de réduction de modelés adaptées à des analyses répétées et permettant, en particulier, la prise en compte de grandes variations géométriques. La première partie de cette dissertation concerne le problème du désaccordage structurel des roues aubagées. Les techniques existantes de réduction de modelés basées des projections qui permettent de caractériser les variations de géométrie de structures périodiques sont dans un premier temps revues. Une méthode amenant un modelé réduit très compact, basée sur la correction et non l'expansion du sousespace modal est ensuite sélectionnée et ses limitations sont analysées. Un nouvel algorithme, inspiré des méthodes itératives de pré-conditionnement optimal pour les problèmes aux valeurs propres généralises, est ensuite introduit pour palier ces insuffisances. Les deux techniques sont combinées dans le cadre de simulations sophistiqués pour analyser les effets désaccord aléatoire et de modifications géométriques pour les roues aubagees. Les variations aléatoires sont introduites en tant que paramètres des aubes dans l'espace modal. Une étude comparative est ensuite présentée en s'appuyant sur un modelé de taille industrielle. Les coûts de calcul, les possibilités d'extension ou encore la précision des méthodes sont examines et des aspects phénoménologie sont discutes. Dans la second partie de cette dissertation, une nouvelle approche numérique est proposée pour la quantification des effets d'incertitudes géométriques dans les assemblages inter-étages des rotors. L'algorithme se distingue des approches traditionnelles basées sur des projections en cela que seule une troncature harmonique est considérée. Des performances satisfaisantes peuvent être obtenues grâce à des opérations d'algèbre linéaire sur des matrices creuses ainsi qu'à l'échantillonnage d'un espace paramétrique minimal. En particulier, l'efficacité numérique de la mise a jour du modelé réduit sera mise en évidence. Enfin, la précision et le performance de cette méthode seront illustrées au moyen d'exemples représentatifs tant en termes de variations de paramètres géométriques que de conditions de fonctionnement.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Statistical inhomogeneity of material properties, variations in nominal geometry, manufacturing tolerances, operational wear lead to uncertainties in the parameters associated with FE models of turbine engine rotors and consequently to uncertainties in their vibration response. Reliable assessment of the rotor system behavior cannot be made unless the effects of such uncertainties are understood and quantified. In practical situations the parametric probabilistic approach is the first choice to employ in that context yielding efficient algorithms with feasible implementations. A set of measured or estimated experimentally random parameters is repeatedly propagated through rotor models in Monte-Carlo simulations, which would pose a formidable computational task if the full order high-fidelity finite element (FE) models were utilized. The objective of this dissertation is to decrease the expense of analyzing systems modified in the parametric space by developing accurate model reduction computational techniques suitable for repeated analysis, in particular addressing the problem of large variations in nominal geometry. The first part of the dissertation is concerned with the structural blade mistuning problem. The existing projection based model order reduction techniques capable to numerically characterize variations in nominal geometry of periodic structures are examined, a method generating very compact reduced order models (ROM) based on correction, as opposed to expansion, of the modal subspace is selected and its limitations are analyzed. A new algorithm drawing on optimal preconditioned iterative methods for generalized eigenvalue problem is introduced to address its deficiencies. Both techniques are combined in a stochastic simulation framework to analyze the effect of random mistuning  on geometrically modified bladed disks, where random parameter variation in blade properties is introduced in modal space at component level. A family of benchmark problems on an industrial scale bladed disk model are utilized in a comparative study assessing the amount of computational effort and storage, scalability and accuracy as well as providing insight on underlying physical phenomena. In the second part of dissertation a new computational technique is proposed focusing on prediction of the effects of uncertainty in rotor assembly inter-stage geometry on global vibration response. The algorithm stands apart from the traditional modal projection based framework employing harmonic truncation only. It is shown that decent performance can be achieved due to reliance on sparse matrix linear algebra and sampling of small parametric space. Particular emphasis is given to the computational efficiency of ROM update. Accuracy and performance of the technique is illustrated with representative simulation examples over a practical range of geometrical parameter variations and operational conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Christophe Pierre (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Hannah Michalska (Internal/Cosupervisor2)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903030d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j852b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vt761"><dcterms:title>An uncoupled multiphase approach towards modeling ice crystals in jet engines</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2010</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nilamdeen, Mohamed Shezad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A recent series of high altitude turbofan engine malfunctions, characterized by flameout and sudden power losses have been reported in recent years. The source of these incidents has been hypothesized to be due to the presence of ice crystals at high altitudes. Ice crystals have been shown to have ballistic trajectories and consequently enter the core engine flow, without getting centrifuged out towards the engine bypass as droplets do. The crystals may melt as they move downstream to higher temperatures in successive stages, or hit a heated surface. The wetted surface may then act as an interface for further crystal impingement, which locally reduces the temperature and could lead to an ice accretion on the components. Ice can accrete to dangerously high levels, causing compressor surge due to blockage of the primary flowpath, vibrational instabilities due to load imbalances of ice on rotating components, mechanical damage of components downstream due to large shed ice fragments, or performance losses if ice enters the combustor, causing a decreased burner efficiency and an eventual flame-out. In order to provide a numerical tool to analyze such situations, FENSAP-ICE has been extended to model mixed-phase flows that combine air, water and ice crystals, and the related ice accretion. DROP3D has been generalized to calculate particle impingement, concentration, and field velocities in an uncoupled approach that neglects any phase change by assuming both ice crystals and supercooled droplets are in thermodynamic equilibrium. ICE3D then accounts for the contribution of ice crystals that stick and melt on an existing water-film and promote ice accretion. The extended ice crystal impingement and ice accretion model has been validated against test data from Cox and Co. and National Research Council icing tests conducted on a NACA0012 airfoil and unheated non-rotating cylinder respectively. The tests show a consistent agreement with respect to experimental profiles in terms of capturing the overall shape, although some of the ice profiles were conservative since they over-predicted the amount of ice accreted. The experimental observations suggest that ice crystals cause splashing of an existing film, and erosion effects when they impact an iced surface, and cause an overall loss in the amount of ice, as well as a general streamlining of the ice profile. This has not been taken into account in the present numerical model. The overall predictions in comparison with other numerical models, however, have improved and are a promising step towards simulating ice-shedding characteristics in a turbomachine.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>De nombreux incidents liés à des problèmes de fonctionnement de moteurs d'avions ont été observés ces dernières années, tous caractérisés par l'extinction du moteur ou une perte soudaine de sa puissance. Ces incidents à haute altitude pourraient être causés par des cristaux de glace qui, de par leur trajectoire balistique, entrent directement dans le coeur du moteur sans être déviés par la force centrifuge vers le pontage, comme pour les gouttelettes d'eau. Les cristaux peuvent alors fondre lorsqu'ils rencontrent des températures plus élevées dans le moteur ou lorsqu'ils heurtent une surface chaude. Une telle surface humide pourrait devenir un noyau de cristallisation en réduisant localement la température, favorisant ainsi la formation de glace sur les composants internes du moteur. Cette accumulation présente un danger lorsqu'elle réduit l'espace libre pour l'écoulement d'air, engendrant un phénomène de pompage du compresseur. Elle peut aussi causer des instabilités vibrationnelles lorsqu'elle n'est pas uniforme sur les composantes rotatives, causant ainsi un débalancement de charge. De l'impact des tessons de glace qui se décollent de la surface peut endommager l'équipement mécanique en aval, et causer des pertes de performance liées à la présence de glace dans la chambre de combustion, engendrant une chute de l'efficacité du brûleur et éventuellement l'extinction de la flamme. Afin de fournir un outil numérique pour l'analyse de telles situations, des modifications ont été apportées à FENSAP-ICE pour lui permettre de simuler l'écoulement de phases hétérogènes (air, eau, cristaux de glace) et l'accumulation de glace sur la surface. DROP3D a été généralisé afin de calculer la concentration et les champs de vitesses d'une particule de façon non couplée, en supposant que les cristaux de glace et les gouttelettes d'eau surgelées coexistent en équilibre thermodynamique. ICE3D à été modifié pour tenir compte des cristaux de glace qui se collent sur une couche d'eau existante et qui fondent, favorisant le phénomène d'accrétion de glace. Les modifications au modèle de simulation d'accrétion de glace pour les cristaux de glace ont été validées à l'aide des données de Cox &amp; Co., ainsi que des essais du Conseil National de Recherche du Canada, portant sur un profil NACA0012 et un cylindre sans rotation ni chauffage. Les résultats de ces essais démontrent que le modèle de simulation est généralement capable de prédire les formes de glace, sauf pour quelques profils qui ont donné des résultats conservateurs avec une plus importante accumulation de glace. Cet excès de glace peut être expliqué par des observations expérimentales qui suggèrent que l'impact des cristaux de glace incidents avec la surface cause des éclaboussures dans la couche d'eau existante, et que l'écoulement autour de la glace provoque l'érosion de celle-ci, produisant ainsi une surface plus lisse et plus réfractaire à l'accumulation. Ces effets n'ont pas été considérés dans ce modèle de simulation numérique. En général, les prédictions s'améliorent lorsqu'on les compare avec d'autres modèles et représentent un résultat prometteur pour la simulation des caractéristiques de délestage de glace dans un turboréacteur.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wagdi George Habashi (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr74v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vt761</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering - Aerospace</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
