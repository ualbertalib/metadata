Among the various processes (4,5,8,17,23,25,27,42,53), membrane processes have become a widely investigated field. Of the membrane processes, electrodialysis is the most encouraging of those studied. A survey ot cost estimates (17,41) has shown that electrodialysis at the present stage ot development is able to convert brackish water at a coat of $0.40 per thousand gallons.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Douglas, W.

Once started, cancer cell proliferation is a chain reaction which the body is rarely able to stop. Even t he surgeon and the radiologist do not biologically stop the tumour. One nips it out and the other destroys it in situ. We are still faced with the old debate as to whether the successful subsistance of the cancer is dependent on inherent intercellular attributes or to lack of adequate defense. Probably both factors exist and interact.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, D.

They are cross-pollinated, largely self-incompatible or self-sterile and highly heterozygous. Attempts at the improvement of red clover through plant breeding have occurred since the beginning of the century in a number of countries chief amongst which are Scandinavia, Great Britain, the United States and Canada. Interest in the employment and improvement of birdsfoot trefoil is fairly recent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bubar, J.
