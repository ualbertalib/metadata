Such systems are defined by complex interconnections of end-uses, energy conversion devices and natural resources. The planning process is usually guided by a number of design criteria, namely, economic, social and environmental impacts as well as system reliability and efficiency. The planning challenge is to find an acceptable compromise among these often conflicting objectives. System efficiency is a critical design criterion normally measuring the ratio of the system output and input energies. In electric energy systems, efficiency is normally defined according to the First Principle of Thermodynamics which states that energy cannot be destroyed. In this thesis, the definition of efficiency in electric energy system planning is broadened to include interpretations according to both the First and Second Principles of Thermodynamics. The Second Principle essentially states that the "quality" of energy decreases or, at best, remains constant in any conversion process where the quality of energy (denoted here by exergy) is a measure of the ability of a form of energy to be converted into any other form. Work, hydroelectric potential and electricity are examples of high quality energy sources while low temperatures heat end-use applications are at the low end of the quality scale. Since certain types of energy conversion processes may show high levels of exergy destruction, even though energetically efficient, it is important to design energy systems such that the energy quality of an end-use is matched as much as possible to that of the energy supply thus avoiding situation where a high quality supply is used for a low quality purpose. The electric energy industry has virtually ignored exergetic considerations in system planning due, to a large extent, to a lack of familiarity with the Second Principle and its implications. Nevertheless, exergy is an attribute which must be planned and conserved with at least the same priority as energy. It is demonstrated here that the planning of energy systems will be drastically affected when both energy and exergy are considered. However, to be able to rationally use the natural resources, exergetic analysis must become an integral part of system planning. This thesis analyses the application of the Second Principle of Thermodynamics in the planning of electric energy systems through theory, examples and case studies including economic considerations. In order to achieve electric energy systems that are more exergetically efficient, a new type of electric energy tariff called type-of-use, is proposed. Analogous to the time-of-use rate that assigns different monetary values for the time of the day considered, the type-of-use tariff assigns a monetary value to the end-uses. Simulations are performed in different electric energy systems to demonstrate that type-of-use tariffs will indeed lead to more exergetically efficient systems. The benefits of exergetic analysis are supported by a number of studies presented in this thesis. These studies analyse from the points of view of energetic and exergetic efficiency and cost the following: (i) A space heating system; (ii) The impact of a major introduction of electric vehicles in Canada and (iii) The long range planning of a regional electric power system consisting of two interconnected provinces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, Francisco Daniel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3333907.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kj02t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, System Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Energy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hh06k"><dcterms:title>The role of glycolytic metabolism in fatty acid and glycerolipid biosynthesis in pea root plastids</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Qi, Qungang</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The interaction between the glycolytic metabolism and fatty acid and glycerolipid biosynthesis in pea root (Pisum sativum L.) plastids was assessed in this study.

Similarly, in the absence of exogenously supplied ATP, the optimized triose-phosphate shuttle, which consists of 2 mM dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 2 mM oxaloacetic acid and 4 mM inorganic phosphate, gave up to 44% the ATP-control activity in promoting fatty acid synthesis from acetate. These results suggest that 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase in these plastids can function in intraplastidic ATP production through substrate level phosphorylation. However, in all cases, exogenously supplied ATP gave the greatest rates of fatty acid and glycerolipid synthesis. Radiolabeled pyruvate, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, and malate in comparison to acetate were all variously utilized for fatty acid and glycerolipid biosynthesis by the root plastid. At the highest concentrations tested (3-5 mM), the rates of incorporation of pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate and acetate into fatty acids were 183, 154, 125 nd 99 nmol $ rm cdot h sp{-1} cdot mg sp{-1}$, respectively.

A load model base on computing an average dwelling augmented by a diversification process is introduced. This model is well-suited for studying the load group's natural and controlled dynamics. To validate this model, extensive simulations are employed. Two different strategies are proposed for the control of residential appliances: (1) aperiodic ON/OFF switching of the appliances; (2) continuous control of the thermostat temperature settings. A mathematical framework based on Pulse Width Modulation theory is developed for the remote ON/OFF switching of residential appliances. Load Management System performs the switching actions on load groups in such a way that the resulting net demand of the appliances matches with a Load Reduction Target. The Load Reduction Target is obtained by modelling load groups as new generation resources into generation scheduling functions. The results of the proposed approach are compared with the results of the current practices and it is shown that the proposed scheme is an effective and flexible method that not only can realize the general form of Load Reduction Targets but also it is capable of error compensation, payback power regulation, switching schedules, incremental update and handling unequal peak powers of load groups. For continuous control schemes, it is shown that during the control period, diversified states of the appliances do not change drastically and room temperatures within each load group are largely similar. Optimal control strategies are generated by employing Priority List, Linear Programming and Forward Dynamic Programming. The results show a close match between the Load Reduction Target and appliances' demand during control period. Both methods are efficient and flexible. They allow incremental updating of schedules. Therefore, they are good candidates for use in real time operations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Banakar, Mohammad Hadi (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537270w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg102</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px613"><dcterms:title>Uniform estimates of polynomials by logarithmic sums</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pedersen, Henrik Laurberg</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is well known that the size of a polynomial is controlled in the whole complex plane by the logarithmic integral of the polynomial.

We obtain uniform estimates of polynomials having sufficiently small logarithmic sums. In these estimates, dependence of the polynomials is expressed entirely through the logarithmic sums of the polynomials. This result was originally established by Paul Koosis in 1966. The proof that we present here is, however, new. We use a suitable version of a so-called multiplier theorem. Theorems of this kind were first published by Beurling and Malliavin in 1962. The particular version that we need is based on least superharmonic majorants and harmonic estimation in slit regions and is due to Koosis. We extend the result to entire functions of exponential type less than a certain numerical constant (approximately one third).

(Joanne Christine)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To enhance the performance of dehydrogenases in synthetic organic chemistry, coenzyme analogs of NAD(P)$ sp+$/NAD(P)H were examined. Our study shows that dehydrogenases are more efficient with NAD(P)$ sp+$ than with the APAD(P)$ sp+,$ FPAD$ sp+$ or SPAD(P)$ sp+$ under non-regenerating oxidative conditions in terms of yields. Under regenerating conditions, APAD$ sp+$ often exceeded NAD$ sp+$ in terms of product formation. Lower yields were observed with SPAD(P)$ sp+$ and FPAD$ sp+.$ These coenzyme analogs also displayed reduced reactivity, but APAD$ sp+$ was the most promising of the three. In reduction experiments, the analogs are as equally or slightly less efficient as NAD(P)H in terms of yields, but react slower. Electropotentials could not explain all of the variation in yields. Therefore, to better understand the interactions made by the 3-substituent of the nicotinamide ring in the dehydrogenase active site, the binding properties of 1-methyl-3-substituted pyridinium salts (iodide and chloride) to 8 different dehydrogenases were examined. The salts were R = CONH$ sb2,$ COONa, CN, CH$ sb3,$ CONHCH$ sb3,$ CH$ sb2$OH, CH$ sb2$CN, Cl, H, CH(OH)$ sb2,$ COOCH$ sb3$ and COCH$ sb3$ did not bind well into the active site. However, the five compounds that did bind, in order of their observed increased inhibitory effects are R = CH=NOH, CONHNH$ sb2,$ CSNH$ sb2,$ NH$ sb2$ and ONa. The ONa chloride salt binds on average 336 times more tightly than CONH$ sb2.$ It is proposed that the tightly bound compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents (CH=NOH, CONHNH$ sb2,$ CSNH$ sb2)$ and pKa's in the range of 9.4-10.4 form stronger hydrogen bonds and the two with strong electron-donating groups (ONa and NH$ sb2)$ with low pKa's in their protonated forms bound in a geometry optimized for efficient hydrogen bond exchange. The difference in binding between the nicotinamide and thio derivatives can be geometry related. The X-ray crystal structure of 1-methyl-thionicotinamide shows a different ground state orientation (s-cis) than that previously reported for 1-methyl-nicotinamide (s-trans). From ab initio calculations, the thio derivative has a global and local minima at $ approx$30$ sp circ$ and 135$ sp circ$ as compared to 0$ sp circ$ and 180$ sp circ$ respectively for the oxygen compound. However, both compounds have an out-of-plane conformation in crystal. The enzyme favored trans out-of-plane conformation may also be more easily accessible for the thio than the oxygen derivative since the equilibrium constant for the cis to trans process is favored by a factor of 5.4. By extension, the geometry that SPAD(P)$ sp+$ adopts to maximize hydrogen bond formation may cause it to have a slow turnover rate and to be an inefficient hydride acceptor, while APAD(P)$ sp+$ which is not as tightly bound to dehydrogenases, is a more efficient coenzyme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kazlauskas, Romas J.

This thesis uses the philosophy of ecology, with its holistic approach to "positive peace", as a means to critique the peace conceptions and prescriptions in the realist and liberal strands of IR theory. A review of ecological thought stresses the convergence of deep ecology and social ecology under a radical umbrella. Inspired from anarchist/naturalist philosophy, radical ecology seeks peace by defending an ethic of detachment and cooperation, a decentralized polis and economy, and a holistic epistemology: such prescriptions are shaped by a reading of nature emphasizing finiteness, wholeness, diversity, and long age. Realism is criticized for its ontology of conflict and aggression, its hierarchical view of nature, its elitist view of the polis, its endorsement of political and/or cultural homogeneity, and its materialism. Liberalism's emancipatory framework is likewise hampered by policies favoring homogeneity, materialism and "order"-through-technicity. In both cases, non-ecological (and peace-threatening) values are reinforced by positivism. The thesis concludes with a review of current challenges to IR theory, assessing their compatibility with ecological precepts. We argue that critiques from the WOMP, feminism, neomarxism, structurationism and postmodernism do play an important role in reconstructing the bases of a new "peace theory" in International Relations, but that an ecological approach can subsume such contributions under a distinctly coherent framework.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g82j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g87d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pacifism</dc:subject><dc:subject>International relations</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmentalism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g665d"><dcterms:title>Capsule-based microwave digestion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Légère, Jean-Guy Joseph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A large tube microwave digestion system with capsule sample introduction has been developed.

A second order dependence on catalyst and a second order hydroxide dependence is observed for the transesterification reaction of HPNP promoted by Cu(N3).

This thesis explores the evolution of Zimmermann's compositional approach to the use of this procedure. The first chapter defines four categories of borrowing which correspond, although in a non-exclusive manner, to the features which characterize four compositional periods: stylisation, homage, teleological genesis and pluralism (A compositional technique defined by the composer around 1960 and aiming at representing a spherical conception of time). The second chapter considers the nature, source and content of the quotations and focuses on the recurrence of the identical fragments, themes and types of writing common to several works. It also establishes that the same logic--where theological concerns and the concept of time function as essential points in a network of reference--unifies older works with more recent ones. The third chapter analyzes the strategic role of passages containing quotations with respect to global form and as solution to compositional problems which confronted the composer. The fourth chapter deals with methods of construction which characterize passages with quotations and demonstrates the composer's fascination with Franco-Flemish polyphonic techniques (cantus firmus, proportional canon and isorhythm). In these contexts, borrowed fragments tend not only to have a historical association with such structural types, but also stem from a repertoire supposedly universal. This permits the creation of textures charged with meaning and allows the listener to perceive different superimposed layers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cherney, Brian (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064741f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd36s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zimmermann, Bernd Alois, 1918-1970 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161780c"><dcterms:title>An experimental study of the applicability of the quasi-steady assumption for staggered cylinders in cross-flow</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Da-Jun</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The quasi-steady assumption is frequently employed to derive the fluid dynamic forces on an oscillating body in fluidelastic stability analysis. Although it is well accepted, and physically reasonable, that this assumption is valid for high values of non-dimensional flow velocity, $U/fD,$ and invalid for low values, it is still uncertain how the error varies with $U/fD.$ In this thesis the applicable range of the quasi-steady assumption and the error of the assumption are investigated experimentally for three cases of two staggered circular cylinders in cross-flow. The applicable range is presented in terms of $U/fD,$ reduced frequency $fD/U$ or the ratio of the vortex-shedding frequency on the stationary model to the frequency of oscillation, $f sbsp{v}{s}/f.$ Two quasi-steady models are studied, a basic model and a modified model. The basic model allows fluid force coefficients measured on a stationary body to be used to determine the fluidelastic forces on an oscillating body, provided that the body motion is correctly accounted for in the resultant velocity vector. The modified model takes the following into account also: (i) the magnitude and incidence of the flow velocity approaching the oscillating cylinder, and (ii) the time delay between cylinder displacement and the fluidelastic forces generated thereby. Forced vibration measurements are conducted for the three cases. In each case one cylinder is forced to oscillate in the cross-flow direction and the other is fixed. The fluidelastic forces on the oscillating cylinder in the cross- and in-flow directions are measured over a wide range of $U/fD$ (roughly $5f/f sbsp{v}{s}&gt;1.1$, where the quasi-steady assumption totally breaks down.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Price, S.

This formulation has led to the design of novel cam mechanisms, as yet unknown. The theory is then extended to the study of four-link cam mechanisms, where an intermediate element, namely, a roller, is placed between the cam and the follower. In general, the surface of the roller is shown to be a hyperboloid, which, for the planar case, becomes a regular cylinder, and, for the spherical case, a regular cone. The two theorems stated for three-link cam mechanisms are then extended to four-link mechanisms. A general formulation is presented for the study of the pressure angle in both three- and four-link cam mechanisms. With this formulation, the general expression for the pressure angle of spherical mechanisms is derived as a particular case of the general expression for spatial cam mechanisms. Moreover, the pressure-angle expression corresponding to planar cam mechanisms is derived as a particular case of spherical cam mechanisms. The unified formulation is then applied to the synthesis of planar cam mechanisms via graphical methods. Here, an innovative technique is introduced, which consists of finding contact points of the cam profile, in contrast to traditional graphical techniques that employ cam envelopes, and, hence, are prone to inaccuracies. Special attention is given to the synthesis of indexing cam mechanisms. In this context, a theorem is established for the determination of one of the design parameters that is used to avoid undercutting on the cam profile. A novel design of an indexing cam mechanism, called PRICAM, in which pure rolling and positive motion are achieved for planar and spherical mechanisms, is obtained using a combination of three- and four-link cam mechanisms. The unified formulation is implemented in the software package USYCAMS, in which, with visualization aids, the user can design cam mechanisms of the three types and animate their motion, by providing the design parameters on-line. USYCAMS allowed the design of two versions of PRICAM, one planar and one spherical, and produced a database describing the contact surfaces, which served as input to the CNC machine tool used to cut actual prototypes of these mechanisms.

Total mass balances were obtained for carbon, sodium, and sulphur in the solid char and gaseous products. Above 600$ sp circ$C, the addition of steam resulted in significant increases in CO$ sb2$ and H$ sb2$, and a decrease in CO; however, the production of CH$ sb4$ was unaffected. The global gasification rate of carbon increased fourfold from 0.003 min$ sp{-1}$ at 600$ sp circ$C to 0.013 min$ sp{-1}$ at 650$ sp circ$C. It is proposed that the carbon gasification rate for black liquor char is controlled by the kinetics of the C-H$ sb2$O reaction. Catastrophic defluidization was observed at 700$ sp circ$C for steam gasification but not for pyrolysis. SEM micrographs of the char particles revealed that surface melting had occurred. Low-melting-point eutectic mixtures containing chloride and potassium were suggested as the primary cause. It is proposed that the stickiness of the char surface is controlled by the quantity of amorphous carbon under these conditions. For pyrolysis in N$ sb2$, a total mass balance over the temperature range 500-700$ sp circ$C showed that the retention of sulphur in the solid char product increased from 60 $ pm$ 11 wt% to 91 $ pm$ 8 wt%. Between 500-550$ sp circ$C, the major sulphur compounds in the char were $ rm Na sb2SO sb4, Na sb2SO sb3,$ and NA$ sb2$S, in decreasing order. The production of Na$ sb2$SO$ sb4$ was attributed to the decomposition of sodium thiosulphate, which was present in the kraft black liquor solids. Between 600 and 700$ sp circ$C, the reduction of $ rm Na sb2SO sb4$ and $ rm Na sb2SO sb3$ by carbon and CO/H$ sb2$ led to an increase in the production of sodium sulphide. The reduction efficiency in the fluidized bed was 99.1 $ pm$ 11.4% at 700$ sp circ$C. The addition of steam led to a decrease in the concentration of solid Na$ sb2$S in the kraft black liquor char throughout the temperature range studied. Between 650-700$ sp circ$C, the emission of H$ sb2$S in the particulate phase of the fluidized bed was in equilibrium with the gasification product gases. The results suggest that the sulphur emission could reach unacceptable levels in commercial fluidized-bed gasifiers employing higher steam concentrations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mujumdar, A. S.

To characterize dynamic recrystallization, continuous torsion tests were carried out between 850 and 1050$ sp circ$C at strain rates of 0.02, 0.2 and 2s$ sp{-1}.$ Quenches were performed to investigate the grain refinement produced by dynamic recrystallization. Interrupted torsion tests were performed between 850 and 1050$ sp circ$C and at strain rates between 0.02 and 2s$ sp{-1}$ to study the characteristics of postdynamic recrystallization. Quenches were performed after increasing holding times to follow the evolution of the postdynamic microstructure. The evolution of the grain size distribution as a function of holding time shows that the growth of dynamically recrystallized grains is the first change that takes place. Then metadynamically recrystallized grains appear and contribute to the softening of the material. The rate of metadynamic recrystallization increases with strain rate and temperature and is observed to be independent of strain, in contrast to the observations for static recrystallization. The dependence of the metadynamically recrystallized grain size on the Zener-Hollomon parameter was established and is shown to differ from static recrystallization dependence. Simple torsion simulations were carried out using constant interpass times to study the conditions under which dynamic, metadynamic or static recrystallization takes place. Dynamic recrystallization controlled rolling (DRCR) is shown to require such short interpass times that they are not attainable in hot strip mills. A new concept, metadynamic recrystallization controlled rolling (MDRCR), is introduced to describe the case where there is 20 to 80% softening by metadynamic recrystallization. The occurrence of dynamic and metadynamic recrystallization causes the load to increase less rapidly than in the case of pure strain accumulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jonas, J. J.

It shows how capacity and production strategies lead to an enhanced economic outcome of resource development and extraction. An important aspect of the study is the development of deterministic algorithms for cutoff grade and production rate optimization within existing mine facilities. These variables are determined by maximizing the present value of future benefits associated with mine production. Two opposing economic forces are at play in the optimizing process. A higher present value can be achieved by increasing operating profits through a higher cutoff grade and/or extraction rate. This strategy decreases the losses due to discounting. However, a higher cutoff grade generally leads to higher operating costs, and may also result in the loss of ore. A higher production rate within an existing mining system, likewise, increases unit operating costs. These reduce operating profits and act to lower the present value. Both static and dynamic optimization methods are developed. Static optimization refers to determining the constant cutoff grade and production rate that maximize the total discounted operating profits. Dynamic optimization refers to the situation in which periodical adjustments are allowed for the production variables. In this case, declining cutoff grade and production rate schedules within an established mining system yield higher total discounted profits over the static solution. In general, the schedule is controlled by the discount rate, as well as by trade-offs between ore quality and reserves, and between production rate, cutoff grade and production costs. The study subsequently focuses on the choice of installed capacity at the mine development stage. The objective here is to find the installed capacity level that maximizes the net present value of the project. The consideration of capital costs alone tends to limit the increase in installed capacity. The preproduction period has a similar effect. When both variables are combined, the increasing preproduction period and capital costs associated with higher levels of installed capacity impose a severe burden on the maximization process, causing limitations to the rising trend of optimum installed capacity at high discount rates.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bilodeau, Michel L.

To gain further knowledge on the behaviour of SMC after arterial injury, SMC were cultured from neointimal explants with or without a covering of regenerated endothelium, 15 weeks after a single balloon catheter deendothelialization. Proliferation of these cells was studied by the examination of the cell growth curve, $ rm lbrack sp3H rbrack$-thymidine incorporation and determination of the cell cycle. The growth factors released from neointimal SMC and their effect on SMC proliferation were studied in neointimal SMC conditioned media. The production of proteoglycan and collagen by these SMC were also measured following the incorporation of radiolabelled precursors into these extracellular matrix components. The morphological features of the cells were observed using LM, TEM, SEM as well as immunofluorescence microscopy. Results revealed that neointimal SMC were characteristically different in their metabolic behaviour after injury. They have a higher proliferation rate, as indicated by higher $ rm lbrack sp3H rbrack$-thymidine incorporation and increased cell number. Neointimal SMC also exhibit alterations in their morphological features and synthesize significantly more proteoglycan and collagen. This study, demonstrated for the first time, that SMC have the ability for sustained proliferation, a long time (15 weeks) after injury. This persistent proliferation may be associated with some growth factors, such as PDGF-AB and TGF-$ beta sb1.$ These proliferating SMC and their cellular products contribute to the development of the neointima, which has many features in common with early atherosclerosis. Thus, endothelial injury is a strong and persistent stimulus for a sustained increase in thickness of the neointima,</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alavi, M. Z.

In the first part of the thesis, the Rayleigh-Taylor and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of a cylindrical interface between two inviscid fluids or two viscous fluids are analyzed from first principles (momentum and continuity equations). Dispersion equations, relating wavenumber, k, to growth rate, G, were derived for various conditions. Application of the dispersion equations to film boiling on a cylindrical heater and to breakup of a liquid film around a cylindrical body led to the development of mathematical models for the prediction of the dominant wavelengths formed during these processes for both inviscid and viscous fluids. Experiments were carried out to measure the dominant unstable wavelength during the breakup of a liquid film around a cylindrical body. It was found that the dominant wavelength decreased with a decrease in the radius of the cylindrical body in agreement with the present theory and in contradiction to previously published work. In another application of the present theory, the breakup of a cylindrical liquid-in-gas jet and a cylindrical gas-in-liquid jet was analyzed based on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. It was predicted that the dominant wavelength decreased rapidly with an increase in the jet velocity. In the second part of the thesis, gas injection through a very narrow slot into a liquid is examined extensively. A modified bubble formation model is proposed taking into consideration the surface tension force and the inertial force. When gas was injected into liquid through a very narrow slot (50-250$ mu$m), three different bubbling regimes were found as the flow rate of gas was increased. They were: regular bubble regime at low flow rates, coalescence bubble regime at medium flow rates, and gas globe regime at high flow rates. The gas-dispersion characteristics of each of the regimes were discussed and mathematically analyzed. In the regular bubble regime, the bubble formation was dominated by both surface tension force and inertial force. In the coalescence bubble regime, the formation of bubbles was dominated by inertial forces only. In the gas globe regime, due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, multiple bubbles were formed at separate nodes of a continuous gas blanket extending the length of the slot. The critical transition condition between the regular bubble formation regime and the coalescence bubble regime is given.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Harris, Ralph (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rq41c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z699v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qb468"><dcterms:title>Acoustic and optical wave propagation in anisotropic fiber waveguides</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dai, Ji-Dong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis analyses of the optical wave propagation characteristics in uniaxial and weakly biaxial fibers are presented.

Interest in the application of controlled recirculation of ventilation air in mines has grown considerably in the last decade. This is evident by the number of controlled recirculation schemes which have been implemented or are being considered or planned in several countries and in different types of mines. A detailed description is given of the operating and proposed schemes in South African gold and U.K. coal mines. This includes safety, dust filtration and blast contaminant removal systems. The monitoring and feasibility methodology required to evaluate controlled recirculation for heat reclamation, and thus cost saving, in Canadian hard rock mines, is then examined. Experimental work pertaining to air quality study, carried out at three mines, is described in detail, and backed up by extensive appendices. The observed deposition of dust and reduction in gaseous pollutants concentration in exhaust shafts are analyzed and depicted in several figures and tables. Simplified theoretical aspects of dust deposition, and statistical analysis of the obtained results, are outlined.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McPherson, M. J.

(Melanie Anne)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This case study examines the educational needs of students attending two social affairs schools in Quebec. The aim was to determine why these youths continue to do poorly academically and why they fail to thrive once they leave the child welfare system, as described in the literature. Individual and environmental factors that hinder academic progress were investigated ethnographically. The chronic under-achievement characteristic of youths attending the social affairs schools appears to be due to a number of individual factors such as frequent school changes as well as to the mental health model that guides the social affairs schools. This model views educational difficulties to be secondary to psycho-social familial problems. As a result, appropriate educational assessments are not conducted and little attention is given to remediating learning difficulties that may prevent successful reintegration of students into regular schools and often exacerbate family dysfunction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eisemon, Thomas O.
