The enzyme was purified from 105,000g supernatant by precipitation at pH 5.1 followed by chromatography on hydroxyapatite at pH 6.8. Activity was assayed by measuring the rate of methylation of either E. coli B or yeast tRNA with (14C or 3H)-Me-S-adenosyl-, methionine at pH 8.2. Although substantial amount of other methylated guanine derivatives and methylated pyrimidines were detected in tRNA incubated with the "supernatant enzymes" fraction or with the "pH 5 enzymes" fraction, 86% of the methylation of tRNA with one of the fractions from hydroxyapatite was of guanine to form N2 -dimethyl guanine. No methylation of adenine by any of the enzyme fractions was detected.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fraser, M.

The radioassay for this enzyme was significantly improved by the addition of EDTA and the substitution of Tris buffer for phosphate buffer. In contrast to DNA synthesis the profile of the ornithine decarboxylase induction in response to partial hepatectomy does not vary dramatically with the age of the rat. The induction of ornithine decarboxylase is inhibited by 8-azaguanine and 5-azacytidine, inhibitors of protein synthesis. The induction is however reinitiated after a delay of approximately 4-6 hours, a time at which the drug is almost completely metabolized. This supports a theory of transcriptional control for ornithine decarboxylase induction. Although ornithine decarboxylase is induced in response to stress and corticosteroids, the induction after partial hepatectomy or thioacetamide administration was shown to be independent of stress. The two slow growing hepatomas examined showed a relationship between ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine levels but none with spermine levels. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the levels of spermidine and spermine may be controlled separately in the cell.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webb, T.

The prosecretory and secretory granules associated with the connecting profiles contained a dense central core surrounded by a clear halo. With glycoprotein staining the Golgi saccules showed a gradual transition from the unstained forming face to the moderately stained mature face.

Surface-wave as well as radiated powers are obtained in terms of the current in the source dipole, and the launching efficiency of the surface waves is determined as a function of the tube radius, wall-thickness and permittivity of the material. Finally, comparisons are made between the dielectric tube and the solid rod which was investigated previously [27] as possible surface-wave transmission lines, and also the launching efficiencies for these two cases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yip, G.

The thesis begins with a broad survey that attempts to recreate the cultural mood and artistic effervescence of an era that unleashed an unprecedented outpouring of black talent. Part One is concerned with the affirmative aspects of the ideal of folk-life. The originality of this study resides partly in its analysis of black folk values and in their description as a kind of racial or group soul. Part Two, which focuses on the critical aspects of the above ideal, explores the historical origins and the fictional expression of the resistance to white American culture. And Part Three examines reservations toward the ideal by dissenting Harlem novelists through a new interpretation of the “passing” theme.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dorsinville, M.

Authors seem to disagree as to the place where the horticultural improvement of the species began. Bailey (1944) attributes it to Holland while Coulter (1941) says that the transition of the wild carrot to the garden form took place in France. Though there are some rather hazy indications that a form of carrot may have been known to man in remote antiquity, for practical purposes the garden type is to be regarded as one of the comparatively later developed species dating from approximately the second century B.C. It is difficult to be precise about the carrot of that time, or even much later, since the ancient writings are so brief and vague in their references to it and to plants of similar type. Thus it is not always possible to ascribe with accuracy to individual species the various names which are in use. One Greek word usually translated as carrot, is “staphulinos” meaning “clustered”, evidently with reference to the umbel. Dioscorides, a physician of the first century in our era, whose work was the standard authority for 1,500 years, says the umbel or inflorescence had a little purple in the midst of the tuft, so it seems evident to regard it as the wild carrot.

The focus of interest was on its effects on FRC and on gas exchange (measured as A-aDO2 and QS/QT%), which have not been previously reported. All subjects were given 10 ml/Kg glucose in saline I.V. during the pre-epidural period. Lidocaine 1.5% was used in all cases, plain lidocaine for the first eight and lidocaine with epinephrine 1/200,000 in the other five subjects. This agent was given to achieve a sensory block to both pin-prick and ice up to T4. Neither FRC nor gas exchange showed any consistent changes following the epidural anaesthetic. These findings are in keeping with what was anticipated from a consideration of the basic physiology and pharmacology concerned and with a review of the pertinent literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Becklake, M.

Chapter II contains the arguments for and against woman's suffrage together with an ideological study of these arguments. The third chapter examines the suffragists' attitude toward the woman's role in society. Chapters IV and V deal with the suffragists’ tactics, the attitudes of their political allies, and the suffragists' reaction to World War 1. Al though the woman's cause in Canada attracted no widespread following, the suffragists' ideas represent an important segment of the intellectual history of the period (1890-1920).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Miller, C.

Single compounds, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, Tween 80, aspartame, and oxalacetate, showed varying degrees of biotin-replacing activity, but none was able to restore the cell to normal growth. Comparative analysis of fatty acid composition indicated that biotin deficiency causes a shift in synthesis from anteiso to normal straight chain fatty acids. RNA, DNA, and protein accumulation were followed throughout the growth cycle. The RNA content per cell was reduced by the vitamin deficiency, however, the DNA per C.F.U. was maintained at a level comparable to that of the normal cell. Protein reached a final level 35% greater than the normal cell protein. It is probable that much of this material is comprised of structural proteins which would account for the morphological abnormalities which accompany biotin-depletion in this organism. Hydrolysates of cell wall material were analysed for amine sugar and amino acid contents. The abnormal cell was found to contain 13.4 times more ninhydrin-reacting material and 19.4 times more hexosamine per mg dry weight over the biotin-sufficient cell.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, E.

It is well known that MAO inhibitors elevate brain amines, and compounds such as morphine and meperidine have also been shown to affect these agents. It therefore appeared reasonable that the interaction between phenelzine and meperidine might be linked to their combined effect on one or more of these amines. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with phenelzine or meperidine, killed by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and the frozen brains were removed and analysed for 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline and dopamine. Phenelzine (10 to 50 mg/kg) elevated all three amines, with a maximum change at six hours following administration. The effects of meperidine (15 to 50 mg/kg) were less striking. It had no significant effect on brain levels of noradrenaline, and tended to slightly increase levels of dopamine and lower those of 5-hydroxytryptamine. When a low dose of meperidine (15 mg/kg) was given to rats pretreated with phenelzine (25 mg/kg), brain levels of all three amines were significantly different from those in rats receiving phenelzine alone. Both catecholamines were further elevated, with the most marked change in dopamine, while 5-hydroxytryptarnine levels decreased. The results of these experiments support the involvement of all three brain amines in the phenelzinemeperidine interaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eade, N.

Measurement of a fairly constant concentration of cyclic AMP in these circumstances further emphasized the physiological importance of turn-over rate rather than concentration of the nucleotide. (2) Acute enhancement of the concentration of cyclic AMP (after in vitro incubation with theophylline) in the mouse thyroid by intravenous injection of LATS or thyrotropin offers firm support for cyclic AMP's role as mediator of the action of both thyroid stimulators. (3) The subcellular distribution of adenyl cyclase in the homogenate of thyroids of the rat and other species was shown to differ but the inference to be drawn regarding cyto-structural variability is not known.

The changes produced by norepinephrine and isoproterenol infusions in the shock state were evaluated. The concentration of FFA in the plasma of dogs anesthetized after a 12-16 hour fast was 450 µEq/l. (range 150-1040 µEq/l). Norepinephrine and isoproterenol increase the plasma FFA concentration by mobilizing FFA from adipose tissue. A moderate hemorrhage increases the plasma FFA concentration, but a several hemorrhage produces no such increase. Catecholamine infusion during shock produces a hemodynamic response, but no metabolic response. Endotoxin injection produces a fall in B.P. and C.O., and a gradual elevation in plasma FFA. Norepinephrine has a minimal effect after endotoxin injection. The half life of palmitic acid-1-C14 in the plasma before and after endotoxin injection was 2.00 and 2.75 minutes respectively. Other studies evaluated changes in FFA concentration across the heart, liver, and adipose tissue.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheiner, N.
