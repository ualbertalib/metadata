Although the reports for both groups began to appear at approximately the same time, they did so within different contexts. This may account in part for the dichotomy. Work with adults was done in neurological clinics and hospital laboratories, whereas the study of children was carried on mainly in educational and various non-medical settings. The persistence of this unfortunate dichotomy is exemplified by two recent review monographs, one describing research with adults (Meyer, 1960), the other with children (Birch, 1964).

Almost forty years elapsed before these observations were confirmed by Krebs et al in 1949. In the meantime, microbes bad not been considered as beinq capable of absorbing (transporting) amino acids from their environment. However, a number of perplexing observations concerning amino acid inter-relationships in the nutritional requirements of micro-organisms bad been reported. These observations centred around the ability of structurally related amino acids to permit growth in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of certain amino acids or analogues, or to prevent growth in the presence of an adequate supply of a required amino acid. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scriver, C.
