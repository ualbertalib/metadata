The beta ray spectrum has been shown to consist of two groups with end points at (970 +/-5) kev. and (886 +/- 5) kev. A single weak gamma ray of (83.9 +/- 0.2) kev. has been found. This energy has been computed from the K, L and M conversion lines on the beta spectrum at 22.6, 73.5, and 81.2 kev. respectively as well as from L and M photoelectron lines using a lead radiator. A search for other gamma rays using lead and uranium radiators had a negative result. Beta-gamma coincidences were obtained for approximately 1% of the beta rays, confirming the complexity of the spectrum. The total conversion coefficient of the gamma ray is estimated at 0.8. A decay scheme consistent with these results is given. The decay of the activity has been followed for 3.5 months and the halflife found to be 126 +/- 5 days.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

If the molecule is electrically asymmetric, it will tend to be oriented in an external electric field. The extent of this orientation can be determined experimentally by measuring the dielectric constant of the material. Substances having high dielectric constants are known to possess large permanent electric moments on the molecular scale. The molecules of such substances can therefore be considered as electrical dipoles, in which the centres of positive and negative charge are separated by finite distances. In the presence of an external electric field, these dipoles will tend to orient themselves in the direction of the field, although this tendency will be opposed by their random thermal motion.[...] </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

Thus, by extirpating the liver or interfering with bile excretion, it was possible to intensify the effects of thyroxine; therefore, the liver influences the action of this hormone by reducing the amount available to the tissues. The role of the testis seems quite different, since testosterone influences only some of the responses to thyroxine, especially those of the submaxillary glands, skin and kidney. Thus, the liver has an overall effect, while the testis hormone has a more local one. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.

Benzoic acid was lethal to ail three stages: ova, preinfective larvae and infective larvae, the others being lethal to preinfective larvae only.The time required to kill £0 percent of the preinfective larvae was: urea - $0 hours; ammonia - 31 minutes; hippuricacid - $2 minutes; benzoic acid - 19 minutes; sodium bicarbonate - h3 hours; and of ova and infective larvae was: benzoic acid - 18 minutes and 160 minutes respectively. Ail constituents were used in solution at their approximate concentrations in urine. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Camero, T.

The purpose is also to learn the attitudes and opinions of such families towards family allowances. It was questioned whether there had been any influence on family spending patterns, and if so, how the patterns were affected. The différences, if any, that family allowances hâve made in family consumptionand spending will be studied. The question of whether or not family allowances must be used only to replace income lost elsewhere, and thus leave the children no better off than before, will also be of concern. The study will be largely exploratory in nature as the field is a new one. In addition, the findings cannot be expected to be of general application. They will apply only to the particular kind of family in the local sample chosen, which is a relatively small one. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Laycock, J.

In the Unes which follow the .intention has been to analyze what three outstanding philosophers meant by courage, how it is related to the other cardinal virtues, and where each of these thinkers stands with respect to the notions presented above. From such an analysis it is hoped that some support will be found for the authorfs own position, namely that courage is a habit of will which makes for something being done without dissuasion by adverse circumstances. We shall inquire (1) whether courage is a virtue, (2) whether courage is the first virtue, (3) hcw courage is said to be a cardinal virtue, (4) what is the relation of courage to the other virtue, (5) what is the proper object of courage— whether fear, daring, suffering, or some other thing, (6) whether if concerned with fear it is concerned with every fear or solely with fear of death,' and if with fear of death then with death of any sort or solelywith death in battle, (7) which is the cief act of courage and whether this act is directed to its own good or another, (8) whether courage takes pleasure in its own act or whether pleasure is alien to that act, (9) whether courage is concerned chiefly with sudden occurences or with occurences of every sort, and (10) what are the vices opposed to courage. In replying to these questions we shall have answered all that can properly be asked about courage per se. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Klibansky, R.
