The current  analysis uses data on 63 ever smokers (mean age 14.1 years) from the first three  years of follow-up of the McGill University Study on the Natural History of Nicotine  Dependence In Teens. To examine reliability, we compared responses to one-month  recall to three-month recall of the subjects' smoking history. The questionnaire  demonstrated very good reliability for smoking intensity (kappa = 0.75) and smoking  frequency (kappa = 0.78). Number of cigarettes smoked per month showed good  reliability (ICC = 0.64). Reliability remained acceptable when subjects who reported  no cigarette consumption at both questionnaire administrations were excluded (kappa  = 0.66; kappa = 0.70; ICC = 0.61, respectively). Older adolescents (14--16) were  better at recalling their smoking history than younger adolescents (12--13). Female  sex and smoking status (sporadic versus regular) were associated with adequate  recall for one and two of the indicators investigated, respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>O'Loughlin, Jennifer (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569516m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83kz97x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tv66d"><dcterms:title>Calculating the probability of an LTL formula over a labeled Markov chain</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Eliosoff, Jacob</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a new algorithm to compute the probability  that a state in a labeled Markov chain model satisfies an LTL specification. A  solution to this problem was given by Courcoubetis &amp; Yannakakis in 1995, but  unlike their solution the algorithm presented here requires no transformations of  the input model. This advantage may be significant because of the large models which  occur in most practical verification problems. The new algorithm is proved correct  and shown to be not worse than doubly exponential in the size of the formula and  cubic in the size of the model. However limited experimental results suggest that  these bounds are pessimistic and that with further optimization the algorithm might  approach the efficiency of current model checkers, which compute only true or false  rather than an exact probability. I also include a working Java implementation,  MCMC, and a proof that for any plausible path P followed by a Markov chain and any  LTL formula Φ, some finite prefix of P determines whether P satisfies  Φ.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Panangaden, Prakash (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc60s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv66d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k5535"><dcterms:title>Host selection behavior of the adult parasitoid Microctonus hyperodae Loan (Hymenoptera:Braconidae:Euphorinae) and the egg parasitoid Anaphes victus Huber (Hymenoptera:Mymaridae), parasitoids of the carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis LeConte (Coleoptera:Curculionidae)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cournoyer, Michel, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis LeConte (Coleoptera:  Curculionidae), is an important pest of carrot in northeastern North America.

Conventional design of propellers uses blade-element theory  but becomes inaccurate in capturing three-dimensional vortical and compressible  effects at the tips, as well as the effect on downstream bodies. A propeller is  always attached to a fixed component that affects its performance, thus the need  arises to couple a fixed domain to a rotating domain in an unsteady aerodynamic  simulation. A finite element formulation for the simulation of propellers is  presented in terms of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for unsteady,  three-dimensional, viscous, compressible flows. The first step consists of preparing  a mesh containing two separate domains interfacing at a virtual surface. Then,  simulation is run to obtain an initial solution. This step highlights the live/dead  interfacing scheme between the fixed and rotating domains without mesh movement.  Finally the unsteady simulation performs interpolations at each time step with node  movement until a periodic steady state is reached. Mesh movement can be treated by  either an ALE formulation or a rotating frame of reference correction. Two test  cases are used to validate the code: a two-dimensional pitching airfoil in transonic  flow and a 3-bladed 5868-9 propeller with a liquid cooled nacelle.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Habashi, Wagdi G.

Total steel media wear in a given mill (ball or SAG)  grinding process is a product of three recognized wear mechanisms---impact,  abrasion, and corrosion of which the contribution of each wear mechanism to total  media wear has not been well established. A total media wear model can be defined on the assumption that  the effect of each wear mechanism can be independently determined and this effect  can be tied to mill charge motion as determined or estimated using a charge motion  simulator, which allows for a total media wear model to be defined as the summation  of the wear results of each mechanism. This necessitates the need for developing  impact, abrasion and corrosion wear testers that will allow the study of media wear  over a wide range of energy levels. Refinement of the impact test will allow  studying how impact media wear at high energies behaves as a function of those  energies.

Such assessments would  benefit from the development of parameters that could be used to quantify and  reflect the magnitudes of odour impacts experience by the community. Therefore,  numerous parameters that can be used to assess odour impacts have been proposed in  this research. These parameters account for variations in odour concentration,  probability of response, degree of annoyance and population density that clearly  influence the degree of impact of an odorous emission on a community. Most of these  parameters require the evaluation of areas enclosed within contours and volumes  under contours and, as such, are calculation intensive. In order to simplify the  calculation of these parameters, algorithms have been developed and implemented into  a user-friendly interface called OdorImp. This software was tested by applying it to  three sets of synthetic data and two sets of data arising from actual case-studies.  Comparisons were made between the results from OdorImp and exact values derived from  simple cases and other values calculated using a commercial contour-evaluation  program.

A large number of such codes require channel knowledge  for decoding. Therefore, research in the area of channel estimation for space-time  coding is very important. This thesis deals with the application of the Kalman Filter (KF)  to channel estimation in space-time coded systems. For the purpose of deriving such  an estimator, we model the multiple antenna channel as a first order Autoregressive  process. As test cases, we employ the Alamouti's code as well as a rate ¾  orthogonal code for 3 transmit antennas. We consider a single antenna receiver, with  different decoders: the joint optimal, the QR decision feedback and the symbol by  symbol decoders. Through computer simulations, the effect of channel estimation  on the system's performance is investigated. With known channel (perfect  estimation), the results show that the joint optimal decoder achieves the best  performance, followed by the QR decision feedback and the symbol by symbol decoders,  respectively. Also, simulation results show that the tracking ability of the KF in  its predictive form deteriorates as the Doppler rate increases. When the channels  are estimated by the KF, the simulations show that the three decoders yield  essentially the same performance, because of estimation errors. The same behavior  for the three decoders, with channel estimation, is observed for different  modulation formats (BPSK and QPSK) and orthogonal codes. Finally, the numerical  evaluation of the error probability for the joint optimal and symbol by symbol  decoders, by the use of the residue theorem, shows similar results, backing up the  computer simulations. Therefore, to enjoy the benefits of improved decoders, an  efficient channel estimator should be also used.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t253m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fr89g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p0967691"><dcterms:title>Design of reinforced concrete elements for durability against corrosion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ji, Chen Hui, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main objective of this research is to establish durability  design models for flexural concrete elements subjected to a given aggressive  environment. Because corrosion of reinforcement due to chloride ingress is the most  significant threat to an existing reinforced concrete structure such as a road  bridge or a harbor facility which is exposed to chloride-rich environments,  corrosion due to chloride ingress is emphasized in this research. The concrete beams  can get corroded to different corrosion levels. Mass loss of the reinforcement is an  important parameter, and it can help define the corrosion level, and this  information can be used to develop a correlation between corrosion, cracking, bond  strength at the steel-concrete interface, and the ultimate strength of the  reinforced concrete elements. Therefore, the prediction model of reinforcement mass  loss under different levels of chloride concentration needs to be established first  using the principles of corrosion electrochemistry. Secondly, design development  length is determined based on the mass loss prediction and bond strength equation.  Thirdly, the model for the prediction of flexural capacity of reinforced concrete  beam for a given design service life is established. Some examples of practical  durability design are presented. Finally, a step-by-step durability design procedure  is recommended for use by practicing engineers.

Further experiments were conducted to determine if the presence  of asphaltenes in petroleum liquids affected resistance to interphase mass transfer  of naphthalene in situ with aging. Results were analyzed using a lumped mass  transfer coefficient calculated after various aging periods. Experimental data  suggested that adding increasing amounts of asphaltenes to gasoline resulted in a  marked increase in the lumped mass transfer coefficient with time during aging  periods of up to 12 days. Over a 60-day aging period, amended gasolines were found  to show net decreases in the lumped mass transfer coefficients, while non-amended  gasolines showed a rather constant lumped mass transfer coefficient over the entire  aging process. Finally, residual saturation centrifuge tests were conducted to  determine if the presence of asphaltene in petroleum liquids affected the  wettability of a subsurface system contaminated with gasolines containing various  concentrations of asphaltenes. Observation of the systems after centrifuging  suggested that as the asphaltene content in gasoline was increased, oil recovery  from the porous media decreased.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ghoshal, Subhasis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731455p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r38k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nh672"><dcterms:title>Multiple-criteria optimization of a cold heading process using finite element analysis and a taguchi approach</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>El-Lahham, Christine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The current work aims at modeling a three-stage cold heading  process of an industrial bolt, and presents a methodology for the optimization of  preform die geometries. The process is modeled using finite element simulations and  potential defects in the heading process are analyzed using external and internal  crack criteria. The preform geometries are then optimized with respect to external  cracking in the blank and forming die load. The conventional Taguchi approach is  first applied on each criterion separately. Three optimal solutions are generated.  It is found that some parameters have conflicting optimal solutions. The single criterion approach is therefore extended to  multiple-criteria approaches by the use of overall evaluation criteria within the  Taguchi method. Two methodologies are proposed, namely, the additive utility  function method and the TOPSIS decision-making model. It is found that the  performances of the two methods are comparable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemes, J. A.

This  research program consisted of accelerated corrosion tests on eight prestressed  concrete prisms, measuring 127 x 127 x 2,060 mm, with three different levels of  prestress (0, 30, and 60% of the ultimate strength of prestressing strand). The aim  of the investigation was to simulate and monitor the corrosion of prestressing  strands in prestressed systems. The specimens were submerged in a saline solution  and subjected to an impressed constant voltage, aimed at accelerating the corrosion  of the strands. During the corrosion period, various electrochemical tests were  performed to monitor the corrosion activity as a function of elapsed time. Strains  at selected locations were measured regularly to check the instantaneous level of  prestress. At the end of the experiment, the prestressing strands were removed from  the concrete, visually inspected, and weighed. They were also tested in tension to  determine their residual tensile strength and their mode of failure. An assessment of the electrochemical results did not point to  any relationship between the initial levels of prestress and the corrosion activity.  A similar observation was made in verifying the effect of the initial level of  prestress on the corrosion activity as manifested in the residual tensile strength  of the strands or their final measured weights. This research program was therefore valuable to the practicing  engineer in the design and maintenance of durable prestressed concrete structures.  The findings confirmed that the risk and extent of corrosion in all prestressing  strands in corrosive environments are roughly similar, regardless of the initial  prestressing level.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mirza, M.

Large  feature size diffractive lenses are easily modeled using simple scalar diffraction  theory. However, as the feature size of diffractive lenses becomes smaller the  theoretical modeling of the systems becomes more complex; a rigorous diffractive  theory becomes necessary. This thesis will determine the difference in analyzing a  diffractive minilens with either a scalar or rigorous diffraction theory for a  free-space optical interconnect with fast Fresnel lenses. The analysis is done for  minilenses with f/# of 2.9 to 8. The results of the analysis show that there is a  great amount of non-uniformity in the diffraction efficiency. In particular, for  fast lenses, the diffraction efficiency dropped significantly from the center of the  lens to the outer edge of the lens. There was no significant polarization  sensitivity in the lenses. An experiment was conducted that supported the  theoretical results.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kirk, Andrew G.

Nevertheless, studying the evolution of the two arts as of  the seventeenth century, allows us to pinpoint and define the sources of  contamination. It is more precisely in the nineteenth century that the history of  both the Theater and the Novel became envenomed, going from fresh influences to  disloyal relations during which time the Theater faded by admitting romanesque  realism to take the stage. By denying its capacity to reveal the "real",  the Theater failed its possibilities and let its art be disinterested from the  theatricality showing all that should have been evoked. Men of theater participated  at recapturing the theatrical art so to regain confidence on stage and near 1950, an  avant-garde movement flourished to favor a renewal of vitality for the theater with  a new language which utilizes all of what the scene could provoke. This "New  Theater" is soon followed by a similar romanesque enterprise, the "New  Novel", a group of novelists also wishing to acknowledge the right to explore a  new style of writing.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv800.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk20f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French fiction -- 19th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>French drama -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>French drama -- 19th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>French fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870w49r"><dcterms:title>Monsters at the edges of the world : geography and rhetoric under the Roman empire</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Racine, Félix</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Descriptions of the edges of the Roman world were shaped by  social preoccupations and identity issues. Living in a newly unified Roman world,  the popularizing geographers of the early Empire (Strabo, Mela, Pliny) used  descriptions of fictional and remote people such as the utopian Hyperboreans, the  cannibal Scythians and the monstrous Dog-Heads to present customs and behaviors that  were utterly un-Roman. These rhetorical descriptions helped define Roman identity  through antithetical exempla. In contrast to this, the fifth and sixth centuries,  the anonymous authors of legends surrounding the figure of Saint Christopher  witnessed a crisis of Roman identity fostered by a new 'barbarian' presence within  the Empire and by the expansion of the Christian (i.e. Roman) faith outside of the  Empire. Their response was to tear down the ginary barrier between the Roman world  and fictional, remote people and to proclaim the forceful Christianization of  distant lands.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Digeser, Elizabeth (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv184.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w49r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rome</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geography, Ancient</dc:subject><dc:subject>Imaginary societies</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407x91h"><dcterms:title>The effects of structured teaching on stereotypic, on-task, and off-task behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorders in physical education /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Levidioti, Maria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effects of a gymnastic unit on stereotypic, on-task, and off  task behaviors of two children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and two  children with Down syndrome were examined using structured teaching, based on  adaptations by the TEACCH model.

Starting with a  review of Ashbery's critical reception, the thesis shows how Ashbery's poetry and  its reception are polarized in two major post-Romantic approaches to poetry: the  Romantic, and the "objectivist" tradition of modernism. Beginning with a  look at how Ashbery's early poetry reflects both paradigms, I focus on moments where  both are simultaneously active. I demonstrate how impressionism, as a sensibility  with certain methodological, epistemological, and technical concerns and devices  having to do with the conjunction of consciousness and the world in perception, best  describes the interaction between Ashbery's Romantic and modernist strains.  Impressionism helps us understand how Ashbery negotiates the Romantic desire for  resolutions to spiritual crises and the modernist focus on objects in and of  themselves by treating a searching attentiveness to those objects as a value in  itself.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hickman, Miranda (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j599.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666511g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ashbery, John -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708x16h"><dcterms:title>Rawls' Kantian egalitarianism and its critics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liotti, Maria Cecilia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis explores the role of the concept of equality in John  Rawls' theory of justice. Rawls argues that the Kantian idea of the moral equality  of persons translates into a primary principle of equal basic liberties, followed by  a principle of fair equality of opportunity that addresses the moral arbitrariness  of social and natural contingencies. Furthermore, the "difference  principle" specifies that social and economic inequalities are only justified  if they benefit the worst-off group. Libertarian critics such as Robert Nozick argue  that Rawls' "difference principle" is inconsistent with a Kantian respect  for the moral equality of persons as ends in themselves. Communitarians such as  Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor argue that Rawls' egalitarian commitments are not  supportable via a Kantian conception of the moral subject of justice as an  autonomous pre-social self. This thesis defends Rawls' theory of justice against  these challenges.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lu, Catherine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c8139.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x16h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social justice.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rawls, John, 1921-2002.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848r194"><dcterms:title>Le discours sur la fin de la littérature en France de 1987 à 1994 /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fahmy, Miriam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The "essai crepusculaire" was one of the most popular  literary genres during the 1980's and 1990's in France.

Our project consists of an analysis of the argumentative  rhetoric contained in the four essays of our corpus, which together form the  Discourse on the death of French literature. We studied how the authors set up an  argumentative construct likely to convince the reader that French literature has  fallen into decay. By analysing the rhetorical processes as well as locating the  tacit discourse, we sought to single out the ideology which they promote and to make  out the contours of the literary ideal which they delineate. In light of these  observations, we ended with the broad outline of a typology of the genre, liable to  exemplify all "essais crepusculaires".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angenot, Marc (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xm42z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r194</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Criticism -- France</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602123n"><dcterms:title>The Shīʻī passion : Taʻzī yeh, tragedy and the sublime</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Empey, Heather</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a study of ta`ziyeh , or the Shi`i passion play  commemorating the martyrdom of Husayn b. `Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.  The goal of the work is to provide an aesthetic evaluation of the plays and their  tragic and sublime aspects. It begins with a discussion of the historical  development of ta` ziyeh and its most important theatrical features. This is  followed by an interpretation of ta`ziyeh using Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of  Tragedy as a guide. Nietzsche's work on tragedy has not been chosen to equate the  Persian plays with Greek theatre, but rather to show how ta` ziyeh embodies certain  tragic ideals proposed by the German philosopher. In its final section, the thesis  extrapolates from Nietzsche to highlight two important aesthetic aspects of the  passion plays: the central role of Husayn in the cosmological drama of Shi`ism, and  the sublime nature of ta`ziyeh. Thus, this work tries to compare ta`ziyeh to certain  Western conceptions of art, while maintaining that the Persian passion plays are  representative of Shi`ism's vital aesthetic dimension.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ormsby, Eric (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh002.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602123n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Taʻziyah</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
