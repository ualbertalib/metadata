It is thus situated outside the cambium which is the living tissue of a growing tree. The anatomical structure of bark is rather complex but in general it can be said that the bark tissue is composed of different kinds of cella, such as sieve, longitudinal parenchyma, ray parenchyma, fiber cella, etc., some of which are also typical of the wood tissue. The physiological function of these tissue elememts in the bark is mainly concerned with the translocation and storage of solutes. As the tree matures, the outermost layers of the bark are broken and die by exposure and especially by the stoppage of food and water supplies. This layer is commonly referred to as the outer bark as opposed to the active tissue beneath it which is termed, inner bark or phloem. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

The basic observation is the Ditchburn-Riggs effect obtained with stabilized images. Stabilized images of simple visual objects, like straight lines, disappear and reappear rapidly from time to time. Pritchard, Heron, and Hebb (1960) observed that stabilized images of complex figures disappear and reappear in a meaningful fashion. McKinney (1963) demonstrated a similar phenomenon with luminous figures in the darkroom. He observed that luminous figures also tend to disappear and reappear like stabilized images. McKinney showed that there are more disappearances when the figure is steadily viewed than when the eyes are moved along the figures. In a recent paper, Hart (1964) reported that disappearance is greater at the fixation point than at other points. Cohen (1961) found that a stabilized line seemed to disappear less when seen with an adjacent parallel line than when seen alone. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Donderi, D.

Taxonomy is therefore, one of the oldest fields of biological science; because in order to classify, even at the most elementary levels, man had to identify organisms. This necessitated observing, and making comparisons, integrating specific data and developing generalizations from these. Since this is the case, one may suggest that taxonomy is an outdated science, as almost everything has been named and 'pigeon-holed' already. It must be borne in mind, however, that early scientists were merely concerned with writing descriptions and giving names, while in modern days taxonomists are interested in more than describing and naming species.

Au cours d'une récente invasion, qui a débuté en 1956, des travaux de recherches ont été entrepris à la fois sur la biologie, l'écologie et la répression de ce ravageur. Ces recherches s'imposaient premiaèrement pour connaître le cycle évolutif et la biologie générale de l'insecte sous les conditions climatiques du Québec, études qui n'avaient jamais été entreprises auparavant et, deuxièmement  pour connaître le comportement des populations naturelles en mesurant leurs fluctuations saisonnières et en essayant de déterminer les facteurs responsables de ces fluctuations. Ces connaissances dans leur ensemble s'avéraient fondamentales tant pour enrayer de façon méthodique les pullulations actuelles de l'insecte que pour essayer de prévoir et de prévenir les invasions futures.

Its main point is that a certain amount of productive land supports an urban center, and the center exists because essential services must be performed for the surrounding land (25:203). Theoretically, a hierarchy of such centers exists, ranging from hamlets to metropolises with their distribution throughout a region following an hexagonal pattern. Many of Christaller's basic premises have been subatantiated by the work of numerous geographers (11, 25:203). Most of these works, however, have been carried out in regions of fairly uniform conditions of topography, climate, agricultural economy, and cultural background. Consequently, it is generally admitted that lack of uniformity in any of those conditions can modify the basic pattern (25:207). To the eyes of the cultural geographer, the emphasis on economic factors relegates unduly on the background important cultural factors. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hills, T.

Since there are no corporate kin groups in North American society (except perhaps among certain minority groups) the second approach must be used by those interested in North American kinship. This means essentially the examination of the nature and extent of Ego's relationships with kin. Most recent theorists in the United States have denied that relatives are of any importance in North American society, and have stressed the isolation of the nuclear family, basing these statements on the demands of a democratic, urbanized and highly industrialized society.

On the one hand, clinical pain is characterized by its persistence, its high intensity which may fluctuate over time, and the fear aroused in the patient concerning its origin. The principal sources of laboratory pain, on the other hand, have been pin prick, pinch, electric shock and thermal radiation: all of very short duration. Procedures in human experiments involve reaction time measurements, behavioral or verbal avoidance responses, or introspective estimates of magnitude. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Melzack, R.
