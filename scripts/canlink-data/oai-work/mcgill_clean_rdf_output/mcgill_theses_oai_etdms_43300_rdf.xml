It begins with a critical  examination of the work of Michael Smith, notably his book The Moral Problem, which  leaves out of consideration the notion of moral experience. I treat Smith as  representative of those working within what I call "the traditional  meta-ethical framework," which is characterized by the assumption that moral  knowledge, if it exists, is available, in principle, from any perspective. Within  that framework, Smith's philosophy stands out as a model of clarity and forceful  argument. I consider and develop some objections to his program from within the  traditional framework. However, the latter part of the thesis is critical of the  framework itself. Against it, I argue that moral knowledge is only available from a  certain perspective, namely, the perspective of the virtuous agent. It is by coming  to perceive or see things from this perspective that the right things will matter to  us. In other words, I argue that we cannot hope for the impartial body of knowledge  promised by the traditional framework where the things that ought to matter are  supposed to be capable of codification or otherwise understandable across  perspectives. In this regard I examine a number of philosophers who are sympathetic  to the idea of moral perception, notably, Jonathan Dancy, John McDowell, Iris  Murdoch, and David Wiggins. Finally, I consider the recent debate between Robert  Brandom and John McDowell on the nature of perceptual experience in order to assess  just how rich a notion of experience is required in order to make sense of moral  knowledge based on moral perception.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r363w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171x72b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Smith, Michael (Michael A.)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ethics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870w36p"><dcterms:title>Molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis transmission</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kulaga, Sophie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We conducted a molecular epidemiologic study of tuberculosis  (TB) transmission during the years 1996--98 on the Island of Montreal. By combining  public health data on the 528 reported cases with IS6110 DNA fingerprints for 430,  we detected an overall low frequency of transmission manifesting as secondary cases  of active disease. We also identified an important sub-group of TB patients who  harbour isolates with matching patterns. Depending on the matching criterion used we  attributed between 6% (95% CI: 4, 9%) and 22% (95% CI: 18, 27%) of TB cases to  recent transmission; the vast majority of active TB disease reflects infection  acquired at an earlier time and/or a different place. However, Haitian-born TB  patients yielded a disproportionately high frequency of isolates belonging to  matching "clusters" (21%; 95% CI: 13, 32%), while, other foreign-born  patients have disproportionately low numbers of clustered isolates (5%; 95% CI: 3,  9%). The classical interpretation of such results is that there is  more ongoing transmission within this immigrant sub-group. We explored an  alternative hypothesis: that M. tuberculosis isolates from Haitian-born patients  demonstrate reduced genetic diversity reflecting TB transmission patterns in their  previously isolated country of origin---hence that a bacterial founder effect  accounts for the higher frequency of matching fingerprints. Using a recently  introduced measure of fingerprint similarity, genetic distance, we assessed the  extent of pattern diversity. The median nearest genetic distance (NGD) was 130  months (inter-quartile range (IQR): 98--201 months) among the 47 distinct isolates  from Haitian-born patients; among the non-Haitian foreign-born, the median NGD for  the 191 distinct isolates was 128 months (IQR: 103--170 months). Hence the overall  genetic heterogeneity of M. tuberculosis organisms among Haitian-born Montrealers  was as great as that among a group of patients born in 70 other countries. Local  transmission among the Haitian-born remains the most likely  scenario. We demonstrated that a continuous measure, such as genetic  distance, may also permit researchers to address a challenge to the interpretation  of M. tuberculosis molecular typing results: how to determine whether highly  similar, non-identical fingerprint patterns in fact reflect underlying  "matches." The distribution of NGD for isolates initially classified as  identical (10--27 months), similar (15--108 months) and unique (40--244 months)  suggested a possible cut-point of 40 months. Use of this cut-point labelled 19% of  isolates as "clustered", suggesting that 14% of Montreal TB cases  reflected transmission during the study period.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schwartzman, Kevin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sd263.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w36p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qs45r"><dcterms:title>The p53 CODON 72 polymorphism and risk of pre-invasive cervical neoplasia /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Koushik, Anita</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Introduction. The Arg/Arg genotype vs. Arg/Pro or Pro/ Pro at  codon 72 of the p53 gene has been implicated in increasing susceptibility of the  cervix to the action of human papillomaviruses (HPV) and thus altering cancer risk.  However, research on this topic has been contentious. Meta-analysis and  meta-regression analysis, included as part of this project, revealed that studies  where departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed tended to report  higher odds ratios (OR). In fact, several methodological and study design choices  can contribute to such departures. The primary purpose of this study was to address  potential methodological limitations and examine the role of this polymorphism in  the risk of cervical neoplasia. Study design. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the relevant  peer-reviewed literature; Case-control, Case-only. Methodology. Cases were women with histologically-confirmed  high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Controls were women with a  normal cervical cytology recruited from clinics affiliated with the hospitals where  cases were enrolled. From each woman, a cervical specimen was obtained for HPV  testing and p53 genotyping, and a self-administered questionnaire was completed.  Genotype was determined by two methods: TaqMan and DNA sequencing. The potential for  population stratification was assessed using information on the race of both parents  of each subject. Results. The genotype distribution among controls was in  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium overall (p = 0.77) and when stratified by race. A slight  increased risk due to Arg/Arg vs. other genotypes was observed (race-adjusted OR of  1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0--2.0). When restricted to high-risk  HPV-positive subjects, results were similar in magnitude to the whole study  population (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.6--3.1). The effect of genotype was not strongly  modified by HPV type or intratypic variants. However, stratification by race was  suggestive of heterogeneity. Conclusion. In this study, attempts were made to minimize  selection bias, population stratification and misclassification of  genotype---factors that may have led to bias in other studies. The results indicate  that the p53 codon 72 polymorphism influences the risk of pre-invasive cervical  neoplasia only slightly. However, further research may reveal if the polymorphism  has a stronger influence on the risk of invasive cervical cancer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franco, Eduardo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v360t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs45r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avt150j72v"><dcterms:title>Ranking hospitals according to acute myorcardial infarction mortality : do the methods matter?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kosseim, Mylène</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Hospital performance indicators serve as a mechanism  for making health care providers accountable to their patients. One indicator  adopted by several jurisdictions is hospital mortality rates among patients with  acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite potentially serious repercussions poor  results can have on how a hospital is judged, there remains considerable variation  in the methods used to measure and compare this indicator. The purpose of this study  is to estimate the extent to which methods used to define AMI mortality outcomes and  to deal with transferred AMI patients impact on hospital performance  ratings. Methods. Using Quebec's Med-Echo hospital discharge records and  vital statistics for 91,633 AMI patients admitted between 1992 and 1999, hospital  rankings were compared using three methods to define AMI mortality outcome  (in-hospital death, death within 7 days of admission, and death within 30 days of  admission) and using three methods to handle transfers (excluding all transfers,  including transfers while assigning the outcome to the initial hospital, and  including transfers while assigning the outcome to the receiving  hospital). Findings. There was discordance in hospital quintile  classification 34% to 43% of the time when using pairwise comparisons of outcomes,  and 23% to 32% of the time when using pairwise comparisons of ways to deal with  transfers. Using hospital ranks to identify significant outliers as a method for  evaluating hospitals, 5 hospitals were identified as "best performers" at  least once, whereas 11 hospitals were identified "worst performers" at  least once. One hospital was among the "worst performers" regardless of  which among the six hierarchical analyses was used, while another was among the  "best" using all but one analysis. The absolute difference in  significantly high or low hospital mortality rates exceeded the clinically relevant  benchmark of 1%. Conclusions. The methods used to define AMI mortality outcome,  or to deal with transfers had an impact on which hospitals were identified as  "outliers". Hospital reputations can be damaged by such findings.  Furthermore, although this study was limited to comparing the impact on rankings  based on AMI hospital mortality rates, other indicators of hospital performance may  be influenced to a greater degree based on the methods used to deal with transferred  patients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mayo, Nancy E.

To better  understand the neurobiology of apoE, the work included in this thesis has focused on  some of the key relationships apoE holds with some proteins known or suggested to  have a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. The H2 allele of apolipoprotein  C-I is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine the possibility of a  direct role for apoC-I in AD, we compared apoC-I and apoE protein and mRNA levels in  post-mortem specimens of frontal cortex and hippocampus from AD patients with levels  in non-demented controls. We were able to confirm apoC-I expression in the CNS and  identify astrocytes as the source of apoC-I. In addition, we revealed differences in  apoC-I expression based on location in the brain, genotype and disease status that  may reflect a role for apoC-I in the pathogenesis of AD. Lipoproteins are only  efficient if able to access their target cells. ApoER2 is one of the major receptors  for ApoE in the brain, and has been shown to be involved not only in lipoprotein  endocytosis, but also in various cellular functions such as signalling and cellular  guidance. By performing an entorhinal cortex lesion, a model of synaptic plasticity,  in mice which express a decreasing number of copies of the apoER2 gene, we  investigated the implication of a deficiency of this particular receptor in response  to damage. Our results clearly indicate a role for apoER2 in maintaining efficient  synaptic plasticity. We have also used the same synaptic plasticity model to compare  the reactivity of various proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease, in wild-type  C57Bl/6J and apoE-knockout mice.

This is caused by a deletion in the  promoter/enhancer region of the quaking gene. The quaking gene is alternatively  spliced, producing QUAKING isoforms that differ in their C-terminal 8--30 amino acid  sequence. The QKI-5 isoform is nuclear, whereas the QKI-6 and QKI-7 isoforms are  predominantly cytoplasmic. The QKI isoforms contain a single KH RNA-binding domain  suggesting a role in RNA metabolism. Although the dysmyelinating phenotype of the  mutant mouse suggests a role in myelination, the function of the protein still  remains unknown. The goal of this thesis is to characterize the possible functions  of the quaking protein. We first explored the ability of the QKI-7 isoform to induce  apoptosis in fibroblast cells and confirmed this event in oligodendrocytes, where  most of the QUAKING isoforms are present. We mapped the domain responsible for this  event to the alternatively spliced C-terminus, which we named 'KILLER' sequence.  Heterodimerization of the other QKI isoforms with QKI-7 causes its relocalization  into the nucleus, suppressing its ability to induce apoptosis. Therefore we  hypothesize that the balance between the different isoforms dictates whether the  cell will live or die. We were also interested in finding a RNA binding substrate  for this protein, therefore we looked at potential proteins that are altered in the  quaking viable mouse. We found that the mRNA myelin basic protein (MBP) is in fact a  target for the QKI proteins. We show that this interaction occurs through the 3'-UTR  of MBP, in a 110 nucleotide region named QRE for Quaking Responsive Element. In  addition, we have recreated a defect of the quaking viable phenotype by  over-expressing QKI-5 into the brain of mice. This causes retention of the MBP mRNA  into the nucleus of oligodendrocytes. As a result, MBP expression is significantly  reduced.

An important aspect of structural  optimization pertains to the conditions under which the loads are applied. Problems  in which the applied load is single and deterministic are well documented in the  literature, whereas those in which the load is deterministic but varying,  stochastic, or uncertain have been less studied. Although methods of structural  optimization under single-loading conditions can be extended to multiple-loading  cases, the computational burden imposed by these methods is often extremely high, to  the point of becoming inapplicable. In this thesis, a novel approach is introduced. We first propose  the use of the concept of stiffness ellipsoid, whose boundary defines the field of  displacements of a structure subject to a load with a constant magnitude, but  applied in an arbitrary direction. Based on the study of the stiffness ellipsoid, an  optimality criterion that determines the worst case of the structure subject to a  load with a given magnitude, but applied in an arbitrary direction, is proposed. The  underlying ideas are applied to the structural optimization of the roller-carrying  disk of a novel class of cam-follower speed-reduction devices---Speed-o-Cam (SoC).  The optimum structures obtained in this thesis are compared with the existing  prototype, which was designed using established design criteria only. Results  indicate an improvement of almost twice the stiffness with a mass reduction of 40%  of the original prototype. Also reported in the thesis is a novel algorithm of mesh  generation, named the contour mesh generation algorithm (CMGA). The CMGA, based on  the concept of penalty functions, is applied throughout the examples given in the  thesis and shows a great advantage in solving structural optimization  problems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fp43r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0646620</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999719j"><dcterms:title>The monocytic Leukemia zinc finger protein MOZ and its related factor MORF /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Nadine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Regulation of chromatin structure involves histone modifications  such as acetylation. Since 1996, the identification and characterization of histone  acetyltransferases have had tremendous impact on our understanding of the molecular  mechanisms related to eukaryotic gene regulation and human diseases associated with  abnormal chromatin functions. The MYST family of histone acetyltransferases is very  interesting because of their various biological functions. In agreement with the  correlation between aberrant histone acetylation and cancer, the MYST family  proteins MOZ and MORF are linked to leukemogenesis. Identification and characterization of a gene encoding a novel  histone acetyltransferase were the goals of this thesis project. Human MORF gene was  cloned and the encoded protein, MORF, was shown to be very similar to MOZ.  Biochemical studies demonstrated that both MOZ and MORF possess intrinsic histone  acetyltransferase activities. The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of MOZ and  MORF contain transcriptional repression and activation domains,  respectively. Runx2, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, binds to the  activation domains of MOZ and MORF and thus recruits them to the osteocalcin  promoter for transcriptional activation. TAZ, a WW-domain transcriptional  coactivator of Runx2, potentiates the transcriptional activation of the osteocalcin  promoter by MOZ and Runx2. Interestingly, treatment of cells with PMA enhances the  synergy between MOZ and TAZ in activating the osteocalcin promoter. Consistent with  this, PMA treatment strengthens the interaction of Runx2 with MOZ and  TAZ. This study, therefore, identified the histone acetyltransferase  MORF and demonstrated that MOZ and MORF are transcriptional coactivators, thus  providing new insights into how histone acetyltransferases are implicated in cell  differentiation and leukemogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yang, Xiang-Jiao (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q686q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999719j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128b42v"><dcterms:title>The interaction of the glycoprotein folding sensor, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, with glycoprotein substrates /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Taylor, Sean Caldwell</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides a  specialized environment to assure the folding and oligomerization of secretory  proteins to their native conformations.

In the nearly 100 years since  those first lines were built, the progressive collapse of large numbers of  structures has been a continuing problem. These large progressive collapses are  known today as cascades. While not all structural failures result in cascades,  longitudinal cascades begin with a failure in the structural system that maintains  tension in the overhead wires. These failures are represented most simply by a  broken wire. Broken wires cause dynamic loads on the towers much higher than the  intact wire tensions. This research tests the hypothesis that adding supplemental  springs and mechanical dampers to electric transmission towers can help control the  dynamic forces on towers that lead to cascades. Two new methods of incorporating  springs and dampers into towers were invented: the "post spring-damper"  and the "rotating crossarm spring-damper." A case study modeling a typical  230 kV line using the finite element dynamics program ADINA (ADINA 2003) was used to  test these two new methods. Both the post spring-damper and the rotating crossarm  spring-damper proved to be effective.

Almost all the existing papers report on  equal transmission rate systems, while little attention has been given to the  multi-rate case. In fact, the first multi-rate echo canceller structure was  developed by Ho et al., and has always been referred since. In this thesis, two sets of simplified techniques are developed.  The first one reports on a fast initialization technique of the echo canceller. The  method consists of replacing the first least mean square (LMS) iteration of the echo  channel estimate by the solution of a system cost function in which circular  convolution is assumed. The simplification of the method resides in the fact that no  known sequence is used, and thus, no protocol is required. The second simplified technique developed aims to reduce the  computational complexity of the multi-rate echo canceller structure at the lower  transmit rate side of the link, e.g. the line terminal side in ADSL. In this case,  the echo canceller located in the terminal, processes the signals in the entire  frequency bandwidth (higher rate). During the processing, the echo channel that is  estimated corresponds in fact to the imperfect hybrid channel combined with the  lowpass filtering action of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the  time-domain equalizer(TEQ). In such a situation, the frequency taps representing the  estimated echo channel decay rapidly above the cutoff frequency of the DAC filter.  In this work, we exploit this specific structure of the echo channel to reduce the  computational complexity of the echo cancellation processing by setting a portion of  the high frequency echo tap coefficients to zero, and by exploiting certain  properties of the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) algorithm. Experimental simulations for an ADSL-like configuration  involving 32 tones on the upstream and 256 tones on the downstream, showed that by  employing the new proposed approach, the computational complexity can be reduced by  a factor of as much as 53% while at the same time improving the achievable bitrate  by 35 kbps. Furthermore, in regards of the initialization technique, the echo  channel estimate convergence can be reached after around 6 iterations as compared to  15 for usual LMS algorithm.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw37k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z29d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x451p"><dcterms:title>Seismic analysis of steel frame wood panel shear walls</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boudreault, Félix-Antoine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The use of steel frame/wood panel shear walls as a seismic force  resisting system (SFRS) in residential and/or commercial buildings is expected to  increase in the future. At the moment, in Canada, however, no specific guidelines in  line with the seismic provisions of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC)  exist with which the engineer can design a building consisting of these shear walls.  An extensive research program has therefore been undertaken at McGill University to  develop a design method through the testing of different configurations of steel  frame/wood panel shear walls loaded with monotonic and reversed cyclic protocols. A  total of 16 wall configurations (109 walls) were tested over the course of the  study. The CUREE Ordinary Ground Motions loading protocol was selected to represent  the reversed cyclic regime because it was found to best correspond to the demand  that would be imposed on a steel frame I wood panel shear wall during a typical  seismic event. The analysis of test results in order to extract the principal  design information was carried out using an Equivalent Energy Elastic-Plastic (EEEP)  model. A ductility related (Rd) and an overstrength related (Ro) force modification  factor are required for the calculation of equivalent static seismic loads following  the 2005 NBCC design provisions. Values of Ro = 1.8 and Rd = 2.5 have been  determined and are recommended on a preliminary basis. The Stewart hysteretic model was found to best represent the  strength and stiffness characteristics of a steel frame/wood panel shear wall  component. The subsequent evaluation of building models that incorporate the Stewart  model using non-linear time history dynamic analyses could then be carried out to  validate the assumptions made by the EEEP method on the system ductility and the  corresponding force modification factors.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pq83q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x451p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av979v364x"><dcterms:title>Who manages home garden agrobiodiversity? : patterns of species distribution, planting material flow and knowledge transmission along the Corrientes River of the Peruvian Amazon</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Perrault-Archambault, Mathilde</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Agrobiodiversity constitutes an essential resource for  traditional rural populations.

We report the development of a process yielding hydrogen from natural gas that  generates no green house gases and thus meets the Kyoto accord  targets. In this process, natural gas is treated in a dielectric barrier  discharge (DBD) yielding hydrogen and solid carbon according to the following  reaction: CH4 (g) → 2H2 (g) + C (s). The direct cracking of the hydrocarbon  is possible if the natural gas is injected in the plasma zone, created by the  presence of a dielectric ceramic material. It was found that the dielectric material plays an important  role on plasma intensity. The change in ceramic properties affects the parameters of  the discharge. It was discovered that the number of micro-discharges increased when  a ceramic with a higher dielectric constant was used. Furthermore, the ceramic  relative permittivity or dielectric constant has a direct influence on the hydrogen  yield. However, the challenge is that when using a commercial high  dielectric ceramic as barrier they tend to break in the plasma environment. In the  attempt of improving the process efficiency medium permittivity dielectric ceramics  (9 &lt; K' &lt;166) were fabricated and successfully tested in the discharge  reactor. A broad variety of ceramics (from low to high permittivity) were tested and  the results suggested that the CH4 conversion using high dielectric constant barrier  is much higher than using conventional barrier material such as  A12O3.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts17b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk12r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p086p"><dcterms:title>Investigation of an integrated optical detection system for fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Malic, Lidija</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the design and fabrication of a  miniaturized optical detection system for sensing in microchannels, based on  integrated optical waveguide technology, which allows the implementation of both  absorption and fluorescence measurement schemes and which can be potentially  integrated into a Lab-on-a-chip system.

They are crucial for assuring appropriate timing and  sequence of ventricle contraction and play an important role in cardiac  arrhythmogenesis, largely via abnormalities in repolarization. Little work has been  done to define the molecular electrophysiology of cardiac Purkinje cells (PCs). The  primary hypothesis of this thesis was that PCs have unique molecular determinants of  repolarization. The specific objectives were to characterize the repolarizing  currents in isolated canine PCs, to clarify the molecular basis for these currents  and to study role of PC current remodeling in a cardiac disease state. To achieve  these goals, we used approaches at three different levels: the cellular level (with  microelectrode techniques), the ionic level (with whole-cell patch clamp techniques)  and molecular level (with competitive RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and  immunocytochemistry). We first optimized PC isolation techniques, which allowed us to  characterize repolarizing currents and to visualize channel protein distribution by  immunolocalization in cardiac PCs. We then characterized an important repolarizing  current, the transient outward current (Ito) in canine PCs. We found that Purkinje  Ito has some unique properties compared to those of atrial and ventricular Ito,  suggesting a different molecular basis. We therefore characterized the expression of  alpha-subunits encoding Ito-like currents and the K+-channel interacting protein 2  (KChIP2) beta-subunit. We demonstrated important differences in the expression of  Kv3.4; encoding a TEA-sensitive Ito channel, and of KChIP2, that might play an  important role in the specific molecular composition of Purkinje Ito. We also  characterized another important repolarizing current, the delayed rectifier (IK)  that had been reported to be absent or small in PCs. We found that I K·  in PCs has properties typical of those observed in other regions of the heart; and  IK channel subunits ERG, KvLQT1 and minK were more sparsely expressed in PCs than in  ventricular muscle (VM), potentially explaining the tendency of PCs to generate  arrhythmias due to abnormal repolarization. We also noted important differences in  the expression of the Ca2+-channel subunits (Cav1.2, Cav3.1, 3.2 and 3.3), the  Na+/Ca2+-exchanger subunit NCX1 and the hyperpolarization-activated channel subunits  HCN1, 2 and 4. Studies in human PCs confirmed that some of the unique PC ionic  properties observed in dogs are also present in man. Finally, we showed that an  experimental cardiac disease paradigm (congestive heart failure) causes  characteristic ionic remodeling in PCs that may explain their role in potentially  lethal arrhythmias associated with heart failure. Our findings support the hypothesis of a unique and important  molecular basis for the control of repolarization in cardiac PCs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nattel, Stanley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623hz248.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j73c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407x85c"><dcterms:title>Molecular and functional characterization of NR2 subunits of teleost NMDA receptors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Harvey-Girard, Erik</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Synaptic processing is essential for proper signal integration  by sensory neurons. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are ionotropic receptors  located at the post-synaptic membrane. NMDARs are considered coincidence detectors  because they need postsynaptic depolarisation and neurotransmitter release to open.  Several extracellular and intracellular signalling molecules affect NMDARs, which  leads to modulation of the synaptic strength. The work presented in this thesis  describes sequences of NR2 subunits expressed in pyramidal cells of a sensory system  in a gymnotiform fish and analyses the functions of recombinant  NMDAR-2B. A rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE) approach was modified to  amplify three NMDAR NR2 subunits expressed in electrosensory lateral line (ELL)  pyramidal cells of a weakly electric fish, the gymnotiform Apteronotus leptorhynchus  . The amino acid sequence of the NR2 subunits (aptNR2A/B/C) was  determined and compared with the sequence of the murine NR2 subunits. This  comparison revealed high levels of sequence conservation throughout the  glutamate-binding domain and membrane spanning segments. Lower levels of sequence  conservation in the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains (ATD and CTD) were found for  the three subunits. However, several known regulation sites in the ATD and several  serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the CTD are  conserved. The functional properties of the apteronotid NMDAR-2B receptor  were examined by co-expression of aptNR1 and aptNR2B in HEK293 cells. The  recombinant aptNR1/NR2B receptors produced robust currents after stimulation with  glycine and glutamate or NMDA. Electrophysiological measurements of the  concentration dependencies for these agonists indicated that the agonist-binding  sites on the apteronotid receptors are highly conserved, with agonist affinities  nearly identical to those of the murine NMDAR-2B. The classical antagonist AP-V and  hydrogen ions inhibit the fish NMDAR-2B similarly as they do for mammalian NMDAR-2B.  The response kinetics of the fish receptor were also highly conserved, with  deactivation rates for the aptNMDAR-2B receptor matching those of its murine  homologue. Apteronotid and murine NMDA receptors displayed two functional  differences. First, the voltage-dependent Mg++ block is slightly reduced. Second,  the affinity of specific non-competitive antagonist ifenprodil for NR2B is also  reduced. These results suggest that the critical features of NMDAR  structure and function were established before the evolutionary diversion of fish  and higher vertebrates. They suggest also that several signalling mechanisms known  to affect synaptic strength in the mammalian CNS are conserved in the apteronotid  nervous system and have established the electrosensory system of gymnotiforms as an  interesting model to study NMDAR functions in synaptic plasticity of a sensory  system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunn, Robert J.

Experimental results show that the solubility  of gold and copper is significant, increasing at higher fHCl and fH2O for gold, and  at higher fH2O for copper. These increases are attributed to the formation of  hydrated gas species, with a metal:chlorine ratio of 1. Hydration numbers vary from  5 at 300°C to 3 at 360°C for gold, and from 7.6 at 280°C, to  6.0 at 300°C, and 6.1 at 320°C for copper; the results reflect the  presence of trimer [Cu3Cl3•(H2O)n] or tetramer [Cu4Cl4•(H2O)n]  species. Results indicate that solubility for both vapour species is retrograde,  i.e., it decreases with increasing temperature, and formed via the reactions:  Ausolid+m·HClgas+n·H2 Ogas=AuClm·H2 Ogasn+m 2·Hgas2  3CuClsolid+n·H2Ogas= Cu3Cl3·H2O gasn Calculations based on the solubility data indicate an economic  high-sulphidation Au deposit (e.g., Nansatsu, Japan; 36 tonnes) could form in  ~30,000 years, whereas a porphyry copper deposit (e.g., 50 million tonnes at  0.5% Cu) could form in as little as ~20,500 years, assuming transport only  in the vapour phase. Precious- and base-metal-rich composite scales, containing up to  111 ppm Au and 628 ppm Ag, occur in surface pipes at the Momotombo geothermal field,  Nicaragua. Polysulphide scale fragments, comprising chalcopyrite, sphalerite,  galena, electrum and hessite grains in a matrix of amorphous silica, formed as a  result of cooling and ligand loss induced by boiling, during fluid ascent in well  MT-36. Secondary bornite, stromeyerite and chalcocite/digenite replaced chalcopyrite  through the addition of Cu and Ag and an increase in fO2 . A drop in pH due to well  closure resulted in replacement of primary and secondary sulphides by  tetrahedrite. Reaction-path modelling using the program CHILLER simulates  deposition of minerals from the reconstructed deep geothermal fluid, at temperature  intervals (depths) along excess enthalpy and isoenthalpic boiling paths. These  simulations accurately reproduce the paragenetic sequence of base- and  precious-metal mineralization in the scales. The modelling indicates excess enthalpy  boiling results in metal precipitation at greater depths than would be expected for  isoenthalpic boiling, and that at Momotombo this occurs through the destabilisation  of bisulphide complexes in response to loss of CO2 and H2 S during phase  separation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams-Jones, A.

Whilst wind loads are covered comprehensively in the literature  and in design standards, ice loads and rules for combination of wind speed on  ice-covered-structures are still in development. The main difficulty in achieving a  design that meets a target reliability level as specified in design codes is the  uncertainty in the temporal and spatial variation of ice accretion. Due to the lack  of sufficient direct field measurements, empirical models are usually utilized in  combination with meteorological data to estimate the intensity of ice accumulation  at specific locations. A unique database of direct measurements on ice accumulation is  available in Quebec. More than 20 years of observations from a network of 180  Passive Ice Meters (PIM) are available throughout the province. The objective of  this study is to analyze this data set in order to improve existing regional design  criteria and for better understanding of the atmospheric icing phenomena in Quebec.  The research is limited to the study of glaze ice, which occurs in conjunction with  freezing precipitation. Firstly, several extreme-value statistical models are  investigated to determine the best one or ones for describing the intensity of glaze  ice accumulation. In order to increase the sample size, an event-based model, in  which every icing event is counted as an independent event, is adopted. Twelve  probability distribution functions are examined. The distributions are compared on  the basis of the overall fit to the data and the sampling characteristics of the  right tail of the distributions. No single distribution fits the data perfectly at  all stations. However, the three-parameter distributions, and in particular, the  Pearson type III, Generalized Pareto, Generalized Normal, and Generalized  Extreme-Value distributions are the best on average. The commonly used Gumbel  distribution is consistently outperformed by the three-parameter  distributions. Secondly, a reliability-based procedure is proposed for the  analysis of the combined wind and ice loads and in particular for associated  pressure on overhead transmission lines. Finally, a procedure for the spatial  interpolation of design criteria is investigated. Spatial interpolations of the  design ice thickness for a 50-years return period is performed using Kriging.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chouinard, Luc (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw394.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rk83c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zr24w"><dcterms:title>Respiratory and systemic health of apprentice-welders : a prospective study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Occupational Health</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>El-Zein, Mariam</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is a result of an epidemiological prospective  cohort study carried out among apprentice welders at four vocational teaching  institutions in welding profession in the Montreal region, for the purpose of: (1)  assessing the respiratory health of students, before starting welding, such as  respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma, lung function and bronchial  responsiveness as well as immunological sensitization to common allergens and to  metals; (2) providing a reassessment of the respiratory health of these same  students as well as an assessment of the incidence of systemic symptoms suggestive  of metal fume fever (MFF) after being exposed to welding fumes; (3) estimating the  association between MFF and the incidence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)  and/or the presence of welding-related respiratory symptoms suggestive of  occupational asthma (OA); (4) determining whether atopy, immunological sensitization  to metals encountered in the welding environment, smoking and a personal history of  asthma, are associated with an increased level of BHR or welding-related respiratory  symptoms suggestive of OA; and (5) determining the relationship between exposure to  metal oxide fumes and the outcome variables, i.e., MFF, immunological sensitization  to metals, welding-related respiratory symptoms suggestive of OA and  BHR. The undertaken study consisted of an initial pre-exposure  assessment survey and two follow-up reassessment surveys that took place between  September 1998 and June 2001. During these surveys a series of tests were carried  out. These included a respiratory symptom questionnaire as well as a systemic  symptom questionnaire, skin prick tests, spirometry and methacholine challenge  tests. Industrial hygiene sampling for welding fumes in the breathing zone of these  students was also performed. The overall results of the epidemiological study are  presented in three interrelated manuscripts. The first manuscript describes in detail the underlying  methodology. In addition, it provides incidence figures, which are lacking in the  reviewed literature, for the outcomes of interest described afterwards. The second  manuscript determined the incidence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and the  increase in airway obstruction from baseline values. The third manuscript confirmed  our earlier findings (1) of a strong association between welding-related MFF and  welding-related respiratory symptoms suggestive of OA.

Four commercial grades of isotactic PP (PP1--PP4) were investigated. The  first three resins differed principally in isotacticity levels, which were 94.8%,  98.6%, and 99.5%, and the fourth resin had molecular weight and isotacticity levels  similar to those of PP2, but differed in crystallization behavior. The four iPP  resins were extruded and cast under similar conditions. The severity of the cooling  was varied for PP4. The cast films were stretched on the laboratory film stretcher,  that simulates closely the stretching conditions encountered in the industrial  tenter-frame stretching process. The morphology of the cast films and the final  stretched films was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and  wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The reflection technique was used for the X-ray  measurements. Finally, the mechanical and optical properties of the films were  determined, and the results were correlated with the film morphology and  orientation. The effects of drawing temperature, stretching ratio, strain rate,  initial morphology, and chain tacticity on deformation behavior, stretched film  morphology, and end-film properties were studied, and correlations were  sought. Simultaneous equibiaxial stretching was found to be homogeneous  for sufficiently high deformation rates ( 3˙H &gt; 0.1 s-1). The stiffness  and the thermal stability of the crystallites played an important role in  deformation behavior. In fact, the biaxial yield stress showed linear dependence on  the crystallite size. Upon simultaneous equibiaxial deformation, crystallinity and  especially orientation increased, while crystallite size decreased. The isotacticity  content was found to influence greatly the thermal stability of the initial  morphology. Increasing isotacticity leads to an increase in DSC melting peak  temperature of the initial morphology, overall stress of deformation, and in the  final crystallinity, orientation, elastic modulus, and tensile strength of the end  film. Finally, it was concluded that the crystalline phase, that melts during  preheating prior to stretching forms a "structured melt" phase. The amount  of structured melt is related to the tensile strength at break of the end film.  Finally, it was showed that an optimal gloss is obtained, if the cast film is  stretched about 15°C below its melting point.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kamal, M. R.
