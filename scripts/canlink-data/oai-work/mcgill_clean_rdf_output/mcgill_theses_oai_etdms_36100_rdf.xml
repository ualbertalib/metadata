The resistant phenotype is associated with a 40% reduction of the cell wall (1 $ to$ 6)-$ beta$-glucan fraction. Yeast cell wall (1 $ to$ 6)-$ beta$-glucan is a highly branched glucose polymer composed predominantly of linear (1 $ to$ 6)-$ beta$- sc D-linked glucopyranosyl residues. This glucan acts as a receptor for the killer toxin, leading to a concentration of active toxin on the yeast cell surface. The KRE1 gene was cloned by complementation of the kre1-1 mutant allele. The KRE1 gene encodes a serine and threonine rich protein, that is directed into the yeast secretory pathway, where it is highly modified, probably through O-linked glycosylation. Haploid strains with a kre1::HIS3 disruption appear to grow somewhat more slowly than wild type, and show an unusual wall structure when examined using electron microscopy. As with strains that carry a mutant kre1-1 allele those with a kre1::HIS3 disruption show a 40% reduced level of cell wall (1 $ to$ 6)-$ beta$-glucan. Structural comparison of the (1 $ to$ 6)-$ beta$-glucan fraction isolated from a wild type strain and a kre1 mutant, showed that the glucan obtained from the mutant had fewer (1 $ to$ 6)-linked residues and displayed a smaller average polymer size. Therefore, the KRE1 gene product appears to be required for the stepwise synthesis of cell wall (1 $ to$ 6)-$ beta$-glucan.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j127.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr618</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Glucans.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j11z"><dcterms:title>Application of transient airborne electromagnetic and ground resistivity methods to geological mapping in tropical terrains</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Barongo, Justus Obiko</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The feasibility of using time-domain airborne electromagnetic and ground resistivity methods in geological mapping in tropical terrains is investigated. The investigation is based upon evaluation of the linear inverse theory in the determination of physical parameters of the weathered layer necessary for interpretation of underlying lithology. Inversion of ground resistivity sounding data from the greenstone belt in western Kenya yields conductivities and thicknesses that are consistent with geology. A similar inversion of modelled time-domain airborne electromagnetic data shows that conductivity, thickness and depth to the top of the conductive weathered layer can be uniquely determined if its response does not suffer the thin sheet response problem. The results further show that this problem can be quite common in tropical regions since much of the weathered layer has low conductivity and thickness and, consequently, the response is weak. In this situation, conductivity and thickness are correlated and conductivity-thickness product is better determined than these two parameters independently. By virtue of the weak time-domain AEM response of the weathered layer, much of the response remains buried in noise. This situation introduces further complications for an inverse problem that is highly non-linear. A method for reducing some of this noise before carrying out the inversion is presented.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bx829.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j11z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb4949124"><dcterms:title>Some logical characterization of the dot-depth hierarchy and applications</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Blanchet-Sadri, Francine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>New connections are discovered between formal language theory and model theory.

Within populations, males differed significantly from females in having lower weight and body component asymptotes but did not differ in plumage characteristics or growth rates. There was no difference in growth performance between individuals in broods of various sizes or within broods as a result of hatching order asynchrony. Comparisons of geographic variation showed that sedentary ospreys in Mexico had significantly higher weight and tarsus asymptotes, reduced growth rates, longer nestling periods and later emergence of flight feathers than migratory ospreys.

Basal forebrain stimulation affected the responsiveness of 63% of 80 somatosensory cortical neurons. Fifty-three percent were facilitated, 10% were inhibited leaving 37% not affected. All the effects observed had a long-term duration ranging from five minutes to more than one hour. These long-term effects were antagonized by atropine in 86% of the 22 neurons tested. An unusually broad distribution of sampled somatosensory neurons skewed toward lower layers was attributed to the stimulation of the basal forebrain. Basal forebrain stimulation also increased the proportion of cells (44%) driven by administration of ACh when compared to other studies. Basal forebrain stimulation had effects similar to iontophoretic administration of ACh on the responsiveness of cortical neurons. It is proposed that the release of ACh in the cortex by terminals of cholinergic neurons located in the basal forebrain more often reach the appropriate receptors responsible for long-term effects than does the iontophoretic administration of ACh.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj301.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r304</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h020x"><dcterms:title>The effects of temporal uncertainty resolution on the overall utility and suspense of risky monetary and survival gambles /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cook, Victoria Tracy, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We extend Kreps and Porteus' (1978, 1979a,b) temporal utility theory to include measures of suspense for gambles that vary in the timing of uncertainty resolution.

The study proceeds in five stages. In order to determine what factors govern agricultural production, prevailing economic circumstances, land distribution and the system of production are examined in succession. Next, the inquiry turns to inheritance customs and peasant estates, with the aim of measuring the economic hierarchy within the peasantry, determining its nature and explaining its dynamics. The study concludes that the slow growth of agricultural production stems essentially from limitations on production resulting from the productive framework of the family farm and the system of inheritance. On the one hand, at each generation, this system pushed the majority of young peasants out to the fringes of settlement, where they could not produce surpluses. On the other hand, it slowed down the development of older, settled land by requiring the sons who established themselves on it to recompense their co-heirs. Moreover, the analysis of peasant estates reveals the existence of an economic hierarchy among the peasantry, a hierarchy that persists over time. The study shows that well-to-do peasants generally benefitted from early access to cleared land through inheritance. As inheritance customs were relatively egalitarian, these privileged peasants were mainly the sons of families sufficiently well-off to establish all or most of their heirs comfortably. This initial advantage becomes particularly decisive once the market for agricultural products becomes more active. One can therefore conclude that even if inheritance customs imply a certain redistribution of family property, they do not equalize peasant society at each generation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q74m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rk97q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Land use -- Québec (Province) -- Jesus Island -- 18th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Economic conditions -- To 1867</dc:subject><dc:subject>Québec (Province) -- Rural conditions -- 18th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jesus Island (Québec) -- Rural conditions -- 18th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jesus Island (Québec) -- Economic conditions -- 18th century</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795840p"><dcterms:title>Recovery of pyrochlore from slimes discarded at Niobec by column flotation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Espinosa Gómez, Rodolfo.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Niobec concentrator recovers niobium minerals (principally pyrochlore) from carbonate and silicate gangue. In the process some 15% of the Nb is rejected in a slimes ($-$10 $ mu$m) product. Recovery of pyrochlore from the slimes was studied. The study was performed using plant water which contained about 200 ppm Ca, 100 ppm Mg and variable quantities of organics as the main contaminants. Selective pyrochlore collectors and selective silicate depressants were evaluated. Four possible routes to float pyrochlore selectively were found. All routes required prior carbonate flotation. Carbonate flotation was attempted using fatty acids and sodium silicate dispersant (as conducted at Niobec) in a flotation column. However, pyrochlore also floated as a result of inadequate dispersion of the slimes. Therefore, new dispersants were tested, which proved effective only at high concentration, because reaction with Ca and Mg cations in the water. High dispersant concentration caused carbonate depression. An additional problem in the flotation column was bubble coalescence and collapse of the froth. This was caused by the fatty acids, enhanced by the high dispersant concentration. A novel method of quantifying coalescence using the change in gas holdup in the column was developed. A stable froth could be made at high fatty acid emulsifier concentration, but his promoted unselective flotation. Only by working at high percent solids (10% vs 1%) could sufficient emulsifier be introduced into solution without exceeding the dosage (per unit mass of solids) above which flotation is unselective. For such high percent solids work must be conducted at plant site. Preliminary plant column work was encouraging. Extensive testwork on very fine feeds (80% $-$20 $ mu$m) at Niobec, and at Mt Isa Mines (Australia) confirmed that column flotation is ideal for selective flotation of fines principally due to reduced gangue entrainment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt418.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795840p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kh09j"><dcterms:title>Discrete angle radiative transfer in uniform and extremely variable clouds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gabriel, J. Philip.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The transfer of radiant energy in highly inhomogeneous media is a difficult problem that is encountered in many geophysical applications. It is the purpose of this thesis to study some problems connected with the scattering of solar radiation in natural clouds. Extreme variability in the optical density of these clouds is often believed to occur regularly. In order to facilitate study of very inhomogeneous optical media such as clouds, the difficult angular part of radiative transfer calculations is simplified by considering a series of models in which conservative scattering only occurs in discrete directions. Analytic and numerical results for the radiative properties of these Discrete Angle Radiative Transfer (DART) systems are obtained in the limits of both optically thin and thick media. Specific results include: (a) In thick homogeneous media, the albedo (reflection coefficient), unlike the transmission, cannot be obtained by a diffusion equation. (b) With the aid of an exact analogy with an early model of conductor/superconductor mixtures, it is argued that inhomogeneous media with embedded holes, neither the transmission, nor the albedo can be described by diffusive random walks. (c) Using renormalization methods, it is shown that thin cloud behaviour is sensitive to the scattering phase functions since it is associated with a repelling fixed point, whereas, the thick cloud limit is universal in that it is phase function independent, and associated with an attracting fixed point. (d) In fractal media, the optical thickness required for a given albedo or transmission can differ by large factors from that required in the corresponding plane parallel geometry. The relevant scaling exponents have been calculated in a very simple example. (e) Important global meteorological and climatological implications of the above are discussed when applied to the scattering of visible light in clouds. In the remote sensing context, an analysis of satellite data reveals that augmenting a satellite's resolution reveals increasingly detailed structures that are found to occupy a decreasing fraction of the image, while simultaneously brightening to compensate. By systematically degrading the resolution of visible and infra red satellite cloud and surface data as well as radar rain data, resolution-independent co-dimension functions were defined which were useful in describing the spatial distribution of image features as well as the resolution dependence of the intensities themselves. The scale invariant functions so obtained fit into theoretically predicted functional forms. These multifractal techniques have implications for our ability to meaningfully estimate cloud brightness fraction, total cloud amount, as well as other remotely sensed quantities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655h31b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kh09j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp05t"><dcterms:title>The effects of matrix glass transition temperature and polarity, and ionic group spacers on ion aggregation in styrene ionomers /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gauthier, Mario</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Matrix glass transition temperature depression through internal plasticization of a styrene-sodium methacrylate ionomer resulted in enhanced clustering at low plasticization levels (up to ca. 20 mole%).

A sample with a relaxed dielectric constant comparable to acrylate polymers showed no decrease in clustering. Similarly, plasticization with nitrobenzene resulted in typical nonpolar diluent behavior. Polarity was, therefore, not a significant parameter affecting ion aggregation.

Ion solvation effects were also suggested for the ether derivatives.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq301.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp05t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nh736"><dcterms:title>Dynamics of satellites during deployment and retraction of flexible appendages</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kalaycioglu, Serdar</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates the dynamical behavior of spinning and/or axially moving beams. An analysis of the effect of appendage root offsets (distance between the mounting point and system center of mass) on the dynamics of constant length spinning appendages is carried out. The stability and response characteristics of the system configuration are investigated taking into account the role played by the non-linear axial shortening effect, when the system is undergoing a steady spin, spin-up or angular slew maneuvers. It is observed that due to the root offset, large static deflections of the beams may result during steady spin of the system. Stability of elastic oscillations around non-trivial steady state configuration is examined and it is seen that, the axial shortening effect increases the stiffness during rotation. A positive offset along the beam causes similar effects on the stiffness matrix increasing the natural frequencies of vibrations. On the other hand, angular acceleration has a destabilizing effect. This destabilizing effect vanishes in the absence of offsets and is greater for larger offset. At some critical value of angular acceleration the frequency becomes zero for a given offset; beyond that the appendage buckles. Also the stability regions in the spin rate-spin acceleration plane are obtained. The axially moving beams may represent appendages in the process of deployment (retrieval) from (into) a spacecraft or a prismatic joint in a flexible manipulator. It is shown analytically that when the length L changes, the transverse vibrations vary, in general, as L$ sp{1/2}$. Thus, the vibrations increase during extension and reduce during retraction. This is in sharp contrast to vibrations of tethered systems which vary as L$ sp{-1/4}$, hence, decrease during deployment and increase during retrieval. The vibratory displacements, in addition to depending on the length, also depend on the type of extension (or retraction). The dynamical behavior for various deployment (retrieval) schemes--uniform deployment rate, exponential extension, uniform variation of the square of the length and harmonic extension is studied. It is seen that uniform and exponential extension lead to larger vibratory displacements compared to the other two schemes. An optimal deployment scheme is devised. It is noted that the optimal scheme is far superior to the uniform or exponential scheme, but has only marginal advantage over harmonic extension or uniform variation of the square of the length. Harmonic extension is recommended, since in this scheme, the axial velocity changes reasonably slowly and is zero at the end of deployment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q963q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nh736</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77sq826"><dcterms:title>Habermas : communicative reason and the moral realization of a normative order</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hart, Albert F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Habermas rejects a class-specific approach to social analysis and political practice and, in renewing the social theory of Marx, he turns primarily to a reconstruction of the work of Max Weber. The conceptualization of society is approached from the interrelated themes of rationalization, bureaucratization and reification. But Habermas seeks to overcome the instrumentalist implications of Weber's one-sided view of rationalization and related rejection of a cognitivist ethics by an expanded framework of rationality that introduces the concept of communicative action and, with it, the promise of clarifying the normative foundations of a critical theory of society. Against contrary views of Habermas' overriding purpose this thesis shows the major strands of his theoretical programme to have their unifying interconnections within an enduring commitment to a rational morally guided practice. Critically vulnerable aspects of this programme, however, suggest that the unity of theory and practice will prove to be as elusive for him as it was for his Marxist predecessors.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm187.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sq826</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Communication -- Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Habermas, Jürgen.

The problem, known as unit commitment, is a nonlinear mixed program typically with thousands of 0-1 integer variables and diverse constraints. An exact optimal solution to the problem is only possible via (explicit or implicit) enumeration, which requires a prohibitively long computation time for large problem instances. Two optimization approaches, Lagrangian relaxation and simulated annealing, are explored in this thesis for efficient and near-optimal unit commitment. Lagrangian relaxation combines the solution of the dual of the unit commitment problem with feasibility search to obtain primal feasible solutions. The feasibility search is necessary because a solution to the dual seldom solves the primal, and because little theory is available to bridge the optimal dual and primal solutions. In this thesis, several new feasibility search procedures to find a near-optimal primal feasible solution from the dual solution are developed and tested. These procedures are independent of the data constituting different problem instances, and are more rigorous and systematic than the existing ones. With these procedures, Lagrangian relaxation is successfully and efficiently applied to both single and multiple area unit commitment. Simulated annealing exploits the resemblance between a minimization process and the cooling of a molten metal. The method generates feasible solution points randomly and moves among these points following a strategy which leads to a global minimum in a statistical sense. Simulated annealing is very flexible for handling diverse and complicated constraints, such as those typical of the unit commitment problem. Simulated annealing is analyzed, evaluated and implemented for unit commitment in this thesis. Five major algorithms, proposed in this thesis for unit commitment and reserve-constrained economic dispatch, are extensively tested and compared by numerical simulation on sample power systems of 10 to 100 units. The simulation results show the efficiency of the tested algorithms for large-scale unit commitment and demonstrate the general applicability of simulated annealing. A comparison with the priority list method and a study of the convergence rates of the subgradient type algorithms are also included in the simulation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh71d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd59p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj38607677"><dcterms:title>The transformations of Circe : the history of an archetypal character</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yarnall, Judith</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The myth of Circe and Odysseus has been told, interpreted and retold from Homer's time to the present. This thesis begins with a detailed study of Homer's balancing of positive and negative elements of the myth and argues that Homer's Circe is connected with age-old traditions of goddess worship, particularly of Artemis of Ephesus. Chapters III and IV investigate the cultural context in which the purely negative Circe of the Homeric allegorists developed and how this allegorical Circe affected works by other ancient writers, particularly Virgil and Ovid. Later chapters demonstrate how this negative allegorical view of Circe prevailed through the Renaissance and seventeenth century, as evidenced in mythographies, Calderon's plays and by Spenser's Acrasia. The study concludes that allegorical interpretations of the Circe myth were founded on body-soul dualism, so that not until this belief is questioned and abandoned by Joyce and Atwood in the twentieth century are more original and/or positive Circes found.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cd88c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j38607677</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Circe (Greek mythology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A44558d97k"><dcterms:title>Association entre la mortinatalite et lexposition aux produits chimiques pendant la grossesse</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Goulet, Lise, 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this research was to study the relationship between stillbirth and chemical exposure of pregnant workers.

The author proposes that ergonomic factors could be a confounder of the association between stillbirth and exposure to pesticides/germicides or metals. A study looking more closely at the association between stillbirth and ergonomic factors is therefore suggested. Because exposure of pregnant workers to elevated levels of chemicals is quite rare, further epidemiological studies should include more subjects. ftn$ sp+$: stillbirths aged 20 weeks of gestation or more. ftn*: stillbirths aged 28 weeks of gestation or more.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m64w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d97k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p794"><dcterms:title>Control of sympathetic neuron and cardiovascular effector activity by carbon dioxide</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hanna, Brian Dale</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of CO$ sb2$ on sympathetic preganglionic neuron (SPN) activity and hindlimb neurogenic vascular resistance (HVR) was investigated in cats.
