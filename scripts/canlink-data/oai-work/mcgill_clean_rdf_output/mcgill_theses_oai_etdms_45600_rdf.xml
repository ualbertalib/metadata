(George Pan).</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel technique of direct copper precipitation from a loaded chelating extractant using hydrogen in an autoclave (pressure hydrogen stripping) was studied. In its simplest form, the reaction is given by {CuL(,2)}(,org) + H(,2)(g) (---&gt;) 2{HL}(,org) + Cu(s). Kelex 100 (Sherex Chemical Co. - commercial solvent extraction reagent), an alkylated derivative of 8-hydroxyquinoline was used as the basis of the present investigation and represents HL in the above equation. Two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study the chemical and thermal response of the extractant at high temperature and hydrogen pressures and (b) those which describe the chemistry and kinetics of hydrogen stripping. The extractant was found to exhibit excellent chemical stability up to 573 K (300(DEGREES)C) and 2.76 MPa (400 psi) hydrogen in the absence of copper. Its chemical stability was somewhat reduced when loaded with copper. In the latter case, some limited hydrogenation of the quinoline nucleus of the extractant and some of the impurities present (furoquinolines) was observed. The chemical stability of the extractant was found to be enhanced when at least 0.52 M of a long-chain alcohol (decanol) was added to the organic solvent (0.4 M Kelex/kerosene). A slow thermal dissociation of the copper chelate was found to take place within the experimental temperature range studied (443 to 488 K). This resulted in copper precipitation and organic regeneration. Copper in a powder form was found to precipitate rapidly from loaded Kelex 100/decanol/kerosene solvents by reaction with hydrogen at pressures between 0.52 and 4.00 MPa (75 and 580 psi) and temperatures from 443 to 488 K (170 to 215(DEGREES)C). The overall process has heterogeneous characteristics. Nuclei are provided through slow thermal dissociation of the copper chelate. The freshly produced metallic copper, acting autocatalytically accelerates the precipitation kinetics. Reduction of the Cu(II) chelate to Cu(I) complex appears to be the rate controlling step. In addition to temperature and pressure, the effects of seeding, agitation, copper concentration, ligand concentration and copper chelate age were investigated. Some physical and chemical properties of the copper powder product were also determined.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sb103.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wn61s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Solvent extraction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Copper -- Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612p48z"><dcterms:title>Studies on the regulation and the biochemical parameters of epididymal steroid delta4-5a-reductase</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Scheer, Heimo W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The regulation of the rat epididymal steroid metabolizing enzymes, (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase and 3(alpha)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3(alpha)-HSD), was investigated during sexual maturation. Nuclear (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity was first detected at day 21 and reached maximal values by day 77. Subsequently, enzymatic activity declined by more than 60% to reach adult plateau levels by day 105. Cytoplasmic 3(alpha)-HSD was already evident in the youngest age group tested (day 7) and reached the characteristic adult plateau levels by day 63. While 3(alpha)-HSD activity correlated closely with androgen-dependent parameters during development, nuclear (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity correlated neither with the presence of spermatozoa nor with parameters of androgen levels. To investigate the subcellular distribution of (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase and 3(alpha)-HSD during development, a discontinuous sucrose gradient method was developed. While 3(alpha)-HSD activity was found solely in cytoplasmic fractions, (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity was present only in nuclear and microsomal fractions. In contrast to the bell-shaped developmental profile of nuclear (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity, the activity of microsomal (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase increased gradually with age. To adequately compare the biochemical properties of nuclear and microsomal (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase, enzymatic activity was solubilized. The sedimentation coefficient of solubilized (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase was greater for the microsomal enzyme than for the nuclear enzyme (11.6S(' )vs(' )10.1S). The relative capacity of steroids to inhibit enzymatic activity and the pH optima were similar for nuclear and microsomal, membrane-bound and solubilized enzyme forms. While the Km for testosterone was similar in nuclear and microsomal fractions (range: 1.75-4.42 x 10('-7)M), the Km for NADPH was about 30-fold greater for the microsomal enzyme than for the nuclear enzyme. Thus, (1) 3(alpha)-HSD activity is androgen-dependent and found only in the cytoplasmic fraction; (2) (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity is regulated by a factor(s) not relating directly to either spermatozoa or androgens; (3) (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity is regulated as a function of age and subcellular distribution; (4) (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase activity can be solubilized in an active and stable form with no major alterations in the active site of the enzyme; (5) there apparently exists at least two distinct forms of (DELTA)('4)-5(alpha)-reductase in the epididymis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x220t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p48z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580n441"><dcterms:title>Sensitivity reduction in multivariable systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bensoussan, David.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Feedback is used to decrease the sensitivity of a system to plant uncertainty or to disturbances. This thesis is focused on the reduction of sensitivity to additive disturbances applied at the output. Systems are represented by linear multivariable frequency responses whose inputs and outputs belong to (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED...PLEASE SEE DAI) Rigorous conditions under which feedback can reduce sensitivity are derived. It is shown that given a minimum phase single input-single output plant, there exists a feedback compensator which reduces sensitivity below any arbitrarily positive value on any finite frequency interval while not exceeding a specified upper bound in the right half complex plane. It is also shown that given a multivariable invertible plant which approaches diagonal dominance at high frequencies, it is possible to build a diagonal feedback compensator to reduce the sensitivity below any arbitrarily value on any finite frequency interval while not exceeding a specified upper bound in the right half complex plane. A relationship between sensitivity reduction and decentralized control is established. It is shown that reducing sensitivity to additive disturbances at the outputs is in essence the same as achieving local control of a multivariable system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4305648.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n441</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Control theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Automatic control -- Sensitivity.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp22g"><dcterms:title>The University of Kuwait : an historical-comparative study of purposes in a new university in a developing nation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cornell, Marguerite Louise.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The University of Kuwait is a new university founded in the latter part of the twentieth century in an oil-rich, developing nation. This inquiry deals with the purposes of such a university and the extent to which it is able to fulfill them. The role of the University has been determined by the evolution of the purposes of universities in the West and the Arab Muslim Middle East, by the development of Kuwait, and by the growth of modern formal education there. The University's establishment and its development during the first eleven years are documented and analysed in the light of these influences. The University initially served a primarily utilitarian role in Kuwait. The question is raised as to whether, given the peculiarities of Kuwait's economy, this role will be sufficient to ensure its future. The conclusion reached is that, as the University develops a broader role in Kuwait, it will find long-term support.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gillett, Margaret (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k81d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp22g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Higher -- Kuwait.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jāmiʻat al-Kuwayt.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adf65v872t"><dcterms:title>Neural regulation of rhythmic growth hormone secretion in the rat by somatostatin and catecholamines</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Terry, L.

It is shown that exictatory and inhibitory neural inputs must be intact to maintain normal rhythmic growth hormone secretion. Growth hormone rises are generated by hypothalamic neurons that liberate a growth hormone releasing factor. These neurons are activated by adrenergic (and probably noradrenergic) inputs. The periventricular and amygdalofugal somatostatinergic systems control ebbs in plasma growth hormone and stress- or lateral hypothalamic stimulation-induced growth hormone suppression.

Rabbit kidneys retained significant levels of function with stable or increasing GFR, sodium reabsorption of 40 to 60%, and glucose reabsorption of greater than 80% of the filtered load. Including dextran in the perfusate as a source of colloid osmotic pressure was deleterious to kidney function. The kidney demonstrated sensitivity to exogenous energy substrate; supplementation of lactate and glucose resulted in better function over butyrate with glucose or glucose alone. The system proved sensitive to ischemia and to stimulation with an antidiuretic preparation. This system was utilized to examine the effects of treatment of rabbit kidneys with dimethylsulfoxide(Me(,2)SO). A recirculating constant pressure hypothermic (10(DEGREES)C) perfusion apparatus was assembled and kidneys were perfused with potassium-rich, sodium-poor solution with elevated glucose and mannitol. The pharmacokinetics of 3 M Me(,2)SO equilibration was studied through estimation of the inulin and Me(,2)SO spaces using radiochemical markers. Medullary tissue equilibration was achieved prior to cortical equilibration, which was complete after 35 minutes of exposure to 3 M Me(,2)SO. Me(,2)SO perfusion resulted in increased fluid retention by the kidney. Function of rabbit kidneys was assessed at normothermia following Me(,2)SO introduction at two different rates, 35 minute equilibration at 3 M Me(,2)SO, and removal by an osmotic counterbalance system commencing with either 800 or 600 mOs/kg washout solution made hypertonic with mannitol. Kidneys exhibited excellent in vitro function following perfusion with Me(,2)SO. Washout with solutions of hyperosmolarity commencing at 600 mOs/kg with gradual and stepwise reduction to 400 mOs/kg allowed immediate removal of Me(,2)SO without damage; initiation of washout at 800 mOs/kg resulted in reduced function at 37(DEGREES)C.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pd81d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t929</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azc77sq99c"><dcterms:title>The structural and functional properties of immobilized subunits of alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McCracken, Susan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli has been immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B using low levels of cyanogen bromide activation in order to favour the attachment of the dimer to the support through a single covalent linkage. The level of phosphatase activity in the matrix-bound monomer, obtained after dissociation of the immobilized dimer, was dependent on the extent of cyanogen bromide activation of the support, indicating that this activity is due to contaminating dimers. The quaternary structure of the subunit, reversibly immobilized through a disulfide linkage, was determined by crosslinking the matrix-bound protein, then releasing the protein from the support and analysing it by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. This method demonstrated the presence of dimeric structures whose concentration was linearly correlated to the amount of phosphatase activity in the matrix-bound subunits. Titration of matrix-bound ('125)I-labelled subunits with soluble nascent ('131)I-labelled subunits resulted in the recovery of over 60% of the original dimer phosphatase activity and a final isotope ratio of 1.06. Titration of metal-free immobilized dimer and monomer with ('65)Zn('2+) showed that the monomer bound 0.9 equivalents of Zn('2+), while the dimer bound 4.1 equivalents of Zn('2+). These results indicate that although the monomer lacks catalytic activity, it exists as a highly folded structure containing sites for Zn('2+) binding and subunit interactions. Chemical modification with ethoxyformic anhydride has demonstrated that three histidines per subunit are modified in the soluble enzyme with a concomitant loss of catalytic activity. Zn('2+) ions protect the enzyme from modification as well as from inactivation, thus implicating all three histidines in Zn('2+) binding. Zn('2+) also protects the monomer against this modification providing independent evidence for Zn('2+) binding in renatured subunits. These techniques, developed in order to characterize subunits of alkaline phosphatase, are generally applicable to other oligomeric enzymes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p8041.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sq99c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bv483"><dcterms:title>Purification and characterization of CEA cross-reactive substances from neoplastic and normal tissues and elucidation of the basis of cross-reactivity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Laferté, Suzanne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Non-specific Cross-reacting Antigen or NCA was isolated from colonic tumor (T-NCA), normal lung (L-NCA) and normal spleen (S-NCA) tissues. In each case, NCA consisted of a 50,000 dalton glycoprotein. Tumor NCA and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) had a similar amino acid composition but differed in carbohydrate content and composition. Enzymatically and chemically derived fragments of T-NCA, L-NCA and S-NCA were identical by SDS-gel but demonstrated only 25% homology by two-dimensional peptide mapping. Normal tissue NCAs demonstrated 62% peptide homology. These differences are thought to result from glycosylation differences. Antigenic determinants involved in CEA/T-NCA cross-reactivity were localized on purified fragments of CEA and T-NCA which ranged in size between 20,000 and 30,000 daltons. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed 30-50% homology of CEA, T-NCA and fragments of these molecules, even after partial deglycosylation. Deglycosylation of CEA and T-NCA with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) generated from each antigen a soluble immunochemically identical 40,000 dalton polypeptide demonstrating 45% homology by peptide mapping. In the case of CEA, the 40,000 dalton polypeptide may represent an acid cleavage product. Deglycosylation of CEA by TFMS treatment also generated an insoluble 85,000 dalton polypeptide which may represent the intact deglycosylated CEA polypeptide. These data demonstrate that a structural basis exists for CEA/T-NCA cross-reactivity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gp14v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv483</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gt51k"><dcterms:title>A morphological study of Tomes' process, enamel matrix secretion and the matrix to crystallite relationship in the rat incisor /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nanci, Antonio.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A morphological study was done of Tomes' process, the organic matrix and the hydroxyapatite crystals of enamel. The membrane of Tomes' process where secretion of rod and interrod material occurs is extensively infolded. The interrod secretion site extends circumferentially around the ameloblast and granules fuse with deep membrane infoldings. The infoldings associated with secretion sites can be abolished by injecting vinblastine. Newly secreted enamel proteins do not accumulate extracellularly. So-called "stippled material" is an artifact of fixation and results from degradation of previously calcified enamel. Simultaneous visualization of the organic matrix and hydroxyapatite crystals is not possible because the aqueous stains needed to reveal the organic matrix dissolve the young enamel crystals. Osmium tetroxide, however, protects against beam damage and dissolution by water. When visualized separately the organic matrix seems to be contained within the space occupied by the crystal. Using stereo electron microscopy, crystals appear as thin flat ribbons. Images previously described as hexagonal cross-cut crystals are due to visualizing a three-dimensional structure in two dimensions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx43k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gt51k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj576"><dcterms:title>Cellular basis of enhanced resistance to listeriosis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Punjabi, Chitra J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cellular basis for genetically-determined differences in resistance to infection with Listeria monocytogenes has been investigated in Listeria-resistant and Listeria-sensitive mouse strains. Adoptive transfer of specific immunity to naive recipients of sensitive and resistant genotypes has shown that the gene (Lr) controlling the level of resistance is expressed in the macrophage, rather than in the T-cell, response. In resistant mice, shortening of promonocyte generation time (T(,G)), together with prompt monocytosis and decreased half-time (T(, 1/2)) of circulating monocytes is seen following infection or injection of listerial cell wall extract; furthermore, the enhanced antilisterial response of resistant mice is highly radiosensitive indicating participation of an immigrant, inflammatory macrophage. Studies in chimeras constructed between sensitive and resistant strains have shown that high resistance is a property of the host environment in which the macrophage precursors mature. Thus, high antilisterial resistance is attributed to an Lr gene product which promotes early arrival of large numbers of young mononuclear phagocytes at infective foci, which destroy the pathogen.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j894v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj576</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3197xm640"><dcterms:title>Trapping and monitoring techniques for plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), in a southern Quebec apple orchard</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Le Blanc, Jean-Pierre R., 1947-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Six published sampling techniques, and six trapping and three monitoring techiques developed by the author, were tested in a southwestern Quebec insecticide-free apple orchard to determine a reliable trapping and/or monitoring technique for the plum curculio.
