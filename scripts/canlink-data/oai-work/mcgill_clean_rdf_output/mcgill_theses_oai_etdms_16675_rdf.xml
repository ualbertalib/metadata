In recent years there have been extensive investigations into the biosynthetic pathways or the aromatic nucleus. Two main routes of formation are known, each giving rise to a group or family or aromatic compounds. Firstly, the acetate pathway involves the end to end condensation or three acetate molecules to give rise to phenols. Acetate-C14 has been found to label the A ring of flavonoids in which the hydroxyl groups are arranged as in resorcinol and phloroglucinol.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Towers, G.

To gain more information about this undesirable reaction, the thesis by E. Eisenbraun had the object of discovering whether such reactive sites could be “blocked” by preferential condensation of the phenol-formaldehyde type. It was shown by three independant methods that 100g of spruce periodate lignin condensed with about 30 g of formaldehyde to form Ross-Potter, or formaldehyde, lignin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

Some of these, it is true, went to the area only in attempts to discover new lands, to traverse the mythical "open polar sea", or to reach the North Pole itself, but several expeditions also made careful and detailed scientific observations. At least two such meteorological records are still of interest and value in the study of the climate of the northern part of Ellesmere Island.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Orvig, S.

It is concerned with the problem of the subjective picture held by a sample of delinquents regarding these agencies - their staff, their members and their activities. A great deal has been written in the past decade or more by various interested groups in the community offering interpretations of the nature of delinquency, its causes and programs for its prevention and cure. None of these studies, however, has at tempted to elicit from the delinquent himself his interpretation of his experiences at recreational and informal educational agencies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gifford, C.
