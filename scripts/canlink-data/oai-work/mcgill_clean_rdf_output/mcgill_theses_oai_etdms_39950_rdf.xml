N-Ethylcarboxamido adenosine (NECA) stimulates cAMP accumulation and binds to A$ sb2$ receptors in a saturable and biphasic fashion in both types of cell cultures. Sixteen hours of theophylline treatment led to a significant increase in the number of low affinity A$ sb2$ binding sites, as well as a potentiation of NECA-stimulated cAMP accumulation, regardless of whether the cells expressed A$ sb1$ receptors. The enhanced adenylate cyclase stimulation in cells treated for 8 hours is completely blocked by addition of cycloheximide, indicating that new protein synthesis plays a role in the effects of theophylline. The potentiated response to NECA continues through 1 week of treatment in both sets of cultured cells, but disappears after 2 weeks of theophylline pretreatment in the cells expressing both A$ sb1$ and A$ sb2$ receptors. Binding profiles in cells that do not express A$ sb1$ receptors demonstrate that while control cells are sensitive to the effects of the non-hydrolyzable analogue of guanosine triphosphate, Gpp(NH)p, cells that were treated for 4 days or 1 week with theophylline are no longer sensitive to the effects of this compound. This could indicate either an enhanced coupling between the receptor and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G$ rm sb{s}$ protein) or a complete uncoupling of these two proteins. There is a significant decrease in the basal cAMP levels after 4 days or more of treatment, as well as an increase in the immunoreactivity of the $ alpha$ subunit of the stimulatory G protein after 2 weeks of treatment. Taken together, these findings would tend to favour the possibility of enhanced coupling between the receptor and the G$ rm sb{s}$ protein.

Following the understanding of knowledge developed by Michael Polanyi and Bernard Lonergan, ethics is presented not as a science of abstract norms and principles, but as a transformative science of reflection on moral activity. Drawing from the social sciences, negative structural patterns which corrupt transformative awareness are examined under the rubrics of self-deception, social ignorance, ideology, dependency and social conformity. These investigations identify and analyze sociological and psychological features of dynamic relationships preventing or corrupting processes of personal transformation and the building up of moral human community. At each stage of the study, the central role of economic and political structures and conditions influencing modern consciousness, and defining society, are taken into account. This research provides insights and analytical tools to increase our capacity to become aware of the subtle social psychological dynamics which stifle human creativity and block moral and social development within contemporary society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baum, Gregory (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv05h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dp34f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ethics, Modern -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social ethics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self-actualization (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Awareness</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j0843"><dcterms:title>A study of some problems arising from combustion and microwave heating</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Andonowati</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A model for microwave heating is considered.

Position-gradient tensors determined from strain analysis of deformed volcanic fragments in a succession of Late Triassic Takla Group rocks abutting one of the north-northwest trending faults indicate that they are dextrally transpressive, in accord with the common occurrence of subvertical intersections of the fault planes with other planar fabrics and subhorizontal stretching lineations within the fault zones. Principal directions of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from Early Jurassic to Cretaceous dioritic rocks are consistent with those of the strain ellipsoids in their adjacent volcanics, suggesting that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. The age of the strike-slip faulting is unknown but was probably not earlier than mid Cretaceous as the Early Jurassic to Cretaceous dioritic rocks were involved in the faulting in many places. Some of the major faults cut the area into discrete, fault-bounded blocks several kilometres wide. As the dextral motion on the FIF progressed, deformation was concentrated within the previously formed fault zones while the fault-bounded rocks remained weakly deformed. Stress tensors for 24 sites were inverted from the regional cleavage within the blocks, which predates the block-bounding faults. The site-mean stress tensors indicate that the fault-bounded blocks were rotated clockwise about a subvertical axis during progressive dextral motion on the FIF. The amount of rotation varies systematically over the area with maximum value (58.7 $ pm$ 3.3$ sp circ$) close to the FIF and minimum value (0.0 $ pm$ 1.6$ sp circ$) about 20 kilometres away from it. Paleomagnetic samples were collected from 13 sites in the widespread Early Jurassic to Cretaceous plutonic rocks. Interpretable magnetic components of the Late Cretaceous, isolated by both stepwise AF and thermal demagnetization from 6 sites, were used to calculate the paleopole. The observed paleopole has a low value of Fisher's precision k = 48, and is significantly different from the Late Cretaceous reference pole for cratonal North America (CNA). After corrections for the local block rotations, the observed paleopole has a high value of k = 383 and moves closer to the reference pole but is still significantly different from it. Rotation about the Eulerian pole for the best-fitting small circle to the Tintina trench and northern Rocky Mountain trench fault zone, however, brings the observed pole into coincidence with that for CNA, and requires only $ sim$670 kilometres of dextral displacement on the fault zone. It is likely, therefore, that local structures associated with dextral strike-slip faults in the western Canadian Cordillera may account for at least part of the paleomagnetic disparity between some western parts of the Canadian Cordillera and CNA.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hynes, Andrew (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px923.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw424</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17cv97n"><dcterms:title>A C-grid ocean circulation model and eddy simulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Xu, Weimin, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have developed a C-grid primitive equation ocean general circulation model with Cartesian and $ beta$-plane geometry. Temperature is the only state variable. The C-grid gives better results than the B-grid in reproducing the growth rates of linear unstable modes of the Raileigh-Benard equations. A semi-implicit scheme is used to treat the Coriolis term, which is important for efficient integration in coarse resolution large scale modelling studies. A new viscosity term which has a damping effect only on the divergence field associated with gravity waves is also introduced. The model can reproduce sucessfully most of the coarse resolution model results of other studies. The biharmonic and Smagorinsky frictional parameterizations are not as efficient as our scheme in eliminating noise in the vertical velocity field. This model is used to study the effects of no slip or free slip boundary conditions on the energetics and northward heat transport in the eddy resolving regime. The divergence dissipation term is used only in the subpolar gyre region, where the Rossby radius of deformation is not well resolved. This term has little effect elsewhere in the model domain. The eddy energetics is sensitive to the lateral boundary conditions used. Increasing vertical resolution can increase the basin average and midlatitude free jet energetics, but its effect is much less than that due to different lateral boundary conditions. The northward heat transports by eddies and mean flow are also examined. The effect of a restoring condition is compared to a zero heat capacity atmospheric model as a surface boundary condition for the eddy resolving model. Two significant differences are found with the use of the zero heat capacity atmospheric model. First, both eddy and mean kinetic energy near the midlatitude free jet are increased. Second, the vertical profiles of standard temperature deviation (eddy available potential energy) become more realistic. An analysis of the mean advection and eddy convergence terms in the mean momentum equations shows that both enhanced horizontal resolution and the zero heat capacity atmospheric model can increase the midlatitude jets in the surface and deep layers. The eddy momentum convergence in midlatitudes is the dominant ageostrophic contribution to both the mean zonal flow and its variation. The mean advection is consistently less important. The effects of eddies have been further investigated by using the mean vorticity equation. The results again show that the eddy convergence term is the most important ageostrophic term, and can be as important as the geostrophic effect. The mean vorticity equation budget shows a similar sensitivity to the horizontal resolution and zero heat capacity atmospheric model as for the momentum equations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lin, Charles A.

In the present study, we demonstrate that an SLE-derived human hybridoma autoantibody, 9604, recognizes a surface antigen expressed on platelets activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), calcium ionophore A23187, or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), showing saturation with approximately 2,000 antibody molecules bound and a K$ rm sb{d}$ of 41 nM. This antibody did not affect shape change or the initial rate of primary aggregation, but significantly inhibited secondary aggregation of stirred platelet suspensions by ADP or calcium ionophore A23187, but not PMA. This was demonstrated to be due to the inhibition of large platelet aggregate formation, with a major shift to smaller microaggregates and singlets. 9604 recognized two reduced polypeptides of 200,000 and 32,000 M.W. (p32) by Western blot analysis. The 200,000 M.W. band was identified as the heavy chain of platelet myosin and was not expressed on the platelet surface.

A murine monoclonal antibody (8E8) was raised against p32 and its antigen binding properties were characterized and compared with those of 9604. 8E8 specifically recognized p32, bound to ADP-activated but not resting platelets, and completely inhibited the binding of 9604 to ADP-activated platelets.

That effort proved abortive, and confirmed in its failure the earlier pattern of state - 'ulama' relations. The pattern was one of collaboration between the caliphs and the 'ulama'. Proto-Sunni scholars were among the beneficiaries of extensive caliphal patronage, and it was their viewpoints which caliphal interventions in religious life upheld. Owing perhaps to the effects of 'Abbasid patronage, but also to the implications of certain proto-Sunni viewpoints, proto-Sunnis were generally favourable towards the 'Abbasids. A convergence is discernible in the interests of the Caliphs and the 'ulama', and partly explains not only the latter's pro-'Abbasid sentiment but also why it was the proto-Sunni viewpoints that the 'Abbasids came to patronize.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Little, Donald P.

We attempt to isolate two effects on the current account which arise from the impact of external shocks to the economy. The first one is attributed to a direct response by private agents to the shock. The second arises from the optimal response by the government to counteract the effects of the shock on the economy and depends on the government's objectives. It is hypothesized that these two effects can explain the behavior of the current account in many developing countries. Much of the literature in developing countries ignores the indirect effect of government policy on private sector behavior and hence its effect on the current account. Moreover, the models emphasize empirical analysis with little or no theoretical foundation. In this thesis, an intertemporal framework is postulated with rational optimizing agents. It is assumed that following an external shock, the rational behavior of economic agents is to adjust their production and spending behavior in an optimal manner. Depending on the degree of flexibility in the economy, the effect of this response is to reduce domestic absorption and thus improve the current account. At the same time, the government responds by undertaking policies which optimize its objectives given the shock. The overall effect may or may not improve the current account. The reactions of both the government and the private sector are analyzed in the context of a game in which it is assumed that each agent takes the other's behavior into account when formulating economic decisions. Two types of equilibria are examined: a Nash non-cooperative concurrent game; and a non-cooperative Stackleberg structure. The theoretical framework is along the lines of Conway who has undertaken a similar study for Turkey, a semi-industrialized economy. The model specification and the estimating equations are however modified to capture key features of the Kenyan economy. The empirical results show that external shocks, particularly increases in the price of imported inputs and exchange rate devaluation have a contractionary effect on the Kenyan economy. Fox example, producers responded to an increase in the price of imported inputs by reducing the demand for the inputs as well as the demand for labor. As predicted by the theory, both the government and private agents responded to the shocks in an attempt to maximize their objectives. It is argued that the optimal responses of these agents are not necessarily in each other's interest implying that each agent will react to counteract the undesirable effects of the other's behavior. The interaction between the government and the private sector can be explained by a Stackleberg game structure where the government is the leader. Also, both the direct and indirect effects of the shocks are found to be important in explaining the behavior of the current account in Kenya.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Handa, J.

Pragmatism, thus, is associated with relativism. C.I. Lewis says that pragmatism without universal norms is a self-contradiction. I defend the view that there are two dimensions to pragmatism. I claim that Lewis' philosophy encompasses both. I argue that there are two different pragmatic justifications implicit in his philosophy; while one is associated with relativism, the other is not. I call them: "the pragmatic choice of the best" and "the pragmatic justification of the non-repudiable," respectively. What is justified by the first is a choice from alternatives; what is justified by the second is the Categorical Imperative--the imperative to be practically consistent. I argue that the imperative governing ethics is secured as one aspect of, or derivation from, the imperative of practical consistency. I argue that there are ethical alternatives but that this flexibility occurs within the discipline; I propose that pragmatic choice of the best be the determining methodology for selection of an alternative. While the first justification belongs to the dimension of pragmatism as understood by the conventional wisdom, the second belongs to the dimension I call "foundational pragmatism." From the Introduction to Chapter 2, I present my position. From Chapter 3 to 7, I explain the structure which underlies and makes possible the two different justifications: this requires a careful, and at times helpful, approach to the way Lewis structures a complex and unified system of norms, knowledge, decisions and choices. In Chapters 8 and 9, I explain how Lewis justifies the Categorical Imperative as pragmatically a priori: I also provide a definition of practical consistency, which is lacking. In Chapters 10 through 12, I develop some ideas connecting the later Wittgenstein, Apel and Winch in order to argue for a convergence between Wittgenstein and Lewis. In the concluding chapter, I argue that Richard Rorty's claim that pragmatism and foundationalism are incompatible is incorrect--indeed, it is not upheld by his own version of pragmatism. By these arguments, I bring Lewis' pragmatism into the contemporary arena of the struggle to ground ethics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv06s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rn24m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lewis, Clarence Irving, 1883-1964 -- Contributions in ethics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pragmatism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085n325"><dcterms:title>DNA cruciforms and mammalian origins of DNA replication</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pearson, Christopher Edmund</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of the research in this thesis is to investigate, at the molecular level, the sequences and/or structures involved in the initiation of mammalian DNA replication and to investigate the protein interactions with DNA cruciforms which have been implicated in the process of replication initiation. Four plasmids containing monkey (CV-1) early replicating nascent origin enriched sequences (ors), which had been shown previously to replicate autonomously in transfected CV-1, COS-7 and HeLa cells, were used in the establishment of an in vitro DNA replication system that uses HeLa cell extracts. The in vitro replication system is dependent upon the presence of an ors sequence, and HeLa cell extracts. Mapping experiments indicate that there is preferential nucleotide incorporation in the ors sequences, suggesting site-specific initiation, and that replication is bidirectional and semiconservative. Electron microscopy confirmed that in vitro initiation occurs within the ors sequence. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral replication origins, mammalian origin enriched sequences (ors) and other mammalian early replicating sequences contain AT-rich sequences and inverted repeats, which have the potential to form bent and cruciform (stem-loop) DNA structures, respectively. Cruciforms have been postulated to form transiently at or near origins to serve as recognition structures for initiator proteins. Using a stable-DNA cruciform as a binding substrate in a band-shift assay, a novel DNA binding activity with specificity for the cruciform-containing DNA and no apparent sequence-specificity was identified in HeLa cell extracts. The activity is protein-dependent and is void of detectable nuclease activity. Cruciform-specific binding was observed to be maximal in early-S phase extracts. A novel cruciform binding protein (CBP) with an apparent molecular weight of 66 kDa was enriched from HeLa cell extracts. Footprinting experiments localized the CBP-DNA cruciform interaction to the four-way junction at the base of the cruciform. CBP appears to interact with the elbow junctions in an asymmetric fashion. Upon CBP binding, structural distortions were observed at the cruciform stems and at a DNA region distal to the junction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zannis-Hadjopoulos, Maria (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r75t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085n325</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asf2687066"><dcterms:title>Control of a polypropylene visbreaking process using an in-line process rheometer</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nelson, Burke I.

Under various combinations and applications of the cytokine and drug, in both normal and erythroleukemic mice, the following parameters were measured: (i) quantitation of NK cells in the bone marrow and spleen, and (ii) the lytic activity of those cells in all cases. In some cases, their (i) proliferative capacity, (ii) target binding capacity and (iii) microenvironmental influences were also assessed. The project has shown that rIL-2+indomethacin treatment of tumor-bearing young adult mice significantly elevated NK cell numbers and their function, reduced tumor cell numbers and increased the life span of such mice. However, in tumor-bearing infant mice, the drug and/or cytokine increased life span and stimulated NK cell numbers was/were unable to induce NK cell functional (lytic) activity from these numerically increased NK cells. Finally, tumor-bearing aged mice were totally unresponsive to such treatments. These results indicate that this form of immunotherapy is very effective in stimulating NK cells in mice bearing erythroleukemia. However, this form of immunotherapy is not universal with respect to age. The lack of NK cell functional activity in normal infant. and aged mice results from different mechanisms.

The thesis also shows that, as a whole, modern Chinese theories of literature are deeply rooted in traditional Chinese poetics. In characterizing traditional Chinese theories, it compares the latter with the mimetic model of Western literature.

The reserves demand behaviour of each of the G7 countries along with seven non-G7 industrialized countries have been empirically examined. The demand functions are estimated using the cointegration approach on autoregressive distributed lag and simple distributed lag models. This study has revealed that a country's reserve demand is significantly influenced by its level of capital flows in addition to the traditionally used trade flow variables. It is shown that the greater the external vulnerability of an economy as measured by its net capital flows in relation to its GNP, the higher is its demand for international reserves. The results have striking similarity for all the 14 industrialized countries despite their structural and institutional differences. This study points to the need of international monetary policy coordination to reduce large fluctuations in exchange rates and lessen massive flows of speculative capital which carry a potential threat of becoming inflationary.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kurien, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t432.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c50m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Money supply</dc:subject><dc:subject>Money market funds -- Reserves</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462736d"><dcterms:title>A magnetocalorimetric study of spin fluctuations in an amorphous metal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dawson, Andrew LeRossignol</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Spin fluctuations (SF) are magnetization fluctuations in a metal.

The enhancement by SF of the effective electron mass has been studied in $a$-Fe$ sb{x}$Zr$ sb{100-x}$ by low temperature calorimetry. We report the first observation of the complete quenching or suppression of SF in a metal, achievable by either raising the temperature, or by applying a high magnetic field.

Saskatchewan) were studied with the objective of optimizing the co-extraction of uranium and radium. To this end, two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study arsenic speciation under simulated U-leaching conditions, with the use of model arsenide minerals, namely niccolite (NiAs), rammelsbergite (NiAs$ sb2$) and gersdorffite (NiAsS); and (b) statistically designed tests involving actual leaching of samples of the Key Lake ore. Niccolite and rammelsbergite were found to yield H$ sb3$AsO$ sb3$ in solution as oppossed to gersdorffite, which was found to yield H$ sb3$AsO$ sb4$. H$ sb3$AsO$ sb3$ was found to be metastable in the Fe$ sb2$(SO$ sb4) sb3$ leaching system, while in the FeCl$ sb3$ and pressure (O$ sb2$) leaching systems, further oxidation to H$ sb3$AsO$ sb4$ was observed to take place at relatively slow rates. A mechanism has been advanced to account for the latter slow oxidation of H$ sb3$AsO$ sb3$ to H$ sb3$AsO$ sb4$. Finally, it was concluded that the formation of As(III)/As(V) in oxidative acid leaching is independent of the prevailing suspension redox potential which, in turn, renders impractical the possible stabilization of As(III) via potential control. The solubility of RaSO$ sb4$ in HCl-MeCl$ sb{ rm x}$ leaching media was quantitatively established by employing the "reduced activity coefficient" method. The estimated solubility profiles clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of CaCl$ sb2$ in solubilizing radium as oppossed to other monochloride salt additions. Finally, optimization of the co-extraction of U and Ra was attained with the use of a computer-aided response surface methodology. An incomplete three-level, four-variable factorial design (Box-Behnken) was applied in the region: 0.33 kg/L $ leq$ d$ sb{ rm s}$ $ leq$ 0.99 kg/L; 0.5N $ leq$ (HCl) $ sb{ rm o}$ $ leq$ 1.5 N; 1.5 M $ leq$ (CaCl$ sb2 rbrack sb{ rm o}$ $ leq$ 3.5 M; and 2 hrs $ leq$ Time$ leq$ 6 hrs. Temperature and oxygen pressure were kept constant at 68$ sp circ$C and 510 kPa (75 psi), respectively. Uranium and radium were found to dissolve simultaneously and rapidly (99% co-extraction in 2 hrs). Effective reduction of radioactivity levels from 10,000 pCi/g Ra$ sp{226}$ down to 160 pCi/g has been achieved in a single-stage batch process, thus making possible the production of environmentally innocuous tailings.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h53p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dx37m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903186g"><dcterms:title>Theoretical and experimental study of internal and annular flow induced instabilities of cylindrical shells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>El Chebair, Abdallah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This Thesis investigates theoretically and experimentally the dynamical behaviour and the stability of a cylindrical shell coaxially located in a rigid cylindrical pipe and subjected to internal or annular flow. In the theoretical study, the shell could be clamped or pinned at both ends and the fluid flow in the inner shell and the annulus is assumed to be viscous and incompressible. The fluid forces consist of two parts: (i) steady viscous forces which determined using turbulent fully-developed theory; (ii) unsteady viscous forces which are derived by means of linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Shell motions are described by Flugge's modified shell equations. Two methods of solution are employed to formulate the problem. (1) Fourier transform techniques. (2) Travelling wave solutions. The objectives are to investigate the effects of unsteady viscous forces as the dynamical behaviour and stability of the system in the presence and absence of steady forces. Calculations have been conducted with a steel shell conveying water with different gap-to-radius ratios g/a$ sb{ rm i}$ = 1/10 and 1-100. First, the system is subjected to unsteady viscous forces only. It is found that, for internal flow and annular flow for g/a$ sb{ rm i}$ = 1/10, the effects of viscosity on the stability of the system are insignificant; however, for the smaller gap (g/a$ sb{ rm i}$ = 1/100), those effects are more pronounced, rendering the system more stable. When both steady and unsteady viscous forces are applied, the results are quite different from the previous case. For internal flow, the system becomes more annular flow, the system loses stability at much lower velocities for both gap-systems. In the experimental study, the flow is only annular. The shell could be clamped at both ends or clamped at one end and free at the other. For the clamped-clamped shell, the system loses stability by divergence (buckling) as predicted by linear theory. However, coupled-mode flutter was never observed experimentally. Clamped-free shells, on the other hand, lose stability by flutter.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8061824.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903186g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x107b"><dcterms:title>Surface immobilization of plant cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Archambault, Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel technique was developed to immobilize plant cells. The cells are deposited on a surface of man-made fibrous material which provides for strong binding of the plant tissue biomass growing in the submerged culture. It was shown that the plant cells need to be fully viable for the attachment process to occur. The scale-up of this technique to laboratory size specifically designed bioreactors was performed successfully. The cell immobilizing matrix was formed into a vertical spirally wound configuration to provide for a high immobilizing area-to-volume ratio (0.8-1.2 cm$ sp{-1}$). A modified airlift (riser-to-downcomer area ratio of 0.03 and vessel height-to-diameter (H/D ratio of 3) and a low H/D ($ sim$1.5) mechanically stirred vessel delivered the optimum bioreactor performance characterized by low foaming of the broth and highly efficient plant cell attachment and retention ($ geq$96%). The growth of Catharantus roseus plant cells was investigated in these bioreactors. This process was found not to be mass transfer limited above minimal mild mixing and aeration levels ensuring sufficient supply of nutrients, especially oxygen (k$ sb{ rm L}$a $ sim$ 10-15 h$ sp{-1}$) to the immobilized biomass. The gentle surface immobilization technique developed in this work did not hinder the biosynthesis potential of the SIPC. In fact, it appeared to induce a partial secretion of some valuable compounds into the culture medium. The mildness, easiness, efficiency, mass transfer characteristics, scale-up potential and biomass loading capacity (11-13 g d.w./L) of the surface immobilization technique make it superior to all other immobilization techniques used to culture plant cells. In addition, its bioreactor overall biomass concentration compares favourably to suspended plant cell concentrations attainable in bioreactors (15-20 g d.w./L).</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343v004.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x107b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant biotechnology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bioreactors</dc:subject><dc:subject>Catharanthus -- Propagation -- In vitro</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plant cell culture</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w0324893"><dcterms:title>Les prolégomènes juridiques relatifs à l'utilisation militaire du milieu aéro-spatial par les forces canadiennes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haeck, Louis, 1951-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The exploration of space started a long time ago with the inception of civil aviation. This mode of transport very soon became a matter of great interest to the military. Today our strategists are concerned about the outer space and the limits of our universe. We do not have an airforce anymore; we have an aerospace force. The first part of this thesis is a study of the air law applicable to the military operations of our pilots. The study begins with an introduction in the world of the international public law and then moves on to the laws of armed conflicts. The flight continues with a fly pass over the laws of airwar and, lastly, the Canadian military law. In the second part of the thesis, we deal with the space law applicable to the military operations in space. We look at the international public law and several multilateral and bilateral agreements relating to the use of outer space for military activities. We also study specific problems of interest for some military operations in outer space. Thereafter we analyse some legal implications of the spying in space, space stations and self defence. The Soviets' doctrine on space laws is explained in chapter eight. After, we do one full orbit around the law of disarmament in outer space and land on the international order in space in the last chapter to complete our journey in deep space. Lastly, we finally conclude that the military personnel serving in different aerospace forces need a better "corpus aero-spatialis". We, the jurists, should work to fix the legal limits of military operations in the air and space environment. Ultimately, we need an international instrument determining the common rules of law of armed conflict for military personnel serving in their respective aerospace forces.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3334300.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0324893</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wf750"><dcterms:title>The use of patient-derived tissue in biomedical research /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kruszewski, Zita.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dualist paradigm, which has been criticized by sources in both the Catholic tradition and feminism for alienating persons from their bodies and allowing the treatment of persons as objects and property, has greatly influenced the development and practice of medicine. Particularly now, with the advent of modern molecular biology techniques as well as the potential for commercial profit-making from human biomaterials, the use of patient-derived tissue in biomedical research brings forth many questions for discussion. The notion of embodiment, what it means to have and to be a body, can be seen as a useful perspective from which to gain insight into these questions concerning person's bodies. Although stated in different terms and employing different methodologies, many sources from both the Catholic and feminist traditions of thought on embodiment converge on a holistic understanding of the person, one that counters pervasive dualistic tendencies. Within the Catholic tradition, a person is considered to be an integrated unity of body and soul; as Pope John Paul II has said, 'touch the body, touch the person.' Within the feminist perspective, the classic 'our bodies, ourselves,' is a reference to the fundamental understanding of the self as incorporating the body in an essential sense.

It strives to identify the various political and ideological discourses that manifest themselves throughout the Institute's history. The Institute's mission is to bridge the two cultures, Arab and European. It is a particularly interesting case study because of its problematic status which lies somewhere between the imperatives of local policies and those inherent to the international arena. The first chapter is a presentation of the institute, its history and its mission. It also dwells upon the local French political scene and the relations between France and the Arab world. It also offers a brief overview of the political and social realities of the Arab world. Chapter two is an introduction to the particularities of the French cultural landscape. It looks at the historical and social movement towards the democratization of culture, specifically through the transformation of the museum and of cultural institutions as a whole. Chapter three aims at identifying the repercussions of the French cultural policies on the Institute's functioning. The perceived failure of these policies is confronted with the official discourse surrounding the Institute. Chapter four is a mapping of the different discourses that manifest themselves through the Institute. The multiplicity of the discourses and the discrepancies of their proclaimed objectives are understood to be at the source of the malfunctioning of the Institute. This thesis does not attempt at finding solutions to the many problems of the Arab World Institute. It is rather an excavation work that aims at bringing forth some of the issues that could be explored while attempting at finding a resolution to the ailments of the Institute.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397b20s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm87h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Institut du monde arabe (France) -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>France -- Relations -- Arab countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arab countries -- Relations -- France.</dc:subject><dc:subject>France -- Cultural policy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arb68xd63k"><dcterms:title>The parameters of Japan's political economic strategy : impact of national identity, national interests, and role conceptions on Japanese foreign policy (1980-97)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duho Drapeau, Dann.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Research on Japanese current foreign policy suffers from neglect of the influence of domestic factors on Japan's decisions and behaviour in world politics. The question of the nature of Japanese foreign policy needs to go beyond the exogenous cause of state behaviour in international affairs. The object of inquiry of this thesis is the influence of social factors on the orientation of Japan's foreign policy. The central concern is: "how" and "why" Japan behaves as it does in world affairs. This examination addresses the question of the interaction of endogenous and exogenous factors on the foreign economic policy of Japan, and postulates that Japanese national identity, national interests, and role conceptions, are the essence of Japan's defensive attitudes in world affairs on the one hand, and that Japanese behavioural patterns in international relations are in conformity with the ends of Japan's foreign policy: economic security and growth under the Japan-US alliance. Japanese response to US pressure and trade adjustment to the changing framework of the world economy from the 1980s up to the present give a relevant outlook to the defensive character of Japan's foreign policy. For Japanese policy-makers, the stability of Japan's economic performance in the world economy, its pacifist attitude in world affairs, its trade relations with the United States, and its protectorate status as a result of the Japan-US Security Treaty, are beyond question.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Culker, Suzanne (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps435.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd63k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>National characteristics, Japanese.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Japan -- Foreign economic relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Japan -- Foreign relations -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>United States -- Foreign relations -- Japan.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
