When compared to a fallow (bare soil) control, cropping to barley and alfalfa for two seasons resulted in significant increases in the size and stability of soil aggregates. The increase in water-stable aggregates $&gt;$2.0 mm was at the expense of aggregates $&lt;$1.0 mm. Under corn, soil aggregation was not different than under fallow. After two seasons, soil under barley or alfalfa contained 15 to 25% more carbohydrates than the fallow or corn treatments. The partial correlation (r = 0.63, P = 0.001) which was observed between carbohydrate content and mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates, and periodate oxidation tests strongly suggested that carbohydrates were at least partly responsible for the increase in macro-aggregate stability. The remaining cropping effects were removed by tetraborate which suggest the participation of more-humified though ill-defined organic matter. The nature of the changes in organic matter was further investigated using particle size fractionation. Compared to the fallow control, cropping to barley and alfalfa resulted in an enrichment in carbon, nitrogen, and carbohydrates in the sand fraction. The carbohydrate composition of the soil and of its size fractions, determined by liquid chromatography, suggested that cropping treatments had only little effect on the origin of the soil carbohydrates.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn54c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk23g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Crops and soils -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil structure -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clay soils -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8w32r632z"><dcterms:title>Transport phenomena under jets impinging on a moving surface with throughflow</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Polat, Suna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A permeable highly sensitive heat flux meter has enabled the first measurements of rapidly changing local heat transfer at a moving surface with and without throughflow. This sensor was tested for turbulent confined impinging single and multiple slot jets, with throughflow and impingement surface motion both separately and in combination. Impingement surface motion, variously claimed to increase or decrease convective transfer rate, decreases Nusselt number. At industrially used conditions this decrease for slot jets is by as much as 25%. Convective heat transfer for both single and multiple slot jets at H/w $ leq$ 8 is enhanced by throughflow according to a factor, $ Delta overline{ rm St}$/Mu$ sb{ rm s}$ = 0.17, is independent of Re$ sb{ rm j}$, Mv$ sb{ rm s}$ and extent of heat transfer surface. In numerical prediction of impingement heat transfer with the high-Re version of the k-$ epsilon$ turbulence model, a modified Chieng-Launder nearwall model improves considerably the agreement between experiment and prediction. This model gives reasonable results for multiple and single slot jets except close to symmetry centrelines, where all such models fail, but does not eliminate the inability of numerical models to predict the effect of nozzle exit turbulence. The effect of throughflow on heat transfer under single and multiple jets is predicted for the first time, accurate to 10% for throughflow velocity up to 0.1m/s.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg10n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r632z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580n263"><dcterms:title>Structural and functional analysis of mammalian origins of DNA replication</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Frappier, Lori</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mammalian DNA sequences (ors), enriched for origins of DNA replication, have been isolated by extruding nascent DNA from replication bubbles activated at the beginning of S phase in CV-1 monkey cells. To determine whether these sequences had origin function, their ability to enable pBR322 plasmids to replicate autonomously in mammalian cells was examined. Using the DpnI-resistance assay and density labeling with bromodeoxyuridine, plasmids containing four different ors (ors 3, 8, 9 and 12) were found to replicate after transfection in CV-1, COS-7 and HeLa cell lines. These results were verified using electron microscopy for ors 8 and ors 12 plasmids, and the position of the replication bubbles in ors 12 plasmids was mapped to the ors sequence. Plasmids containing ors 3, 8, 9 and 12 were also shown to replicate in a cell-free replication system using extracts from HeLa cells. Origin mapping experiments in the in vitro system showed that, early in the replication reaction, incorporation of nucleotides occurs preferentially at ors-containing fragments, indicating ors-specific initiation of replication. All of the ors sequences, and all known origins of replication from prokaryotes and viruses of eukaryotes, contain inverted repeat sequences with the potential to form cruciform (stem-loop) structures. Transient cruciform formation at the origin has been postulated to be involved in the initiation of DNA replication, but the detection of such structures in vivo has been difficult. With the aim of developing a tool for the detection and functional analysis of cruciforms in vivo, two monoclonal antibodies, 2D3 and 4B4, were raised against a stable DNA cruciform structure. By gel retention assays it was shown that 2D3 and 4B4 bind not only to the cruciform that was used as immunogen, but also to another stable DNA cruciform of unrelated sequence, and to T-shaped double-stranded DNA molecules containing a single stem-loop; they do not bind to linear double-stranded DNA identical in sequence to the cruciform DNA, nor to linear single-stranded DNA, to single-stranded DNA with a stem-loop, or tRNA. Using T7 endonuclease 3, the binding site of these antibodies was mapped to the base of the cruciform stem regardless of sequence. It was concluded that 2D3 and 4B4 recognize conformational determinants specific to the elbow-like structures at the base of the stem of DNA cruciforms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz00d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n263</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10wq86h"><dcterms:title>Numerical models of turbulence with a wide range of scales</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bartello, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Severe D-1 directional Fourier truncation of the equations for D-dimensional (D = 2, 3) incompressible flow leads to a small number of coupled PDE's in one space dimension with the same inviscid quadratic invariants as the original set.

Viscous calculations for forced and decaying turbulence at high Reynolds number are consistent with k$ sp{-5/3}$ inverse energy and k$ sp{-3}$ direct enstrophy cascading inertial ranges in two dimensions and with a k$ sp{-5/3}$ direct energy cascading inertial range in three dimensions. The power-law behaviour is clear in the two-dimensional system, but less convincing in three dimensions due to the persistence of a shallow spectral range at low wavenumbers. Dissipation-range intermittency consisting of spatially intermittent vorticity gradients (D = 2) and vorticity (D = 3) is observed. In contrast to full numerical simulations, there is no tendency for isolated coherent structures to emerge in two dimensions.

The level of hydrolysis increased in phenylpropane models (i.e. with $ gamma$-CH$ sb2$OH). Thus the commonly accepted generalization that 1,2-diethers of 3$ sp prime$,4$ sp prime$-dimethyoxyphenylpropane are stable in hot alkali is valid only for 1-alkoxy compounds. The newly observed hydrolytic cleavage is influenced by a combination of steric effects, electronic effects and solubility parameters. These observations now make it possible to consider alkaline delignification in the light of gel-degradation theory. A series of compounds of the general structure 1-(3$ sp prime$-4$ sp prime$,dimethoxyphenyl)-1-aryl-2-guaiacyloxyethane, where the 1-aryl group bore a hydroxy substituent, also exhibited alkaline hydrolysis, at 150$ sp circ$C, at the $ beta$-carbon. The extent was greater when the 1-aryl group bore an $o$-OH than when it bore a $p$-OH. Thus, the reaction was assisted by the nucleophilic attack of the $o$-phenoxide anion on the $ beta$-carbon. A relatively high release of guaiacol occurred on treatment of 1-(3$ sp prime$,4$ sp prime$-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-thio-2-guaiacyloxyethane with 2N NaOH at 150$ sp circ$C, and the yield of guaiacol was increased when the terminal sidechain carbon bore a $-$CH$ sb2$OH group.

Using a small computable macroeconometric model of Cameroon incorporating some major relevant quantitative aspects of the knowledge sector, we have investigated the effects on that sector and on the overall economic system of increased education- and research-service resources. We have also analyzed some of the major qualitative factors that are important in this sector. Our results suggest that, given existing patterns of education, science and technology in Cameroon, the contribution of public investment in this sector may be small compared to the potential contribution suggested in the literature.

By analytical isoelectric focusing and activity stains it was revealed that fraction EGI is comprised of endoglucanases specific to cellulosic substrates, and that fractions EGII and EGIII are non-specific endoglucanases that hydrolyze cellulose as well as xylan substrates. The major protein fraction CBHI was shown to be a cellobiohydrolase. Turbidimetric measurement phase contrast microscopy and analysis of the products resulting from the hydrolysis of swollen cellulose demonstrated differences between endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases. The enzyme component CBHII, previously described as a cellobiohydrolases was shown to be an endoglucanase. The adsorption behavior of the four enzyme fractions was examined, with respect to pH, temperature and ionic strength. This was accomplished by using ($ sp3$H) radiolabeled cellulase fractions as tracers. The adsorption of the cellulases occurred within 60 minutes, and was described by a Langmuir type correlation. Increasing the adsorption temperature increased the saturation uptake of the endoglucanases but not of the cellobiohydrolases. Changes in pH and ionic strength affected both the degree and strength of adsorption of all the fractions, likely due to protein structure conformational changes. Direct evidence of exchange between adsorbed and free enzymes was obtained for each component using ($ sp3$H) and ($ sp{14}$C) radiolabeled tracers. In simultaneous adsorption of enzyme pairs, CBHI was shown to predominate adsorption. Endoglucanase EGI was preferentially adsorbed over EGII and EGIII. Sequential adsorption studies have shown that interaction between enzyme components largely determine the degree of their adsorption. Evidence suggested both common and distinct adsorption sites exist, and that their occupation depends on which components are involved. Light microscopy and monitoring of sugar production during cellulose hydrolysis indicated that conditions which limit predominance in adsorption by any one of the cellulase components, enhance synergism and increase degree of hydrolysis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q220m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh50w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cellulose</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fungal enzymes</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp07c"><dcterms:title>Applications of irreducible spherical tensor operators to NMR and NQR spectroscopy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Krishnan, Mangala Sunder</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis extends the concept of Irreducible Spherical Tensor Operators to spin dynamics problems in Nuclear Magnetic and Quadrupole Resonance Spectroscopy. NQR and solid state NMR deal with spin systems which behave as effective single spins in many, pulsed experiments, or as multispin systems when the dipolar interactions among spins cannot be neglected. The thesis considers problems in both areas. New analytic results are derived in the thesis for pure NQR spectroscopy and for the effect of radiofrequency fields in the presence of electric quadrupolar interaction. Three-pulse experiments are proposed for a spin-5/2 system and quantitative calculations are done for the indirect detection of new observables. Attention is focussed on the usefulness of the full-spin density matrix in all these calculations. In addition the concept of multispin tensors is applied to a system of spin-1/2 nuclei with strong dipolar interactions. This leads to coupled differential equations for correlations among spins for which an iterative solution can be obtained. The solutions are discussed in relation to Free Induction Decay experiments available for $ sp{19}$F nuclei in CaF$ sb2$ crystal.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p101k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp07c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nuclear spin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p815"><dcterms:title>Quantum corrections to the conductivity in simple metallic glasses</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Richter, Reinhart</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The validity of the theories of quantum corrections to the electrical conductivity, namely weak localization and enhanced electron-electron interaction, has been tested quantitatively in well characterized, free-electron-like Mg-Cu and Mg-Zn metallic glasses containing various amounts of Ag and Au through measurement of the electrical resistivity between 1.5K and 20K in magnetic fields up to 5.6T.

Presynaptic bursting was also more effective in suppressing, via muscarinic and non-cholinergic mechanisms, the postganglionic cell afterhyperpolarization.

Enzymatically dephosphorylated NF-L and NF-M proved as good or better substrates for phosphorylation by various exogenous protein kinases, while dephosphorylated NF-H was refractory to phosphorylation, suggesting that a conformational change accompanies the dephosphorylation of NF-H but not NF-L or NF-M. The biosynthesis and phosphorylation of NF subunits were investigated in PC 12 cells. While all three NF subunits were synthesized in PC 12 cells, NF-M and NF-H were synthesized as hypophosphorylated precursors. NF-M was shown to undergo a time-dependent decrease in electrophoretic mobility in both control and NGF treated cells, consistent with its undergoing post-translational phosphorylation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) administration resulted in increased biosynthesis of NF-L and NF-M, increased stability of both NF-L and the slowest migrating form of NF-M, as well as increased incorporation of phosphate into NF-H. A soluble pool of NF subunits was also found in PC 12 cells. Soluble NF-M and NF-H were synthesized as faster migrating electrophoretic forms. Soluble NF-M underwent a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation state, indicating that the extent of phosphorylation does not significantly affect the solubility of this NF subunit. The effect of NGF on NF gene expression PC 12 cells was further explored. NGF treatment resulted in time-dependent increases in the levels of all three NF subunits. However, increases in NF-H levels were delayed relative to those of NF-L and NF-M. NGF treatment resulted in 12- and 14-fold increases in NF-L and NF-M mRNA, respectively, as well as increased transcriptional activity of both genes.

However, NGF treatment was found not to affect the levels of NF-H mRNA nor the transcription rate of the NF-H gene, indicating that the effect of NGF on the biosynthesis of NF-H in PC 12 cells may occur at the translational or post-translational level.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz02z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35t926b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tv82s"><dcterms:title>The effect of protein structural configuration on the free enzyme kinetic behavior of urease /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lencki, Robert W.

A quasi-native kinetic model was developed that predicts enzyme activity by examining the effect of solute addition on the overall protein structure. The theory was tested using the enzyme urease (urea aminohydrolase EC 3.5.1.5). The quasi-native model was found to accurately predict both the activation and inhibition phenomena observed with urease and could also predict enzymatic activity in complex solute systems. The quasi-native isomerization constant was shown to be a function of hydrophobic effects characterized by the Sechenov theory and electrostatic effects characterized by the DeBye-Huckel theory. The Sechenov constant was found to be independent of temperature and pH. The urease denaturation rate constant displayed a response to solute addition similar to that observed with the quasi-native isomerization equilibrium constant. However, the effect of pH on urease kinetics was a complex function of the ionization of active-site ligands and enzyme surface charge interactions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Neufeld, R. J.

The best yields were obtained for the combination of zero or reduced-till and inorganic fertilizers. Zero-till resulted in increased soil density and soil water content and a slight accumulation of P and K in the surface layer of the clay soil. Manure improved soil physical properties especially when combined with zero-till, but resulted in lower N availability to the plants. The factors that limited plant yield in the clay site were plant population, soil nitrate content, bulk density and soil water content. Plant population was the only limiting factor in the sandy loam site.

The process depends on the expression of a number of plant and bacterial genes that are considered critical for the establishment and maintainance of the symbiotic state. The merits of a mutational approach to the analysis of symbiosis have been recognized for several years and transposon Tn5 mutagenesis of Rhizobium has led to the identification of several symbiotic genes. This study describes the use of Tn5 mutagenesis for the isolation of symbiotically defective mutants of Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Two classes, auxotrophic and cell surface-altered mutants defective in nodule formation, have been characterized. In B. japonicum USDA 122, histidine auxotrophs that are defective in nodulation have been studied. The mutagenized DNA region has been cloned and the wild-type DNA region isolated by hybridization and complementation. In B. japonicum 61A76, Tn5-induced cell surface-altered mutants have been isolated by selecting for bacteriophage resistance. Several parameters have been used to demonstrate alterations in cell surface components. It has been shown that the Tn5 insertion is not the primary cause of the mutation in two of the characterized mutants. Complementation tests have led to the isolation of a wild-type DNA-containing cosmid, pPS23A, that overcomes the symbiotic defect in one of the mutants. Analysis of the cell surface showed a partial restoration of surface components in the complemented mutant.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f96p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq43m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rhizobium japonicum.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microbial mutation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transposons.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp39x"><dcterms:title>Probes of quark matter formation in high energy 16O-nucleus collisions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sirois, Yves</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I present the measurements, analysis and results obtained with the NA34 experiment at the CERN European laboratory, on the global characteristics of particle production in ultra-relativistic oxygen-nucleus collisions, at incident energies of 60 and 200 GeV/nucleon.

From this analysis, novel information emerges concerning the mechanisms and space-time evolution of the soft-hadronic processes in short-lived extended volumes of matter at extreme densities and temperature.

One waste, peat runoff water (the waste-water that remains after the mining of peat), was found to be unsuitable for biological conversion to any product since it contained an insufficient quantity of carbon. The other waste, NVR (non-volatile residue, the major waste from the manufacture of nylon 6$ sp prime 6 sp prime$), was found to be a suitable carbon and energy source for the production of PHB (poly-$ beta$-hydroxybutyric acid) by Pseudomonas cepacia ATCC 17697. A general approach to the development of complex toxic wastes as fermentation substrates was formulated. NVR was found to be toxic to microorganisms. None grew in enrichment culture containing 2.0% NVR. P. cepacia was the most resistant microorganism found. It could grow well in up to 1.3% NVR. It also grew on butanoic, pentanoic, and hexanoic acid as well as 6-hexanolactone. These were found to be the major toxic components of NVR. P. cepacia was grown in a NVR-limited chemostat with a NVR feed concentration well in excess of the toxic NVR concentration. In nitrogen-limited, batch fermentation on fructose, P. cepacia accumulated PHB in excess of 50% of its dry weight. A 2-stage chemostat process for the production of PHB from NVR by P. cepacia was investigated with encouraging results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jx710.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk28n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Factory and trade waste -- Recycling</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6m311p99v"><dcterms:title>The need for pragmatism in epidemiology, illustrated in research on the determinants of estrogen receptor status in breast cancer /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rogers-Melamed, Iris</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A survey was planned to explore how estrogen receptor (ER) status of breast cancer was related to dietary and reproductive factors, in postmenopausal patients from Toronto.

Despite small numbers, the odds of positive ER status were found to be low for patients with many pregnancies and high for those with one or two pregnancies, but intermediate for cases who had never been pregnant.

It was demonstrated that such lesions are sufficient to impair performance on tasks that require memory for spatial information. Deficits were found in both working and reference memory paradigms, with more severe impairments in the former. Ability to discriminate spatial location was not affected when delay was minimal, but retention was progressively impaired as delay was increased. A dissociation in the effect of the lesions on performance of analogous spatial and nonspatial tasks was observed. The lesions did not impair the learning of a visual discrimination/reversal, or a conditioned taste aversion. It is concluded that lesions to the region of the mammillary bodies have a selective effect on spatial learning and memory.

To identify the polypeptide carrying the antigenic determinant, BALB/c mice were immunized with the enriched isolate and their splenic lymphocytes were fused with mouse plasmacytoma cells. Eight hybrids were cloned and produced MAbs that immunoprecipitated principally a single chain of MW 40,000 (p40) as well as minor chains of MW 25,000 (p25) and MW 13,000 (p13) which were probably degradation products of p40. On 2D gels, p40 was composed of 7 spots with a pI of 6.1 to 7.6, which was not altered by neuraminidase digestion. Affinity chromatography with MAb anti-p40 absorbed p40 and LAI activity. The bound and recovered fraction was enriched for p40 and LAI activity. Affinity-purified p40 contained the previously identified p25 and p13 as well as a MW 32,000 polypeptide (p32). MAb anti-p40 was directed to a common framework determinant on p40 since MAb anti-p40 bound to cancer cells from other organs. The lung cancer organ-specific determinant recognized by leukocytes from lung cancer patients was not recognized by the MAb. Affinity purified p40 triggered the LAI response for leukocytes from patients with lung cancer but not for leukocytes from control subjects or patients with colon cancer or malignant melanoma in blind testing. Partial cross-reactivity was observed with leukocytes from patients with breast cancer. Thus, a p40 molecule has been purified that is expressed on the membranes of lung cancer cells and triggers immunologically-mediated LAI.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m66f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch180</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d31t"><dcterms:title>A barotropic stability study of free and forced planetary waves /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fyfe, John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The stability of free and forced planetary waves in a $ beta$-channel is investigated with a barotropic model. The forced waves at equilibrium result from a constant mean-zonal wind interacting with a finite-amplitude topography. The frequencies of all infinitesimal perturbations to the equilibrium flows are determined numerically as a function of the flow parameters. The results are interpreted using a truncated spectral model and related to those of previous studies with infinite $ beta$-planes. In contrast to some earlier analytical studies we find that unstable long waves $(L sb{x}$ $&gt;$ $L sb{y})$ exist under superresonant conditions. We also report on the existence of an interesting travelling topographic instability. The linear instability of a weakly non-zonal flow is investigated numerically and analytically (via WKB theory). The theory reproduces the qualitative nature of the numerically-determined fastest-growing mode. Nonlinear integrations, involving many degrees of freedom, reveal that initially-infinitesimal disturbances may grow explosively to finite-amplitude. The longer-term integrations are interpreted using a statistical mechanical model.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs75g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d31t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rossby waves</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh448"><dcterms:title>Binding of epidermal growth factor and insulin in cells of bone and tooth as revealed by radioautography</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1986</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martineau-Doizé, Béatrice, 1949-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In vivo binding assays using radioautography were employed to visualize epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin receptors in bone and the enamel organ of the rat.
