It is the purpose of this thesis to describe the occurence of these bodies as fully as possible. The information has been obtained from a suite of ore specimens and representative rock specimens collected by the author while employed by the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company. Dr. A. R.

As always, the systematic development of supporting historical and institutional data goes on behind the front-runners. This thesis is concerned mainly with the former of these developments. It deals with the monetary aspects of private investment in a single sector of the economy, and attempts to resolve certain differences between the traditional and the modern approaches to money matters. As such, it might be called a study in the applied theory of interest. Expressed otherwise, the thesis examines the financial mechanism by means of which the gap between savings and investment in the mortgage market was bridged in Great Britain. The most general conclusion drawn from the study is that the institutional framework distorted the allocation of loanable funds and served to impede the functioning of the price mechanism. This being the case, a monetary policy based on the assumption of a freely operating price system in the money market was bound to be unrealistic. The contributions of this thesis fall under three headings. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marsh, D.

Using this technique the neutron deficient mass spectra of strontium, indium, and gallium were surveyed, extracting th~se. ~~om targets of rubidium chloride, cadmium and zinc, respectively, activated in the proton beam of the McGill cyclotron.

This procedure requires the rat to jump at one of two cards bearing the patterns to be discriminated. On the basis of Laehley’s extensive anatomical and behavioural studies it has been assumed that the cards fall within the rat’s binocular field of vision and, consequently, that they are seen as a whole at the time when the visual patterns begin to influence behaviour during discrimination learning. Ehrenfreund (1948), however, thought that the rat’s effective field, in the Lashley jumping apparatus, might be limited to the lower margin of the cards, and has demonstrated this experimentally in certain conditions of training. Since Ehrenfreund’s data  have been interpreted as bearing on the current continuity-noncontinuity controversy concerning the nature of learning, his experiment is of general importance. Ehrenfreund trained his rats on a modified Lashley jumping apparatus to discriminate between an upright and an inverted triangle in two differing experimental situations. In one condition, the triangles were raised eight centimetres above the bottom margin of the cards. The platform from which the rats jumped, as in the usual procedure, remained level with the platform on which they found food. In the second, the platform was also raised, so that the rats were jumping at the centre of the cards where the triangles were now located. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.

Since both the proportions and the detailed structure of these regions have great influence on physical properties, auch as tenacity and flexibility, the adsorption of liquids and gases and on the ability of the fibers to swell in liquids, their measurement is of considerable interest. A chemical analogy of the strictly physical definition, divides the fiber into accessible and inaccessible regions, the accessible portion being defined as that into which the reagent can penetrate. Since the amount of accessible material may be inereased by swelling or decreased by crystallization depending on the nature of the reaction, the estimates from various reactions usually differ. Nor will the amorphous region necessarily coincide with the accessible, the one being arrived at by a truly physical measurement, the other resulting from the imposition of a chemical reaction upon an already complex physical system. This concept of accessibility, however, continues to arouse wide interest since the processing of cellulosic materials, of major importance to most countries, necessarily depends upon the chemical behavior of the fibers, rather than on their ultimate x-ray pattern.

In this same article, it is shown that for certain finite groups, such as the cyclic group of order 4, there are infinitely many classes of indecomposable representations under unimodular equivalence.  A natural method for studying these problems of arithmetical representation theory would be the P-adic approach.  As a first step in this direction, using the methods of Hensel and R. Brauer, we will show that the theory of representations of a finite group, over a ring of P-adic integers can always be brought back to the modular case, insofar as it is concerned with questions of unimodular equivalence, reduction and deomposition.  More particularly, we will show that for any finite group, if P is a generator of the maximal ideal in the ring of P-adic intergers considered, and if Pko is the highest power of P dividing the order of the group, then unimodular equivalence may be considered module Pk, for any k &gt; ko , while unimodular reduction and decomposition may be considered module Pk, for any k &gt; 2 ko, without any loss of generality.  As a corollary, we will show that if P does not divide the order of the group, then all questions of unimodular equivalence reduction and decomposition are completely equivalent to these same questions, module P.

The only area in which fish have been subjected to parasitological studies is the Strait of Georgia. Again when the extensive investigations of parasites of fish found in European waters, in the North American Atlantic, in Japan and other localities are brought to one’s attention, it is evident that we must know little concerning the parasitic fauna of Canadian Pacific fish and the distribution of these parasites. Parasitological investigations of fish in the neighbouring United States and Alaskan Pacific no doubt contribute to our knowledge of what we might expect in the way of parasites in fish from the coastal waters of British Columbia, as most of the species of fish occurring in Canadian waters have a distribution range from Alaska to California. Studies of this nature have been more frequent in the United States than in Canada, but the parasitic fauna can still be considered as largely unknown. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.

Since then numerous attempts have been made to measure and evaluate clinically the gastric potential difference, but the work has progressed slowly because ef technical difficulties, and the complex nature of the gastric function.

Geology and petrology are important aids in the search for new stone. Study of the features of better eastern Canadian “granites” suggests a set of rules which may prove useful in indicating first, the localities in which “granite” should be sought and second, the desirable qualities of a marketable stone. A graphic analysis is made of “granite” production during the years 1925 to 1949. It is suggested that the “granite” producing industry could strengthen its economic position by advertising, improving quarrying techniques, co-operative use of central finishing plants and providing better grades of “granite”.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kranck, E.

Many authors have attempted to construct mathematical expressions for this cyclic growth, in addition to ideal growth curves as an aid in the study of bionomics.  Some of these will be dealt with later in this thesis where they prove relevant to the theme.  The term “cyclic growth” may be broken down into its constituent parts: (a) it is well known that growth or increase in the bodily dimensions of an animal (or plant) can occur in two main ways, viz. (1) by increase in cell number (cell division); (2) by increase in the size of the cells already present.  (Of course, production of cell products may also be considered growth.)  The two modes of growth are not mutually exclusive. (b) The definition of “cycle” put forth by KLEITMAN (1949) will be used in this thesis, viz., “A cycle ..... is a repetitive series of events or successive changes of states, thus being either qualitative or quantitative in nature, and its own distinctive feature is one of order of occurrence, rather than duration.  Cycles are intrinsic in origin; they may be influenced by inernal and/or external conditions, which affect them quantitatively, but seldom qualitatively.”[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boyes, J.

The succeeding pages are principally concerned with a study of the geology of southern Pascalis township, a review of the evidence upon which the propositions are based and a discussion of experimental results which prove the deductions to be true with regard to certain rocks of the area studied. The propositions are: 1. If certain conditions are fulfilled, many minerals will exhibit the phenomena of luminescence. 2. In most cases, one of the important conditions for luminescence is the presence within the mineral of small amounts of trace elements which are foreign to the pure mineral and which may modify the crystal lattice. 3. During the emplacement of eruptive bodies, or their subsequent metamorphism, small amounts of trace elements are distributed in special arrangements relative to the bodies, either within or adjacent to their boundaries. This probably applies regardless of the size of the eruptive. 4. Some of the trace elements of Proposition 3 may either form independent minerals, occur in the lattices of the rock forming minerals or cause the formation of lattice imperfections. From these propositions, it may be logically deduced: 1. Luminescent minerals should be found in or adjacent to many bodies of eruptive rocks. 2. The distribution of the luminescent minerals and the trace elements should bear some close relationship to each other. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevenson, J.

For example, in paper sizing it is almost impossible to apply the desired amount without making the drying process too slow, because ao much water has to be used to produee good flow characteristies. Oxidized starches are used very satisfactorily to reduee or eliminate such difficulties. They have greater colloidal stability, thus higher concentrations may be used in sizing. Their adhesive properties are better than those of native starch. The oxidizing agent is considered to change hydroxyl groups in the glucose units of starch to carbonyl and carboxyl groups and to decrease the molecular weight. It is probable that different oxidants show a preference for different types of hydroxyl group because the appearance and behaviour of oxystarches produced with different oxidants are different. Present knowledge of the chemistry of oxidized starches is scanty, although one or two detailed structural investigations have been made. In particular the widespread use of bleaching agents containing chlorine, and of the halogens themselves, as modifying agents for starch and cellulose has not yet been complemented by a fundamental study of the reactions involved. The present thesis attempts to fill at least a portion of this gap in knowledge. Purified wheat starch was chosen for the investigation because this species is one of major economic importance in Canada. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

Entamoeba histobtica, Sohaudinn 1903, in man, and Entamoeba invadens, Rodhain 1934, in snakes, are the only two species known to invade host tissue. In 1930 Sanders and Cleveland described a new species, Entamoeba terrapinae, from the terrapin, Chrysemys elegans. Since then no further work has been pablished on this amoeba, and much information regarding it is still wanting. According to Sanders and Cleveland the life-cycle of E. terrapinae differs from any other life history of a parasitic amoeba heretofore described. As their observations have not been confirmed it was deemed advisable to reinvestigate the life-cycle of this parasite. A number of species of parasitic amoebae have been described in turtles by various workers. In many of these the specific identity, which was established on inadequate morphological study, is still in doubt. In some cases size alone was the characteristic used for differentiating a species.

But the problem of Elisabethan shorthand has been thoroughly investigated by competent scholars, and their findings convince me that there was no contemporary system capable of reproducing the best reported parts of Q from performance in the theatre.  Surely, on the basis of the shorthand theory, we should have to assume an extraordinarily low standard of accuracy in the actors of Shakespeare’s company to account for the wholesale memorial corruption also observable in Q.  The only reasonable hypothesis seems to me to be that the ‘gross corruption, constant mutilation, meaningless inversion and clumsy transposition’ in Q are solely the result of inept memorial reconstruction.  It is my further belief that Q is a report of an original in substantial agreement with the F text.  I propose now to adduce fresh evidence pointing to the conclusion that the Q text is indeed memorial; at the same time attempting to show that the theories which represent Q as a first sketch of the F text or a farce interlude adapted from F are untenable.

In particular there is not a single systematic investigation of the effects of temporal-lobe damage in man, althrough there are several isolated and highly suggestive reports of individual cases.  Fortunately the situation is quite different with regard to animal work, where the last few years have yielded numerous reports dealing with the effects of temporal-lobe lesions of varying extent on the learning ability of lower primates.  This material is highly relevant to the present investigation, since it draws attention to types of deficit which might well be found at the human level also, but which have been neglected; for this reason the animal data will be presented in some detail, before passing to a review of the clinical literature.  Since the present study deals only with cognitive functions, there will be no detailed discussion of the emotional changes often seen in temporal-lobe damage.  In the monkey, a decrease in emotional reactivity regularly follows deep-temporal removals (Brown and Schafer, 1888; Kluver and Bucy, 1938; Bard, 1950; Thomson and Walker, 1951; Mishkin, 1951; Poirier, 1952); in man, electrographic abnormality in the anterior temporal region frequently gives rise to personality disturbances (Bailey and Gibbs, 1949) [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hebb, D.

The discovery of this method is usually ascribed to one of the early alchemists although Von Lippman (1) claims that the Greeks had already used steam baths in their study of the sciences many years before. The sugar industry has been the greatest single contributor to evaporator design in the modern sense of the word. The quarter century 1800-1825 saw the development of the first vacuum pans for the concentration or sugar. One of the earliest was the “Roth Pan”, which appeared about 1825. Based on an original idea advanced by Howard in 1812, it utilized the direct condensation of vapour in presence of cooling water. Multiple effect evaporation came into use eometime during the period 1840-1850, when N. Rillieux built an evaporator based on this principle in Louisiana in 1843. This apparatus was covered by patent (2), but does not seem to be the first to describe the principle of multiple effects. Apparently Peclet (3) suggested using vapour from a boiling liquid to heat a second boiler, but never developed the idea practically. Other workers about this time were Pecquer, who described a multiple effect under pressure in a single body in 1834, and Degrande, who used a type of film evaporator for sugar juices heated by vapour from a first effect. Neither of these evaporators came into general use. Rillieux’s evaporator was of the type now known as horizontal tube, steam inside type. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gauvin, W.

These include the need for social contacts, for cultural expression, for the organization of action, and for group concern for the common good. The group plays a vital role in meeting these needs and in the preservation of our democracy. It is the practical training ground where people learn both the form and the practice of democratic living. Miss Coyle has pointed out that, “Many of them (groups) are permeated with the basic homespun relations of mutual respect, orderly procedures and common consent out of which the larger framework of political, economic, and social democracy must evolve. Because of the importance of group life in our democratic society this study has attempted to get a picture of group activities among Jewish teen agers in Indianapolis. Because group activity deals with that period of leisure time that is available after all necessary chores and tasks have been completed, the study is primarily concerned with the problem or how this leisure time is spent. The fact that the manner in which this leisure time is used is a matter or some concern to parents of teen agers and to the teen agers themselves is attested to by the comments made to the writer by several parents. Typical of these comments are the following. “Our teen agers are wasting their time.” “Our high school children are lazy. They show no creativity in their after-school activities.”[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m265f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451m90s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hd014"><dcterms:title>The reaction of 2,3-dibromoindone with pyridine.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Redkevitch, Zenon.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this work was to synthesize the 2,3-dibromo-inden-2-one-1 by the method of Roser; and to study the reaction of this compound with pyridine and with the three methyl-pyridines.

Studies have shown this insect to be vulnerable in the adult stage to stomach and contact insecticides. Investigations to control the adult fly with contact and stomach insecticides have culminated in the recommendation of DDT (Andison et al 1951). The possible destruction of the maggot and emerging adult with contact insecticides, and the immobile pupae with soil fumigants, has received attention by some workers, but without any notable success. The development of newer soil fumigants and insecticides has provided opportunity for further study on this phase of the control problem. The present paper presents results obtainad from the use of the fumigants ethylene dibromide and DD and the insecticides BHO and dieldrin, tested in the laboratory, against dormant currant fruit fly pupae, and the insecticides BHC, DDT, and chlordane, tested in the laboratory, against the larvae entering the soil. The fumigant ethylene dibromide was further tested in the field against dormant, prediapausing and diapausing pupae at different rates, depths, and under conditions of cultivation and no cultivation. The affect of the soil temperature and soil moisture on the efficacy of ethylene dibromide was considered. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morrison, F.

A survey of the literature in this field indicates that enuresis is not a clinical entity to which one can ascribe a single cause, but rather it is a symptom of an underlying emotional disturbance. If the enuretic child is to be helped with his problem, it is of vital importance to study each individual case in order to discover how that child is reacting to his environment and how his particular social experiences have affected him. Much material has been written about those experiences in early childhood which can create feelings of insecurity in the child and may lead to deeper disturbances later on in life. Enuresis can be viewed as an earlier manifestation of these disturbances. It is generally accepted that the most potent of all influences on social behaviour is derived from the “Primary social experience with the mother” during the oral stage. In this period the mother should be devoted to satisfying the demands made by the infant who is ruled by his impulses, and strives only to gratify his most primitive needs. The loving care and attention with which these needs are met is of vital importance to the infant’s sense of well-being and security. If he receives this, he will later learn to give up the pleasure derived from the immediate satisfaction of his instinctual needs [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Irvine, L.

The case records, however, leave much to be desired as regards the aphasic (or, if one desires, dysphasic) disturbances. The cases personally observed have been used to determine the type of disturbance; only whether any disturbance is present or not is noted in the others. In 1946, Dr. Preston Robb summarized in his thesis the effect on speech of excising various cortical areas in some of these cases. He also began assisting Dr. Penfield in the operating room during the period of stimulation. The author took over this work in 1948. The following represents an attempt to fulfill the requirement of “a clear statement of the author’s claim of original work or contribution to knowledge”. In his previous thesis (1949) the author presented the effects on speech of cortical stimulation. The only additions since that time are the production of misnaming without perseveration in the left Broca’s and supplementary motor areas and an increased number of “aphasic types of responses” in the supplementary motor area during electrical arrest. The Rolandic regions of both hemispheres and the right supplementary motor area function only for the motor control of speech organs. The left Broca’s, parieto-temporal and supplementary motor areas all have the same function in relation to speech.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Penfield, W.

When these insecticides were applied, as controls for certain insect pests, it was found that in almost every case populations of mites increased to such an extent that further chemicals were required to control the mites. Theories were early advanced, and later substantiated, that the newer insecticides, particularly DDT, were harmful to predators of mites. Mites increased to tramendous populations when released from the control previouely exercised by their predators. It, therefore, became imperative for economic entomologists not only to find newer and better acaricides, but also to determine through biological studies what arthropods are predacious on plant-feeding mites. This study belongs to the latter category. It was initiated in 1950 with a threefold objective: to determine what species of Tetranyohid mites are of economic importance in Manitoba; what predators are present for natural control; and what relative value each predator bas as a natural control factor. The information contained herein was accumulated during the years 1950 and 1951. Prior to this time no work had been done on predators of mites in Manitoba. In two years the important mite species and their principal predators have been identified.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.

Segall described a reaction between hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine and cellulose trinitrate in which a stable cellulose “mono-oxime dinitrate” was formed. A gas, predominantly nitrous oxide but containing some nitrogen, was evolved. Segall also found that cellulose trinitrate reacted with free hydroxylamine in pyridine to yield one mole of nitrogen and a cellulose “dinitrate”. His attempts to discover whether the “labile” nitrate group occupied the second, third or sixth positions in the glucose units of the cellulose trinitrate led to indecisive results. In these circumstances Hayward reverted to a simpler, crystalline compound, methyl-ß-D-glucopyranoside tetranitrate, for his study of the denitrating action of the free base hydroxylamine in pyridine. Hayward in his Ph.D. thesis (1949) reported that 1.26 moles of nitrogen gas was evolved from each mole of the methyl-ß-D-glucoside tetranitrate and a syrupy mixture of methylglucoside di- and trinitrates was formed. The reaction seemed to follow the same mechanism as with cellulose trinitrate, but it was not specific for any one nitrate group. The present investigation was initiated to study the action of hydroxylrumine hydrochloride in pyridine on methyl-ß-D-glucoside tetranitrate, and parallels the work of Hayward on the system employing hydroxylamine as a free base.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.
