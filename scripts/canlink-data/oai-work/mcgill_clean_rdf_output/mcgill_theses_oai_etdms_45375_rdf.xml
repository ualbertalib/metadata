Finally, with the surrender of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe a large number of new countries are seeking after closer ties with the western market areas. These changes did not leave air transport matters untouched. The development towards an internal market has led to substantial changes in the EEC legislation on these external relations. As a concrete outcome of these changes a draft agreement between two EFTA countries and the EEC has been negotiated, which may indicate the form of further cooperation between EEC and non-EEC countries in air transport matters. This thesis was submitted in the summer/autumn of 1991, a few months before the successful negotiation of a European Economic Area (EEA) which embodies such further cooperation. ftn$ sp1$EES - A Historic Step towards a New Europe (3/90) EFTA Bulletin 1 at 1. quad $ sp2$Hereinafter referred to as EEC. quad $ sp3$Hereinafter referred to as EFTA.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s910.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g80c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jm58z"><dcterms:title>Welfare reform in Quebec : implications for single mothers and their children</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Russell, Regena Kaye</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the process of welfare policy-making in Quebec with respect to single mothers and their children. Historically, traditional notions of the role of women in society and the distinction between "deserving" and "undeserving" poor have inhibited adequate social assistance for single mothers. Chapter 1 examines the 1937 Needy Mother's Assistance Act, the first state assistance program for single mothers in Quebec. Chapter 2 discusses the ideological basis for present-day welfare policy making. The liberal feminist commitment to gender neutrality and acceptance of the marketplace economic model have abetted recent attacks on the Motherwork norm in welfare policy and thus reinforced existing disadvantages of single mothers. Chapter 3 examines the Quebec welfare policy-making process embodied in the 1987 position paper Towards an Income Security Policy and subsequent parliamentary commission hearings. The Return to School Program for single parents, and other provisions, with their renewed emphasis on the marketplace and their attack on the Tender Years Presumption, left single mothers effectively worse off under the new Income Security Act.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g623w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jm58z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Work.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Public and Social Welfare.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f4626608"><dcterms:title>Curriculum implementation : a study in two secondary schools in Kenya</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kelwon, Isaiah K.

In this study, the case method was used to investigate implementation in two secondary schools in Baringo district, Kenya. Data were collected using observation, interviews, questionnaires, and audio recordings. Implementation standards were found to be rather low because of a number of factors. The general laboratories in the two schools of the study were poorly equipped, and textbooks available to students were too few. Moreover, the textbooks were reported as being shallow and sketchy. In addition, the content of some topics was too difficult especially at the lower secondary (Forms I and II) level. The syllabus was also too wide for satisfactory coverage in the four-year duration of secondary education. An additional problem found was that there were no inservice courses for the biology teachers. It was also found that the head teachers played a limited role as instructional supervisors because most of their time was spent on administrative duties.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h999w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4626608</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>High schools -- Curricula</dc:subject><dc:subject>High schools -- Kenya</dc:subject><dc:subject>Curriculum planning</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644s67p"><dcterms:title>La mesure de l'expression : physiognomonie et caractère dans la Nouvelle méthode de Jean-Jacques Lequeu</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bédard, Jean-François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The work of Jean-Jacques Lequeu (1757-1826) is often used by architectural historians to demonstrate the erosion of the principles of classical architecture at the end of the eighteenth century.

The similarities between the Nouvelle Methode and the Dissertation sur les especes naturelles by the Dutch naturalist Petrus Camper (1722-1789) show the importance of the notion of caractere in the structure of knowledge of the classical age as portrayed by Michel Foucault. Simultaneously a theory of physionomy and a theory of architecture, the Nouvelle Methode demonstrates that the theory of caractere in both disciplines, far from announcing the birth of the modern age, is central to the pursuit of order which sustained architecture in the classical age.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt95t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s67p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lequeu, Jean-Jacques, 1757-ca. 1825.

The results revealed the importance of the power flow analysis as a sensitive tool for describing coordination disabilities. Similar muscle phenomena were reflected through the functional movement phases of both ability groups. However, the variability in the number of phases increased as a function of the task complexity. The statistical comparison of selected kinematic and dynamic parameters revealed significantly higher peaks for the able-bodied movement profiles. The analysis also demonstrated that the movement deficiencies observed in Parkinson's Disease cannot simply be attributed to the pure force production by the joint musculature.

Eight ACL and eight PCL injured subjects performed active and passive anterior-posterior knee drawer tests. These tests were performed during two sessions to verify their reliability. Posterior and anterior laxity were recorded for the PCL and the ACL injured subjects, respectively. Laxity was measured at forces of 60, 90 and 130 Newtons.

Results revealed a significant anterior tibial shift (p $&lt;$.05) in the PCL injured patients when comparing active to passive tests. No significant anterior tibial shift occurred in the ACL injured patients when performing the same comparison. The Genucom produced reliable results across two sessions for both PCL and ACL groups.

Atherosclerotic lesions have displayed an altered GAG content and distribution. Diabetes is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis, but no information is available on the arterial GAGs in human diabetes. To improve our understanding of the atherogenic proccss we examined GAGs in normal and atherosclerotic intima of nondiabetic and type-II diabetic humans. Intima was stripped from the autopsy samples of thoracic aortas, normal and plaque areas were separated. GAGs were isolated by delipidatlon, proteolytic digestion, and precipitation. They were assayed biochemically and their distribution evaluated by electrophoresis and densitometry. Results indicate a significant decrease in total GAGs and a change in GAG distribution in plaques of nondiabetics. Similar changes of lesser magnitude were found in normal intima of diabetics, while changes in plaque areas were more pronounced. This indicates that changes in arterial GAGs precede the development of lesions in diabetes and may be important in atherogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd55c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225c12k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mw39g"><dcterms:title>Informed consent and the right to refuse medical treatment : a comparative study of common-law Canada and Japan</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tomita, Kiyomi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Common law in Canada recognizes the rights to self-determination and autonomy and the right of competent persons to decide for themselves on medical treatment which includes the right to refuse all treatment.

Initially inspired by the rationalist trend and discussion of scientific matters in the classical Jewish religious sources, he succeeded in linking these traditionally sanctioned modes of thought to the burgeoning field of nineteenth century science. Slonimski thought that the dissemination of scientific knowledge among the traditionalist Jewish readership would strengthen their commitment to rationalism and the belief in progress, fundamental principles of liberalism, and thus facilitate the secularization and modernization of Eastern European Jewry. He was eminently successful in his strategy of using the holy tongue, Hebrew, to popularize modern science among his traditional readers. His periodical Ha-Tsefirah (The Herald) represents a significant and unique contribution to the advancement of the Jewish Enlightenment's program among Eastern European Jewry.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p44m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb86x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Slonimski, Ḥayyim Selig, 1810-1904</dc:subject><dc:subject>Haskalah -- Biography</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc82p"><dcterms:title>Commodity markets : a case study of coffee and tea in the United States</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Banerjee, Ruchira</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Historical evidence has shown that increases in coffee prices, though generating a short term gain in export earnings for producers, also lead to increased plantings of the coffee crop.

The establishment of the International Coffee Agreements was meant to stabilize this fluctuating behaviour in coffee prices. The purpose of this paper is to present an overall analysis of coffee prices in order to predict the future course of prices under two circumstances. First, when the international coffee market is governed by the mandates of the International Coffee Agreements and secondly, when the market operates under free market conditions. The paper also attempts to draw parallels between the structure and mechanisms of the markets of coffee and tea. The first part of this paper provides a background study of the markets of coffee and tea including a discussion of the commodity cartels which have been signed to date in both markets. Part two provides a historical analysis of prices in both markets, followed by an econometric analysis of the demand for coffee in the largest consuming country in the world, the United States.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r03k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc82p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Coffee industry -- United States.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Commodity exchanges -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tea trade -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mk14v"><dcterms:title>Die Grimmschen Märchen als Kinderliteratur in der Elementarschulerziehung in der "DDR" : zur literatur-pädagogischen Rezeption der KHM im Gänsefüsschenland</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Menzel, Agnes M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is a well established fact that Grimms' fairy tales have been adapted by the Grimm brothers to suit the taste of middle class Europeans in the 19th and 20th centuries.

This thesis presents the theoretical discussion in East Germany (the GDR, "DDR") which served as a rationale for using some of these fairy tales in the socialist education of children, and outlines the ideologically motivated selection of the fairy tales. The thesis analyzes the DDR regulations, which governed education in kindergarten and elementary school as well as in (after school) day-care programmes. It shows the extent to which Grimms' fairy tales were used in socialistic teaching of children. It is clear that the fairy tales selected and edited by the Grimm brothers to cater to the taste of the 19th century bourgeois were also considered effective in the teaching of values to children in a socialistic society.

Experiment 1 confirmed that NMDA-induced lesions of the PPTg block the development of a conditioned place preference to morphine. Subsequently, morphine-induced analgesia was found to be reduced, but not eliminated. The reduction of reward was not significantly correlated with loss of choline acetyltransferase containing neurons in the PPTg. In Experiment 2, PPTg lesions did not affect morphine analgesia in drug naive animals, but produced motor abnormalities and blocked the morphine-induced depression of spontaneous motor activity and catalepsy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s68z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk979</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rats -- Behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mesencephalic tegmentum.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Morphine -- Physiological effect.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analgesia.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gp48p"><dcterms:title>Biochemical characterization of rat colonic mucin species in response to Entamoeba histolytica</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tse, Sil-King</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Colonic mucins bind to the E. histolytica Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin and inhibit amoebic adherence to and lysis of epithelial cells.

The findings from this study allow for physically awkward children to be characterized as having abilities for success during the recovery of the sprinting stride. Identifying abilities represents an approach that focusses on a positive view into physical awkwardness, a view which has traditionally been negative.

A dynamical model in conjunction with a microphysical model designed to predict evolution of cloud droplet spectra, is employed to perform a two-dimensional simulation of a small nonprecipitating cumulus cloud in the presence of wind shear. Results show that vortex circulations and penetrative downdrafts are responsible for entrainment of clear air into the cloud structure. Entrainment and mixing are more severe on the downshear side of the cloud leading to a more fragmented structure and often to total dissipation of cloudy air rather than partial dilution as is the case on the upshear side. Mixing followed by uplifting leads to fresh activation of cloud droplets and results in multimodal spectra. In areas where mixing has occurred, the spectra exhibit smaller average radius and larger standard deviation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182m31x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707958869</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290b626"><dcterms:title>Factors affecting occupational injury rates : an analysis of Canadian data</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>La Novara, Pina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis focuses on the issue of occupational injuries. There are four different explanations of why accident rates vary. A set of research hypotheses were created based on these explanations. Multivariate regression analyses of aggregate secondary data were used to test four hypotheses. The findings of these analyses indicate that establishment size, unionization rates and strike and lockout rates are related to injury rates but earnings are not. A fifth hypothesis was tested using the mining industry of Ontario as a case study. This analysis indicates that safety-related legislative and regulatory changes were not effective in reducing either fatal injuries or non-fatal injuries.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107016z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290b626</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Industrial accidents -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Industrial safety -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nm64m"><dcterms:title>Dynamic optimization of job distribution on machine tools using time decomposition into constant job-mix stages</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Natarajan, Subramanian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the development, analysis and application of a new method to optimize the allocation of jobs on machine tools. The benefits of this method are derived through time-decomposition of the scheduling horizon. The decomposition scheme is based on the scheduled flow of jobs i.e., the input of jobs to the shop floor and their departure after processing. The partitioning procedure divides the planning horizon into 'stages', or time periods, at which the job-mix remains constant. The optimization of job allocation is carried out within each partition and successive stages are treated sequentially. The dynamic nature of the problem is such that the solution at a stage affects the boundary conditions of the subsequent stage. The Constant Job-Mix Stage (CMS) algorithm developed to solve the job allocation problem, accounts of the setup times and enables one to obtain integer solutions while reducing slack on machines and enforcing due date on jobs. The application of the algorithm is demonstrated for three different cases. The first two cases focus on single operation jobs and represent two different approaches to scheduling. The third case deals with the assignment of multiple operation jobs to machine tools which are grouped according to processes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386k51j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm64m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, System Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h303n"><dcterms:title>The legal aspects of access to the geostationary orbit /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zdravic, Dusica</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main issue affecting the access to the geostationary orbit is how to reconcile freedom of access, inherent in any res communes regime, with equitable sharing of accessed benefits in the geostationary orbit, where the high potential for mutual interference among two or more satellites requires extensive coordination and often entails compromise of optimal configuration for telecommunication satellite systems. The Outer Space Treaty has established the basic principles of international law applicable to outer space: the common interest principle; the non-appropriation principle; the freedom principle. The ITU has adopted two regulatory regimes that govern the access and use of the geostationary orbit: the first-come, first-served regime (general rule); and the a priori plans (exception). The legislation of the US, a country with the largest number of satellites in the geostationary orbit, is discussed. At the domestic level, the US has adopted the open entry policy, which it will be able to maintain to the extent that the international approach to orbit/spectrum management provides for continued availability of requested satellite assignments. At the international level, the US is committed to the global communications satellite system (INTELSAT). However, deregulatory trends in the satellite market and the rulings of the FCC developed the transborder policy and the separate systems policy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k6192.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h303n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zp569"><dcterms:title>Selected legal aspects of commercial remote-sensing : bilateral regulations and proprietary provision relative to LANDSAT, SPOT, MOS-1, ERS-1 and RADARSAT</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Salin, Patrick A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses several contracts which regulate the relationship between organizations which own or operate remote-sensing satellites and the organizations which receive satellite transmitted data. The first part is a descriptive part which stresses the importance of the national environment. The second part deals with the study of the contracts. Those which are commercially oriented are very elaborated in order to create a team spirit with the local organization. It starts with a study of the evolution of the Landsat contracts when this satellite was alone of its kind in the Western world. Then it studies the impact on the contracts of the early commercialization process and compares the new contracts with those established by newly arrived and competing organizations in the market. Finally, it studies similar provisions set by the European system and by the Canadian system. The third part focuses on the impact of the copyright conventions on remote-sensing data protection. It shows that even though this protection is expressed by means of various warnings and "ad-hoc" clauses, this protection is still mostly formal.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b966.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp569</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Business Administration, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remote Sensing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qq69h"><dcterms:title>Role of epithelial cells of the male excurrent duct system of the rat in the endocytosis or secretion of sulfated glycoprotein-2</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wright, Janice Gail</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Light (LM) and electron (EM) microscope immunocytochemistry were used to investigate the distribution of SGP-2 in the rete testis, efferent ducts and epididymis. Intense immunolabeling was observed in the apical and supranuclear regions of the epithelial cells lining the rete testis and efferent ducts which, under EM observation, corresponded to a labeling of the cell's endocytic apparatus. Sperm in the lumen of the efferent ducts were unreactive. The strongest immunolabeling was observed in the caput epididymidis, but demonstrated variable intensities of labeling from cell to cell. More detailed EM observation of labeled principal cells revealed gold particles over the cell's secretory apparatus. Results suggest that testicular SGP-2 dissociates from sperm during passage through the rete testis and efferent ducts, where it is endocytosed by the epithelial cells lining these regions. Testicular SGP-2 is subsequently replaced by epididymal SGP-2, which is secreted by epididymal principal cells. Furthermore, the principal cells of the epididymis appear to be in different functional states with respect to the secretion of epididymal SGP-2 within a given region and in different regions of the duct.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tn162.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qq69h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0c483k48g"><dcterms:title>Population, time and medication histories in research on NSAIDs</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Van Staa, T.

Three related studies were conducted using virtually complete longitudinal information, drawn from 36 Dutch pharmacies (1988, 83,000 NSAIDs prescriptions). Firstly, studies that use prescription information must assign a number of days of therapy to each prescription, traditionally a fixed period. If this window is made unduly long, then validity is compromised. Fixed windows could also confound comparisons between age-gender strata and drugs. Secondly, analyses based on two assumptions for estimation of the duration of use after dispensing showed substantive differences between NSAIDs in the distribution of patterns and histories of exposure and various other risk factors. Thirdly, switching of one NSAID to another occurred rather frequently within a proxy duration of use, especially in people with a history of unstable usage patterns of NSAIDs. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated the importance of patterns and histories of exposure in pharmaco-epidemiology.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj81h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483k48g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff365617r"><dcterms:title>System identification of the reflex contribution to human ankle dynamics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Perreault, Eric Jon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Previous studies of the human stretch reflex have been limited by difficulties separating the reflex response from those due to passive and intrinsic joint properties. This study has presented and experimentally verified a method for separately determining these contributions to the human ankle response, and used this technique to assess the reflex contribution to joint dynamics during the application of a stochastic position perturbation. Although this method was applied to the human ankle, it is readily applicable to any intact joint. The results of this analysis showed that most of the neuromuscular response could be accounted for by two parallel pathways: one for the stretch reflex dynamics, and another for the intrinsic joint stiffness. The estimated nonparametric model accounted for 92% of the measured torque variance between 0.5-25Hz, and greater than 94% of the variance between 5-12Hz, where the stretch reflex was found to be most effective.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p151s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365617r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Anatomy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
