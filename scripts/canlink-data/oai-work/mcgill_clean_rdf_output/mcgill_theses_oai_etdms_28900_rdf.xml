General scattering rate equations are obtained for coherent diffuse scattering. We find, as expected, that the diffuse scattering rate is small compared to the coherent scattering rate in a medium with low fluctuations allowing an effective Hamiltonian description. However, for a more turbulent background, it is still possible to have more significant contributions to the diffuse scattering which may affect the existing theory of neutrino flavor conversion (MSW effect).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burgess, Clifford P.

The study consisted of two parts. The first is a descriptive census of BPD infants (n = 38) followed at the outpatient clinics at The Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH). The second is a cross-sectional study of fifteen patients wherein anthropometric parameters, energy intake, and oxidative stress measures (red cell glutathione (GSH) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA)) were assessed. Nine infants with growth failure were compared to six thriving infants with respect to their nutritional and oxidative stress status. Growth failure was defined as weight for age and weight for height for age less than the tenth percentile (z score $ leq - 1).$ Results revealed that the prevalence of growth failure in the BPD infants followed at MCH ranged between 45% and 55%. The mean ($ pm$ SD) energy intakes for thriving and failing to thrive infants expressed as a percent of the recommended nutrient intake were 104 $ pm$ 46% and 133 $ pm$ 35% respectively. Six infants had reduced mean ($ pm$ SD) blood glutathione per hemoglobin (3.63 $ pm$ 0.37 umol/g) compared to adult controls (6.57 $ pm$ 1.04 umol/g). Four of the six infants had growth failure while two were thriving. Fourteen Infants including all failing to thrive infants had elevated mean ($ pm$ SD) plasma MDA levels compared to adult controls (129 $ pm$ 48 vs 55 $ pm$ 3 nmol/l). Differences in oxidative stress markers were not observed between the two groups. These results suggest that growth failure is associated with an increase in caloric consumption and not with a decrease in caloric intake. The preliminary findings on oxidative stress markers suggest a depletion of the GSH antioxidant in some infants and marked lipid peroxidation in the BPD population.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kopelman, Hinda (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b72f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xw26d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pediatric respiratory diseases -- Nutritional aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia -- Nutritional aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adf65v913v"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of the saccular elements of cytoplasmic droplets from rat epididymal spermatozoa</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chan, Peter Tze Kin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cytoplasmic droplet, a small localized outpouching of cytoplasm of epididymal spermatozoa of unknown biological significance, contains numerous saccular elements as the near exclusive membranous component.

Immunocytochemical studies at the light and electron microscopic levels further revealed the saccular elements as the exclusive site of reactivity for Golgi apparatus markers TGN 38, $ alpha$ 2,6 sialyltransferase and $ beta$ 1,4 galactosyltransferase. The isolated droplet fraction was enriched in galactosyltransferase and sialyltransferase activities, and endogenous glycosylation assays identified the modification of several endogenous glycopeptides.

The glycosylating activities in the saccular elements may be related to plasma membrane modifications which occur during epididymal spermatoza maturation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Oko, R.

Food intake was decreased by lack of zinc in the diet. Tissue zinc content and plasma alkaline phosphatase activity were reduced by zinc deficiency. Systemic administration of human IGF-I increased the body weight, tail length and tibia epiphyseal cartilage width of control animals. This somatogenic action was impaired by zinc deficiency, as evidenced by continued weight loss, no increase in tail length and decreased tibial epiphyseal cartilage width of zinc deficient animals. Unilateral arterial infusion of GH increased the tibial epiphyseal width of the treated limb but not of the non-treated limb in control rats. However, no difference was found between the infused and the non-infused limb of zinc deficient animals, suggesting the occurrence of GH resistance on long bone growth in zinc deficiency.

To address this apparent paradox, the study measured and described patterns of joint excursions in the ipsilateral wing and leg of the chick embryo at embryonic day 9, in ovo, during spontaneous motility. Methods were developed to obtain kinematic measures, corrected for movement out-of-plane, from video recordings of continuous activity. Within a limb, synchronous movement of joints into flexion and extension was the prevailing pattern in all embryos. Between limbs, synchronous movements were present but less common, however, there were distinct, orderly spatiotemporal patterns of ankle and elbow excursions suggesting that movements of ipsilateral limbs are nonrandom and partially interdependent. Results suggest that organized, coordinated movements are a reliable feature of embryonic motility.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bradley, Nina S.

The method is based on sequential comminution and recovery steps, the first at 100% $-$841 $ mu$m, the second at approximately 50% $-$74 $ mu$m and the third at final grind (typically 75 to 90% $-$74 $ mu$m). The mass processed depends on the gold grade and particle size, and commonly varies from 25 to 100 kg. The method was used to determine the gravity recoverable gold in nine different ore samples. The grade of these ores ranged from 3 g/t to 45 g/t. Both massive sulfide and silicate ores were tested. Gold in the ores ranged from fine (90% $-$210 $ mu$m) to coarse (60% +841 $ mu$m). The amount of gravity recoverable gold ranged from 29 to 93%. Results from the proposed test compare favorably with mineralogical studies and data from industrial gravity recovery circuits. Some problems arose while testing the various ores; minor adjustments to the procedure were made to correct these. These corrections and other caveats for the test procedure are discussed. This test yields an essential component of an algorithm that can be used to predict the amount of gold that can be recovered by installing a gravity circuit. This algorithm is referenced and an example of its use is included. Information from the test can be used to evaluate circuit performance and indicate if the performance is equipment or process limited. The test will quickly indicate if a gravity circuit is an option. Results indicate that sizing material before it is processed with a Laboratory Knelson Concentrator leads to significant increases in recovery (48% without screen to 64% with). Industrial results are not yet available to verify this.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Laplante, A. R.

Two furnishes were investigated, thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and a TMP/kraft pulp blend. Drying of handsheets under matched conditions in air was used as the basis of comparison. TMP paper dried in superheated steam has a slightly higher surface roughness, by about 0.5 $ mu$m at a roughness around 8 $ mu$m. This difference decreases with drying fluid temperature. It is also reduced by about half after a very light blade coating. Surface roughness of paper from 50/50 TMP/kraft blend is unaffected. Superheated steam drying reduces substantially the linting propensity of TMP paper, by about 30%-60% depending on the criteria used. Improved lignin softening by higher web temperature from the beginning of drying in superheated steam drying is believed an important mechanism in improving bonding of surface fines and short fibre fragments. The Z-direction bond strength of TMP paper after surface treatment with water is about 20% higher for sheets dried in steam. Time for water absorption is 100%-150% longer for superheated steam dried TMP paper and contact angle of water is also substantially increased. Superheated steam drying substantially reduces the volume of micropores of diameter 0.2-0.6 $ mu$m while having no significant effect on larger pores. Thus superheated steam drying affects only the pore structure of the micronetwork. The decrease of micropore volume in superheated steam drying is associated with an increase of Z-direction bond strength and a decrease of light scattering coefficient.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Douglas, W.

This data will be useful for the design and fabrication of single and multi-moded waveguides and devices. A step function was found to accurately model the index profile after proton-exchange. Empirical equations relating the waveguide depth $d sb{pe}$ and the extraordinary index increase $ Delta n sb{e}$ to the exchange temperature and time were found. Propagation losses were measured, and index instabilities were detected. The generalized Gaussian function can be used to accurately model the index profile throughout annealing. Empirical equations relating the depth d and the surface index increase $ Delta n sb{s}$ to the anneal time were found. Additional empirical relations, establishing the dependence of the parameters of the equations on the anneal temperature and proton-exchange conditions, were also found. A criterion for eliminating index instabilities in the waveguide was established, and propagation losses were measured. Mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of annealing was attempted in order to gain insight into the phenomenon of the surface index increase. Proton-exchange with buffered melts offer the possibility of fabricating waveguides with index profiles that are not possible if using concentrated melts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yip, G. L.

The deaf children produced significantly more gestures, and a higher proportion of iconics, than the hearing controls. The deaf children were systematic in their use of speech in conjunction with gesture in that they combined iconic gestures with verb phrases and points with noun phrases. This systematicity was not displayed by the hearing children. The deaf children were also found to gesture more frequently during partially intelligible than during intelligible utterances. The implications of this data for the speech-gesture relation are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mayberry, Rachel I.

Experiments were done on an aluminum framework designed to verify the behaviour of the multi-storey frame and the columns as a part of the frame. The behaviour observed for different loading patterns is compared with the theoretical solution using a proportional multiplier of load as parameter.
