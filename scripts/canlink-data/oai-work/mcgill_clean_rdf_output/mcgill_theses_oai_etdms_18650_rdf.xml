In these industries, certain precautions and practices are adopted in due course to encourage and allow nature to rejuvenate and replenish the area. Thus it may be periodically reworked indefinitely, once the proper rotation schedule is established.

Like 2-nitraminopyridines, and 4-nitraminopyridines, 2-nitraminothiazoles can be rearranged more or less readily to 2-amino-5-nitrothiazoles in concentrated sulphuric acid. As seems to be the case in nitraminopyridines, the rearrangement of nitraminothiazoles has been shown to be an intermolecular reaction.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.

The answer tells us a great deal about the other person and helps us to decide how to behave towards him and what to expect from him. The more his occupation is like ours, the better we understand him; if his is the same as ours we may even enjoy some "shop talk"; the more it is different, the more we are likely to look upon him as a stranger.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cp818.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nc858</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Sociology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s429n"><dcterms:title>Factors in the Formation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, 1875.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1955</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Johnston, John Alexander.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with factors leading to the formation in 1875 of that ecclesiastical organization known as The Presbyterian Church in Canada.

Three major fields may be grossly discerned. The integration of gastric secretion with other events of the digestive process first received the major attention of organ physiology, as exemplified by the work of Pavlov's laboratory. Interest in the alimentary regulation of gastric secretion continues unabated at the present time despite the fact that much is well confirmed.
