Seventy-one samples of glasses activated by Mn('2+) inside and around the Na(,2)O(.)B(,2)O(,3)(.)SiO(,2) miscibility gaps were prepared. These samples were then phase separated by dry thermal treatment. It is shown that on addition of MnO, the ternary Na(,2)O(.)B(,2)O(,3)(.)SiO(,2) system behaved like other quaternary systems of the type X(,2)O(.)MO(.)B(,2)O(,3)(.)SiO(,2) (X = Na, K; M = Mg, Ca, Ba, Zn). Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis demonstrated that manganese concentrates preferentially in the boron-rich phase. This analysis, in conjunction with a comparison of Mn('2+) emission spectra of unheated and heat-treated glasses shows that the glasses are submicroscopically phase separated when prepared. The decay-time analysis of Mn('2+) luminescence indicates that the low energy emission band arises from Mn('2+) in the boron-rich phase while the high energy emission is due to Mn('2+) in the silica-rich phase. The difference in the crystal field parameters obtained from the excitation spectra of the two emission bands shows that the high energy emission band is from Mn('2+) in tetrahedral sites while the low energy emission band is from Mn('2+) in an octahedral environment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074v89v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jr943</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Luminescence spectroscopy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spectrum analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glass -- Spectra.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4q77fs076"><dcterms:title>Synthetic studies with 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran and related compounds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Seung Dal.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reactions of 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran and 2,6-dimethoxytetrahydropyran with halotrimethylsilanes have unexpectedly given 1,4-dichloro-1,4-dimethoxybutane and 1,5-dihalo-1,5-dimethoxypentane, respectively. Some features of this reaction were investigated and a mechanism was proposed. It was shown that 1,4-dichloro-1,4-dimethoxybutane was a mild reagent for the conversion of primary amine and amide to the corresponding N-alkyl and N-acyl pyrroles, respectively. As part of these applications, 2-(2-formylpyrrol-1-yl)-4-methylpentanoic acid, a compound isolated from flue-cured tobacco, was synthesized. The use of acylpyrroles as active acylating agents was investigated. The preparation of (alpha)-substituted derivatives from ethyl 2-(1-pyrrolyl)acetate was achieved by using lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base. As part of a synthetic study directed toward Nonactin, the bicyclic enol form 152 and keto form 153 were obtained by the reaction of 1-methoxyl-1,3-bis(Trimethylsiloxy)-1,3-pentadiene with 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran.

Observations of the deformation and break-up of solid-liquid clusters in a simple shear field has led to an investigation of various aspects of separation and coalescence phenomena: the interaction of solid particles and drops in simple shear, film thinning processes, the thermodynamics of engulfment and solid-liquid separation by the external fields. A microrheological approach was used to determine which parameters are important to the behavior of these systems in simple shear. Among the most important were found to be the liquid/liquid interfacial tension, the incidence of three phase contact and/or the wettability of the solid surface. The importance of these paramters was also investigated in the formation and stability of sphere-drop systems in a gravitational field, and the detachment of the liquid drop by surface and gravitational forces. Extensions to existing theory have been made to include gravitational effects in the thinning of a liquid film which forms around a sphere. Finally, an asymptotic solution to the Laplace equation of capillarity has been developed which may be applied to various axisymmetric liquid/fluid interfaces not too far from spherical shape. The findings in this thesis are highly relevant to various industrial processes (such as in the production of oil, minerals, paper, etc.) where three phase systems are encountered.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j80j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j1815</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fusion.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Separation (Technology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999744w"><dcterms:title>Movement organization in speech production : implications from studies of coarticulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Parush, Avraham.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis was concerned with coarticulatory patterns across various speech articulators and whether these can be accounted for by similar movement organization principles. Movements of the tongue dorsum, and the upper and lower pharynx, were recorded separately by a computerized ultrasound system during the production of vowel-consonant-vowel sequences. The movement amplitude, duration, and onset (relative to specific acoustic events) were computed for each articulator for a variety of speech gestures. It was shown that both spatial and temporal aspects of the movements varied in a similar manner for the three articulators as a function of the phonological context. The results indicate that spatiotemporal articulatory adjustments for vowels co-occur with the articulation of a consonant. This pattern can be accounted for by the notions of co-production and the 'spatial proximity' hypothesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zv10w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999744w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Speech -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tongue.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pharynx.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Speech.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq476"><dcterms:title>Equations and equational theories</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Srour, Gabriel, 1958-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We define a formula (phi)(x;t)(' )in a first-order language L, to be an equation in a category of L-structures if, for any H in , and set p = {(phi)(x;a(,i));(' )i (ELEM) I, a(,i)(' )(ELEM) H} there is a finite set I(,0) (L-HOOK) I such that for any f:H(---&gt;)F in ,(' )(INTERSECT)(,i(ELEM)I(,0))(phi)(F;fa(,i)) =(' )(INTERSECT)(,i(ELEM)I)(phi)(F;fa(,i)).

In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the hypotension and bradycardia resulting from stimulation of central (alpha)-adrenoceptors by clonidine or (alpha)-methyldopa are inhibited by the opiate antagonists naloxone and naltrexone and by centrally administered (beta)-endorphin antibody. Clonidine and 1-(alpha)-methylnoradrenaline increase the release of immunoreactive (beta)-endorphin from brain stem slices of SHR, superfused in vitro. The antihypertensive effects of clonidine and (alpha)-methyldopa are similarly inhibited by opiate antagonists in steroid/salt and renal hypertensive, Sprague-Dawley rats, but not in matched normotensive controls for the above three groups of animals. Furthermore, in SHR the centrally mediated acute as well as the chronic antihypertensive action of propranolol is prevented or reversed by naloxone and naltrexone, whereas the hypotensive response to baroreflex activation or to direct electrical stimulation of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is not inhibited and the bradycardia is potentiated by naltrexone. These findings indicate that the mechanism of action of antihypertensive drugs that act through stimulation (alpha)(,2)-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system involves the release of an endorphin-like opioid from the brainstem and subsequent stimulation of opiate receptors inhibitory to sympathetic tone. The exact central site of this interaction is not known, but in SHR it does not appear to involve the NTS or another component of the baroreflex arc. Finally, the adrenergic-opioid interaction is absent or inactive in normotensive animals, and it appears to be activated by the hypertensive process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r8676.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jv440</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aff3655834"><dcterms:title>Bionomics of the northern corn rootworm, Diabrotica longicornis (Say) (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) in Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dominique, Cyril Ray Michael.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Studies of the life history and habits of Diabrotica longicornis (Say), a new pest of corn in Quebec, were undertaken in the field and in the laboratory.

The threshold temperature for development of NCR eggs was estimated at 9.7(DEGREES)C. The mean thermal constant for first hatching in the laboratory was 326 degree days above 9.7(DEGREES)C. Eclosion occurred in the field when average soil temperature conditions at the 5 - 10 cm depth reached 331 - 334 degree days. Pupation occurred in the soil from late June to early July. Adults emerged from mid-July to August, and oviposition occurred during the same period. Oviposition preferences of NCR beetles were studied in relation to local soil types, soil moisture, and soil surface conditions, both in the laboratory and in the field under free choice conditions. In both cases, a clear preference was shown for moist, cracked, clay soil. The behaviour of adults held under controlled environmental conditions (12L:12D diel light cycle, 23 (+OR-) 2(DEGREES)C temperature, 60 - 80 per cent RH) was investigated, and emergence, locomotor activity and sexual behaviour were recorded. The duration of larval stages reared in the laboratory on natural diets were compared with those for field-collected larvae. Natural enemies and mortality factors for the species were investigated in the field.

Activation of glycogen phosphorylase in hepatocytes from euthyroid and hyperthyroid rats was mediated by alpha adrenoceptors. In hypothyroid rats there was a significant beta receptor contribution to this response and enhanced beta receptor-mediated accumulation of cAMP. Responses to glucagon, a hormone which also activates phosphorylase via cAMP, were not similarly affected. The increase in beta receptor-mediated responses in the hypothyroid rat was accompanied by decreased alpha receptor activity as indicated by a marked suppression of phenylephrine-stimulated phosphorylase activation and calcium efflux. Similar effects produced by vasopressin and the calcium ionophore, A23187, were changed only slightly or not at all. Alpha(,1) receptors in liver plasma membranes were identified by {('3)H}prazosin binding. Hypothyroidism did not influence the binding affinity of agonists or {('3)H}prazosin, but reduced the density of alpha(,1) receptors. This change was opposite to the increase in density of beta receptors in hypothyroid rat liver reported by others. All the changes observed in hypothyroidism were partially reversed by in vivo thyroid hormone replacement. It is concluded that hypothyroidism produces a selective enhancement of beta and suppression of alpha receptor responses in rat liver. These changes are most likely the result of corresponding alterations in the density of membrane receptor sites.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977v64q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g47b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, General.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acc08hg231"><dcterms:title>Effect of serum lipoproteins on glycosaminoglycan secretion by human arterial smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts in culture</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wosu, Leonard O.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Interactions between serum lipoproteins and human cells in the secretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) were investigated in cultures of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) and fibroblasts.

Addition of low density lipoproteins (LDL) to 10% LFS in the medium caused increases in GAG secretion and cell cholesterol but a net decrease in cell population. LDL effects were positively correlated with the rate of cell proliferation independent of serum concentration. High density lipoproteins (HDL) decreased GAG secretion in slowly but not in actively proliferating cultures; however in the latter, it reduced all LDL-induced changes. Cells from non insulin-dependent diabetics had an increased GAG response to LDL. Low concentrations of platelet factors enhanced GAG secretion. The addition of a GAG mixture inhibited all LDL effects.

To achieve these objectives the seeding of the intercrops was delayed, the corn population was increased, and the red clover was spring-ploughed. Fall-ploughed red clover maintained the mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates on the Ste-Rosalie clay. Spring-ploughed red clover on the other hand caused a decrease in bulk density in the top 10 cm of the Chicot loam. The nitrogen-response of corn indicated that the intercrops did not contribute to the nitrogen regime of grain-corn. There were also indications that intercrops competed with corn for available inorganic nitrogen and water. The intercrops, however, did reduce the levels of soil inorganic nitrogen in the fall allowing for a possible decrease in the nitrogen load of soil percolates. Despite the beneficial effect of nitrogen fertilisation on the organic nitrogen content of the soil, the presence of leguminous intercrops did not prevent the increase of the soil CN ratio.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw60c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z1541</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ryegrasses.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Red clover.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alfalfa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Yields.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Companion planting.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sd40x"><dcterms:title>Toward an integrated development communication strategy : an analysis of the SADCC case</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mukasa, Stanford Garikayi</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reflects an attempt at a theoretical and methodological retaxonomization of development communication research in the aftermath of theory failure in the traditional communication approach to development--a failure largely attributed to the inadequacy of research methods in giving a full accounting of the dynamics of interrelationships between and among various social dimensions in which communication and development occur. Innovative and critical methodological dimensions to the traditional and hardline quantitative research, namely, ethnomethodology, focus group interviews and case studies, have been added in an attempt to give a more comprehensive account of the role of the people at grassroots level. It is from this theoretical perspective that the thesis assesses the potential impact of the telecommunication development program of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) on the productive sector, notably, small-scale rural farmers who are crucial elements in the region's hopes for food security and agriculture-based development. The thesis takes the theoretical and methodological position that the question of a communication approach to development cannot be addressed as if communication were an independent variable but as an integrated package of socio-economic and cultural factors that jointly or collectively impact on communication and development in more interactive and complex ways than previously recognized. Hence the potential of development communication has to be viewed in the context of the strategic equation in which information and communication are but one aspect of interactive factors that add up to the fulfillment of life. The thesis' methodological elements include; field research among the rural farmers in Zimbabwe, interviews with policymakers, researchers, media practitioners, communication educators, consultants, NGO project officers; content analysis of selected media of the SADCC region, with the Zimbabwean media (both print and electronic) as case studies; and an analysis of original documents and reports on telecommunication and other development plans. Interviews with peasants on one hand, and with technical experts and politicians, on the other, will highlight the fact that knowledge generation can be multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary and what different constituencies can offer to development efforts. How we might begin to take account of this prospect is the basic research question this thesis addresses.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h262m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd40x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Communication in agriculture -- Zimbabwe</dc:subject><dc:subject>Southern African Development Coordination Conference.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jf470"><dcterms:title>Thermodynamics of aqueous electrolyte solutions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haghtalab, Ali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The focus of this work is the thermodynamics of aqueous solutions of strong electrolytes for both binary and multicomponent systems. A new excess Gibbs energy function to represent the deviations from ideality of binary electrolyte solutions was derived. The function consists of two contributions, one due to long-range forces, represented by the Debye-Huckel theory, and the other due to short-range forces represented by the local composition concept. The model is valid for the whole range of electrolyte concentrations, from dilute solutions up to saturation. The model consistently produces better results particularly at the higher concentration regions in which the other models deteriorate. An electrochemical cell apparatus using Ion-Selective Electrodes (ISE) was constructed to measure the electromotive force (emf) of ions in the aqueous electrolyte mixtures. For the NaCl-NaNO$ sb3$-H$ sb2$O system, the data for the mean ionic activity coefficient of NaCl was obtained in order to show the reproducibility of literature data and to test the validity of the experimental procedure. The data for mean ionic activity coefficient of the following systems were also collected: (1) NaBr-NaNO$ sb3$-H$ sb2$O (a system with common ion); (2) NaBr-Ca(NO$ sb3$)$ sb2$-H$ sb2$O (a system with no-common-ion). A novel mixing rule was proposed for the mean activity coefficients of electrolytes in mixtures in terms of the mean ionic activity coefficients of electrolytes in the binary solutions. The rule is applicable to multicomponent systems which obey Harned's Rule. Predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental data for ternary systems which follow the Bronsted specific ionic theory.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c1191.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf470</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9p290b19x"><dcterms:title>The"Amyloid-enhancing factor" (AEF) in the development of experimental secondary amyloidosis /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>HÃ©bert, Lise</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Secondary amyloidosis was induced in mice with daily consecutive injections of casein or in an accelerated form with the injection of the "Amyloid-Enhancing Factor" (AEF).

In conclusion, the appearance of AEF in organs during the development of secondary amyloidosis was accompanied by the modulation of the splenic macrophage phenotype and function.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t927m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290b19x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nv26t"><dcterms:title>The chiroptical properties of specifically substituted cellulose derivatives /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Harkness, Brian Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several novel cellulose derivatives with triphenylmethyl or 1-methylnaphthalene substituents at the primary hydroxyl positions and n-alkyl or benzyl substituents at the secondary hydroxyl positions have been prepared and characterized.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was successfully microencapsulated within artificial cells. The immobilized enzyme had an assayed activity of 20% $ pm$ 4% (Mean $ pm$ S.D.) of the free enzyme in solution. The immobilized enzyme maintained a higher enzyme activity at very low pH compared to the free enzyme in solution. The pH optimum of the free and immobilized enzyme was 8.5. This pH optimum corresponds to the average pH range of the small intestine. PKU induced rats had a 10 to 20-fold increase in the amino acid phenylalanine in the systemic circulation. This amino acid elevation was comparable to the plasma phenylalanine increase in human PKU patients. Daily oral administration of artificial cells containing 5 units of the enzyme PAL, to PKU rats, lowered on an average the systemic phenylalanine level to 20% $ pm$ 8% (Mean $ pm$ S.D.) of the original levels in 7 days (P $&lt;$ 0.001). After 7 days of this form of enzyme therapy, systemic blood phenylalanine levels of PKU treated rats were lowered to levels not significantly different from those of normal rats. Unlike control PKU rats, the treated group showed no signs of abnormal behavior or weight loss. HPLC analysis of free amino acids in the plasma, cerebro-spinal fluid and brain of PKU rats was carried out in the following groups: (1) Normal rats, (2) PKU rats on a normal diet, (3) PKU rats on a high phenylalanine diet, (4) PKU rats on a phenylalanine free diet, and (5) PKU treated rats with PAL-loaded artificial cells. Amino acid compartmental distribution was different in all these groups. The oral administration of PAL-loaded artificial cells decreased the hyperphenylalaninemia in all the compartments studied. It also corrected the imbalance of many amino acids, including tyrosine and tryptophan, in the CSF and the brain. This enzyme therapy was more effective in compartmental PHE level depletion, than a PHE-free diet.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv14r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268589j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655h345"><dcterms:title>Studies on the immunobiology of experimental visceral leishmaniasis in mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Olivier, Martin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The immunobiology and the control of experimental visceral leishmaniasis were studied in susceptible (C57BL/6J) and resistant (C57L/J) strains of mice.

It was also found that the phagocytic activity of macrophages is reduced by the infection and that liver and peritoneal macrophages reflect their specific resistance/susceptibility phenotype following protective or curative treatment with lymphokines: macrophages from resistant C57L/J mice responded better to lymphokine activation. The production of IL-1 by spleen and peritoneal macrophages is inhibited by the infection. Immunosuppression with cyclosporin A (CsA) exacerbated the infection, without affecting phenotype; both CsA-treated strains of mice heal the infection in the absence of IL-1 and IL-2. There were more infected liver macrophages in normal or CsA-treated susceptible C57BL/6J mice and a greater number of amastigotes per cell than in normal or CsA-treated resistant C57L/J mice. CsA treatment did not affect the responsiveness of macrophages to lymphokine activation.

Adoptive immunotherapy in vivo with IL-2-treated spleen cells from infected animals showed significant specific reduction of the parasite load in the liver; daily injections of IL-2 enhanced cure.

A placement of T = $(V,E)$ is an assignment $f: V to { bf R} sp2$ (or R$ sp3$) of vertices to points in space satisfying the following: for each edge $e = (u,v) in E$, the Euclidean distance between f(u) and f(v) is equal to l(e). We define the EUCLIDEAN TREE PLACEMENT problem as follows. Given a Euclidean tree T = (V,E) and a subset of m vertices in V labeled $u sb1,u sb2, cdots,u sb{m}$, and given m nonempty sets $S sb1,S sb2, cdots,S sb{m}$, not necessarily disjoint, in R$ sp2$ (or R$ sp3$), find the feasible placements $f: V to { bf R} sp2$ (or R$ sp3$) such that for $1 le i le m$, $f(u sb{i}) in S sb{i}$, or else report no such placement exists. In this thesis, we study the EUCLIDEAN TREE PLACEMENT problem and give both lower and upper bounds for it. Specifically, we first examine two special decision versions of the problem and show their NP-hardness by reductions from PARTITION. Then we provide a geometric method for placing Euclidean trees in the plane with each of the leaves constrained to a point. We also discuss an algebraic method for doing this. The given constraints on the leaves implicitly impose constraints on all vertices in V. Thus each vertex is associated with a point set (not necessarily connected) in which it can be placed in some feasible placement of the tree. Each such point set is shown to have a finite number of circular arcs on its boundary. Let r be the maximum boundary arc number over all such point sets for a Euclidean tree having at most n vertices. Then, for an input tree with n vertices, the geometric method takes $O(nr sp2 log r)$ time (real RAM), and the algebraic method takes $O(2 sp{4n sp2})$ time (rational RAM). At present r is not known to be bounded by a polynomial in n. Nevertheless, the geometric algorithm seems much more practical to implement than the algebraic algorithm. In developing the geometric method, we design an $O(m log sp2m)$ algorithm for computing the Minkowski sum of a planar figure, possibly containing holes and bounded by a collection of m circular arcs of various radii, with a circle centered at the origin. This algorithm can be directly used for computing the offset of the figure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r862t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq37z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d34n"><dcterms:title>Analyses of gravity grain flows</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kamis, Ahmed Samy A.

In the first part the subaqueous flow of a cloud of coarse particles down an inclined bed was investigated experimentally and theoretically. This work is relevant to the mechanics of transportation of ocean bed sediment in the form of submarine grain flows. It was found experimentally that after an initial growth period, the cloud collapsed as a result of sedimentation. A theoretical analysis for the development of a two-dimensional cloud was derived based upon the overall conservation equations; the sediment mass balance equation, the ambient fluid entrainment equation and the linear momentum equation along the bed. The second part of the thesis is a study of the flow and spreading of a finite mass of dry cohesionless granular material released from rest on rough inclines. Firstly, a two-dimensional depth-averaged model which describes both the longitudinal and the lateral spreading during flow down a rough inclined plane was developed. From the results of the numerical studies, it was concluded that the lateral spreading is insignificant relative to the longitudinal spreading. Therefore, a depth-averaged model which describes the one-dimensional longitudinal spreading down rough, curved beds was developed. It was concluded that the traveling distance and velocity of the center of mass of a rock pile can be approximately predicted by a simple analysis of a point mass sliding down the same incline. The long runout distance of the leading edge of the slide debris can result from extreme spreading of the pile as it accelerates down the slope after initial release.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s552t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d34n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jv34r"><dcterms:title>Degradation kinetics of quality factors, their verification and optimization in a thermoprocessed simulated food system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ghazala, Suad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel simulated food model (ascorbic acid, thiamine and a mixture of glucose and glycine) incorporating celite was developed.

Application of the Donnan theory, which is based on ion partitioning between two phases, indicates that the adsorption is an ion-exchange process--the bile acid anion displaces the chloride counter-ion of cholestyramine. Donnan considerations indicate that the bile acid in the resin phase exists in two forms, bound and unbound, but at higher Ceq the bound form is increasingly favoured. Since the concentrations of bound bile acid in the resin phase are above the critical micellar concentration, micelle-type ordering is occurring. It is also possible that the unbound bile acid in the resin phase aggregates to form "regular" micelles. The micellization promotes the partitioning of glycocholic acid into the resin phase, explaining the ability of cholestyramine to adsorb glycocholic acid significantly, in vitro. Ion-exchange resins were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis with active sites chosen to resemble those of cholestyramine. They were produced by coupling 4-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-aminophenylacetic acid or 4-(aminomethyl)phenylacetic acid to the backbone. The ion-exchange resins were prepared both as primary amines and in the quaternized form. The cholestyramine-like sorbents were synthesized with systematic changes in the structure, to determine which structural parts of cholestyramine are involved in the adsorption process. As compared to cholestyramine, both sets of resins were remarkably ineffective in adsorbing bile acids in vitro. It was found that the nature of the backbone determines the accessibility to the active site; that the resins with the methylene group positioned between the phenyl group and the amino group have higher adsorption capacity for glycocholic acid; and that quaternization increases the adsorption capacity. The two latter observations indicate the importance of the basicity of the active site. Therefore, in cholestyramine, the backbone is such that it permits the transfer of ionic species and the quaternary ammonium group is involved in the interaction with bile acids. Computer modelling showed that the cholestyramine pendants are close to one another and are separated by benzene rings, thus leaving too little space between them to allow a bile acid molecule to interact with the benzene rings. Therefore, the bile acids must interact with the quaternary ammonium group, leaving the bile acid molecule inside the cavity where they interact with one another to form micelles. The possible modes of interactions of bile acids with the synthesized resins are more numerous since the pendants are not as close together.

(Neil Alexander)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The formulation and implementation of a control volume finite-element method (CVFEM) for steady, two-dimensional, viscous compressible and incompressible internal flows is reported in this thesis. In the development of this method, a CVFEM for steady, quasi-one-dimensional, viscous compressible flows was also formulated. The proposed method is an equal-order colocated shock capturing formulation, which incorporates adaptive grid techniques to discretize calculation domains with triangular elements and provide local grid refinement in the vicinity of strong gradients. Polygonal control volumes are constructed around each node in the finite-element mesh, and discretized forms of the governing equations are obtained by deriving algebraic approximations to integral conservation equations for each control volume. The proposed methods are formulated using the velocity components, pressure, and temperatures as the dependent variables: density is calculated from an equation of state. The pressure is interpolated linearly. The velocity components, temperature, and density are interpolated using flow-oriented upwind type functions. The interpolation functions for the velocity components and temperature include source-related terms that permit the interpolated variable to respond appropriately to the influence of a source term within an element. The source-related terms in the velocity functions include the appropriate pressure gradients; this feature allows the formulation of equal-order colocated methods valid for incompressible flows. The discretized forms of the governing equations are solved using an iterative algorithm. In this algorithm, linearized forms of the coupled discretized momentum and continuity equations are solved simultaneously using an iterative line-by-line application of a new coupled equation line solver. The proposed quasi-one- and two-dimensional CVFEM's are applied to several compressible fluid flow problems, and the solutions generated are compared with theoretical, numerical, and experimental results available in the literature. This comparison shows that the proposed CVFEM's can generate solutions that are in good agreement with the expected physical behaviour of compressible flows and also with the available results. The ability of adaptive grids to improve solution quality is also demonstrated. The results suggest further research is required in the evaluation and enhancement of the interpolation functions currently used in CVFEM's, and in the incorporation of other adaptive grid schemes into CVFEM formulations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t928w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m011q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st33b"><dcterms:title>Nonlinear oscillations, noise and chaos in neural delayed feedback</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Longtin, AndrÃ©</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bifurcations and complex oscillations in the human pupil light reflex (PLR) are studied. Autonomous pupil area oscillations are produced by substituting electronically controllable nonlinear feedback for the normal negative feedback of this reflex. A physiologically sound theoretical framework in which to study pupillary oscillations is developed. The model, framed as a delay-differential equation (DDE), agrees quantitatively with the simpler periodic behaviors and qualitatively with the complex behaviors. Much of the aperiodicity in the data can be ascribed to noise and transients rather than to chaos. The critical behavior of the PLR at oscillation onset is different with piecewise constant rather than smooth negative feedback. In the former, relative fluctuations in period are larger than those in amplitude, and vice versa in the latter. Properties of the time solutions and densities of a stochastic DDE are used to explain this experimental result. The Hopf bifurcation in this system is postponed by both additive and multiplicative colored noise. Theoretical insight into the behavior of stationary densities of DDE's and the origin of the postponement is given, and implications for analyzing bifurcations in neural delayed feedback systems are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f95w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st33b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Optics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj9602139j"><dcterms:title>Import of proteins into mitochondria : biogenesis of the uncoupling protein and identification of a mitochondrial signal peptide binding protein</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liu, Xingquan, 1959-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The inner membrane uncoupling protein (UCP) of rat brown fat mitochondria has been imported into rat heart mitochondria in vitro.
