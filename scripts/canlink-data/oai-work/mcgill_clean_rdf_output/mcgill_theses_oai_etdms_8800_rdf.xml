It involves the external anatomy of the adult beetle, the reproductive system and the digestive tract. A discussion of the evolution of the Rhyncbophorous head is given in which the controversial points of various workers are mentioned. An explanation of the hypostoma and the tentorium is given aecording to the writer's interpretation. The thoracic segments are discussed from an outer and an inner aspect. The mesotergum is peculiar in its enlarged precosta and prescutum and specialized scutum and scutellum. The abdomen presents the most important sexual characters which are found in the location and shape of the seventh and eighth terigites. In the female, 8 Is covered by 7, and forms the so-called "pygidium" while in the male 8 is distinct and together with 7 forms the so-called "divided pygidium". It is thought that the ninth and tenth tergites and the ninth and tenth sternites are represented in the sclerotized elements of the reproductive organs. The appendages ot the body are figured with their means of articulation explained. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.

After a discussion of the vexed question of motor vehicle taxation and of the various means which might be taken to meet the growing competition from motor transport, it is concluded that the rationalisation of railway services (closer co-operation between our two great railway systems, or even their complete amalgamation, and the adoption of new units of railway rolling stock, such as the rail-car and oil-electric train), and the initiation of supplementary and auxiliary highway services by the railways offer the only practical solution.

The five visits of Loti to Turkey are discussed, particularly in their relationship to the influence they have on the character and mental outlook of the man. Loti's impressions of Turkey, its people, their social customs and their religion are compared with those of contemporary writers on Turkey. Finally, the description of the Turkish women and her life in the harem as depicted in "Les Desenchantees", is considered, and the question discussed as to whether it is truly representative of the Turkish woman of that day.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Du Roure, R.

Most of the extracts given are from writings composed at a time contemporary to, or shortly after the occurrence of the events discussed in them. The purpose of the study is to indicate economic conditions in the period considered, and to assist in reaching a clearer understanding of the nature of economic f1uctuations.
