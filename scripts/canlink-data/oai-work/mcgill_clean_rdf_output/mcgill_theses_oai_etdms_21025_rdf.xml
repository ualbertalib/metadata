While the aviation security conventions cover a variety of acts of terrorism against civil air transport they failed to adequately deal with terrorism at international airports. In direct response to the terrorist attacks that took place at Rome and Vienna international airports in December 1985, the international civil aviation community adopted under ICAO auspices the Montreal Protocol of 1988, a new legal instrument aimed at the control of terrorism at airports serving international civil aviation. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine the Protocol in order to provide an answer to the question whether or not this legal instrument can be considered as an effective tool for the achievement of its main goal, the suppression of terrorism at international airports.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nc39w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k832f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azk51vh82p"><dcterms:title>Combined use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and glucose (GOX) for shelf-life extension of fresh fish</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Yun-ae</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The fish processing industry is actively seeking for alternative methods of shelf life preservation and marketability of fresh fish, while at the same time economizing on energy costs. Two methods which fulfill both objectives are modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and glucose oxidase (GOX)/Glucose dipping solutions. MAP is the packaging of perishable products in an atmosphere other than that of air and is used for the shelf life extension of beef, pork, fruits, vegetables and bakery products. GOX, either alone or in conjunction with MAP has the potential for shelf life extension of fresh fish. The objectives of this study were to determine the combined effect of glucose oxidase/glucose or gluconic acid dipping solutions and modified atmosphere packaging in conjunction with refrigeration on the shelf life extension of mackerel and cod. This study has shown that the shelf life of fresh fish can be extended through the combined use of MAP/dipping solutions and refrigeration. This novel process of "dipping" in GOX solution in conjunction with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) will have a significant effect in the area of fish hygiene and will minimize fish losses incurred through spoilage.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085m35s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh82p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fish as food -- Packaging.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protective atmospheres.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish as food -- Preservation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236322v"><dcterms:title>Construction and test of a SPWM current source converter</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lujara, Nelson Kakuru</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis describes a stand-alone, unity power factor, current-regulated SPWM rectifier.

The issues and problems of LdI$ sb{ rm dc}$/dt voltage and low harmonic waveform distortion are identified. Solutions are found by using a dc snubber circuit and a simple local notch filter feedback circuit which performs the dual function of stabilizing and active filtering. From the clarification given by this more expensive but less constrained topology, the stage is set for the next step in incorporating the lessons learnt here to the more economical topology based on the 6-valve, 3-phase parallel bridge, which requires a tri-state logic for PWM control when operating in the current-source configuration.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g1355.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236322v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x540"><dcterms:title>Seismic response of concentrically braced frames meeting Canadian design criteria</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lu, Feng</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis deals with the non-linear dynamic time history analysis of a certain type of medium- and high-rise concentric braced frame designed according to the new National Building Code of Canada (1990) and CAN/CSA-S16.1-M89.

Two contrasting analyses of moral reasons, Kohlberg's justice orientation and Gilligan's response orientation, were reviewed and criticized. From this a Moral Reasoning Grammar which formally characterizes the semantics of the justice and response moral orientations was developed. Specifically, the Moral Reasoning Grammar distinguished reasoning based on principles and their defense from reasoning based on narrative and social-interactive knowledge. The Moral Reasoning Grammar was applied to subjects' protocols to determine the extent to which these two orientations characterized subjects' verbal responses to moral problems. Application of the Moral Reasoning Grammar resulted in good coverage of subjects' verbalizations which reliably differentiated knowledge and processes used by subjects resolving moral problems from either a justice or response orientation. The justice orientation characterized the four male subjects' protocols and the response orientation characterized the four female protocols. The small sample precludes any generalization of this finding. The Moral Reasoning Grammar and results were discussed in terms of further psychological research, an expanded and more comprehensive philosophical approach to moral reasoning, and the potential educational implications.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq89q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x015t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Judgment (Ethics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reasoning</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870x022"><dcterms:title>Basic education and the World Bank : crisis and response in the 1980s</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kaler, Amy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Basic education is a crucial, often underfunded component of national development. Theories based on basic needs both illustrate the links between education and other goals associated with the elimination of poverty and define the types of education needed to maximise these links and advance these goals. Third World progress towards basic educational goals, as measured by first level enrollment, literacy and resources available to education, has been slowed particularly as a result of economic pressures. Measures taken by international organisations to relieve these pressures have not adequately protected the poor; and in some cases have adversely affected the maintenance of systems of basic education. The World Bank, as the world's largest development organisation and as one concerned with economic adjustment, is changing its policies to adapt to this situation. (These changes are taking place in an institution noted for being more oriented to economic growth than to human needs.) There is, however, room for cautious optimism that trends within and without the Bank may converge to bring basic education to a higher place on the development agenda.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m528c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x022</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economic development -- Effect of education on</dc:subject><dc:subject>World Bank</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Developing countries</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d1016"><dcterms:title>Electroosmotic dewatering of bentonite suspensions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ju, Shuohui</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Electroosmotic dewatering of Bentonite suspensions under conditions of constant DC voltage and constant DC current was investigated experimentally in a column 5 cm in diameter.

Electroosmosis removed 20-60% of the water with energy expenditures well below the energy required to vaporize the water. Higher voltages or currents removed more water. Removal rates were increased by the addition of CaCl$ sb2$. The lowest bed height (1 cm) gave the lowest energy of dewatering, but the final water removal was low. For constant voltage experiments with an initial field strength of 2.8 V/cm, bed heights around 2 cm gave the highest water removal.

In mixed infections, as few as one or two metacercariae in the thorax reduced the spontaneous flying time of females by almost half. Such infections also reduced total egg production, the number of ovarian cycles, fecundity per cycle, as well as fertility and life span of female hosts. The fertility and life span of males was similarly affected. Purely abdominal infections reduced the life span of males and females as well as the fertility of males, but only at high intensities.

Increased medium agar concentrations and medium dilution did not improve survival or growth. Stomatal function resumed sooner in new leaves of plantlets than shoots. High relative humidity ($&gt;$95%) and low light intensity (90 $ mu$mol s$ sp{-1}$ m$ sp{-2}$) negatively affected stomatal closure both on acclimatizing transplants and greenhouse-grown plants.

This thesis follows up this line of thought in examining clinical material on apraxia, both temporally previous and subsequent to Merleau-Ponty's discussion. Additionally, it is contended that various paradigms in Bergson and within modern cognitive science (Edelman, Schacter) may be applied with some utility to the praxis of theatre spectatorship. This may lead to a better understanding of the mental participation of the spectator in the performance text as a modulation of present perception and past subjective experience.

A detailed questionnaire/survey was deployed in May and June 1987, during a period of massive reorganization and automation of production by Domtar Fine Paper Mill, the dominant local employer. The primary empirical focus of this work is on the household impacts of job losses, incurred directly or indirectly by this restructuring. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between gender, employment and income and how this relationship is manifested among the differing material circumstances of Windsor households, and to attempts to adapt to the socio-economic impacts of restructuring via self-conscious "coping strategies". A secondary focus is communal coping strategies aimed at combatting declining industrial employment. Findings indicate an exacerbation of economic polarization between economically stable households of the remaining Domtar employees and households enmeshed in unstable economic and employment conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397946q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz68v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Households -- Québec (Province) -- Economic aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Employment -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Paper industry workers -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zx75v"><dcterms:title>La genèse de Carlos et de sa Cosworth suivi de La Cosworth /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Da Conceicao, José Carlos</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This Master's thesis in creative writing consists of two parts: a novel and a critical study. The creative writing part is entitled La Cosworth. Carlos da Silva, the main character, seeks material goods to the detriment of his friends, family and happiness. He begins to decay simultaneously with his car and dies after it is completely destroyed in an accident. Product of his environment, he ceases to exist after he loses his car, which symbolizes his way of life and his existence. La genese de Carlos et de sa Cosworth precedes the creative writing part and shows the evolution of the novel. Todorov recognizes two kinds of stories: based on plot or on the character. The critical study explains why La Cosworth is a character novel. It covers the genesis and changes of the characters. It explains the importance of the automobile in the story and the use of music as a means of framing and animating the narration. We will analyse the development of the chapters and the overall construction which are dependent on the evolution of the characters. And to conclude, we will discuss problems encountered while writing and the way they were resolved.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d99q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx75v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Da Conceicao, José Carlos.

Numerical simulations of the nonlinear diffusion equation have shown that the proton-exchange process cannot be adequately described by the well established ion-exchange equations. A generalized Gaussian function was used to accurately model the refractive index profile in annealed proton-exchanged waveguides resulting in considerable improvements over previous work. Annealing was found to allow for flexibility in the tailoring of the waveguide parameters. In addition to establishing single mode propagation criteria, changes in these parameters were correlated with the fabrication conditions using a general power law thus showing that the anneal process is not characterized by simple diffusion mechanisms.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt98n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw34b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8623j002m"><dcterms:title>De Philibert De l'Orme et De Rabelais : analogous treatises: a companion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chupin, Jean-Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyzes the corporeal origin of theoretical works in XVI$ sp{ rm th}$ century French architecture. A comparison of Philibert de l'Orme's treatises and Francois Rabelais' work allows for a dynamic awareness of materiality to emerge. During the Renaissance, this awareness was based on analogical relationships and Hermetic texts. However, whether one looks at the theory of the Elements, the concept of Proportion, the microcosm-macrocosm interplay, or even the Cardinal Virtues, it appears that the references were always traced back to the everyday experience of the body. Confronted with the mechanistic and objectifying conceptualizations that dominate today, this thesis supports the crucial role the architect must play in the bringing forth of places that allow for a perception of the body closer to apprenticeship than to domination.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j6763.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j002m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Renaissance -- France</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rabelais, François, ca. 1490-1553?</dc:subject><dc:subject>L'Orme, Philibert de, 1515?-1570</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nr75n"><dcterms:title>Radiative decays of [eta, rho, omega, eta'] mesons produced in the reaction [pi-]+p [yields] meson + n at 8.45 Gevc</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shahbazian, Elisa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We have studied the radiation decays of non strange mesons into (pi)('+),(pi)('-) and one or three gamma rays observed in the reaction (pi)('-) + p (---&gt;) Meson + n at beam momentum 8.45 Gev/c in a Counter-Spark chamber experiment conducted at Argonne National Laboratory Zero Gradient Synchrotron.

Forty elective surgery patients were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental pain control procedures or to a standard treatment control group--preoperative teaching. The treatments were found to be equally credible and generated equivalent expectancies for success. Pain was assessed using multiple subjective and objective measures sampled across the postoperative period. Multivariate analysis of these data indicated that the experimental treatments were no more effective in diminishing postoperative pain than the control procedure. However, the analysis revealed several significant correlates and predictors of postoperative pain. These included trait anxiety, depression, stress coping style as well as interview and rating scale reports of cognitive coping strategies. Significant predictors of credibility--expectancy, treatment utilization and cognitive coping classifications were also found. Analysis of the pain measurement strategy indicated consistency among the subjective measures--the McGill Pain Questionnaire and visual analogue scales--which were relatively independent from the objective measures, which comprised electronically monitored gross motor activity and analgesic medication requirements. Possible interpretations and implications of these results as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d13n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z658</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gallbladder -- Surgery.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Postoperative pain.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autogenic training.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analgesia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mental suggestion.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6969z159d"><dcterms:title>Effects of molecular shape on the structure of alkane mixtures</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tra, Van-Huu.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Using the new Picker flow calorimeter, the excess heat capacity (C(,p)('E)) has been measured for systems containing normal, branched and cyclic alkanes. The results indicate two unusual effects: (1) a large negative contribution due to the destruction of orientational order in a pure n-alkane component, and (2) a positive contribution attributed to the "condensation" of a more freely-moving molecule or segment on a sterically-hindered branched alkane, resulting in a restriction of rotational movement, i.e. creation of order in the solution. Mixtures of cycloalkanes and their methyl derivatives also show unexpected positive effects in the excess heat capacity. Thus the plate-like cyclopentane molecule gives positive C(,p)('E) values when mixed with other plate-like methyl derivatives of cyclohexane suggesting a hindering of its molecular rotation. Cyclohexane mixed with globular branched and cyclic alkanes shows S-shaped C(,p)('E) curves, negative at low concentration of cyclohexane but positive at high, indicating the possibility of a restriction of cyclohexane motion. Effects of order are also apparent in the equation of state of a liquid. The thermal pressure coefficient for systems containing n-hexadecane has been found to be anomalous and is explained by a lowering of the internal energy of n-hexadecane by orientational order. Excess volume (V('E)) has been studied for systems of branched and normal alkanes by investigating different effects contributing to the total V('E), particularly an important effect of a difference in thermal pressure coefficients of the two components.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk33q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z159d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alkanes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heat of mixing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Molecular structure.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Order-disorder in alloys.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301205b"><dcterms:title>Phosphorus competition and partitioning between freshwater phytoplankton and bacterioplankton</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Currie, David J. (David John)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Phosphorus and phytoplankton dynamics in freshwater are usually thought to be tightly coupled and interdependent, yet orthophosphate uptake in situ has been observed to be mediated largely by particles of bacterial size. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the general hypothesis that freshwater bacterioplankton are markedly superior competitors for phosphorus, relative to the phytoplankton. Using isolates of three species of pelagic bacteria, and two of algae, it was shown that the bacteria possess much higher affinity orthophosphate uptake kinetics than the algae. In a Monte Carlo simulation study, the accuracy and precision of these Michaelis-Menten parameter estimates were found to depend strongly upon the experimental design matrix. Bacterial superiority in uptake was also reflected in terms of growth, in chemostat competition experiments, which also showed algal and bacterial uptake of orthophosphate to be well correlated with their relative long-term phosphorus assimilation. In parallel experiments in situ, bacterioplankton were found invariably to be responsible for more than 97% of the orthophosphate uptake. In contrast, excreted organic phosphorus was utilised almost exclusively by the phytoplankton. There is little evidence as yet that excretion and reuptake of phosphorus is important in redistributing phosphorus among the plankton.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np1939827.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301205b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Water -- Phosphorus content.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freshwater microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Freshwater phytoplankton.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j259"><dcterms:title>Synthesis and characterization of a new class of silyl-transition metal compounds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pelletier, Emilien.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Some new inorganic and organometallic derivatives of methylcyclosiloxanes have been prepared and characterized by IR, MS and ('1)H NMR.

The present study is limited to the flow of immiscible fluids (oil and surfactant), where fine solids (clay) migration occurs during the motion. It is divided into two parts: (a) experimental and (b) theoretical. The experimental investigations have been performed in order to evaluate: (a) the factors (e.g., porosity, temperature and injection pressure) that affect the injected surfactant flow rate through oil/soil mixtures, (b) the role of clay mineral concentration on the uptake and displacement of oil by the injected surfactant, (c) the portion of the oil displaced by the injected surfactant in the medium, under the testing conditions, (d) the effect of injection head on the rate of oil uptake during the injection process. The theoretical analysis leads to a new diffusion model which accounts for the simultaneous movement of oil, fines and surfactant. The conclusion to be drawn from this part is that the new simplified model, together with further refinement, lead to a better understanding of the behaviour and prediction of the multiphase flow through a porous medium.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mn026.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk651</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Porosity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiphase flow.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cr18m"><dcterms:title>Magnetic filtration of iron precipitates</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Todd, Iain A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A variety of iron precipitates formed in the electrolytic zinc industry were studied to estimate the possibility of magnetic filtration to augment conventional thickening/filtering systems.

The LCST for PE are much lower than for branched polyolefins, especially in branched alkanes. The results are not predicted by the Prigogine-Flory-Patterson theory but are understood in terms of correlations of molecular orientations in the PE melt. Fusion thermodynamics of P4MP1 confirm the existence of ordered conformations in the melt. The thermoreversible gelation of P4MP1 solutions depends on solvent and thermal history. It is studied by calorimetry, viscosimetry and wide angle X-ray diffraction. The gel crosslinks are presumably of a fringed-micellar nature and their formation is tentatively associated with the existence of helical conformations of P4MP1 in solution. The latter is also responsible for the obtaining of four different crystalline structures of P4MP1 from solutions and gels. Preliminary measurements of dynamic mechanical properties of P4MP1 gels are reported.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qc98z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mc70s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gelation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heat of solution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polyolefins.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
