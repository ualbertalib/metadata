Specifically, eight Peewee hockey coaches followed the same procedures and implemented the same physical team building activities with their teams throughout the regular season. Data was gathered in a variety of ways. Coaches' answered questions on a pre and post-intervention form for each activity and their behaviors were observed by members of the research team. As well, a semi-structured exit interview was conducted with each coach following the completion of the regular season. Cote, Salmela, and Russell's (1995) guidelines were used to inductively analyze and interpret the interview data. Results of the data revealed four higher-order categories concerning coaches' perceptions of the team building program: (a) coach characteristics and outcomes, which included skills coaches gained as a result of their participation in the team building program, as well as their beliefs, philosophies, and background experiences that shaped their coaching development, (b) team circumstances and climate, which involved interpersonal interactions, internal and external environmental factors, and elements influencing team atmosphere, (c) athlete outcomes, which included the feelings, attitudes, and values, as well as the intellectual/thinking-related skills and outcomes that athletes experienced as a result of their involvement in the intervention program, and (d) program involvement and assessment, which focused on coaches' roles and their confidence delivering team building activities, as well as their appraisal of the intervention program. Results of this study provided evidence of the benefits of a season-long team building intervention program for coaches, athletes, and entire teams. Specifically, coaches felt athletes enjoyed this experience and improved and/or acquired a variety of important life skills, such as problem-solving and the ability to focus and persevere when faced with challenging tasks. Likewise, coaches felt their communication and motivational skills improved as a result of their involvement in the team building program. Finally, coaches also felt athletes bonded daring activities and improved their abilities to work together as a group. The results of this study have advanced knowledge in sport psychology by providing a deeper understanding of how team building is perceived by youth sport coaches.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x1756.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c305v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sports -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hockey -- Coaching.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap8418n46q"><dcterms:title>Russianness in Aleksei Remizov's early writings</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mot, Magdalena.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines three different collections from the early works of the Russian writer Aleksei Remizov (1887-1957): Posolon' (1907), Leimonarion (1907), and Besnovatye: Savva Grudtsyn and Solomoniia (1951). Each of them highlights a different approach taken by Remizov in preserving Russianness. In this analysis the concept of Russianness does not constitute a specific national or historical scheme. The reference is rather to a spiritual legacy, a condition of soul. Posolon' calls for the regaining of a lost cyclicity and looks back in time at the common folk's way of life. Leimonarion is one of the most expressive examples of the constant duality of Remizov's position on the dominant artistic and ideological ideas of the time; this collection looks at the old world through the new eyes of a modern era. "Savva Grudtsyn" and "Solomoniia" present a perpetual moral struggle, which pits the profanity of a secular world against the sacred values to which people ought to aspire. The results of the study show that Remizov, using different themes and different literary genres, pursues one broad concern: Russianness. This theme permeates not only his literary language, but also the content of the works discussed here. In Leimonarion Russia is kept together by her people and their belief in salvation; in Posolon' Russia is all about folklore, joyful games, tales and rituals; in Besnovatye Russia is saved by the simplicity and purity of the iurodivye , the 'Holy fools.'</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rw922.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n46q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Remizov, Alekseĭ, 1877-1957 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>National characteristics, Russian, in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr171x49j"><dcterms:title>Delhi Secondary School as a temple of worship : musical choices and devotional diversity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mutter, Morgan L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Delhi Secondary School is a public school with approximately 6,000 students; 300 teachers, 6 administrators, and countless headmistresses and support staff.

Ethnographic tools, participant observation, and interview were used to discover how Delhi Secondary School supports religious plurality within their educational community as advertised on their web site, specifically how the music specialist teachers in Delhi Secondary School recognize students' religious diversity in their music curriculum. Analysis of my field notes, interviews, transcripts, photographs and other documents revealed that Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Catholic religions were represented in the devotional music that was studied and performed by the students. These findings suggest that the school supports religious plurality through participation and acceptance of spiritual acts during lessons, morning assemblies, concert performances and other daily activities.

Controversially, the South African media has paid great attention to violence against white farmers amidst a seemingly endless flood of violence against black farm workers. The now commonplace tales of farm attacks incite racial tension and provoke paranoia, leading one to question why they are repeated at all. Recent works by South African authors have engaged this question, including Jonny Steinberg's Midlands (2002), J. M. Coetzee's Disgrace (1999), and Breyten Breytenbach's Dog Heart (1998). Critics have accused these works of perpetuating racism with their grim depictions of black-on-white violence but have failed to recognize the manner in which these authors contextualize the violence. I argue that each work registers the farm attack as a land claim, made in an era of failed land reform. Furthermore, these works reflexively explore the pragmatics of circulating the stories.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708w771.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk02r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>South African literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land reform -- South Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Violence in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45q917m"><dcterms:title>Motet settings of the Song of Songs ca. 1500-1520</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chiu, Remi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates early sixteenth-century motet settings of texts taken from the Song of Songs.

I will also consider generic properties of the renaissance motet---contemporary definitions of the genre, performance context, types of texts used, and repertory dissemination---and make a case that both the Song of Songs and the motet occupy a sort of "intermediate" position between the secular and the sacred world, participating in both the earthly and the spiritual. Several motets---Tota pulchra es by Ludwig Senfl, Tota pulchra es by Nicolaus Craen, Nigra sum sed formosa by Johannis Lheritier, and the anonymous Vulnerasti cor meum from Petrucci's Motetti de la Corona I print---will be analyzed through the lens of the historical Christian exegesis and generic considerations of the motet. I interpret diverse musical parameters---among them, texture, quotation of pre-existent material, motivic structuring, cadential manipulation, mode and modal commixture---as some of the ways in which the composers responded to their Song of Songs texts.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35694749.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q917m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motets -- 16th century -- Analysis and appreciation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motets -- 16th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Song of Solomon (Music) -- Criticism, interpretation, etc.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak35694731"><dcterms:title>Economic and social dimensions of neighbourhood trade-stores in Cochabamba, Bolivia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Coen, Stephanie E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neighbourhood trade-stores, or small scale retail outlets specialising in domestic provisions sold in small quantities, are common features of residential landscapes in developing countries. While these shops are fixtures in the everyday micro-geographies of urban places, little is known as to how they are economically and socially bound up with the neighbourhoods in which they are situated and, in turn, how these linkages influence the day-to-day life circumstances of local people. Through such a local-level investigation utilising multiple qualitative methods, I examine the intra-neighbourhood economic and social roles of small trade-stores in an urban neighbourhood in Cochabamba, Bolivia. My analysis reveals that trade-stores were a key influence on the welfare of neighbourhood residents. Economically, these shops functioned as safeguards for family economies by providing multidimensional material support. Socially, trade-stores acted as mechanisms for informal social control, nodes of local information exchange, and sources of local social opportunities and social support.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rd75g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k35694731</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cochabamba (Bolivia) -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cochabamba (Bolivia) -- Social conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neighborhoods -- Bolivia -- Cochabamba.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Convenience stores -- Bolivia -- Cochabamba.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407x49h"><dcterms:title>Cul sec : suivi de, La passivité d'Antoine dans L'hiver au cœur d'André Major</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Charette, Nicolas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two parts constitute this thesis.

These short stories contain characters having different relations to alcohol, be they negative or positive. The goal of this creation wasn't to explain or identify causes of alcohol consumption, but rather to build atmospheres and to expose various behaviours related to alcohol. Our characters also distinguish themselves for their passiveness, particularly regarding some problems they have to face. The second part of the thesis is a character study of Antoine in Andre Major's Winter of a Heart. More specifically, it is an analysis of the interior conflict he lives between his desire for a woman and an old romantic ideal of solitariness, conflict that will alter the apparent passiveness of the character and that will influence his work as a writer.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881m192.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x49h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Major, André.

A factor analysis of the combined measurements has revealed 3 factors, accounting for 70% of the variability. They were interpreted as cognitive ability (eigenvalue=4.3), cautiousness (eigenvalue=2.1) and impulsive responding (eigenvalue=1.3). No association was found between the DRD4 VNTR alleles and impulsive responding (F1,93 =0.082, p=0.775). The smallest and youngest within this sample of young adults have been found to display the most cautious behavior (p=0.002). The heaviest subjects displayed the most uninhibited response-style (p=0.045). And lastly, monkeys with cognitive difficulties had the highest CSF levels of the dopamine metabolite, HVA (p=0.017). The ORT and TRAIT provide rapid screening measures of cognitive ability, cautiousness and impulsive-responding, but extensive validation of these measures with classical cognitive tests was beyond the scope of this project. The relationship between cognitive performance and resting levels of dopamine metabolites suggests that the battery may be useful in future studies of various psychopathological models in this species.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bt826.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf057</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720d05f"><dcterms:title>Examining the multidimensional nature of acculturation in a multi-ethnic community sample of first-generation immigrants</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dere, Jessica.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>While acculturation is among the most popular concepts in cultural psychiatry and psychology, the conceptualization and measurement of this construct continue to be issues of significant debate. Recent literature supports the development of multidimensional models of acculturation, in contrast to traditional linear or unidimensional models. The current study examined a multidimensional model of acculturation in a multi-ethnic community sample of first-generation immigrants in Montreal. Two cultural orientations - Canadian and Self-Defined Ethnicity - were assessed independently among Caribbean (n=109), Vietnamese (n=97), and Filipino (n=109) participants. These two cultural orientations were examined across three dimensions of acculturation: ethnic loyalty, ethnic behaviour, and situational ethnic identity. Correlational and factor analysis were used to assess the distinctiveness of the three dimensions, and the relationship between the two cultural orientations. For ethnic behaviour and situational ethnic identity, the two cultural orientations were not related to one another. Among the Vietnamese and Filipino groups, loyalty to one's self-defined ethnic group was positively related to loyalty towards Canadians. Factor analysis revealed two independent components, corresponding to the two cultural orientations. Overall, results support both the need to assess cultural orientations independently, and the multidimensional nature of acculturation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h2246.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d05f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Social.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f846f"><dcterms:title>Physical activity validation pilot project in Inuit of the Baffin region</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dénommé, Daneen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of physical activity (PA) measurement in an Inuit population with a self-administered questionnaire.

There were a number of compliance problems encountered when implementing the Caltrac in the pilot community which resulted in too few Caltrac scores available for analyses. However, IPAQ PA score (N=44) was significantly inversely related to Body Mass Index (p≤0.05) and positively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p≤0.03).

Results. Eleven per cent (n=23) of the included patients (N=201) experienced a switch, and 11 % (n=22) had another antipsychotic added to their treatment. A history of recent psychiatric hospitalizations and secondary diagnoses of personality disorders were more common among switched and add-on patients than maintenance group patients. During the study period, significantly more switched and add-on patients used outpatient, emergency and inpatient psychiatric services than maintained patients. Conclusions. Patients whose antipsychotic treatment was changed had likely been experiencing clinically significant problems for which a change was implemented.

Images of simple contrast objects taken using the orthogonal bremsstrahlung beams showed superior contrast levels in comparison to those produced by the forward beams.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236230b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074v348</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wc90p"><dcterms:title>Three dimensional power spectra of motion parallax in cluttered three dimensional scenes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rivait, Derek.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The analysis in this thesis is motivated by two models in the literature. Dong and Atick [4] describe the relationship between spatial and temporal frequencies of videos of natural scenes. Langer and Mann [10] describe a geometric constraint on the power spectrum of individual image sequences produced by an observer moving laterally relative to a cluttered 3D scene. Langer and Mann's model proposes a bowtie pattern in the frequency domain, but does not consider the distribution of power within this bowtie. In this thesis we consider the distribution of power within the bowtie by applying the model of Dong and Atick. The model predicts a spreading of power away from the bowtie axis, and a bias of power towards low speeds. Using synthetic image sequences, we verify both of these predictions. Other contributing factors are discussed including occlusion, transparency and the distribution of objects over different depths in the scene.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2685403.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wc90p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20ss75n"><dcterms:title>Aéroports : quelques enjeux juridiques actuels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hartmann, Cyril.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following thesis deals with three current legal issues regarding airports. In the first chapter the development of airport ownership and management structures will be studied. Although in most cases airports are still owned and managed by governments or local bodies, since the 1960s, new approaches to ownership and management have come into practise. This phenomenon is studied from the perspective of its impact upon public air law. The second chapter deals with airport charges and their international legal framework. After examining the different forms of airport charges and the recommendations enacted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the author will be led to the conclusion that the current legal regime is unsatisfactory and that the most appropriate solution to this would be to incorporate the principles formulated by ICAO in an Annex to the Chicago Convention. The third and final chapter is devoted to the study of a legal dispute between Switzerland and Germany with respect to the approach paths to Zurich airport through German airspace. It is concluded that the unilateral legal measures taken by the German government are, with one exception, in conformity with international law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773v987.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20ss75n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Airport zoning -- Germany.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airports -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Airports -- Landing fees.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hs20z"><dcterms:title>Sets and senses : a work for symphony orchestra accompanied by an analysis : a hierarchy of scienceart interactions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Holbrook, Geoffrey.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Sets and the Senses is a work for symphony orchestra that bears the interaction between science and art as its overriding theme. Formalizations of compositional parameters that relate to this interaction are established, in particular those relating to the contrast between systematic and intuitively composed music, in order to provide a vehicle for musical communication on the theme. A summary of scientific and artistic elements of the compositional process reveals in the work an ingrained hierarchy of science/art interactions. Specific strategies for manipulating the science/art parameters are described. Genetic algorithms as applied to computer-assisted composition are discussed. The formal design of the work is described in terms of the relationship between science and art, accompanied by descriptions of systematic and intuitive musical procedures used.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/707957995.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs20z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Art and science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Scores.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Set theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1v53jx27f"><dcterms:title>Hecate nocturne : for large orchestra</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Johnson, Stephen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With Hecate Nocturne, I set out to create a unified piece of substantial length. The piece features certain sounds of British Columbia---birds, animals, wind, water, machinery, and folksong; their musical depictions represent a growing interest of mine, one which was expanded significantly in this piece. The primary goal of the thesis is a close interconnection of all musical material, at all levels; that a limited pool of material could produce, through motivic development, all the components of the piece, from small to large. The secondary goal is to give the music a "sense of place" through depictions of natural sounds occurring---in this case---in British Columbia. The tertiary goal is to write musical returns, or recapitulations, that are always significantly altered from their original presentations, to give the piece a feeling of consequence or alteration. This last goal arises from the aesthetic application of some of the composer's philosophical beliefs.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17ct17h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx27f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orchestral music.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cq751"><dcterms:title>Design and development of Van-gogh-like1 conditional mouse knockout</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Han, Steven.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neural tube defect is one of the leading causes of birth defect in human.

The situation clearly calls for corrective action in the form of a normative framework of effective regulations. Such a regulatory framework must needs to be enforced by a respected and dynamic international organization. Our research on this topic leads us to believe that the International Labour Organization (ILO) would be in an excellent position to supervise a proactive strategy of this kind, directly or indirectly, as it has the political clout and history to compel multinational corporations to respect their workers' most basic rights. In order to establish our case, we examine the legal questions at stake in this case study. In particular, we address the key attributes of multinational corporations, the issue of territorial sovereignty, the tripartite system, and the need for national legislation in any strategy involving workers' rights vis-a-vis multinational corporations. Next, we summarize the current level of accountability that multinational corporations have to their cross-border labour force. We then go on to discuss the ILO, the organization at the core of our reflections on multinational corporations' current (lack of) workplace accountability. Our research leads us to conclude that the ILO has not only the power to play that role, but also the duty to do so.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603qx74s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d0053</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>International Labour Organisation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor laws and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>International business enterprises -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pn16q"><dcterms:title>Places of refuge and the obligation to accommodate ships in distress</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ucar, Zeynep.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transport of oil or other hazardous substances by sea constitutes the backbone of the world economy. The fiscal benefits and dependence on the transport of oil and other substances by sea outweigh the dangers associated with the carriage of such substances by sea, especially the pollution of the marine environment. Although the absolute answer for the protection of the marine environment may be to prohibit the harm-producing activities altogether, and to turn to alternative energy-resources, it seems very unlikely that this will be the case in the near future. The feasible solution for the protection and preservation of the marine environment and safe marine transport calls for a liberal approach that redistributes these responsibilities amongst all the related interests. In this respect, this thesis examines the issue of places of refuge, as a measure to protect and preserve the marine environment, and the position in international law on the obligation to grant refuge to ships in distress. It is argued that the obligation to grant refuge, founded in early customary international law and denounced in current international documents, can be reformulated in an environmental context.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s2753.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn16q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Maritime law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marine pollution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Harbors of refuge.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azs25x890x"><dcterms:title>The Anglo American academic attitude towards the field of judicial evidence and its usefulness to rational fact finding in Honduras /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vargas, Erick Rodolfo.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I address the problem of the lack of academic attention to evidentiary issues in Honduras in comparison to Common Law Countries. I feel that Honduran law students need to be taught a working scheme to deal with issues of admissibility and weight of evidence in order to achieve the rational determination of facts. Moreover, I draw such a scheme from the conceptual basis for admission of evidence and the probative processes identified by Wigmore. I think that if this scheme were applied to trial records, academicians would identify problems in the admission and weight of evidence and would develop approaches to make reason and justice prevail. The scheme is presented in the form of a chart and because it is adapted to the Honduran context I consider that it will have a positive effect on academic research, theorization and teaching of issues of admission and weight of evidence in Honduras.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g542w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x890x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Evidence (Law) -- Great Britain.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evidence (Law) -- Honduras.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evidence (Law) -- United States.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795800q"><dcterms:title>La légalité de l'intervention humanitaire en droit international : entre la non-violence et le respect des droits de l'homme</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Villeneuve, François, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In spite of the general prohibition of the use of force in international relations contained in the UN Charter, some jurists maintain that humanitarian intervention is valid under comtemporary international law.

The first holds that humanitarian intervention is compatible with the UN Charter, and the second, which is used more often, that a right of humanitarian intervention has arise out of state's practice. The present thesis surveys these arguments and comes to the conclusion that humanitarian intervention remains illegal under international law. Notwithstanding the formidable progression of human rights in international society, the rule prohibiting recourse to force still enjoys great currency among states at the beginning of this new millenium.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j289.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795800q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nonviolence.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human rights.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Humanitarian intervention.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613mx85j"><dcterms:title>Nonlinear rock mass behaviour and application to stability of underground haulage drift</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Yaohua, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Numerical methods of analysis such as the finite element method and finite difference method have seen increasing use in recent years as tools for geomechanical mine design to predict problems of ground caving and failure. As a result of recent advances in computer technology, it is now possible to handle large-scale problems involving complex material and geometric nonlinearities at an affordable computational cost. The scope of this study is the stability of underground mine haulage drifts associated with sublevel stoping method with delayed backfill. This is one of the most popular mining methods today in Canadian underground metal mines. In this method, blasted ore is mucked with load-haul-dump vehicles and transported to the nearest dump through a nearby haulage drift. Therefore, it is crucial in a mining operation that a haulage drift remains functional during the life of the stope. This study is focused on studying the interaction between the haulage drift and nearby mining activity. The stability of the haulage drift is examined through a detailed parametric study of a finite element model representing typical mining layout most commonly adopted in Canadian underground metal mines. The model parametric study examines the influence of critical factors such as the stope mining sequences, mining depth and the distance between the stope and the haulage drift. The model is set up for nonlinear behaviour of the rock mass taking into account elastoplasticity of the rock mass and non-associated plasticity using Mohr Coulomb and Drucker Prager yield functions. Stability indicators are defined in terms of displacement, stress and the extent of yield zones. These indicators serve as a basis for assessing the effect of different parameters on the stability of the haulage drift. From the model parametric study, it is found that stope mining causes a lateral movement of the entire drift. The severity of such movement is increased with shorter distance between the stope and haulage drift. Of all mining sequences examined, same-level mining is the most critical step. It is also found that more yield zones develop around the haulage drift as the mining depth increases and as distance between haulage drift and the stope decreases. A 3-centre arc drift is compared with a rectangular one of the same cross sectional area. It is found that the 3-centre arc drift shape is more stable. This study also demonstrates that the nonlinear elastoplastic analysis gives more realistic results than traditional linear elastic analysis in terms of stress and displacement behaviour of the haulage drift.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f456.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mx85j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
