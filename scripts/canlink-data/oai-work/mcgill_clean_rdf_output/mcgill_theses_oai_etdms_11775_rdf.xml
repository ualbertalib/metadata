The destruction of tryptophane during acid hydrolysis is not, in all cases, due to the direct action of the acid since pure tryptophane is relatively stable in hot dilute sulphuric and hydrochloric acids. The destruction must, therefore, be due to some other constituent or constituents of the protein.

The main idea has been to open one of the rings in the steroid nucleus, introduce an isotopic carbon atom and regenerate the original steroid molecule for subsequent use. Among the four rings of the steroid molecule, ring A seemed to be the most desirable for this purpose because several important hormonal steroids, namely, testosterone, progesterone and corticoid hormones, possess a common ^3 unsaturated ketone group in ring A; thus a general method of labelling these steroids was sought.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jamieson, R.

More recent workers have shown that boron occurs in small proportions in the ash of many kinds of plants. In 1910 Agulhon published results of experiments showing increase in dry weight, over that of control without boron, of wheat, oats, and radish grown in sand cultures with 0.5 mg. of boron per kg. of sand.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Murray, H.

Annual losses in the wheat-growing area of Saskatchewan have been estimated at up to seventeen million busheis (Farstad, 1945). This would seem to indicate inadequate natural control. There are, however, several native parasites of this pest, and of these Microbracon cephi Gahan is the most important. In some areas this parasite has been very effective in reducing severe sawfly infestations.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>DuPorte, E.

The diet consisted mainly of whole wheat. As fed, it was found to be unsuitable for digestibility studies with guinea pigs. With sheep, a basal hay diet was fed and digestion coefficients determined indirectly. Variability between individuals was relatively low, for all species, for food fractions other than crude fiber and ether extract. Humans digested crude fiber to the same extent as pigs and rata. The range of the digestion coefficients for crude protein, nitrogen-free extract and digestible energy was remarkably small, considering that the species used in this study had anatomically different digestive systems. All species showed significant differences in the total digestible nutrients and digestible energy of the diet. Further research is needed in comparative species digestibility studies with humans.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.

It was found that Standard methods of wood analyses gave inconsistent results with typha seed hairs and an effort was made to discover why such methods were unsuitable in this particular case.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

The work was performed in the Departments of Experimental Surgery and Physiology at McGill University. In Chapter I, a description is given of a new method of preparing dogs for the study of metabolism. As will be pointed out, such preparations need not be restricted to this study but can be used to investigate several other problems. A review of the literature dealing with the bronchial vessels, as outlined in Chapter 2, emphasizes their importance to the physiology of respiration. It was felt, therefore, that it would be interesting to attempt to obliterate this vascular supply to one lung in dogs and to study the effect histologically.

Particular reference is made to the relative ages of these formations* their structures, and to major faults. The field evidence suggests that a red feldsparporphyry intrusive is younger than the granite which intrudes the volcanic porphyries. This, and to some extent the stratigraphic sequence proposed differ from previous findings. The distribution and attitudes of the sedimentary and volcanic formations indicate a flexure in a regional northv/esterly-trending open fold- Two sets of right-hand faults strike northerly and northeasterly respectively. The latter are marked by large displacements and in places by giant quartz veins. The horizontal movement along one such northeasterly-trending fault is determined as three to four miles. The age relations and causes of faulting are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jolliffe, A.
