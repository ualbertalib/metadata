In contrast to this, this work explores the color histogram intersection method. Simple thresholding processes color information pixel by pixel, whereas histogram intersection operates on groups of pixels. It thus captures more information. We investigate the possibility to localize faces based only on the use of color, as opposed to the post-processing of the thresholded image, usually required with simple thresholding. A color space is sought that minimizes the variations in facial color due to races and illumination conditions. We take advantage of the CIE XYZ color space because of both its perceptual superiority to the RGB space, and because a normalization of the space takes place prior to computing hue. We choose to specify facial color using just hue and we further model it through 1D hue histograms. We compute a generalized facial color model by accumulating facial color histograms across many images. An iterative algorithm scanning the image at multiple scales is proposed.

To identify occupational risk factors for cancer, a multi-site case-control study was conducted in Montreal; renal cell carcinoma was one of the sites. A total of 142 cases of renal cell cancer and 2,433 controls were interviewed in this study. Complete occupation histories were obtained, and a team of industrial hygienists and chemists estimated each subject's exposure to a list of industrial substances. Statistical analyses were carried out to estimate the association between renal cell cancer and each non-occupational and occupational variable. Among non-occupational variables collected and analysed, increased risks were observed for highest level of body mass index (BMI) and a previous history of hypertension. Negative associations were found for tea and coffee consumption. Increased risks were found in the following industries: printing related service, laundries, military, wholesale and retail trade industries. Increased risks were found in the following occupations: managers, plumbers, welders, printers, nursery workers, and aircraft mechanics. Exposure to the following substances significantly increased the risks for renal cell carcinoma: hair dust, felt dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, hydrogen sulphide, inorganic acid solution, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, jet fuel, aviation gasoline, jet fuel engine emissions, ink, chromium compounds, and ultraviolet radiation. The above findings were not adjusted for mutual confounding. After adjustment for known risk factors using multivariate logistic regression models, one non-occupational and several occupational risk factors were associated with renal cell carcinoma. These were: high BMI, asbestos, hair dust, felt dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, exposed to any of jet fuel, aviation gasoline, and jet fuel engine emission, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and ultraviolet</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Siemiatycki, Jack (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462755m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892d055</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c272r"><dcterms:title>Practical implementation for authentication of electronic transaction using mobile agents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hu, Song, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mobile agents are often described as a promising technology moving towards the vision of a widely distributed scalable electronic market.

To solve this scenario, we design a mobile agent model which involves two authentication levels: high-level customer authentication and low-level mobile agent authentication. As implementation of high level customer authentication, we select an opened CORBA based Java mobile agent system---Grasshopper. To achieve mobile agent level authentication, we suggest two cutting-edge security techniques: Java fine-grained access control from JDK 1.2 and the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol from Netscape.

Methods . 383 4th--6th grade Mohawk children (193 boys, 190 girls) completed questionnaires and had anthropometric measures taken during 2 serial cross-sectional surveys as part of the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (1994--1997). Physical activity was measured using the Weekly Activity Checklist. Demographics, community activities, parental variables, self-efficacy, sedentary activity, and overweight were correlates assessed using ordinal logistic regression. Results. 29.7, 33.4, and 36.8 percent were inactive, moderately active, and very active, respectively. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals [OR(95%CI)] of independent correlates for boys included year of measurement (1996 vs. 1994) [1.7(1.3,2.2)], older age [0.7(0.5,0.9)], and enrollment in school #1 [2.0(1.1,3.6)], lessons [2.8(1.3,5.9)] and summer sports [1.1(1.0,1.1].

Starting rock powders were sealed in Au75Pd25 capsules (that acted as the source of Au) with 5--7 wt.% water. Oxygen fugacities were near 2 log units above the nickel-nickel-oxide (NNO) buffer. Gold contents in experimental glass products were analyzed by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometers (LA-ICP-MS). Combining solubility data in "near" Cl saturated melts at an oxygen fugacity of 2 log units above the NNO buffer from this study and Au solubility data in H2O saturated with NaCl from Ballhaus et al. (1994), the fluid/melt partition coefficient for Au was calculated. A fluid/melt partition coefficient was calculated with Au solubility data that was extrapolated to 2 log units below the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer, using the relationship between log Au concentration and log fO2 from Borisov and Palme (1996). Sulfide/melt partition coefficients for Au were calculated by combining Au solubility data from this study with Au solubility data from Cygan and Candela (1995).

These domains are all characteristic of Ror receptors. Aruf is homologous to members of the Ret and FGF receptor subfamilies of RTKs. However, Aruf does not have the extracellular domains typical of those receptors. Furthermore the degree of identity between Aruf and either the Ret or FGF receptors is closer to that between members of different RTK subfamilies, than between members of the same subfamily.

In mammals and other organisms, 5-HT is synthesized through the action of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). TPH is the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, and as such sets the pace for the formation of 5-HT. TPH is a member of a family of enzymes that hydroxylate aromatic amino acids and have an absolute requirement for the pterin cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). It is unknown if this same enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of 5-HT in C. elegans and other helminths. Based on sequence information from the C. elegans Genome Data Base and RT-PCR, we have cloned a full-length C. elegans TPH cDNA (CeTPH) that shows high homology to mammalian TPH. The predicted coding sequence of CeTPH was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector, pET-15b, and the resulting construct was introduced into E. coli (BL21 DE3 pLys strain) for IPTG-inducible expression of CeTPH protein. Results show that CeTPH expressed in E. coli has TPH activity and also shows an absolute requirement for the cofactor, BH4, just as shown previously for the mammalian enzyme. It has been well established that 5-HT is present and is biologically active in the tissues of C. elegans. By way of characterizing furthur CeTPH, we examined the localization of TPH in whole mounts of C. elegans by immunofluoresence using a polyclonal antibody against TPH. Taken together, the results of this thesis characterize at the structural, functional and in situ levels one of the most primitive forms of TPH enzyme ever cloned.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ribeiro, Paula (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h75q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mm07n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tryptophan hydroxylase.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tt788"><dcterms:title>Function of the loki serinethreonine protein kinase and identification of valois</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hijal, Sirine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>loki was identified in our lab in a screen for novel serine-threonine protein kinases that are specifically expressed in the ovary. loki transcripts are expressed in early embryos and adult ovaries. In the ovaries, loki transcripts accumulate in the oocyte during early oogenesis, and by stage 8, are found to localize anteriorly to the oocyte-nurse cell interface. In order to understand the role of loki in Drosophila development, I created a loki mutant through excision of a P-element that had inserted 700bp upstream of loki. loki mutants display no apparent phenotype. I was also able to identify the transcription unit responsible for valois (vls) function since it is located downstream from loki in the 38B region. vls is a member of the posterior group gene family and vls mutant mother produce embryos that lack pole cells and show abdomen patterning defects. Further characterization of vls indicates that it is a fairly direct activator of Vasa protein: vls function is required between Oskar protein and Vasa in the posterior patterning pathway since Vasa fails to localize to the posterior pole of vls mutant eggchambers. I also find that Vasa is differentially modified in vls ovaries and embryos, even though it is not yet known whether this modification is required for localization, proper function or both processes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Suter, Beat (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602304v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tt788</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drosophila -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oogenesis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Protein kinases.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784n85m"><dcterms:title>Prooteoglycan synthesis in bovine intervertebral disc cells cultured in alginate beads : variation with age and modulation by TGF-b1</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Heathfield, Terrence Fran√ßois.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The major aim of this work was to develop a cell culture system in which changes in the rate of synthesis of intervertebral disc (IVD) matrix molecules could be evaluated in cells of animals of different ages. In particular, the synthesis of the large aggregating proteoglycans (PGs) and of decorin (DCN) and biglycan (BGN) were investigated. In addition, the potential use of growth factors to modulate the anabolism of these molecules was also studied. The results of these studies have demonstrated that the age related decline in PG biosynthesis observed in human disc tissue can be reflected in a bovine disc cell culture model. The three dimensional alginate bead cell culture model was effective in maintaining the phenotype of disc cells from both annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) regions in the presence of serum. Differences in phenotype of these respective cells were illustrated in vivo by the patterns of resident PGs obtained from tissue extractions. In the AF of young animals, the predominant form observed was a small PG form while in the NP of all age groups, aggrecan was the major species. In vitro collagen analyses confirmed the different phenotype of cells from the AF and NP regions. Also, TGF-beta1 was effectively used to stimulate over all PG synthesis in NP cells from and young adult bovine. After 10 days in culture, TGF-beta1 treated cells showed similar relative amounts of the small PGs compared to aggrecan as those determined from tissue extractions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alini, Mauro (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc63k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n85m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kq25b"><dcterms:title>Cyclical neutropenia : data analysis and modeling study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Haurie, Caroline.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We review the salient clinical and laboratory features of cyclical neutropenia (CN) and other periodic hematological disorders, and the insight into these diseases afforded by mathematical modeling.

The analysis of the serial blood counts in the animal model of CN---the grey collie (GC), reveals a complex pattern of oscillations that we could reproduce with a model of hematopoiesis combining a peripheral control of granulopoiesis through G-CSF, together with an oscillatory input from the pluripotential stem cell. Both the human and GC data analysis suggests that CN results from a complex interaction between the stem cells, the mature cells and G-CSF, and that the regulation of the different blood cell lineages are strongly linked together.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mackey, M.

One peak from NeutraseRTM digest, five peaks from NeutraseRTM /Debitrase(TM) digest, and two peaks from NeutraseRTM /L. casei enzyme digest were purified and identified by API mass spectrometry. All the purified peptides contained active sites within their sequences. The volatile compounds in a series of EMCs prepared by L. casei and commercial enzymes as well as Cheddar cheese (mild, old, extra old) were also identified by using Pyrolysis/GC/MS and dynamic headspace techniques.

Reliability is typically assessed quantitatively, through an appropriate coefficient, such as the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Validity, on the other hand, is assessed more informally through a series of tests and checks: for instance, construct validity may be established by testing the significance of factors that are supposed to influence the measure at hand. In general an ICC is calculated as a ratio of variance components to the total variance. Therefore the first step in the calculation of an ICC is the estimation of variance components from an appropriate statistical model. This thesis presents two approaches to the estimation of variance components in the context of reliability and validity studies: One is the ANOVA approach, based on the method of moments and valid especially for the case of balanced data. The other is the mixed linear model approach, for the more general case of unbalanced data. Furthermore, a general framework is developed which permits treatment of reliability and validity within the same statistical model, By means of this statistical model, a special case of the mixed linear model, appropriate ICCs for both reliability and validity can be computed, while construct validity can be established by testing the significance of appropriate fixed effects. The delta method and the bootstrap are proposed for the calculation of the standard errors and confidence intervals of the ICCs. Finally, an example of case-vignette study is presented. All calculations were carried out using the SAS system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ciampi, A.

The St. James (StJ) population is territorial; it competes aggressively with conspecifics but scramble competes with heterospecifics. The Deep Water Harbour (DWH) population forages nonaggressively in large homospecfic flocks. Earlier studies linking these social differences with differences in individual and social learning suggest that Z. aurita is ideal for testing predictions from Brown's (1964) theory of economic defendability. Firstly, the hypothesis that resource defence will increase as the spatial clumping and temporal predictability of a resource increases was tested at 6 sites at DWH with a randomized complete block design. Secondly, spatial distribution of food was manipulated at both DWH and StJ in an attempt to alter the mode of foraging competition at DWH from scramble to interference, and to elicit group-feeding in the otherwise territorial StJ doves. As predicted, rates of aggression per intruder were highest for those sites at DWH receiving a spatially clumped and temporally predictable food source. Unlike those at DWH, doves from StJ did not modify their mode of foraging competition in response to variations in spatial distribution, but rather as a consequence of increased resource density. Interference competition appears to be the default strategy for Zenaida doves, with birds switching to scramble competition when a threshold of resource density is reached, only to revert back to aggressive defence when the spatial clumping and temporal predictability of food increases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lefebvre, Louis (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827d77r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b53t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Zenaida aurita -- Food -- Barbados.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition (Biology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Zenaida aurita -- Behavior -- Barbados.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117r03z"><dcterms:title>Commissioning a dynamic multileaf collimator on a linear accelerator</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>G√©linas, Dominic.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present generation of medical linear accelerators is computer controlled providing great precision in dose delivery in addition to other options, such as conformal radiotherapy which involves intensity modulated fields. These fields are produced with multileaf collimators (MLCs) capable of delivering a radiation beam with a pre-determined modulated intensity using the dynamic capabilities of the MLC leaves. Two dynamic beam delivery methods are currently used: the step and shoot method and the continuous motion method. The first consists of several static subfields with the motion of the leaves occurring without the presence of radiation, while in the other the leaves may move with the beam on. The work presented here intends to prove that dynamically enabled linear accelerators can be used with confidence by verifying the accuracy and the stability of motions of the movable axes for the two dynamic beam delivery methods. Prior to clinical use, the integrity of the entire beam delivery system must be tested and the dosimetry related to the MLC must be examined. The purpose of this thesis is to develop, analyze and perform tests for the commissioning of the dynamic beam delivery capabilities of a medical linear accelerator and to catalogue these tests to facilitate their implementation in a routine quality assurance program.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, M.

Information on the changes that occur in protein secondary structure upon heating is provided by detailed examination of the amide I band, as different protein conformations have characteristic amide I frequencies. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to study the changes in protein structure that occur during gelation of whey protein isolate (WPI) and (ii) to correlate the changes in protein structure observed under different physico-chemical conditions to rheological properties of WPI gels prepared under the same conditions. The FTIR spectra of D2O solutions of WPI at different pHs, ranging from 3 to 10, were recorded as the temperature of the solution was increased from room temperature to 95¬∞C in 5¬∞C increments. In all the solutions studied, the formation of two new bands at 1618--1623 cm -1 and 1678--1684 cm-1 was observed upon heating; these bands are characteristic of aggregate formation and have been previously assigned to antiparallel beta-sheet structure. As the pH increased from 3 to 10, the aggregation temperature of WPI decreased from 85¬∞C to 65¬∞C. The rheological properties of WPI gels were studied by employing an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The Instron measurements demonstrated that protein concentration, heating temperature, and heating and cooling time are directly related to gel strength. The changes in gel strength as a function of cooling time (for gels prepared by heating at 75¬∞C for 45 min) were correlated to FTIR spectral data for WPI solutions subjected to the same treatment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ismail, A.

The objectives of this project were to estimate the metal speciation in urban soils and to evaluate the predictability of soil metal pools on plant uptake. The chemical speciation of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn was estimated by using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM). In soil solutions, Cd, Ni and Zn were present mainly as free ions when the solutions were acidic and their organic complexes were dominant as the pH was over 7.5. The other two metals mostly formed complexes with organic ligands. The activities of Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Zn 2+ were affected by soil pH and total soil metal burdens. All five metals were under-saturated with respect to the minerals which could potentially control the metal solubility. Metal uptake by plants in the contaminated railway yards was generally not correlated with free, dissolved and total soil metal pools. A pot experiment demonstrated better correlations between the metal pools and the metal content in wild chicory. Multiple regression analysis showed that the metals in the leaves and roots of wild chicory could be adequately predicted by the soil total metals and soil properties such as pH and exchangeable Ca.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendershot, William H.

Aleochara bilineata Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) is a natural enemy of the cabbage maggot. Adults of this species are predators of eggs and larvae of cabbage maggot and the first instar larvae are ectoparasitoids of cabbage maggot pupae. A. bilineata oviposits its eggs in the soil, near plants infested with cabbage maggots. Differences in size have been noted in the eggs of A. bilineata . In insects several factors can affect egg size. Certain females can oviposit small trophic eggs which serve as food for emerging larvae or egg size can be affected by factors such as size and age of female, as well as, food and host quality. These factors have been studied in A. bilineata in order to determine the conditions that favor the production of small eggs.

The use of the blue product as a precipitation agent for nickel and zinc in the treatment of acid mine drainage has been explored in a preliminary manner.

The source of arsenic is unclear. It could be supplied to the Fjord by the marine waters which enter from the St. Lawrence Estuary or may have accumulated as a result of historically high levels of effluent input. The waters of the Saguenay Fjord are also characterized by anomalously high particulate aluminum concentrations (i.e., [Al]tot/[Al] diss &gt; 1), introduced as a result of the aluminum refining activity along the shores of its tributaries. Gibbsite (Al(OH)3), a by-product of this activity, is known to strongly adsorb phosphate and arsenate from low ionic strength aqueous solutions, and may act as a vector for these two elements to sediments of the Saguenay Fjord. The small amount of arsenate and phosphate adsorbed onto gibbsite from seawater indicates that their adsorption to particulate aluminum in the water column cannot account for the elevated levels of arsenic and phosphate in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord.

In this study, the defecation periods in older wild type and clk-1 mutant worms were found to be similar despite their differences in young adults. Transgenic strains which express high levels of clk-1 were characterized phenotypically. Over-expression of the clk-1 gene has no observed effect on physiological rates as measured conventionally in young adults but rather has an effect on defecation rates in an age-dependent manner. A proportion of ageing transgenic animals over-expressing clk-1 did not have decreased defecation period, as seen in ageing wild type and clk-1 mutants. This suggests that the action of CLK-1, which functions in controlling physiological rates, is reduced in older wild type worms. As previously characterized, clk-1 mutants have lengthened life spans compared to wild type (Wong et al., 1995). Consistent with this effect, we found transgenic strains with high clk-1 expression to have a shortened average life span. Furthermore, no effect on average life span was found in transgenic control strains in which clk-1 expression was not altered, confirming that the presence of the transgene and the phenotype marking its presence do not influence the observed effects in strains with high clk-1 expression. Together, the findings from both the studies on physiological rates and life span suggest that clk-1 plays a role in determining the rate at which worms age.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hekimi, Siegfried (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s62m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q606</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Longevity.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bk31d"><dcterms:title>Parametric solutions to the generalized Fermat equation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Esmonde, Jody.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this paper we examine parametric solutions to the generalized Fermat equation, xp+yq=zr.

In cells depleted of GSH by L-Buthionine Sulfoximine (BSO), Cisplatin-resistance was significantly decreased in both cell lines. BSO had no effect on the radiation resistance of either cell lines.
