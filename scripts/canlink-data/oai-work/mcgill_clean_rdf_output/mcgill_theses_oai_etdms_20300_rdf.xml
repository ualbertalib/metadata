By considering Head as a social realist, the thesis relates sociological evidence to authorial interest and demonstrates Head's treatment of the power issue in her three novels, When Rain Clouds Gather, Maru, and A Question of Power. Biographical data, particularly Head's unique, though socially marginal position as a political exile, a Coloured, and a woman are also applied. The thesis covers three areas--politics, race, and gender. The first explores the nature of power in South African politics within the time-frame of the present, past, and future. The second which focuses on the institution of apartheid examines racial relations between the blacks and whites and also among the blacks, with attention given to the dilemma of the Coloured. The third section discusses sexual politics, looking at male-female relationships in both traditional and contemporary societies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r679v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w29m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Head, Bessie, 1937-1986 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dw66v"><dcterms:title>Effect of signalling a positive reinforcer on contextual conditioning</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Steinwald, Hannah</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three experiments used an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning procedure to investigate the ability of the context to generate excitation. Discrete stimuli (CSs) signalling food unconditioned stimuli (USs) were used to decrease contextual conditioning. Detailed observations of the behaviours of rats during and immediately preceding the presentation of CSs, and in an event-free period were analysed. Experiment 1 showed that a discrete visual CS was able to interfere with contextual conditioning because it was a more efficient cue for food than the context. Experiment 2 found that an auditory CS could reduce contextual conditioning in a similar manner but the topography of responding during the event-free period was specific to the modality of the CS. Experiment 3 demonstrated that signal-appropriate responding during the event-free period occurred only if the CS was a signal for reinforcement.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s359x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw66v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Classical conditioning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b738c"><dcterms:title>Assessment of nonlinear least-squares estimation of monod kinetic parameters from batch reactor experiments</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Villarreal Rodriguez, Marco Antonio</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It is known that the use of batch experiments for the estimation of kinetic coefficients is a better alternative than continuous flow reactors, in terms of the time needed to perform the experiments. In this study a new methodology to estimate the four Monod-kinetic parameters from batch reactor data set is presented. This method fits biomass and substrate plots simultaneously via nonlinear least-squares analysis. The nonlinear equations are solved via the secant method. The methodology performed satisfactorily with two synthetic data sets. It was also applied to seven batch reactor data sets available in the literature and to ten data sets from batch experiments using wastewater and sludge from the municipality wastewater treatment plant in Granby, Quebec. The constants estimated vary considerable among themselves, and some were not within the range of values commonly found in the literature. The methodology proposed yields parameter estimates which produce the minimum sum of squares residuals. It is believed that further studies are needed if one is to attempt estimating the four Monod-kinetics constants using batch reactors experiments.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bq525.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b738c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zv52d"><dcterms:title>Physical oceanography of northern estuaries</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Veilleux, Lorraine</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Within the context of oceanographic research on northern estuaries in James Bay and Hudson Bay, and in relation with hydroelectric developments and their impact on the physical environment, two studies were undertaken. Both concern the importance of bottom topography, tidal motion and fresh water input on the estuarine processes in these areas. The first one, in Rupert Bay (south-eastern corner of James Bay), describes tidal and local wind effects on circulation and mixing patterns for summer conditions. An estimate of terms in the lateral momentum equation shows that the centrifugal acceleration, the Coriolis force and the baroclinic pressure gradient are the most important forces at a mid-bay cross section transect. The second study is concerned with the freshwater plume of Great Whale River (south-eastern Hudson Bay). CTD measurements were used to examine the lift-off point of the plume for under-ice and increasing discharge conditions. Comparison with existing models shows them to be inappropriate for under-ice conditions. Finally, the presence of supercooled water masses in the region of the study is reported.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j96021990.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv52d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physical Oceanography.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289k30j"><dcterms:title>A user interface for a programming environment /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boulos, Sami</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Poor user interfaces in programming environments detract from environments' power and ineffectively communicate with users. Moreover, specification, development, testing, and modification of these usually large, complex, and handcrafted user interfaces are difficult, error prone, slow, and costly. An alternative is user-interface generation. This thesis deals with two primary issues: xmupe2, a user-friendly user interface for the MUPE-2 programming environment, and user-interface generation. Implemented in Modula-2 and C for the X Window System, xmupe2 shows MUPE-2's character with: windows tailored to program-fragments, textual and graphical representations of fragments' contents, and editing commands fired by context-sensitive mouse-based menus. Secondly, and because of the effort in handcrafting xmupe2, the thesis introduces MUISL, an experimental event-driven user-interface specification language. MUISL defines user-interface objects with inheritable classes, attributes, and actions. Then presented in muigen--a flexible, table-driven, and MUISL-based user-interface generator. Both MUISL and muigen simplify user-interface development, as exemplified in the thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903113z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289k30j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53ww957"><dcterms:title>A decision support system for soil conservation planning /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Montas, Hubert J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A Decision Support System for the design and planning of soil conservation systems on a watershed scale was conceived and applied to southwestern Quebec. The system integrated Geographical Information System, distributed parameter hydrologic modeling and Expert System technologies. Maps of appropriate soil conservation practices were produced for two small rural basins representative of the study region. The effect of the selected practices on runoff and sediment was assessed using the ANSWERS model. Erosion sites were targeted using a once-in-25 year design storm. It was observed that small portions of the study basins produced large amounts of eroded sediment. The expert system was designed to select appropriate conservation practices for the 1-ha cells which had more than one ton of erosion as a result of the design storm. The results demonstrated that the selected conservation practices would reduce sediment yield and average erosion rates by 50% in each of the study basins.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m529n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww957</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Decision support systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil conservation -- Québec (Province) -- Planning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn1070223"><dcterms:title>The common play of ironic understanding : a critical study of Kieran Egan's theory of educational development</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hammond, David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>My thesis centers on a critical analysis of the concept of the "educated person" in Kieran Egan's theory of educational development. Egan presupposes that the erudite human being in western societies is ideally a sophisticated ironic thinker, that is, a person who possesses the fullest range of sense making capacities known to our culture; and furthermore, a person who tactfully and innovatively applies these capacities in everyday life. My thesis attempts a "thick" description of Egan's notion of ironic understanding in light of the writings of Martin Buber on dialogue, Hannah Arendt on human thinking, Hans Georg Gadamer on the serious playfulness of the interpretative act, Richard Rorty on private irony and liberal democracy, and finally, Michael Oakeshott on the educational conversation. It suggests that these theoretical notions of the fully human life may be practically realized in the educated ironist characterized by Egan in his various writings.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj87x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn1070223</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Egan, Kieran -- Contributions in education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Philosophy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d71s"><dcterms:title>A measurement of the hadronic production of J/[psi]'s /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Simard, A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The production of charmonium states J/$ Psi$ and $ Psi sp prime$ was measured at 300 GeV/c with $ pi sp{ pm}$, p, and p beams on a lithium target.
