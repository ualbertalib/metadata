The effects of changes in growth conditions, such as temperature, growth medium, and incubation time, sampling conditions on the reproducibility of the spectra were investigated. The spectra of bacteria suspended in saline solution, in D$ sb2$O-saline and on plate films were obtained and stored in separate spectral libraries. The application of library search routines for differentiation and identification of the 14 bacteria was investigated. The spectral regions used for the library search include 1750-1560 cm$ sp{-1}$ and 1480-960 cm$ sp{-1}$, which contain bands mainly associated with proteins (secondary structure), lipids, and polysaccharides. An index produced by the library search, which indicates how much an "unknown spectrum" matches a library spectrum, is suggested as a criterion for the differentiation and identification of bacteria. A correct identification of five unknown samples shows the feasibility of using spectral library searching routines for identification of bacteria down to the species level by FTIR spectroscopy. This technique is rapid, easier, and more efficient than conventional microbiological and biochemical methods. Quantitative analysis of a mixture of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by the partial-lest-square (PLS) technique was also evaluated. The analytical error was about 10%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ismail, A. A.

This duality of concern has led to a demand for increased numbers of highly accurate and precise determinations of selenium in biological materials. A convenient procedure was developed for determining selenoamino acids by HPLC-THG-AAS, based on the derivatization of these analytes with Sanger's reagent. Selenomethionine, selenocystine and selenocysteine (after blocking the free selenol group with phenylmercurio cation) were converted to their N-2,4-dinitrophenyl derivatives, and separated on a Nucleosil 5-NO$ sb2$ column with methanolic mobile phase containing acetic acid and triethylamine. Furthermore, an improved HPLC-AAS interface design was modified and optimized for the detection of selenium in HPLC column eluate. The new design was (i) compatible with aqueous mobile phases containing volatile buffers and (ii) provided equivalent molar response to analytes containing Se($-$II), Se(+IV) and Se(+VI). A method for simultaneously determination of selenate, selenite, selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine was developed by using the HPLC-AAS system with aqueous acetic acid containing ammonium acetate as eluate solution on the cyanopropyl column. The equivalent low ng limits of detection (1-2 ng as Se) for different oxidation states of selenium analytes were obtained using several different mobile phases and/or columns. A phenol extraction procedure for selenate, selenite, selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine was evaluated for the determination of these selenium analytes in natural waters and wheat samples. The current HPLC-AAS system provides an inexpensive alternative to conventional techniques for the determination of selenium analytes in environmental samples.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, W.

Patients were diagnosed by a psychiatrist and 71 were additionally diagnosed via structured clinical interview (SCID or A-DIS-R). All subjects resided in the province of Quebec. Subjects consisted of two groups: patients referred for treatment and patients recruited by a newspaper advertisement for a drug study on panic disorder. The age of onset in both groups was inversely related to having a family history of panic disorder, or anxiety disorders, or major affective disorders, or substance abuse disorders. To evaluate the presence of psychopathology in family members a semi-structured family history interview was used throughout. Multigenerational panic disorder was defined as having three or more affected relatives in at least two generations. This familial form of panic disorder was present in 15% of the pedigrees overall. There was a significant difference between the two groups in regard to family history of major affective disorder with the referral group having significantly more probands with a family history of major affective disorder. There was no difference between groups with respect to panic disorder, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse disorders. Age of onset of panic disorder was significantly lower in probands who were referred for treatment than those recruited for the drug study. Subjects were then recombined with respect to a history of comorbid depression. The presence of a comorbid diagnosis of depression in the proband predicted a multigenerational family history of major affective disorder.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Palmour, R. M.

E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nitrate leaching was studied on a 2.4-ha subsurface-drained corn (Zea mays L.) field in southwestern Quebec. The soil was a sandy loam to loamy sand (mean depth 46 cm) overlying clay. Treatments, begun in fall 1991, consisted of no-till, reduced tillage, and conventional tillage with crop residues either removed or retained at harvest. Drain flow volume and NO$ sb3 sp-$-N concentrations in flow were monitored year-round, and soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N levels measured in spring and fall. A total of 34 kg NO$ sb3 sp-$-N ha$ sp{-1}$ was recorded in drain flow in 1992 from the site as a whole, equivalent to 20% of applied fertilizer N. In the first 14 months of monitoring, over 70% of water samples had NO$ sb3 sp-$-N levels exceeding Canadian drinking water guidelines (10 mg NO$ sb3 sp-$-N L$ sp{-1}),$ and about 25% had over 40 mg NO$ sb3 sp-$-N L$ sp{-1}.$ Flow-weighted mean concentration for the site as a whole in 1992 was 19 mg NO$ sb3 sp-$-N L$ sp{-1}.$ Unanticipated variations in drain depth significantly affected flow volume and total NO$ sb3 sp-$-N losses, hampering assessment of treatment effects on drain water parameters. In 1992, post-harvest soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N levels at 0-25 cm were significantly lower in plots with crop residues retained, regardless of tillage system, than in plots with residues removed. In May 1993 (pre-tillage), soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N levels were similar for all treatments, having dropped in no-residue plots and risen slightly in plots with residues, suggesting immobilization of NO$ sb3 sp-$-N by crop residues in summer-fall and mineralization in spring. The NO$ sb3 sp-$-N measured in drain flow represents a substantial loss of N from the farm system, and has negative implications for water quality. Within the time-frame of the study, crop residues appeared to have a greater effect on soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N levels, and thus leaching potential, than did tillage system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mehuys, Guy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn3012484.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz85r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Soils -- Nitrate content.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Leaching.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tillage.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Corn -- Residues.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2f75r9001"><dcterms:title>Agriculture and the environment : an economic-ecologic input-output model of the Canadian economy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carpentier, Line Chantal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The current environmental movement calls for a re-evaluation of many economic-ecologic relationships. The objective of this study is to identify industrial sectors and final demands most responsible for particular types of residual discharge and resource use. An economic-ecologic model was constructed for the Canadian economy from the Statistics Canada I-O as modified by Thomassin et al. (1992). This modified version with its 12 agricultural sectors and 16 food processing sectors is best suited for agricultural policy analysis. The model estimates national erosion, pesticide and fertilizer use as well as air and water pollutants, solid waste, and water use associated with specified economic activities. Two different scenarios were analyzed. In the first, the impact on both the economy and the environment from changes in the final demand for agricultural and food commodities was simulated. Each commodity's final demand was increased by $1 million and its impact compared to the other simulated results. The ten commodities studied yielded similar economic impacts, while their environmental impacts differed considerably. Changes in the demand for wheat and oilseeds had the largest environmental impacts. In the second scenario, the effects of a $1 million increase in each final demand category were compared. This scenario focussed on markets rather than products. The construction, exports and personal expenditures categories were the greatest generator of wastes and the largest user of free resources. The exports category yielded twice as much erosion than personal expenditures and twenty times more than the next highest value (construction).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomassin, Paul (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m5362.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r9001</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Canada -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Environmental economics -- Canada -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural ecology -- Economic aspects -- Canada -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xw27p"><dcterms:title>Induction of vacuolar H+-translocating pyrophosphatase during anoxia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carystinos, George D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Anaerobiosis results in low ATP levels and cytoplasmic acidosis. Pyrophosphate (PPi) may play an important role in anaerobiosis as an energy source replacing ATP, as suggested by the hypoxic induction of PPi:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase and sucrose synthase in preference to phosphofructokinase and invertase. Here we show that vacuolar H$ sp+$-translocating pyrophosphatase (PPase) is also strongly induced by anoxia in rice seedlings. The PPase transcript abundance is increased within the first hours of anoxia, and decreases within 2 days after the return of seedlings to air, similarly to alcohol dehydrogenase-1 (Adh1). However, tissue studies show that the highest transcript induction for PPase is in the root whereas the highest induction of Adh1 is in the shoot. Assays of enzyme specific activity indicate a 75-fold increase in PPase activity over 6 days of anoxia, while the vacuolar ATPase changes only slightly. Return of seedlings to air results in rapid disappearance of enzyme activity. Chilling stress in rice seedlings also gives rise to an increase in immunoreactive PPase enzyme, and a progressive 20-fold increase in enzyme specific activity within 6 days. Upon return to room temperature both enzyme level and specific activity decrease. In corn, hypoxic stress results in a small induction in the PPase transcript, and no increase in PPase specific activity, which, however, is constitutively high in this material. It is suggested that in both species, H$ sp+$-PPase may play an important role in hypoxia and chilling stress, not only in conserving ATP, but also in limiting cytoplasmic acidosis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Poole, Ronald J.
