How this grew from the $75 millions owed at Confederation this essay will attempt to chronicle. In the story of the growth of the national debt is reflected the story of Canada -- her booms and depressions, her periods of expansion and her periods of stagnation, the triumphs of her statesmen and the mistakes of her statesmen. Particularly the mistakes. Most legislative blunders would be soon forgotten were it not for the fact that they had some financial repercussions. Yet too often is it true that the effect remains while the cause tends to be lost in obscurity; it is rapidly becoming that way with the Dominion debt. The public is prone to look at its size and to condemn recent governments for their inability to cope with it: an examination of the origin of the burden might engender a rather more sympathetic attitude towards those who must find ways of obtaining money to meet the annual interest charges. What is of even greater importance is bringing clearly into focus the nature of the mistakes made in the history of Canadian public finance. For it is from an analysis of these mistakes that the future has the most to gain. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Culliton, J.

The drama had its ultimate origin in the services of the Church and it is from this religious drama of the Middle Ages that our modern theatre developed. At first the clergy dramatized parts of the simple Bible stories in the chancel during the Church service. Later the drama lost direct connection with the service and the presentation was given in other parts of the Church. These performances, which were known as the Miracle and Mystery Plays, were for the purpose of the moral and religious edification of the people. [...] The drama did not remain permanently under the control of the guilds. In the fifteenth century an interest in the old classical plays was awakened and the regular English drama began to take form. Plays were performed at the universities, in public halls and private houses, and the inn-yard was used during the early sixteenth century. [...] The history and the development of scenery, costumes and lighting will be studied individually in this thesis, and general stage equipment will be considered as it relates to each of these. The relation of scenery, costumes and lighting will be examined and the effects created will be compared with the feeling for form, colour, composition and light which art from the middle of the nineteenth century onward has made a common possession.

J. Carlyle treats of the place of St. Augustine in the history of political thought. In general he regards Augustine as a typical representative of Patristic thought, and finds his significance in the history of political ideas to lie in his re-statement of the traditional view of the Stoics and the Christian Fathers. On only one point does Carlyle find Augustine differing from the Stoic-Patristic tradition. It is the question of the relation of the state to justice. Augustine had quoted Cicero's definition of a people: "A people is not every rabblement of the multitude, but a society gathered together in one consent of law, and in one participation of profit." According to Carlyle, Augustine interpreted Cicero correctly as meaning that there can be no state where there is no justice, because there can be no law where there is no justice. But Augustine, unable to allow that a pagan state was just, found it impossible to apply Cicero's definition, and searched about for another which would not make justice an essential part of the state.[...] It shall be the purpose of this thesis, then, to examine once more Augustine's teaching respecting the nature of the state with a view to discovering whether he really meant that justice is not an essential element in its constitution, and, if not, what he proposed the bond of society to be.

Although most of our Canadian soils are well supplied with total phosphorus, only a very small proportion of this is available to plants. [...] We may state the question thus: Does the large quantity of organic phosphorus in our soils represent simply an accumulation of the end products of the decomposition of organic material added to the soil, thus being inactive and of little use for the phosphorus nutrition of plants; or does it still constitute an active part of the phosphorus cycle in our soils, being a store, as it were, of organic phosphorus continuously being synthesized by micro-organisms or repleted from plant residues, and simultaneously being decomposed and mineralized by other micro-organisms, thus providing a source of phosphate readily available for plant assimilation? Before this question can be answered, a great deal has to be learned about the nature and properties of the organic phosphorus in soils. Undoubtedly, phosphorus in the soil takes part to some extent in a dynamic biological cycle, as do nitrogen, carbon and sulphur. Just as the availability of nitrogen in the soil is greatly influenced by soil conditions (pH, moisture etc.) so also it is probable that the transformations of phosphorus are likewise affected and thus it may be possible to change the conditions in our soils so that organic phosphorus may be more readily mineralized.

The Empire mine is a part of the property of Bralorne Mines Ltd. at Bralorne,B.C. The property is made up of 61 claims, and is northwest of and adjoins that of Pioneer Gold Mines. The Empire mine is in the central section of the property and is bounded on the northwest by the King mine and by the Coronation mine on the southeast.

Development work on the Empire mine has reached a depth of 1500 feet, and the present programme of development and exploration will extend these workings to 2400 feet. At present the mill treats about 530 tons a day, and the average tenor of the ore is about .50 oz. of gold a ton, making the Bralorne the leading gold producer of British Columbia. According to Company records the gold production for the year 1939 was 105,472 ozs. ($3,767,372) from 184,922 tons of ore.

The argument runs as follows: Economic Evolution (Development) in the Capitalist system proceeds non monotonically and is inherently cyclical. Without Development the system is not capitalist. Factors External (Chapter one) and Internal (Chapters three and four) disturb equilibrium conditions (Chapter two). Stripped of External factors and the Internal (except innovation) the system would still be cyclic. Hence he concludes that Innovation is the prime cause of cyclicity. Theoretically the system moves about a neighborhood of equilibrium in prosperity and recession phases; when secondary forces exert their influence the cycle develops four phases, prosperity, recession, depression and revival. Entrepreneurs introduce innovations with the hope of profits because of new lower cost production functions, but imitating entrepreneurs benefiting from the experience of pioneer entrepreneurs soon innovate also and compete, thus reducing profits to the vanishing point. Incompetent firms will be forced to give up the struggle. And when this process is completed, when costs and prices tend towards equilibration, the air is cleared for a new wave of innovations. Innovations appear in clusters, major ones producing long Kondratieff cycles, while lesser give us the Juglar, and the Kitchin cycles are the product of minor innovations.

However, the effect of temperature of preliminary drying on the apparent lignin content of succulent plant tissues has been largely overlooked in these studies.

Logan (1) as early as 1863, however, correctly interpreted the structure of the peninsula as a great east-west trending synclinorium. When the Federal lead - zinc and the Miller copper prospects were found just after the First World War, detailed mapping of the interior was commenced. The areal geology mapped by I.W. Jones in the district served as a basis for the study of the Miller properties. The mineralisation of the Miller claims is pyrometasamatic but, in certain respects, it differs radically from mineralisation of other deposits of this type in Eastern North America. In Gaspe, the grade of regional alteration of the Devonian rocks is very low, - comparable perhaps to that of the Trenton group in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. Certain rock3 of Lower Devonian age, however, show contact metamorphism of a high grade over restricted areas. Mineralised skarns and porcellanites have been produced. Pyrometasomatic deposits of the skarn type in the Grenville sub-province are characteristically coarse in grain, and this and certain other features suggest that they were formed at great depths under considerable pressure. The skarns of the Miller deposits, on the other hand, are extremely fine in grain, and give evidence of shallow formation without extreme hydrostatic or tangential pressures.

Early workers investigated whether a reaction would or would not go and what yield of products it would give but they gave little consideration to the mechanism of the reaction. [...] In many cases, moreover, the products of the primary decomposition would also decompose so that the final products gave little information about the primary processes. [...] The industrial importance of the hydrocarbons has aroused great interest in their thermal decomposition mechanisms. Unfortunately, however, the thermal decomposition reactions of these compounds generally involve a great many steps that are extremely hard to untangle and the choice of a mechanism, in many cases, becomes one of pure speculation. Consequently, attempts have been made to supplement the information obtained from thermal studies by independent methods. The present investigation is concerned with the applicability of the free radical theory to hydrocarbon decompositions. Information is obtained by an independent method: mercury photosensitization. However, since contemporary knowledge of the subject comes from a variety of sources, it will be advantageous to review the theory of free radicals and to point out the information that can be obtained by the various independent methods before proceeding to specific reactions.
