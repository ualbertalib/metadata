The case considered is that of fully developed laminar flow under constant heat flux. All fluid properties are considered constant except the density. Velocity and temperature equations are developed by perturbation analysis in terms of power series of Rayleigh number. Solutions have been obtained up to second order in Rayleigh number. When density is considered variable only in the buoyancy terms the resulting equations contain dimensionless parameters; Rayleigh, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.
