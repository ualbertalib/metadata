Scepticism exists, however, about its validity because the hippocampus may not be completely irrigated by the internal carotid artery. EEG analysis in patients having intracerebral electrodes showed the hippocampus to be clearly affected. To ensure that memory is tested only during Amytal inactivation, monitoring the duration of inactivation is necessary. It was found that EEG measures predicted a significantly shorter duration than motor and sensory measures. EEG slow waves caused by Amytal were also shown to predict low memory scores.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b2327.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv37j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w0324205"><dcterms:title>Bi-based high Tc superconducting fibers by melt extraction</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chang, Jack J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bismuth-based high T$ sb{c}$ superconductors were prepared from amorphous precursors made by melt-extraction.

This thesis develops the finite element formulations and computer programs for modelling the free and constrained inflation of thin polymer sheets in relation to thermoforming applications. In recognition of the generally time-dependent viscoelastic behaviour of polymers, and the large strains encountered in thermoforming applications, the material is modelled as non-linear viscoelastic. For this purpose the constitutive relation proposed by Christensen is adopted, assuming the relaxation function to be exponential. Most published work on nonlinear viscoelastic membranes deals with simple axisymmetric geometries, while the finite element formulations presented in this work are for both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric membrane inflations, including contact against constraining surfaces. Both frictionless and slipless idealizations of contact conditions are studied. The finite element solutions of free and constrained inflations of circular membranes serve as illustrative examples for the axisymmetric case, while those for elliptical membranes serve this purpose for the nonaxisymmetric case. Comparison of the finite element results with the analytical solutions obtained for some simple free and constrained inflation problems shows excellent agreement.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s1617373.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n225s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4m90dw65k"><dcterms:title>Implementation of delay and nondeterminism in a database programminglanguage</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Douik, Samir</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The programming language RELIX (RELational database system on unIX) was designed to provide, in a single framework, a database querying facility and a very high level data processing capability. This first goal was achieved by introducing a new fundamental concept of the "Relation as a primitive data unit", associated with a powerful algebra to operate on relations. In addition to this relational algebra, there is an algebra of attributes, the so-called domain algebra. A second goal is to integrate fundamental concepts in programming languages with the central ideas of relational databases. In particular, features such as inter-processes communication, nondeterminism and synchronization are missing from RELIX. This thesis is concerned with the design and implementation of the minimum new syntax to express synchronization between processes on one hand and, on the other, to provide mechanisms to express nondeterminism and parallelism. The syntax to express synchronization follows closely the syntax of the T$ sb-$selector in RELIX. On the other hand, the semantics draw heavily on the ideas of LINDA. Three new operators are added to express nondeterminism, parallelism and sequential execution. These operators are binary and operate on relations. The work involves adding to the RELIX translator new syntax rules and routines to perform semantic checking and code generation and to the interpreter, new functions which evaluate the relational algebra operations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n493.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw65k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613mz683"><dcterms:title>Protein synthesis and drought stress in two rapeseed cultivars</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leblanc, Rosanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Desiccation effects on rate and pattern of protein synthesis in Brassica napus (cv westar) and Brassica juncea (cv cutlass) have been examined.

ELM's ability to activate basic-level knowledge from pictures and words is investigated using accuracy-based and chronometric measures. The pattern of ELM's category-specific visual agnosia is concomitant with his failure to show priming and typicality effects for words.

In addition, the hardstem bulrush (Scirpus lacustris glaucus (Sm.) Hartm) litter present was replaced with a non-nutritive artificial substrate in half of the fertilized and unfertilized enclosures. Fertilization did not affect the dry weight loss of bulrush litter, but N and P concentrations were higher in the decomposing litter of the fertilized treatments. Dominant taxa of nektonic herbivores-detritivores responded to fertilization but were not affected by the replacement of plant litter by a non-nutritive substrate. Epiphytic herbivores-detritivores responded to changes in both detritus and algal food sources. Fertilization resulted in early peaks of emergence for the Chironominae, Tanypodinae and Orthocladiinae.

The role of ANF in the control of blood pressure prompted several investigations in relation with the regulation of its gene expression. The work presented in this thesis describes the putative localization of some regulatory elements of the rat ANF gene. These elements were investigated by chromation hypersensitivity and methylation studies of the promoter region spanning the first 3.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. Preliminary data suggested that there might be DNAse hypersensitive site(s) at two positions ($-$2.5 kb and $-$0.5 kb) in the promoter. These positions are consistent with other experiments performed in our laboratory. Digestion with several methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases suggested some tissue-specific differences in the methylation status of HpaII, SaII, SnaBI and HhaI restriction sites in the ANF gene when comparing expressing and non-expressing tissues. Taken together, the hypersensitivity and methylation studies have identified sequences in the 5$ sp prime$ region of the rat ANF gene as being putative target for regulatory proteins.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bm77p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff3656202</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fm810"><dcterms:title>Leaching of 14C radio-labelled atrazine in long intact soil columns</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Smith, Ward N.

The adsorptive and desorptive capacity of atrazine in the soil columns was mainly attributed to organic matter and moisture content. LEACHMP was found to be superior in predicting hydrologic characteristics in the soil columns as compared to PRZM which required calibration. Both models underestimated levels of atrazine near the soil surface and in the leachate (115 cm depth). The results from first and second order analysis for PRZM and LEACHMP showed considerable uncertainty in atrazine fate and transport. First and second order analyses were found to be useful tools in indicating where efforts to reduce uncertainty can best be directed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s014.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm810</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Herbicides -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atrazine.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soils -- Leaching.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t039p"><dcterms:title>On the interactions between the atmospheric seasonal mean flow and the transient eddies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Meteorology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yu, Wei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Our study is concerned with the winter climatology over the Northern Hemisphere for the years 1980 to 1986. The local E-P flux divergence is divided into barotropic and baroclinic components. The 300 mb level is chosen to represent the upper troposphere. The three dominant convergence centres of the baroclinic component are found on the east coast of Asia, near the eastern Pacific and on the east coast of North America. In most areas the barotropic component of the eddy forcing accelerates the mean flow. Near the dateline the barotropic and baroclinic components of the eddy forcing tend to enhance each other, while on the east coast of North American the barotropic and baroclinic components partially cancel each other. The three-dimensional structure of some general circulation statistics are discussed, and the results are compared with those of earlier studies. The possible link between the interannual variation of the seasonal mean flow and the transient eddies forcing is discussed. The results show that no obvious correlation exists in our data set, so that no firm conclusions can be reached.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128b990.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t039p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qd28g"><dcterms:title>European air transport within the international system of air regulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Loewenstein, Andreas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The International System of Air Transport Regulation, consisting of ICAO's essentially technical regulation, IATA's tariff and services coordination functions and the dense network of Bilateral Agreements might be challenged and profoundly modified by recent developments in the law of the European Communities. In the framework of the creation of the European Internal Market, to be achieved before 1993, the European civil aviation industry is submitted to an accelerated integration and liberalization process. It comprises the opening of national markets to all Community carriers, the application of a common competition regime to all EEC-related flights and the transfer of regulatory functions to the EEC institutions. The EEC might, at the end of this process, acquire exclusive competences for the regulation of interior and exterior aviation matters. The structure of the International System of Air Transport Regulation and the European air law in place and in the planning stage have to be analyzed with the aim of exploring the compatibility of the European Integrated Air Market with global legal requirements.

To better understand T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of IDDM, a panel of T cell hybridomas were produced from pancreas-derived T cells of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. A total of 119 hybridomas were constructed from 8 fusions and 94 of these were tested. Twelve hybridomas were found to be islet-reactive since they produced high level of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the presence of NOD islet cells and NOD antigen-presenting cells (APC's). The responses could also be detected against islet cells of other strains (i.e. C3H/Hej or C57B1/6), but only in the presence of the NOD APC's. Phenotyping of these islet-reactive hybridomas showed that all of them were CD3$ sp{+}$CD4$ sp{+}$. Furthermore, a high frequency (39%) of CD4$ sp{+}$ T hybridomas in the panel were found to be islet reactive. In addition, analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) V$ sb{ beta}$ expression of these islet-reactive T-cell hybridomas revealed that TCR V$ sb{ beta}$ element usage is heterogeneous unlike findings in some experimentally induced autoimmune diseases.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tn17b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290b63g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074w272"><dcterms:title>Surface charge characteristics of a radio-charged electret</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacDonald, Brennan A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Measurements of charge distributions across the face of isothermally, radio-charged polymer electrets are presented. The electret forming chamber is comprised of a parallel-plate ionization chamber in which the collecting electrode is covered by a dielectric (Teflon, Mylar). Charging is accomplished by the simultaneous application of electric potential and ionizing radiation to the chamber. The electret can be discharged by removing the external potential during further irradiation. For these studies the electrets are scanned with an electrostatic voltmeter probe yielding digitized maps of the surface charge as functions of time under various charging and discharge conditions. The results of numerical modelling of the charging process are compared with experimental data. Storage techniques for optimum charge retention are discussed. It is found that charge stability is comparable to that achieved through corona charging. These results allow us to design an optimum reusable, radio-charged electret-dosimeter.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g6270.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w272</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq15s"><dcterms:title>Role of the neutrophil in post-ischemic skin flaps</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Chen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reviewed current theories of the post-ischemic injury. Special emphasis was placed on the concept of reperfusion injury. In a series of four experiments, this thesis evaluated neutrophil function, localization, depletion, and inhibition in ischemic cutaneous and myocutaneous flaps. Neutrophil function as measured by phorbol myristate acetate stimulated superoxide production was found to be enhanced on reperfusion of ischemic myocutaneous flaps. $ sp{111}$Indium labelled neutrophils were found to localize in post-ischemic cutaneous and myocutaneous flaps. Post-ischemic cutaneous flap survival was not improved by either cyclophosphamide induced neutrophil depletion or ibuprofen neutrophil inhibition. Post-ischemic myocutaneous flap survival was significantly improved by both cyclophosphamide induced neutrophil depletion and ibuprofen neutrophil inhibition. Thus, the cumulative evidence from these experiments yielded surprisingly different conclusions for cutaneous and myocutaneous flaps. The post-ischemic injury in cutaneous flaps was not mediated by the neutrophil. In contrast, the neutrophil did partially mediate the complex post-ischemic injury of myocutaneous flaps.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp05d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq15s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cm19c"><dcterms:title>Reason and finality in Ibn Zakarīyāʾ al-Rāzī's philosophical works</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shaker, Asaad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study, the relationship between medical thought and philosophy is investigated through the works of the famous Islamic thinker, Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Zakariya al-Razi (ca. 250-323/864-935). In one of the texts we shall be examining Razi thought that he could resolve the problem of the world's creation through allegory. Razi's interlocuter was concerned to defend the idea of epistemological "revelation." Although Razi agrees that the Intellect was sent by the Creator, he insists that this was done primarily for the benefit of the "self," which had become entangled in "material confusion." He is particularly concerned to counter the authoritarian implications of his opponent's epistemological position, which appears to emphasize doctrinal truth at the expense of all other considerations. These considerations are taken up by Razi in another work, the Kitab al-tibb al-ruhani. There, he draws on the science of medical treatment for application in ethics, but with some interesting implications for the problem of knowledge. The real object must be to bring man to his proper destination, and in this Razi's views coincide with the early mystical tradition in Islam, from al-Hujwiri to al-Ghazzali, where the problem essentially consists of existential realization rather than a merely abstract or intellectual process.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b445d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm19c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā, 865?-925? -- Views on epistemology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy, Islamic</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam and reason</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8060950"><dcterms:title>La morale féminine dans "Delphine" et "Corinne" de Madame de Staël /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Slosmanis, Bernadette</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The central theme in Delphine and Corinne, two novels by Madame de Stael, is that of the tragic and suffering heroine. The heroines die for ideals: those of freedom and the right to live their lives according to moral principles of the highest order. For Madame de Stael, the Parisian society she lives in, allows women no real freedom and therefore, there is no sense of morals where they are concerned. In Delphine, she draws a series of portraits of unhappy and psychologically scarred women, and she shows how prejudice and social convention brought this about. In Corinne, Madame de Stael's imagination explodes into her vision of the performing heroine who dazzles not only her fellow fiction characters but contemporary literary women. In both novels, the hero abandons the heroine and she dies. The theme of the tragic hero inspires early romantic literature. Madame de Stael introduces the essential characteristics of romanticism to the French in From Germany. The heroine's drama is her own. This thesis studies the guiding influences, the sources and the inspiration of Madame de Stael's ideas which led her to state that moral principles did not exist for women in the society of her day.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225c16p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8060950</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Staël, Madame de (Anne-Louise-Germaine), 1766-1817.

Under standard reducing conditions, methionine synthase specific activity is normal in cblE fibroblast extracts, but is low in cblG fibroblast extracts. Seven cblE and seven out of ten cblG cell lines demonstrate levels of accumulation of ($ sp{57}$Co) CN-Cbl in fibroblasts comparable to that of control cells. They exhibit similar proportions of label associated with the two intracellular cobalamin binders, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. The remaining three cblG cell lines exhibit a lower level of cobalamin accumulation, and demonstrate a lack of cobalamin association with the enzyme methionine synthase. The specific activity of methionine synthase is almost undetectable in the three cblG cell lines that showed no such association. These results demonstrate heterogeneity within the cblG group and suggest that the defect in cblG affects the methionine synthase apoenzyme.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wd93q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv155</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vitamin B12.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methionine.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289k29s"><dcterms:title>Closing gestures in opening ideas : strategies for beginning and ending in classical instrumental music</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sherman-Ishayek, Norma Lillian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper studies the formal ambiguity that arises when a closing gesture occupies a beginning location in the instrumental works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.

I first present a systematic survey of the theoretical principles underlying the formal functions of beginning and ending in this style. I then show some specific examples of typical cadences and of initial units that imitate them. Next, I focus on the "main theme," observing how the function of "beginning" is performed by a "closing initial idea" and then, how the main theme's cadences express their proper function. Finally, I study what happens in other locations such as the return of the main theme, the cadence closing the form, and post-cadential material.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w851n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289k29s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Musical analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Instrumental music -- 18th century -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
