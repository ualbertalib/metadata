The effects of polymer  viscosity, processing conditions, type of mixing and the type of fillers on the  intercalation process were evaluated. The resulting nanocomposites were tested to  characterize structure, thermal stability and mechanical properties. Two new organoclays were used in this study exhibited good  thermal stability. This suggested their potential use in the preparation polymer  nanocomposites at high processing temperatures. Batch mixing promoted polymer intercalation in most cases. PS  nanocomposites showed a combination of intercalated and unintercalated or collapsed  structures. In general, thermal stability and mechanical properties of PS were  enhanced by incorporation of organoclays. Processing conditions in the batch mixer  had only a small influence on intercalation behavior. However, they had a strong  effect on thermal stability and mechanical properties. The degree of intercalation  was dependant on the type of organoclay. As a result thermal stability and  mechanical properties were influenced by the type of organoclay used. The best  mechanical properties were obtained with Cloisite 10-A. Mixing in the twin screw extruder promoted intercalation of low  viscosity PS. Thermal stability was increased in all cases, but mechanical  properties did not improve significantly. The tensile modulus of nanocomposites was calculated using five  models reported in the literature. The results were compared to experimental data  obtained in this study. Up to 1% wt Cloisite 10-A content, the experimental results  showed very good agreement with the predictions of the Halpin-Tsai and Brune models,  which predicted the highest modulus values. The experimental values fell rapidly  bellow theoretical predictions above 1% wt clay content.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kamal, Musa R.

Despite extensive research, its role in the control of movement and posture remains controversial. One reason for this is that the torque output produced by reflex activity has been studied in only a limited number of tasks and behaviours. The main thrust of this thesis is to examine whether the central nervous system (CNS) modifies stretch reflex properties to suit the task. An electro-hydraulic actuator applied perturbations to the ankles of five subjects while they performed position-matching (PM) and torque-matching (TM) tasks. Stretch reflex properties were determined using a new closed-loop, reflex identification algorithm that analytically separated the torques produced by stretch reflexes from the overall ankle torque. Stretch reflex gain was greater in the PM task than for the TM task, under matched conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kearney, Robert E.

The flow field is fully developed channel flow---one of the  simplest inhomogeneous turbulent flows. A fine line source is used to inject the  scalar (temperature). The temperature injection does not affect the flow field,  hence it is passive. The line source is in the spanwise (z) direction of the  channel, and is located at transverse (i.e., wall-normal) locations: y/h = 0.067,  0.17, and 1.0 (where h is the channel half-width). Measurements of the resultant  thermal plume for each source location are taken for two Reynolds numbers: 10400 and  22800 (where Re = Uch/nu: U c is the centerline velocity and nu is the kinematic  viscosity). Hot-wire anemometry and cold-wire thermometry are used to acquire  velocity and temperature data, respectively. It is shown that the downstream decay of the mean temperature  rise is less than that of isotropic grid-generated turbulence and homogenous  turbulent shear flow. The peak RMS temperature fluctuation also decays at a slower  rate. For the near-wall source locations, the peak of the transverse RMS temperature  profile drifts toward the channel centerline with increasing downstream distance  from the source. Also, for the near-wall source locations, the scalar PDF is  quasi-Gaussian, indicating improved mixing in that region. As the plume is traversed  toward the centerline, the PDF evolves into a very positively skewed  shape. An extensive database of the thermal plume is compiled, which  consists of the mean, RMS, and skewness profiles of the temperature field, PDFs of  the temperature field, and temperature-velocity correlations. This database can be  used to test numerical and/or theoretical models, highlighting their strengths and  weaknesses.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mydlarski, L. B.

The use of paste backfill is gaining popularity, however various  technical, environmental and regulatory constraints complexify the study of its  behaviour. There are various laboratory experiments available for the appraisal of  this material; however the results do not necessarily correspond to its in-situ  response. The main objective of this experimentation is to evaluate the quality of  the fill by the study of its P-wave velocity, hence establish a relationship between  the curing-time, strength and P-wave velocity of the material. This preliminary  analysis in the field of mining demonstrates the possibility of finding an easy,  reliable and cost effective in-situ method of appraising paste  backfill. Given the complexity of the research project, the work focuses  on correlating the quality of the paste fill, with the MSR-IE and PUNDIT systems, in  a laboratory environment. The results demonstrate the potential of the MSR-IE  investigation on Paste backfill and the near future possibility of in-situ testing  with this method.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ouellet, J.

Although  the performance of the system depends directly on the hydraulic mixing, there is  currently no consensus on the key hydraulic parameters that influence the mixing of  these lagoons. Tracer studies were performed on the St-Hermas aerated lagoon and a  dynamically similar laboratory model to determine the effects of the water flow rate  and the aeration rate on the performance of these aerated lagoons, to evaluate the  method of dynamic similarity used to design the laboratory model and to evaluate the  accuracy of predictive empirical dispersion models. The results were analysed using  flow visualisation, simple observational and mathematical Retention Time  Distribution (RTD) techniques and various hydraulic models. From these results it is  concluded that the water flow rate and the aeration rate both significantly affect  the hydraulic mixing of aerated lagoons, with the water flow rate being the dominant  parameter. Furthermore, it is proven that the method of dynamic similarity used in  this research is valid and that the only dispersion model that predicted reasonably  accurate results was Arcievala (1981). An additional finding during the course of  this research indicates that tracer study E-curves must be developed to completion  in order to ensure conservation of mass and accurate analytical  results.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b074.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c33q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Environmental.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752h34d"><dcterms:title>Theory and simulation of microstructure transformation in cholesteric liquid crystalline materials : applications to biological fibrous composites</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>De Luca, Gino</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Current advanced engineering composites suffer from high-cost of  manufacturing as well as design and processing weaknesses.

Microstructural studies  of these materials have revealed that they exhibit a common architecture known as  twisted plywood. This architecture results from the passage of the matrix into a  cholesteric liquid crystalline phase during the development of the composite. The  main objectives of this work are: to develop a mathematical model based on the  well-established liquid crystalline theory of Landau-de Gennes, to describe the  formation process of the twisted plywood architecture; to solve the set of governing  partial differential equations, to use the theoretical and computational results  obtained to provide a picture of the structure evolution and its  kinetics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rey, A.

In GPS a typical technique for kinematic position estimation is  relative positioning where two receivers are used, one receiver is stationary and  its exact position is known, the other is roving and its position is to be  estimated. We describe the physical situation and give the mathematical model based  on the difference of the measurements at the stationary and roving receivers. The  model we consider combines both code pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. We  then present: a recursive least squares approach for position estimation. We take  full account of the structure of the problem to make our algorithm efficient, and  use orthogonal transformations to ensure numerical reliability of the  algorithm. At each epoch, possible cycle slips must be detected, otherwise  it may significant deteriorate the positioning accuracy. A cycle slip detection  method based on the higher-order difference technique, one of typical techniques for  cycle slip detection, is developed and incorporated into the preprocess of our  positioning algorithm. Finally, real data testing for our positioning algorithm and  cycle slip detection algorithm are performed. The results suggest our algorithms are  very effective.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chang, Xiao-Wen (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4305427.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp872</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geodesy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1g05fc23h"><dcterms:title>The role of RET tyrosine kinase in kidney and urinary tract development /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yu, Hoi Yun Oriana, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that induces cell survival,  proliferation and migration.

In the kidney, RET is required for branching of the  ureteric bud and it also regulates the maturation of the ureter in the urinary  tract. Although it is well established in mice that the absence or overexpression of  RET leads to severe kidney abnormalities, the cellular basis for these defects  remains unexplored. To determine whether the overexpression of RET affected the  development of the urinary tract, HoxB7/RET mice were tested for the presence of  vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) in which urine flows retrogradely from the bladder back  up the ureter. To further understand how the urinary tract is formed, we looked for  the presence of VUR in HoxB7/RET and wildtype mice at E17.

A common complication in  patients suffering from prostate cancer is the development of hypercalcemia of  malignancy. While determination of PSA and PSP-94 levels can serve as  diagnostic/prognostic markers, PSP-94 can also serve as a therapeutic agent. The  efficacy of PSP-94 to block tumor progression and hypercalcemia of malignancy was  tested in our syngeneic in vivo rat model of prostate cancer. Rat prostate cancer  Mat Ly Lu cells were transfected with full length cDNA encoding PTHrP [Mat Ly  Lu-PTHrP] which is known to be the main factor responsible for hypercalcemia of  malignancy. Mat Ly Lu-PTHrP cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right  flank or via intracardiac injection into the left ventricle of male Copenhagen rats.  Animals were treated with different doses of PSP-94. Tumor volume, time of hind-limb  paralysis, plasma calcium and plasma and tumoral PTHrP levels were determined.  PSP-94 caused a significant delay in the development of hind-limb paralysis,  reduction in tumor volume, plasma calcium levels, plasma and tumoral PTHrP levels as  compared to control animals receiving vehicle alone. These effects were due to the  induction of tumor cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our studies illustrate the ability  of PSP-94 to block prostate cancer growth and skeletal metastases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rabbani, Shafaat A.

Physical activity was assessed via an  adaptation of the Weekly Activity Checklist. The effect of a ban on extracurricular  activities on adolescent physical activity levels was determined.

Interaction between CI and histone H3 was previously observed in Dr. Fortin's  laboratory. Based on previous studies that demonstrated the importance of the H3  tail domain in gene regulation and chromosome arrangement, it was hypothesized that  CI would interact with the tail rather than the globular domain. The objective of  this project was to identify which histone H3 domains CI protein interacts with. The  full-length, globular, and tail domains of histone H3 DNA were expressed in E. coli  and purified. Based on in vitro interaction experiments, the CI protein was observed  to interact with the globular domain of histone H3.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fortin, Marc G.

In 1880 a lava dome was erupted into the center of the caldera lake. The aim of  this study is to understand the nature of Ilopango eruptions, the magmatic evolution  of Ilopango through time and attempt to place Ilopango into a regional context. I  conclude that the intracaldera stratigraphy is mostly subaqueously emplaced and that  the caldera was occupied by a lake &gt;53,000 years ago during formation of the San  Agustin Block unit. The eruption which formed the San Agustin Block unit began with  a phreatomagmatic phase and progressed to a more degassed phase, spalling pumices  from the quenched carapace of the lava dome. The magmatic evolution of Ilopango is  not a progressive magmatic process related to a time factor, but rather reflected by  a reservoir that experiences replenishment of a more mafic composition causing  fluctuations in magma composition over time. Ilopango is less evolved than other  Central American silicic centers such as Atitlan, Amatitlan and Zunil, but is  similar in composition to Santa Maria, Santiaguito and Acantenango.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stix, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g469.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c358</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pn544"><dcterms:title>Nonvalidated practices : understanding the issues and balancing the risks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Maniatis, Thomas, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nonvalidated practices are characterized by a therapeutic intent  and a relative lack of evidence to support their adoption into the practice of  medicine.

Current guidelines do not require  any special form of monitoring of nonvalidated practices. However, the principle of  non-maleficence favours the adoption of a novel monitoring system which would assure  the protection of patients and society.

In this study, the function of the R-domain was  examined using a CFTR variant lacking the entire R-domain. These split channels  assemble from separate polypeptides corresponding to the two halves of CFTR after  translation of a single mRNA. Even though the back half of the split CFTR channel is  expressed as a core glycosylated protein, both halves are able to fold independently  and associate with one another to form a PKA-independent, constitutively active  channel; however, this occurs with low efficiency.

The aim of the study was to identify sequence elements, within  this enhancer, required to drive node/notochord specific-expression. Since, in the  Xenopus organizer, Siamois activates organizer-specific gene expression, it was  tested whether this factor could activate expression from the Foxa2 node-specific  enhancer. Using deletion analysis, the response element was mapped to a 33bp region  and it was shown that this element was both necessary and sufficient for reporter  gene activation by X-Siamois . Furthermore, it was shown that X-Siamois can bind  this DNA element and two sequence motifs required for binding and transactivation by  X-Siamois were identified. Preliminary results suggest that the 33bp element, within  the 500bp enhancer, is required for the maintenance of expression in the notochord  of transgenic mice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clarke, Hugh (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Dufort, Daniel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q957k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b4109</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Transgenic mice.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Notochord.</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA-binding proteins.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d21k"><dcterms:title>Chlorine atom initiated reactions of selected hydrocarbons observed in the marine boundary layer : rate constants and potential mechanisms</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Garib, Anisha</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The importance of the role of halogen chemistry in regulating  tropospheric ozone budgets was revealed in the Arctic Marine Boundary Layer (MBL)  during Polar Sunrise Studies where episodic destructions of ozone were accompanied  by increases in bromine containing compounds. Chlorine chemistry becomes especially  relevant in the tropospheric MBL and in coastal regions due to the existence of  elevated concentrations of chlorine generated from sea-salt aerosols. In this  thesis, the kinetic study of the reactions of seven tropospherically important  hydrocarbons with chlorine atoms was done at atmospheric pressure and 298 &lt; T  &lt; 358 K using a Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detection. This data  set not only compares well with available literature values but also provides a  first report on several systems for which no temperature dependent kinetic data  existed. Some of these reactions were found to be fast enough to compete with HO  radical chemistry in the MBL. Mass spectral product studies of Cl-initiated  reactions of CHBr2Cl and CHBr3 indicated that halogen atoms could be recycled back  to the atmosphere. The importance of these reactions on the chemistry of the  troposphere is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ariya, Parisa A.

To determine the network interactions of the  perirhinal cortex and the entorhinal cortex in ictogenesis, my investigations were  conducted in the combined hippocampus-entorhinal-perirhinal slice preparation.  Sliced were superfused with either 4-aminopyridine or Mg2+-free artificial  cerebrospinal fluid to generate in vitro epileptiform activity.

In addition, ictal duration in the perirhinal cortex did not change  following physical separation of the three limbic structures, while it decreased in  the lateral and medial entorhinal cortices. My results suggest the perirhinal cortex  is potentially epileptogenic as indicated by its propensity for initiating ictal  events and its ability to generate ictal activity of similar size after isolation.
