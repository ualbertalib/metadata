In order to investigate the molecular basis of recent electrophysiological findings which implicated 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptors in the mechanism of action of antidepressants and anxiolytics, radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies using tritiated 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)-tetralin ( ($ sp3$H) -8-OH-DPAT) were done in rat brain following various treatments. These included: the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine; the reuptake blockers paroxetine and indalpine; the monoamine oxidase inhibitor clorgyline; electroconvulsive shock; lithium; the classic benzodiazepine diazepam; and the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ partial agonist gepirone. None of these treatments, nor the fluctuation in 5-HT availability provoked by the circadian cycle, gave any significant changes, with the exception of clorgyline which initially appeared to decrease the affinity of ($ sp3$H) -8-OH-DPAT for its receptor. A further series of studies in vitro and in vivo ascertained the possibility that the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptors may display two interconvertible affinity states and that, in fact, clorgyline induces a shift of the high to the lower affinity state. The findings from this second series of experiments suggested that labile changes, which may possibly be disrupted during membrane preparation, in the coupling between the 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor and a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) may account for the effects that certain treatments have on 5-HT$ sb{ rm 1A}$ receptor responsiveness.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278v21j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r425p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bj359"><dcterms:title>Recovery, drying and characterization of carotenoproteins from industrial lobster waste</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tu, Ya.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Lobster waste (including the head and hard carapace, viscera, mandibles and gills) contains approximately 98 $ mu$g/g total astaxanthin, 23% protein, 20% chitin, 34% ash, and 2.2% crude fat on dry weight basis. Carotenoprotein, amounting to 16% of the dry matter was effectively recovered from lobster waste by a trypsin aided process. Air-dried carotenoproteins were enriched in protein by about 108-115%, in crude fat by 540-594% and in carotenoid pigment by about 147-329% as compared with the waste material. Furthermore, the ash and chitin levels in the products were considerably lower than those of the raw material. Drying characteristics of carotenoprotein was evaluated in a modified air-drier using air temperature (45$ sp circ$C, 55$ sp circ$C or 65$ sp circ$C) and relative humidity (5% and 15%) as main factors. The study indicated that higher temperatures achieved faster drying rates of the product but adversely affected its nutritional composition and/or quality. The proximate compositions of carotenoprotein dried at 45$ sp circ$C and relative humidity of 5% or 15% were comparable with that obtained by freeze drying. Thus, the process achieved a substantial reduction in the levels of anti-nutrients associated with lobster waste (i.e., ash and chitin) while elevating the levels of carotenoid pigments and essential nutrients such as protein and fat in the recovered product. These characteristics of the tray-dried carotenoprotein suggest that it could be used as an inexpensive source of pigment and protein in diets of cultured salmonid species.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv74g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bj359</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carotenoids</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fishery processing industries -- By-products.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lobster industry -- By-products.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655h81j"><dcterms:title>Variations in the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal response to stress during the estrous cycle in the rat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Viau, Victor</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To investigate the role of gonadal steroids in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to stress, we studied adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) responses to 20 min restraint stress in cycling female rats, and in ovariectomized (OVX) rats replaced with physiological levels of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P). In cycling rats, we found significantly higher peak ACTH and B responses to stress during proestrous compared to the estrous and diestrous phases. No differences were found in either basal ACTH and B levels across the cycle phases. In a separate study, OVX rats were maintained on low, physiological levels of E2 and P with silastic implants for three days, and injected either with oil (O$ sp prime$), 10 ug of E2 (E$ sp prime$) 24 h before stress testing, or with E2 and 500 ug P 24 h and 4 h, respectively, prior to stress (EP$ sp prime$). These treatments mimicked endogenous profiles of E2 and P occurring during diestrous, proestrous, and late proestrous-early estrous phases, respectively. In response to stress, ACTH levels were higher in the E$ sp prime$ group compared to the EP$ sp prime$ and O$ sp prime$ groups. Within the 20 min stress period, ACTH levels and plasma B levels in the E$ sp prime$ group were significantly higher after the onset of stress, compared to the EP$ sp prime$ and O$ sp prime$ groups. $ beta$-endorphin-like immuno-reactive responses to restraint stress were also significantly higher in the E$ sp prime$ group.

A framework for performing fault simulation in a distributed environment is developed based on the assumption that fault simulation of different vectors can be run independently on different processors. This can be done using any uniprocessor fault simulator and requires only a fairly simple and low bandwidth communication mechanism. This communication mechanism distributes the list of faults detected by each simulator to all other simulators so that the simulation can be controlled based on global criteria such as the fault coverage obtained by the distributed simulator, and the amount of work to be done by each processor is dynamically reduced through fault dropping and fault-free dropping based on the coverage obtained by all processors. Finally, a distributed simulator is implemented using the above mechanism on a network of workstations using the uniprocessor fault simulator Tulip.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483k50h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz669</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v838171h"><dcterms:title>The quantitative genetics of sound production in Gryllus firmus /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Webb, Karen Lynn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The species-specific calling songs of male crickets are used by females for species recognition and mate choice.

The effects of divorce on children are reviewed, as are the major constructs of stress-coping theory. A study is conducted to demonstrate the empirical utility of the theoretical integration of the two domains. The coping resources, styles and efforts of 71 elementary school children from divorced and intact homes were investigated. Data analyses demonstrated that children from divorced homes had lower levels of psychological coping resources, and less effective coping styles and efforts, thus sustaining the theoretical integration. Other significant results revealed developmental trends for some aspects of coping resources and coping styles, and correlations between coping resources and efforts, thereby supporting important conceptualizations in stress-coping theory. Speculations concerning the long-term effects of divorce, differential effects of divorce on boys and girls and recommendations for future investigations are made.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c1700.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d70h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children of divorced parents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stress (Psychology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A76537236k"><dcterms:title>Multiculturalism and teacher training in Montreal English universities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jones, Theo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The contemporary discussion on the topic of multicultural education in the Canadian literature relates questions of race, ethnicity or culture to public schooling, with little attention given to the area of teacher preparation.

This study notably presents the results of a 42 item survey of pre-service teachers' perceptions of: (a) the concept of multiculturalism and; (b) the adequacy of their training for multicultural classrooms. The pre-service teachers also examine their curriculum for multicultural content. This is followed up by a content analysis of the respective programs by the researcher. The implications of this exploratory study are especially valuable for teacher training institutions. As multiculturalism is a fact of Canadian society, it is logical to educate our future citizens in accordance with this reality. Institutions are failing to prepare teachers for today's society if they are not providing courses in multicultural education.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zp594.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537236k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Teachers -- Training of -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cultural pluralism -- Quebec (Province) -- Montreal.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967486w"><dcterms:title>An investigation of the quasi-static assumption for a pair of staggered cylinders in cross-flow /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sychterz, Piotr Waclaw</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The validity of the quasi-static assumption was tested for the case of the leeward cylinder of a pair of parallel cylinders staggered in cross-flow.

Afterwards, in order to safeguard society from the increase of crime, the State began to interpose itself in the family when it was thought there was a link between parental neglect and juvenile delinquency. The second part describes the awakening of society, first in the United States, then in Great Britain, to the phenomenon of child maltreatment. Direct state intervention in the family came about in Great Britain by means of statutes withdrawing the child from his abusive family. Influenced by the evolution of British legislation, the Canadian common law provinces, Ontario in particular, adopted their own laws against child abuse relatively quickly. However, probably by reason of its existing social care network structure, the province of Quebec was much slower in contrast to adopt child welfare laws and recognizing the legal rights of the child.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf766.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67js33k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>History, Modern.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw0892c00k"><dcterms:title>Regulation of insider trading : problems and solutions in the United States and Switzerland</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Trottman Bischof, Renata</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this comparative study a broad view of insider trading in the United States and Switzerland will be presented.

The calibration powders were shown to produce consistent calibrations within laboratories and between laboratories and met AOAC specifications in terms of accuracy and repeatability. The reconstituted solutions were shown to be stable for up to 6 h at 40$ sp circ$C and could be stored under refrigerated conditions and used for repeated analyses for up to 21 days without apparent deterioration in calibration performance. It was concluded that the calibration powders perform as well as conventional calibrants, were more consistent overall and suitable for any calibration application. The calibration powders have the stability and performance characteristics to serve as reference standards for monitoring instrument performance and would be a useful tool for accrediting payment and dairy herd analysis laboratories.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Van de Voort, F.

(Daniel Edward)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis focuses on transactional process involved in the construction and operation of the Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working Group. This cooperative wildlife management mechanism gives Yup'ik commercial and subsistence fishermen and other users a direct role, with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, in salmon management. Transactions involving participants' knowledge and values are described in three processes: (1) the establishment of a management body and its operating rules; (2) the mediation of power in decision-making; and, (3) fishery management which uses both "science" and "fishermen's knowledge." Results indicate that through cooperation in decision-making, data gathering, and other management tasks the participants have been able to promote record commercial salmon harvests while at the same time providing for subsistence and conservation needs. Shared local values of consensus and reciprocity have acted to sustain participants' interaction in the bargaining process inherent in co-management. Through having to mediate and accommodate diverse interests and goals, the participants have developed a significant congruency or compatibility of values.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603qz67k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp54t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Salmon fisheries -- Alaska -- Management</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cr54g"><dcterms:title>Aspects of cyclic nucleotide metabolism in taurine-deficient rat retinas</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Acton, Joseph</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effects of taurine deficiency on aspects of retinal cGMP metabolism were examined. Rats were made taurine deficient by the administration of 1% GES. The activities of the key enzymes of cGMP metabolism, phosphodiesterase and guanylate cyclase, were indirectly determined by the response of retinas to light and to low calcium. Dark-adapted retinas of rats treated with GES for 4 and 8 weeks exhibited significantly smaller decreases in cGMP in response to light exposure as compared to control retinas. Retinas from 4 and 8 week GES-treated rats also exhibited smaller increases in cGMP when they were exposed to 0.1nM calcium. In addition, dark-adapted retinas of 8 week GES-treated rats had 36% less cGMP than dark-adapted control retinas. Since a light-induced decrease of cGMP is of central importance in phototransduction, these results support the hypothesis that abnormalities in the retinal cGMP metabolism of taurine-deficient rats may account for the electro-retinographic deficits observed in these animals.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393113.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr54g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515p47f"><dcterms:title>The response of reinforced concrete bridge pier caps /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Al-Soufi, Sami</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Experiments were carried out in order to investigate the response of reinforced concrete bridge pier caps.

Vertically, 72% and 24% eggs occurred in the surface 10 cm soil before and after fall plowing, respectively. A 5 x 10 cm x 15 cm (deep) sampling unit was appropriate for estimating egg populations before plowing. Thereafter, 20 cm depth was needed. Larvae and pupae were concentrated around the root system and a soil quadrat 20 x 20 cm x 10 cm (deep) was an easily reproducible sampling unit. Direct counting on corn plants in early morning was the most efficient method for adult sampling. Sample sizes for all stages were calculated for different precision levels. Spatial distribution of eggs and larval field populations were contagious, and a stratified random sampling is appropriate for density estimation. Spatial distribution of adults changed with corn phenology. Average mortality of overwintering eggs was 66% and of spring larvae 89%. The field population density of beetles did not change significantly during 1979-82.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354g05x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q83k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corn -- Diseases and pests -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Northern corn rootworm.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053g86j"><dcterms:title>Bionomics and field behavior of crucifer-feeding flea beetle adults (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Entomology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vincent, Charles, 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 1980-81, teneral and fully melanized adult flea beetles were monitored with water traps.

Dispersal studies, using interception traps coupled with statistics of directional data, showed four immigrations to and seven emigrations from a rutabaga field. P. cruciferae was more attracted to allyl isothiocyanate than P. striolata, whereas the behavior of Ps. punctulata was not affected. Sex ratio estimations were affected accordingly. The color white significantly attracted more flea beetles than yellow, green and red. Overwintered adult flea beetles were more prevalent on later sown rutabaga, and the species proportions were slightly affected by the sowing date. Flea beetle infestations were simulated by punching out holes in cabbage seedlings.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z640.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053g86j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Flea-beetles.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beetles -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cr17b"><dcterms:title>Finite element modelling of reinforced concrete structures</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hanna, Youssef G.

Post-cracking behaviour of planar reinforced concrete structures is studied to investigate the tension stiffening phenomenon and the post-cracking shear resistance. The feasibility of using the available bond stress-slip relationships to model the steel-concrete interface behaviour is examined by incorporating these relationships in a three dimensional axisymmetric finite element model and analyzing several reinforced concrete tension specimens. A finite element model which uses the advanced endochronic stress-strain relationship and incorporates the results of the investigation on post-cracking behaviour and steel-concrete interface behaviour is formulated and used in the analysis of several reinforced concrete members. Analysis results are compared with the available experimental data and with the results obtained by other researchers. Excellent correlation was obtained between the computed values and the experimental results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb19t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr17b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shear (Mechanics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reinforced concrete -- Cracking.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw95051292"><dcterms:title>The feeding of fermented colostrum to neonatal calves /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Drevjany, L.

The inoculation of colostrum with S. lactis culture ensured a highly palatable and more uniform product. Calves fed the inoculated product gained in weight quicker and consumed more starter than those fed naturally fermented colostrum. The addition of sorbic acid to S. lactis inoculated colostrum controlled the mold contamination, particularly during hot summer weather. This lowered the degradation of lactose and protein and extended the storage life. The application of 1,000 ppm of sorbic acid during the first 4 days of storage is, therefore, recommended. An undesirably narrow ratio of Digestible Energy/Digestible Protein in colostrum was widened through the use of a supplementary energy source. These treatments also improved the performance of calves.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h032q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95051292</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Colostrum.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Calves -- Feeding and feeds.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83m020p"><dcterms:title>Deep inelastic ploarized electron-proton scattering in QCD</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marleau, Guy.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We compute the anomalous dimension (gamma)(n) and (gamma)(,ns)(n) needed in the evaluation of the polarized structure function G(,1)(q('2)) in electron-proton scattering, up to and including the order g('4) contributions in the minimal subtraction scheme in perturbative QCD.
