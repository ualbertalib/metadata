The primary goal of the work presented in this thesis is to characterize the phenotype of Sam68 deficient mice. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can give rise to adipocytes and osteoblasts, we explored the differentiation capacity of MSCs. First we showed that these mice are protected from age related bone loss due to enhanced osteoblast formation. Adipogenesis is defective in mouse embryo fibroblasts generated from Sam68-/- mice. Also, Sam68-/- mice show lower body and adipose tissue weights. These mice are protected against dietary obesity and diabetes owing to deregulation in lipid metabolism associated with adipogenesis defects. Taken together, the work presented here suggests a novel role for Sam68 as a positive adipocyte and a negative osteoblast differentiation factor.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fd468.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333656j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zv73f"><dcterms:title>Postural strategies to maintain balance during lateral walking in stroke and healthy individuals</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Trivino, Michael.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Abstract not available.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451n84v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zv73f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nz697"><dcterms:title>Isolation of human scFv expressing cells from a yeast library using magnetic and fluorescence activated cell sorting</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Petosa, Adamo.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effective and efficient generation of both antibodies and antibody fragments to proteins of interest is vital, as antibodies and antibody fragments are required for an ever-increasing variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and analytical applications. The single chain variable fragment (scFv) is an antibody fragment consisting of a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a light chain variable region (VL) joined together by a flexible polypeptide linker. In 2003, Feldhaus et al. developed a nonimmune human scFv surface display library, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , containing 109 different scFvs. Cells in the library expressing scFvs of interest can be isolated using magnetic cell sorting (MCS) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The reduced size of the scFv relative to the intact IgG allows it to penetrate tissue with greater ease and therefore reach epitopes within both tissue and cells that would otherwise remain inaccessible. As a result, one possible scFv application is the study of cartilage destruction by proteases that occurs in both normal joint development and arthritis. Antibody fragments would allow for cartilage degradative processes to be studied in vivo . Fluorescently tagged scFvs could penetrate intact cartilage tissue, bind to epitopes and then be localized using techniques such as dual photon confocal microscopy. This would not be possible using IgG molecules. The yeast library developed by Feldhaus et al. was obtained for the potential isolation of cells expressing scFvs to cartilage neoepitopes. While found to possess an inherent Candida parapsilosis contamination, the surface display library was screened using three peptide-ovalbumin-biotin complexes. Peptides corresponding to observed cartilage neoepitopes were bound to biotinylated ovalbumin and added to the library for screening. Excess unlabelled ovalbumin was also added to the library to prevent the isolation of ovalbumin binding cells. In all, two rounds of MCS and two rounds of FACS with all three antigens were used to screen the library for binders. A portion of the remaining library cells was then screened by MCS with a single antigen and eight individual clones were isolated. The affinity of these clones was determined and the scFv region of one clone was sequenced. Despite preventative measures, all eight clones isolated and analyzed were found to have an affinity to undetermined ovalbumin complex regions other than the peptides of interest. Still, cells expressing scFvs binding to a portion of the antigen complexes presented to the library were clearly enriched and subsequently isolated using MCS and FACS.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m615t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nz697</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr1722356"><dcterms:title>Imaginaire et identités de jeunes migrants : masculinité, féminité et rapport à l'origine dans des autoportraits d'adolescents réfugiés</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Premand, Natacha.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a qualitative study that used the making of self-portraits and their incorporation in collages to investigate issues of identity among recently arrived adolescent refugees. These collages were then analyzed to shed light on the influence of both the migration process and adolescence on the subjects' sense of their identity. Fourteen asylum claimant teenagers---recently arrived in Canada from Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa---were asked to produce a collage that represents him- or herself. The collages consisted of a photographic self-portrait and images that the subjects culled from various newspapers and magazines made available to them. Nondirective interviews with the subjects, conducted in a subsequent session, provided biographical information that was used to support the analysis of the collages. The study indicates that, transcending differences in geo-cultural origin, there are clear differences in the self-representation of male and female adolescents. This result underlines how much the construction of identity during adolescence is primarily that of gender identity. In addition, the study shows that despite the predominance of a "globalized youth culture," each teenager appropriates this culture according to his/her need to identify with and differentiate from the host society. The collages also indicated an engagement by the subjects in working out the comfort they draw or pain they feel in relation to the country and culture they have left behind. Finally, the collages also included a temporal dimension and the emphasis on the past, present, or future seems to correspond to the subjects' differing strategies for working through the experience of geo-cultural dislocation. The study concludes that creative exercises such as self-portraiture and collage provide a rich source of psychological material and a non-threatening way of gaining access to the imaginary of recently arrived refugee teenagers. Consequently, the approach used here could also be used as a tool to provide support to adolescent asylum seekers. The results also indicate a need for a greater understanding of the relationship between self-image and mental health.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021k37b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr1722356</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fs93k"><dcterms:title>Functional characterization of the BHD tumor suppressor gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pomerleau, Véronique.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome that increases the risk of developing kidney cancer. The gene responsible for this disease was recently identified but the protein encoded by this gene has yet to be characterized. In this thesis, we present an initial characterization of the BHD protein. To do so, a polyclonal antibody against the human BHD protein was produced that detects both the exogenous and endogenous protein. Moreover, several BHD putative interacting proteins were identified by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) analysis following large scale purification of epitope-tagged BHD. The interaction of BHD with one candidate was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and by in vitro binding assays but could not be validated. In parallel, a Far Western was attempted to discover BHD putative interacting proteins but with no success. Furthermore, the intracellular localization of BHD revealed to be mostly cytoplasmic as shown by differential centrifugation and by indirect immunofluorescence. A BHDwt-GFP construct was also engineered to perform further studies on BHD subcellular localization. Finally, the effect of BHD disease-associated mutations on protein expression was investigated by Western blotting.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q859r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs93k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9880vw20v"><dcterms:title>Fear of dental implants among edentulous patients</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nemes, Jordan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite implant-supported overdentures' advantages over conventional dentures, edentulous patients often refuse dental implants for reasons that may be related to fear. Objective. The purpose of this study was to uncover and explain the various forms and sources of dental implant-related fear among edentulous patients. Methods. A convenient sample of 8 edentulous/semi-edentulous participants was used. Participants were recruited from a current study at McGill University's Faculty of Dentistry, posting of recruitment flyers, and local homes and community centers for seniors. One-on-one interviews were conducted in Montreal from March 2005 to February 2006, transcribed verbatim, and coded into multiple theme-based sections. Results. Three categories of implant-related fear were identified: (1) fear of dental implant surgery; (2) fear of the recovery period; and (3) miscellaneous fears. As well, four main sources of dental implant-related fear were uncovered: (1) past negative experiences at the dentist; (2) "horror stories" of dental implant surgery; (3) having relatively little knowledge of dental implants; and (4) poor dentist-patient relationship. Discussion. The various forms of dental implant-related fear seem to play a substantial role in influencing a patient's decision to undergo implant surgery.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pf762.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vw20v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p462x"><dcterms:title>Effects of chronic nerve growth factor treatment on synaptic transmission in neurons of the rat medial septum diagonal band of Broca area</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Huh, You Lim, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin important for the survival, growth and function of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. However, little is known about the function of NGF on other basal forebrain neurons such as glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Here, we used neurons from the rat medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS-DBB) to test whether chronic exposure to NGF affects the synaptic function of cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic basal forebrain neurons. We isolated single rat MS-DBB neurons in culture, allowing them to establish synaptic contacts onto themselves. One group of neurons chronically received NGF while another group received none. After 2-4 weeks in culture, we used whole-cell electrophysiology to measure the amplitude of evoked autaptic EPSCs or IPSCs. Cholinergic MS-DBB neurons were identified using 192IgG-Cy3, a fluorescent p75NTR receptor antibody. Neurotransmitters involved in postsynaptic currents were characterized pharmacologically. In some experiments, a trk inhibitor K252a and MRL3, a function-blocking antibody for p75NTR, were added with NGF to study the role of trkA- and p75NTR-mediated signaling, respectively. To investigate the synaptic mechanisms underlying the changes in evoked EPSCs, miniature EPSCs were recorded. We found that NGF led to a significant increase in the amplitude of nicotinic and glutamatergic EPSCs in "cholinergic" MS-DBB neurons releasing both neurotransmitters. However, NGF did not affect autaptic currents in non-cholinergic neurons releasing glutamate or GABA. K252a prevented the NGF-induced increase in glutamatergic EPSCs but not nicotinic EPSCs. Conversely, MRL3 reduced the effect of NGF on nicotinic EPSCs but not glutamatergic EPSCs. Furthermore, chronic NGF treatment led to a 2-fold increase in the frequency of miniature EPSCs in cholinergic neurons but did not affect the amplitude of the events. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that chronic NGF treatment dramatically increases both glutamate and ACh release from cholinergic MS-DBB neurons. The present study illustrates that NGF is crucial not only for cholinergic function but also for glutamatergic function in the septo-hippocampal pathway, which plays an important role in memory.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vg708.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p462x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr172236g"><dcterms:title>Motor learning in stroke : imaging training induced plasticity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Henderson, Amy, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in Western countries and it is estimated that up to 70% of stroke survivors have a long-lasting disability of the upper limb. The purpose of this study was to examine plasticity at the neuronal level to distinguish between recovery and compensation and how this relates to recovery of arm movement at the behavioural and functional levels in five chronic stroke patients. Brain activation patterns associated with a pointing movement involving the whole arm were identified over two baselines and one post-training intervention evaluation. At each evaluation, a clinical physical and cognitive evaluation, and a recording of the movement kinematics was performed. Analysis was performed on three regions of interest (ROI) bilaterally; primary motor cortices (M1), premotor cortices (PMC) and the primary sensorimotor cortices (S1). A measure of signal intensity, the location of peak activation, and a measure of the contribution of each hemisphere in the ROIs was examined on a case-by-case basis. We found a trend for increased contralesional involvement, changes in signal strength in each ROI and shifts in the peak activation in many directions, which paralleled increases in motor functioning. Our results seem to suggest that contralesional involvement in our ROIs may be sustaining recovery in these patients, and we can confirm that the more the activation in the stroke brain returns to the activation seen in healthy individuals, the better the recovery. Although it is possible that an absolute distinction between recovery and compensation at the neuronal level cannot be made, our results show that recovery at the behavioural and functional levels are accompanied by changes in brain activity. A relationship must be determined if we are to venture into using fMRI as a tool to influence clinical decisions during recovery from stroke.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cj622.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr172236g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63t1016"><dcterms:title>Effect of acute ethanol administration on the extracellular concentrations of the opioid peptides [beta]-endorphin, met-enkephalin and dynorphin A₁-₈ at the level of ventral tegmental area in the rat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jarjour, Samuel J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is experimental evidence suggesting that ethanol alters the activity of the endogenous opioid peptide systems in a dose and brain region dependent manner. These ethanol-induced alterations in opioid activity may influence the processes of ethanol reward and reinforcement. However, the precise nature of the link between ethanol-opioid interactions influencing reward and reinforcement is not clearly understood. Thus, it was the objective of the present study to investigate the response of the three major opioid peptide systems (endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins) to acute ethanol administration, at the level of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region important for drug, including ethanol, reinforcement. Using the in vivo microdialysis technique coupled with specific solid-phase radioimmunoassays for beta-endorphin, met-enkephalin, and dynorphin A1-8, changes of the extracellular concentration of theses peptides at the level of VTA were determined at distinct time points following the administration of 0.0 (saline), 0.8, 1.6, and 2.4 g ethanol/kg B/Wt. Results demonstrated a biphasic effect of ethanol on beta-endorphin release with 1.6, but not 0.8 or 2.4, g ethanol/kg B.Wt. enhancing beta-endorphin release. None of the ethanol doses used altered the extracellular levels of met-enkephalin, and dynorphin A1-8 peptides. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that at the level of VTA interactions of beta-endorphin with the mu and/or delta opioid receptors on GABA interneurons may contribute to the ethanol induced augmentation in the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and influence ethanol reinforcement.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593v064v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63t1016</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Physiological.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz8064318"><dcterms:title>Specificity of exercise on enhancing cognitive abilities : Argentine Tango and walking</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jacobson, Allison.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this feasibility study was to determine for the elderly at-risk for falls the effects of a 10-week program in Argentine Tango dancing or Walking on cognition.

In this study we demonstrate that NOD.B6 Idd3 mice show halted disease progression and also show reduced levels of TH1 cells in their peripheral immune system. In vitro , CD4+ CD25- effector T (TEFF ) cells from congenic mice display increased proliferation and IL-2 production compared to wild type NOD mice. However, unfractionated NOD.B6 Idd3 CD4+ T cells maintain a higher TREG:T EFF ratio and proliferate less than their NOD counterparts, suggesting increased immunoregulation. In vivo, the Idd3 locus does not appear to reduce the number of islet-reactive cells or increase the systemic frequency of TREG cells in the immune system of pre-diabetic mice. Instead, reduced infiltration of TEFF cells in the pancreas of NOD.B6 Idd3 mice suggests increased suppression of autoimmune cells at the site of inflammation in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, tolerance mechanisms in the NOD.B6 Idd3 mouse are much better at suppressing the proliferation of islet-reactive T EFF cells in the pLN. Furthermore, using a novel strain of BDC.Idd3 mice, which contain islet-reactive TCR transgenic CD4+ T cells and which are homozygous for the B6-derived Idd3 allele, we demonstrate that TEFF cells containing the protective Idd3 allele do not possess reduced diabetogenic potential in vivo. Using an adoptive transfer model for type-1 diabetes, we demonstrate that CD4+CD25+ TREG containing the protective Idd3 allele are intrinsically better suppressors than TREG cells of NOD genotype. Collectively, our data show that the protective Idd3 allele favours immunoregulation in the pancreatic lesion by enhancing TREG cell function. Although the precise mechanism of this protection remains unknown, these findings may ultimately help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce or prevent the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta islet cells in type-1 diabetes patients.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n272g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xn92n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kz071"><dcterms:title>MMCTP : a radiotherapy research environment for Monte Carlo and patient-specific treatment planning</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Alexander, Andrew William.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Accurate dose calculations and analysis tools are essential to radiotherapy treatment planning.

We also study the motion of twist grain boundaries subjected to slow transverse modulations of lamellae, and obtain both analytically and numerically the traveling velocity of the boundary as well as its dependence on modulation wavenumber.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sf84h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881r28v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Theory.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akk91fr093"><dcterms:title>Glc7-E101Q is a novel tool for integrated genomic and proteomic analysis of PP1Glc7 phosphatase functional networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Szapiel, Nicolas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Reversible phosphorylation is a major mechanism for regulating the activity, localization and stability of proteins required for vital cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, gene expression, establishment of polarity, mitosis and cytokinesis. Phospho-regulation is driven by the activities of kinases and phosphatases. Together, these enzymes account for ~3% of eukaryotic genomes and it is estimated that 30% of the eukaryotic proteome is composed of phospho-proteins. Protein kinases (PKs) have been studied extensively, however relatively little is known regarding the signaling networks of protein phosphatases (PPases). The identification of PPase functional networks has been slow due to the redundant nature of the majority of PPases, the complexity of their substrate recognition in vivo, and the lack of large-scale analyses that would facilitate network analysis. We hypothesized that large-scale analysis of genetic interactions using the Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) and proteomic analyses using 2D-PAGE Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DiGE) could reveal PPase functional networks. Here, we apply this approach to the essential and conserved PP1 PPase Glc7 as it regulates numerous cellular processes in budding yeast. For this study, we created a glc7 hypomorphic mutant (glc7-E101Q) suited for both SGA and DiGE analyses. SGA analysis of glc7-E101Q revealed a broad network of 147 synthetic sick/lethal (SSL) and 178 synthetic rescue (SR) interactions. DiGE comparison of the glc7-E101Q proteome relative to wild-type at medium-resolution (~1000 proteins) revealed alterations in 39 proteins that changed as a consequence of both the mutation and growth conditions. One of the proteins identified in this analysis was Eno1, a non-essential enolase that is mis-regulated in the presence of glucose and identified a SR mutation in the glc7-E101Q SGA. Subsequent phenotypic analysis suggests a novel, non-metabolic role for Eno1 in the Glc7 interaction network. Our results reveal that parallel analysis, using SGA and DIGE, can reveal novel functions and networks that a single analysis may not detect.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311t64k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fr093</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Phosphoprotein phosphatases.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722hf09j"><dcterms:title>Evolution of modular morphology in actinopterygian pectoral fins</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tissandier, Sylvie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>With a generally conserved function for locomotion, paired fins have an extensive evolutionary history that has resulted in highly disparate morphologies in a wide diversity of taxa. Two-dimensional geometric morphometrics offers a means to quantitatively describe disparity and changes in the shape of pectoral fins. Actinopterygians lend themselves well to a study of this nature due to their prolific diversity and prevalence in the fossil record. As a result of changes in skeletal fin structures and the lack of homologous elements throughout the group, three morphological modules are used as the unit of comparison rather than individual elements of the fin. Ordination plots from thin plate spline analyses, including fossil and extant taxa, show correspondence with the actinopterygian phylogeny as trends become apparent through the group. Basal actinopterygians and basal teleosts tend to have a narrow, elongate fin shape. Following a shift in morphospace, derived teleosts have a wider fin base, with an elongate anterior margin of the fin relative to the posterior trailing edge. Linear and squared-change parsimony reconstructions of continuous data allow the phylogeny to be traced through morphospace to approximate the path of pectoral fin evolution. The shift in morphospace occurs at Acanthomorpha, and is correlated with the evolution of a physoclistous swim bladder and a change in the position and orientation of pectoral fins. As a result of these changes, new swimming modes are made available, and the expansion of locomotory modes of Acanthomorpha is here hypothesized to be associated with a sharp increase in pectoral fin disparity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd473151z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf09j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Osteichthyes -- Morphology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fins (Anatomy) -- Anatomy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fins (Anatomy) -- Evolution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Osteichthyes -- Anatomy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x3391"><dcterms:title>Focal-plane-array fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as a rapid method for the differentiation between antibiotic resistant and sensitive salmonella</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Taqi, Marwa.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The utility of focal-plane-array Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) spectroscopy as a rapid method for the differentiation of antibiotic resistant foodborne pathogens was studied. Optimum spectral acquisition and processing parameters as well as appropriate film thickness of bacterial films were empirically established for the discrimination between two Shigella species (S. flexneri and S sonnei) in order to optimize the scanning parameters of an FPA-FTIR spectrometer. A detailed study of the potential of FPA-FTIR spectroscopy for the discrimination between antibiotic resistant and sensitive strains from two Salmonella species (S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg) was subsequently undertaken. The results of these studies demonstrated that the infrared spectra recorded by an FPA-FTIR spectrometer contained sufficient information to differentiate between antibiotic resistant and sensitive strains of Salmonella. Accordingly, FPA-FTIR spectroscopy may potentially serve as a high-throughput technique for the identification of foodborne as well as antibiotic resistant bacteria. Interpretation of the regions selected in relation to the different resistance mechanisms would require more detailed studies. However, the identification of specific biochemical markers based on such spectral interpretation is generally not feasible owing to the complexity of the FTIR spectra of microorganisms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f686.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x3391</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Drug resistance in microorganisms.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Salmonella.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foodborne diseases.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microbial sensitivity tests.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn00b292z"><dcterms:title>The development of a warm-season blocking index for the Northern Hemisphere /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Von Appen, Florian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Considerable research has been performed on persistent-anomaly structures for the Northern Hemisphere winter. However, atmospheric blocking structures during the warm season also have a considerable impact on weather and climate, as manifested through heat waves, floods, and droughts. In particular, atmospheric blocked flow has a profound impact on anomalously-dry regimes over the central North American continent. In order to provide a better understanding of the life cycle of the atmospheric blocking events and their relation to fast-climate phenomena, we analyse persistent height-anomaly structures derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) global reanalyses. We devise an objective criterion for the characterization of blocked flow by relating it to persistent positive height anomalies. Individual warm-season events over the North American continent are then identified and examined in case studies. This reveals a type of blocking regime, differing in structure from the Rex and Omega type blocks described in the literature, as being important in the region during summer. Moreover, changes in the statistical distribution of the event frequencies are analysed in order to detect climatic trends. We find a pronounced westward displacement of the North American anomaly event frequency maximum to be associated with the 1999-2004 drought in the Canadian Prairies.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924g87n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b292z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atmospheric Sciences.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945w17n"><dcterms:title>Un système septique modifié pour gerer efficacement les eaux usées de ferme laitière /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morin, Sophie, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 2001, the Quebec Ministry of Environment modified its waste management regulation and obliged dairy farms to treat their milk house wastewaters to prevent contamination of water courses. For small dairy farms with fewer than 60 cows, conventional technologies implied an investment of at least $15 000 to comply with the new regulation. The objective of this master's project was therefore to develop a low cost and sustainable technology for the treatment and disposal of milk house wastewaters that would permit on-farm recycling of nutrients and water. With the help of the research results of Urgel Delisle and Ass., the new system was done by modifying existing septic tank systems on two dairy farms with 40-50 cows by installing a sediment and milk fat trap before the septic tank, and building a drained 0.45ha seepage field in a pasture or cropped field, after the septic tank. The modified septic tank system on each farm was monitored during a three year period, which involved checking the system for clogging by digging out sections of sewer pipes after two years of operation; measuring and sampling milk house wastewaters to establish the annual nutrient load, and comparing the water quality in drainage from the seepage field to that of a nearby control field. The milk house wastewaters produced by the farms led to an average nutrient load of 60kg TN/ha/y, 50kg TP/ha/y and 80 kg TK/ha/y. The average volume of wastewater applied to the seepage field, between 16 and 19mm/month, did not saturate the soil as no sign of gleying (reduction of iron oxides) was observed when excavating the sewer pipes. In general, soil pH decreased when milk house wastewater entered the seepage field, while the NH4-N, K and Ca concentrations increased. However, soil salinity was low (&lt;4 dS m -1) on these farms. The soil P concentration was unchanged on one farm, but there was rapid and significant accumulation of P in the 20-60 cm depth of the soil profile on the second farm. The accumulation of milk fat inside the sewer pipes on one farm resulted from the disposal of wasted milk into the septic system, the absence of a water softener and the fact that this fat was not regularly removed from the trap. The milk fat was then flowed into the septic tank harming the correct operation of the system. Drainage water quality was similar from the seepage field of the modified septic tank system as an adjacent control field. The low cost of system modification, about $4 400 Can., and the treatment efficiency achieved meant that the concept is feasible and offers a suitable solution for small dairy farms.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537533c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945w17n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sewage -- Purification -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy waste -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Septic tanks -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adr26z2295"><dcterms:title>Experimental analysis of trans-splicing of an ascidian troponin I gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mortimer, Sandra, 1981-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>I investigated SL trans-splicing in the troponin I gene of Ciona intestinalis. Experimental mutation of the AG dinucleotide adjacent to the natural trans-splice acceptor site (-64) in CiTnI/nuclacZ constructs eliminated trans-splicing to that site in Ciona embryos but activated trans-splicing at cryptic acceptor sites at -76 and -39, adjacent to the nearest AG dinucleotides. However, not all AG dinucleotides specify cryptic acceptor sites because outron internal deletions or 3'truncation mutants were trans-spliced at a far-upstream AG-adjacent cryptic site (-346), leaving many AGs in the retained outron segments. Thus, additional sequence elements that are present only in the -346 and -76/-64/-39 regions are required for cryptic acceptor activity. All mutant constructs generated detectable beta-gal enzyme expression, although the mutant with the longest retained-outron segment appeared less active. Therefore, mRNA accumulation and translation do not require trans-splicing to the natural acceptor site, although they may be facilitated by the normal removal of the outron during trans-splicing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xd80h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z2295</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ciona intestinalis -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trans-Splicing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muscle proteins.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Troponin I -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>RNA splicing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ciona intestinalis -- genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kf972"><dcterms:title>Metabolite fingerprinting tools to detect differences between transgenic and conventional crops</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morin, Geneviève.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A concern in transgenic crops is the potential risk posed by unintended effects which could result from genetic transformation.

Propionic acid-based additives can be added to ensiled forages to inhibit yeast and mold growth, and improve the aerobic stability of silages. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of a propionic acid-based silage additive (Solution Foin) on ensiling characteristics, aerobic stability and feeding value of short-term ensiled corn forage. Chopped whole corn was left untreated or treated with Solution Foin (contains 700 g kg-1 propionic acid and 300 g kg-1 NH4OH). The additive was added to forage prior ensiling at a rate of 5 L ton-1 (wet basis). Treated and untreated forages were placed in six plastic silo bags (three each). Silo bags were opened one day after ensiling and daily samples were collected for 30 consecutive days. Effects on animal performance of feeding treated or untreated forage were determined in a completely randomized design, using 30 lactating cows (178+/-55 days in milk) fed total mixed ration (50:50 forage: concentrate) with the major forage portion consisting of untreated or treated forage. The feeding study started one day post-ensiling. Results showed that Solution Foin reduced (P &lt; 0.05) yeast and mold populations between d 5 and 14 post-ensiling. The highest differences (P &lt; 0.002) were observed on d 10, at which point yeast and mold populations for untreated silage were 7.86 and 2.51 log cfu g-1, respectively. The corresponding values for treated silage were 4.35 and 0.00 log cfu g-1, respectively. Aerobic stability of treated ensiled forage was also improved (P &lt; 0.01) from day 0 (by 159 h) to day 10 (by 33 h) post-ensiling. Solution Foin also increased (P &lt; 0.05) the overall lactic acid and WSC content, and lowered the temperature of the treated ensiled forage in the field. No treatment differences were detected in the forage pH and acetic acid concentration. Dairy cows fed treated forage had similar feed intake (average 23 kg d-1) and milk yield (average 29 kg d-1) to cows fed the untreated forage. It was concluded that Solution Foin can be used to improve the aerobic stability and ensiled forage characteristics of short-term corn forage, likely by reducing yeast and mold populations.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032715x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78th39c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Corn -- Silage.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Feeding and feeds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Propionic acid.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Silage -- Additives.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85ng45n"><dcterms:title>Determining the optimal location for a large organic food store in Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Li, Beibei, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, the optimal location for a large format, organic food retail store is determined using the Huff Model in Montreal, Canada. The Huff Model has been widely used in marketing analysis to determine the optimal location in a variety of contexts. First, the study used Statistics Canada 2001 food expenditure data for Montreal to generate a double log linear food expenditure model for Montreal consumers. Variance Inflation Factors were calculated to test if there were multicollinearity problems, and a Breusch-Pagen test was done to test for heteroskedasticity. Neither of the results showed any statistical problems. Second, AC Nielson survey results were used to facilitate the organic food expenditure calculation process. Third, the travel distance from all census tracts in Montreal to the candidate store locations were calculated using the Manhattan distance calculator (McLafferty and Grady, 2005). Finally, the Huff Model was used to calculate an attractiveness index for each candidate location. The conclusion from the results of the empirical analysis was that, among the 45 candidate locations, which are scattered all across Montreal, 5445 de Gaspe gained the highest attractiveness index. This location is situated close to relatively affluent and highly populated areas of the city, and is also very accessible. Not only is this just a few blocks from two metro stations, and close to city bus routes, it is also adjacent to several major streets such as Saint-Laurent to the west, Saint-Denis to the east, Rosemont to the north and Saint-Joseph to the south. This thesis has provided a new application of the Huff model, which could be used in various markets, and has provided an interesting combination of models from the field of Economic Geography, and Agricultural Economics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t6283.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85ng45n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Store location -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Natural foods industry -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Supermarkets -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn107328c"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of impact attenuation of facial protectors in ice hockey helmets</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lemair, Mylene.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether ice hockey facial protectors can decrease overall head acceleration during blunt impacts as well as to identify if attenuation differences exist between visors and cages. Commercial models of three cages and three visors were assessed. Blunt impacts were simulated permitting the measurement of peak accelerations (PA) within the surrogate head form. Results indicated that indeed face protectors in combination with helmets substantially reduced PA during blunt impacts within threshold safety limits (below 300 g's). In general, cages showed lower PA than visors (p=0.004). Differences between models were also observed during repeated impacts and impact site (p=0.0001, p=0.007). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that facial protectors function beyond their role in preventing facial injuries, complementing the role of the helmet in attenuating head deceleration during impact.
