This model, which is non-hydrostatic and compressible, was extended by including separate continuity equations for dry and activated multi-modal aerosol, and for chemical species. The sources and sinks include: particle activation, solute transfer between drops, generation of extra soluble material in clouds via oxidation of dissolved SO2, and particle regeneration. The cloud processes are represented by an advanced double-moment bulk microphysical parameterization. Three summertime cases have been evaluated: a marine stratus and a cold frontal system over the Bay of Fundy near Nova Scotia, formed on 1 Sep 1995 and extensively sampled as a part of the Radiation, Aerosol, and Cloud Experiment (RACE); and a continental stratocumulus, formed over the southern coast of Lake Erie on 11 July 2001. The marine stratus and the frontal system have been examined for the effects of aerosol on cloud properties and thoroughly evaluated against the available observations. The frontal system and the continental stratocumulus have been evaluated for the effects of cloud processing on the aerosol spectrum. The marine stratus simulations suggest a significant impact of the aerosol on cloud properties. A simulation with mechanistic activation and a uni-modal aerosol showed the best agreement with observations in regards to cloud-base and cloud-top height, droplet concentration, and liquid water content. A simulation with a simple activation parameterization failed to simulate essential bulk cloud properties: droplet concentration was significantly underpredicted and the vertical structure of the cloud was inconsistent with the observations. A simulation with a mechanistic parameterization and a bi-modal aerosol, including a coarse mode observed in particle spectra below cloud, showed high sensitivity of droplet concentration to the inclusion of the coarse mode. There was a significant reduction in droplet number relative to the simulation without the coarse mode. A similar change occurred in the precipitating system preceding the stratus formation, resulting in an enhancement of precipitation in the weaker (upstream) part of the system while the precipitation in the more vigorous (downstream) part of the system remained almost unaffected. Aerosol processing via collision-coalescence and aqueous chemistry in the non-drizzling stratocumulus case suggests that impact of the two mechanisms is of similar magnitude and can be as large as a 3-5 % increase in particle mean radius. A more detailed analysis reveals that the impact of chemical processing is oxidant-limited; beyond times when the oxidant (H 2O2) is depleted (~ 40 minutes), the extent of processing is determined by supply of fresh oxidant from large-scale advection (fresh gaseous emissions are not considered). Aerosol processing via drop collision-coalescence alone suggests, as expected, sensitivity to the strength of the collection process in clouds. Larger particle growth, up to 5-10 %, is observed in the case of the frontal clouds, which exhibit stronger drop collection compared to that in the stratocumulus case. The processed aerosol exerted a measurable impact on droplet concentrations and precipitation production in the frontal clouds. For the case modeled here, contrary to expectations, the processed spectrum (via physical processing) produced higher droplet concentration than the unprocessed spectrum. The reasons explaining this phenomenon and the resulting impact on precipitation production are discussed. The current work illustrates the complexity of the coupled system at the cloud system scales, revealed earlier at much smaller large eddy scales. If future parameterizations of the regional effect of aerosols on clouds are to be developed, careful consideration is required of the many of feedbacks in the boundary layer.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zz37x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f549s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atmospheric Sciences.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qp083"><dcterms:title>Carbonation of cement-based products with pure carbon dioxide and flue gas</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Sanwu, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>CO2 absorption behaviour of four commonly used cement based building products: cement paste, concrete block, expanded polystyrene bead (EPB) and cement-bonded cellulose fiberboard are studied. Cement products are manufactured following industry formulation and process, and carbonation curing takes place in a chamber under a pressure of 0.5 MPa, at ambient temperature, for durations of mostly 2 to 8 hours with both pure carbon dioxide gas and flue gas. The flue gas of 13.8% CO2 content is collected from a typical cement kiln without separation. Influencing factors on carbon uptake, long-term strength as well as microstructure development are studied. It is found that the CO2 uptake ability of those cement-based products follows the same order when exposed to either pure gas or flue gas: fiberboard has the highest uptake capacity, followed by cement paste, bead board and concrete. For fiberboard, the best CO2 uptake in flue gas is 8.1%, it reaches 23.6% if pure gas used. Introduction of cellulose fiber in the fiberboard significantly increases voids volume and cement paste surface area through dispersing the paste onto fiber surface, effectively increasing carbonation reaction sites and thus CO2 uptake. For pure gas carbonation with high reaction rate, it takes longer time for carbonated products to further develop strength from subsequent hydration, due to the high water loss during carbonation, the densified cement matrix structures and even fast decalcified cement minerals. Fast carbonation with pure gas is detrimental to cement paste in its long-term strength. For flue gas carbonation, both immediate strengths and long-term strength of the products are comparable with those by pure gas carbonation, although with less CO 2 uptake ability. Five CO2 uptake determination methods are evaluated. Weight gain method is suitable for both pure gas and flue gas carbonation systems. Mass curve method is more suited for pure gas carbonation. For flue gas carbonation, CO2 concentration method agreed well with the weight gain method. Pressure drop method is relatively less accurate because of water vapor generation during carbonation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x343m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qp083</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carbon dioxide.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cement composites.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Concrete -- Curing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Concrete products.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Flue gases.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn301566p"><dcterms:title>Speaker adaptation in joint factor analysis based text independent speaker verification</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shou-Chun, Yin, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents methods for supervised and unsupervised speaker adaptation of Gaussian mixture speaker models in text-independent speaker verification.

Furthermore, few studies have been done to clarify how the wake vs. sleep promoting neurons may be modulated to generate their differential activity and sleep-wake cycle. Using a paradigm of sleep deprivation and sleep recovery and examining c-Fos expression as an indicator of cell activity, we found that across the BF and the adjacent preoptic area, more cells including cholinergic neurons were active during waking than during sleep and thus contribute to generating a waking state. On the other hand, the proportion of c-Fos expressing neurons that were GABAergic was higher during sleep recovery than sleep deprivation, indicating that particular GABAergic cells are involved in generating sleep. Although the posterior hypothalamus has long been known to play a critical role in the maintenance of waking, the neurotransmitter identity of neurons fulfilling this role was not known. Here using c-Fos, we show that Orexin (Orx) neurons are active during waking. On the other hand, we show that co-distributed cells containing melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) are more active during sleep recovery than sleep deprivation, suggesting an opposite role of MCH to that of Orx neurons in sleep vs. waking regulation. Sleep vs. wake promoting cells could be differently modulated by noradrenaline (NA) and accordingly would bear different adrenergic receptors. We found that the majority of GABAergic BF cells expressing c-Fos during sleep bear alpha2 adrenergic receptors (alpha2AAR). They would accordingly be inhibited during waking through these receptors. We also found that many Orx cells in the hypothalamus bear alpha1AAR and thus would be excited by NA during waking. Like the BF GABAergic cells, many MCH neurons were endowed with alpha2AAR and thus would be inhibited during waking. Activation vs. inhibition of sleep or wake-active cells could also be modulated by changes in the availability of cell surface receptors across behavioral states. We show that following sleep deprivation, the presence and the intensity of GABAARs on the BF cholinergic cell membrane were increased. Such activity dependent changes of GABAARs could underlie homeostatic regulation of wake promoting cells across the sleep-waking cycle. These studies identify clearly for the first time the specific neurotransmitter-containing neurons that are active during and thus generative for waking vs. sleep through the BF, the preoptic area and the posterior hypothalamus. They moreover illuminate how by bearing different receptors or changing membrane receptor availability, different cells can be modulated to generate the sleep-waking cycle.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x344w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79408236f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cv90z"><dcterms:title>An application of semi-bayes modeling to a study of the occupational etiology of lung cancer /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Momoli, Franco G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The occupational environment has been a fruitful source of research on causes of cancer. Analyses in studies of occupational risk factors for cancer can experience problems if an attempt is made to model large numbers of exposures, some of which may be highly correlated. Typical analyses of such studies focus on one chemical at a time, but this may not adequately deal with mutual confounding. Based on a large study in Montreal, the objective of this thesis was twofold: to assess several occupational chemicals for their etiologic role in lung cancer, and to explore the use of semi-Bayes modeling to simultaneously estimate the effects of many chemicals at a time. Methods. Data came from a multiple-cancer case-control study of exposures in the work place. The study was comprised of 857 cases of lung cancer and 2172 controls consisting of patients with other types of cancer diagnosed from 1979 to 1985. Detailed occupational histories were collected and occupational hygienists translated these into exposure histories for 231 chemicals. All chemicals were analysed with conventional modeling strategies of both single and multiple parameter models. Of the 231 chemicals, 184 were singled out for analysis in a single large semi-Bayes model, which is a variant of classical empirical Bayes. This analysis is a fairly novel method suited to estimating large numbers of parameters in the face of sparse data. For the Bayesian portion of this model, chemicals were grouped by shared chemical and physical properties, based on the belief that these shared properties would imply similar effects on the risk of lung cancer. Results. Estimates for all 231 chemicals were derived under the various modeling strategies. For most chemicals, estimates changed little across these analytic approaches, though some differences were apparent. Of the 231 chemicals assessed, 53 were earmarked as requiring further evaluation and underwent additional analyses. Discussion. While semi-Bayes models have been shown previously to offer improved estimation over conventional analyses, the gains in using semi-Bayes models in the present study were less clear. Effort put into some portions of the Bayesian modeling did not materially influence the results. A number of chemicals were earmarked as potential lung carcinogens.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698c99r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv90z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53x125j"><dcterms:title>Immunomodulation with toll-like receptor 7 ligands in infections and allergic diseases</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moisan, Jacques.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Modulation of the immune response to treat various infectious and allergic diseases as well as certain forms of cancer has been employed since William B. Coley injected a mixture of bacteria into patients with large inoperable tumors over 100 years ago. The imidazoquinoline compounds are nucleoside analogs with strong type I interferon inducing activity. Recently, these compounds have been found to mediate their effects through a subset of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. A topical cream containing imiquimod, a member of the imidazoquinoline family, is currently employed in humans for the treatment of genital warts caused by the human papilloma virus, against actinic keratosis as well as for topical treatment of primary superficial basal cell carcinoma. The goal of the present study was to determine the potential of imidazoquinolines in the treatment of other infectious and allergic diseases as well as their mechanism of action. Furthermore, the role of possible modulators of response to these chemicals has been studied. We show that imidazoquinoline treatment can increase mycobactericidal activity in mice carrying a resistant (wild type) allele of SLC11A1 (formerly natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1)). NRAMP1 affected responsiveness to imidazoquinolines in macrophages by modulating P38 MAPK activation as well as atypical PKC activity both of which are required for optimal immunodulatory activity by these TLR ligands. Imidazoquinoline treatment also prevented development of atopic allergic asthma in mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin by preventing inflammatory cytokine production as well as eosinophil infiltration in the lungs. Interestingly, this drug when used as a therapeutic agent against allergic asthma was equally efficient in mice carrying the wild type (resistant) or the susceptible allele of the Nramp1 gene. This suggests that NRAMP1 modulates response to imidazoquinoline treatment in models dependent on macrophage subsets which require NRAMP1 function to become activated to an appropriate degree. Taken together, the presented study broadens the possible applicability of imidazoquinolines to the treatment of mycobacterial infections as well as to allergic asthma treatment and defines an important role for NRAMP1 in regulating responses to this family of pharmaceutical compounds.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236657k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53x125j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr1722381"><dcterms:title>Identification and characterization of a novel regulator of root development from natural genetic variation among isogenized Arabidopsis accessions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mouchel, Céline.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Roots are essential for plant anchorage and nutrient uptake. Although root system architecture is genetically determined, its high level of plasticity allows rapid as well as long term adaptation to the plants' environment. To confer such adaptability, favorable alleles have been selected within species to endow them with an optimized root system. The identification of such favorable alleles is therefore a central component of research in plant breeding. In an attempt to isolate novel factors that modulate root development, we exploited natural genetic variation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Tissue culture analysis of 44 accessions led to the identification of a line, Uk-1 (Umkirch-1), whose root system differs significantly from average accessions. A short primary root and an increased number of lateral and adventitious roots are typical for the Uk-1 root system, while the average Arabidopsis root system consists of a predominant primary root and few lateral roots. The major locus responsible for the Uk-1 phenotype, BREVIS RADIX (BRX), was successfully isolated by map-based cloning. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis revealed that BRX is responsible for ca. 80% of the variance of the observed primary root length difference as compared to an average control accession. BRX controls the extent of cell proliferation and elongation in the growth zone of the root tip and is a member of a novel, small family of proteins that contain three distinct and highly conserved domains of unknown function. BRX is a low abundant, nuclear protein, which is expressed in the phloem and the pericycle at the phloem poles. BRX is also expressed in the columella. Since BRX is not expressed in the root meristem, it must affect root growth in a secondary manner, likely by modulating responses to the plant hormone auxin. Transcriptional profiling in root tissues revealed that BRX does so by maintaining optimal expression of the brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene CPD, and thereby optimal endogenous levels of the plant hormone brassinosteroid. Further analysis identified BRX as a central component of the interdependency of brassinosteroid signaling and auxin signaling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fh12t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr1722381</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arabidopsis thaliana -- Roots.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arabidopsis thaliana -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9w032718r"><dcterms:title>Statistical benchmark surveying of production concentrators</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lotter, Norman Owen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sampling and analysis of sulphide mineral processing plants is addressed in this study. A review of the published literature has shown that the foundations of this topic were laid in the 1970's, but typically a single sampling test was performed, and its representativity accepted provided its metallurgical balance closed without excessive adjustments. There was no mention made of quality control or equivalent tests of representativity of the feed material during sampling tests. No recognition of the effect(s) of ore grade on metallurgical performance was given. In this study, a quantitative model, called a statistical benchmark survey, is presented. Multiple surveys are completed over a limited time; the corresponding stream samples of the surveys deemed acceptable are combined to obtain high confidence composite samples. The head grade of each survey is compared to two distributions to test its acceptability, typically at a 95% confidence level. These distributions are called the Internal Reference Distribution and the External Reference Distribution. The first test---on the Internal Reference Distribution---uses the Sichel t-estimator, a lognormal model designed for use on small data sets, on the set of six survey unit head grades. The associated confidence limits of this mean grade are equivalent to two standard errors of the distribution, but are skewed about the sample mean. The second test, this time by the External Reference Distribution, also uses a lognormal platform, designed by Krige, but uses larger data sets from 1-3 months of shift sample head grades. The associated confidence limits of this second model are also skewed, but are wider than for the Sichel model, and are equivalent to two standard deviations of the sample mean. This outlier rejection model produces ore grade estimates that are in good agreement with the more robust External Reference Distribution means. The Raglan Mine case study is used to illustrate that ore grades in situ are highly lognormal; this lognormality is also present in the time domain in head samples (taken at the cyclone overflow), but is less pronounced (i.e. residual). Two survey models are presented. The benchmark model describes typical operations. The campaign model specifically chooses ore types that are mined and milled in a specific week of operations for predictive or diagnostic purposes. The multiple mineral hosting of nickel across three orders of magnitude extends this problem into that of a compound distribution. The construction and use of an External Reference Distribution to estimate the mean and associated skew confidence limits of this compound distribution is shown for both drill core and ore milled (the latter in a case of residual lognormality). A trial decomposition of the spatial External Reference Distribution is discussed. The heterogeneous nickel mineral hosting in ore, after processing, becomes an artificially controlled final concentrate, containing most of the economic nickel sulphides in a normal distribution, and most of the uneconomic nickel minerals in a final tailing with a residually bimodal lognormal distribution. The presence of bimodal lognormality in final tailing data may have historical or predictive uses: at Raglan, flowsheet improvements and more seasoned operations contributed to the decrease in the mean of both the low-grade and high-grade modes, and increase the contribution of the low-grade mode.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sz12d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032718r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abv73c478t"><dcterms:title>The molecular and structural characterization of the PTS1 glycosomal protein import pathway in Leishmania donovani /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Madrid, Kleber Patricio.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Leishmania glycosomes compartmentalize a variety of essential biochemical and metabolic pathways required for parasite viability. Biogenesis and maintenance of glycosomes involves a family of proteins called peroxins, however the molecular mechanisms governing the early events of this pathway have not been fully established. A structural-functional analysis of the receptor LdPEX5 revealed the formation of a tetrameric structure stabilized by coiled-coil motifs. A biophysical approach showed that the tetrameric structure of LdPEX5 dissociates to dimers upon binding to the PTS1 ligand. However, the tetrameric LdPEX5 is more thermodynamically favorable to bind. Lastly, LdPEX14 modulates the LdPEX5-PTS1 interaction as the presence of LdPEX14 decreases the Kd of LdPEX5-PTS1 by ~10 folds. PTS1-loaded LdPEX5 docks onto the glycosomal membrane via the membrane-associated LdPEX14, an interaction that was characterized by molecular mapping and biophysical approaches. In higher eukaryotes this PEX5-PEX14 interaction involves conserved WXXXF/Y pentapeptide motifs found on PEX5 and a signature sequence found on PEX14. These three repeats in LdPEX5 do not appear to be crucial for interaction with LdPEX14 thus suggesting a unique molecular mechanism mediating the docking event. On the other hand, the conserved signature motif is crucial for interaction with LdPEX5. The topology and nature of the interaction of LdPEX14 with the glycosomal membrane is not clear. In vivo expression of FLAG-LdPEX14-HA together with proteinase digestion confirmed that both N- and C-termini are cytosolic facing. Mapping analysis revealed that the first 63 N-terminal residues of LdPEX14 are critical for anchoring LdPEX14 to the glycosomal membrane. Interestingly, expression of the first 74 amino acids of LdPEX14 is toxic to the parasites. Finally, the structure of LdPEX14 on the glycosomal membrane was addressed by molecular mapping and biophysical techniques. Partial trypsin digestion of recombinant LdPEX14 and molecular mapping suggested that the first 250 residues of LdPEX14 were involved in the formation of the complex. Biophysical approaches and cross-linking assays suggest that this complex may consist of ~12-100 LdPEX14 subunits. Interestingly, the structure of LdPEX14 appears to be modulated by LdPEX5. Considering all the results, these findings have established important molecular information concerning early events in the targeting and import of PTS1 proteins into the glycosome.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182q47f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c478t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cell receptors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leishmaniasis -- Molecular aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leishmania -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924g896"><dcterms:title>Rehearsing the real : children's identity development in virtual spaces</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lynch, Dianne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Children who have grown up with the Internet as a dominant form of cultural production bring to their identity development a complex and unique set of expectations and assumptions about identity fluidity and presentation. In addition, these "cyberchildren" are spending much of their social-interaction time in environments populated and controlled by adults, and yet beyond the purview or authority of the adults in their "real" lives. Understanding the nature of their identity development in virtual spaces and its implications for their real-world behaviors offers new opportunities for interventions that more effectively empower children to navigate and negotiate their experiences in relationship with online audiences. The study proposes that Goffman's dramaturgical metaphor can be productively applied to cyberspace, where children are rehearsing their identity performances in backstage, virtual environments; transferring their most salient and valuable identities to middle-stage spaces in real life, where they are performed for their peers and friends; and finally adopting them for presentation in front-stage, public spheres. The work draws on sociological interaction, dramaturgical analysis, information flow theory, and cyberstudies theory to propose a new theoretical framework. Its mixed-methodology approach incorporates a quantitative online survey, including benchmark questions drawn from three national surveys, and open-ended questions analyzed through qualitative methodologies. Taken together, the results confirmed the author's hypotheses that: (1) Cyberchildren have access to adult information and situations; (2) Traditional interventions to protect children in cyberspace are largely ineffective; (3) Cyberchildren maintain distinct online and real-life identities; and (4) Cyberchildren perceive of their virtual identities as valuable and salient.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zv74q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g896</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Internet and children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Video games and children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computers and children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Virtual reality.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702qb64h"><dcterms:title>Roles of zinc cluster protein transcription factors in conferring drug resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacPherson, Sarah A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Multi-drug or pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) is a universally acquired mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved. Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as an excellent model organism for studying this phenomenon in pathogenic fungi, such as Candida albicans. In yeast, PDR is most often mediated by the overexpression of membrane-spanning transporter proteins that act as drug efflux pumps. Their expression is controlled by an intricate network of transcription factors, including many members of the Gal4p superfamily of zinc cluster proteins. Pdr1p, Pdr3p, Pdr8p, Stb5p, Yrm1p, and Yrr1p are all transcriptional activators that make up the PDR network. Upc2p and Ecm22p are two other transcription factors in this family that contribute to drug resistance by effecting changes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Unlike S. cerevisiae, transcription factors contributing to PDR in C. albicans are virtually unknown. Using comparative genomics, we characterized a homologue of Upc2p in C. albicans. We show that overexpression of C. albicans UPC2 confers resistance to several drugs, and its gene product regulates transcription of several ergosterol genes. In addition, we recently identified a novel zinc cluster protein in S. cerevisiae, Rdr1p, which acts as a trancriptional repressor of multi-drug resistance genes. We demonstrate that Rdr1p forms homodimers in vivo, and does not heterodimerize with any of the other transcription factors tested. These results favour a model in which Rdr1p negatively regulates transcription by competing for binding with other factors to elements within the promoters of target genes. Together, these data imply that this family's role in drug resistance is conserved, and that our knowledge of zinc cluster proteins in budding yeast can be applied to pathogenic fungal species.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35td412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702qb64h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gx92f"><dcterms:title>Investigating small multiple catchment runoff generation in a forested temperate watershed</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>James, April Lynda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Runoff generation refers to the physical processes by which water travels through the landscape, moving through the subsurface or over the ground surface, ultimately arriving at the stream channel. These physical processes vary in both space and time leading to difficulties in mechanistic modelling of storm response, contaminant transport and nutrient fluxes. Runoff generation has been extensively studied at the hillslope scale and in headwater catchments. However, only recently have empirical studies begun to collect similarly detailed datasets across multiple catchments with which to examine how these processes change with scale. This study examines runoff generation from a series of eight small nested forest catchments and focuses specifically on the controlling influences of antecedent moisture conditions and catchment topography. End-member-mixing-analysis using stream water hydrochemistry from the eight catchments shows changing seasonal and storm-based source water contributions to the stream channel. Analysis identifies hydrochemical solutes with behaviour consistent with the assumptions of the mixing-model approach for all eight catchments. Results indicate that testing of solute selection is critical in the application of this method to multiple catchments. Runoff generation observed for five storm events shows a strong nonlinear relationship between runoff and antecedent moisture conditions, supporting the hypothesis of varying 'states of wetness'. Detailed hillslope-scale investigation during the different 'states of wetness' indicates that while groundwater and soil moisture profiles show changing active-flow connectivity on a seasonal and storm-base dtime scale, there no significant change in spatial patterns of shallow soil moisture. These results suggest that a priori spatial patterns in shallow soil moisture in forested terrains may not be a good predictor of critical hydrologic connectivity that leads to the threshold change in runoff generation, as has been found in rangeland catchments. Differences in storm response from the eight catchments are in part attributable to variation in topography and landscape organization. The multiple catchments have similar distributions of topographic index and yet differences in mean values of topographic index lead to significantly different estimates of mean residence time. Scaling of storm response is dominated by the behaviour of the three largest catchments. These three catchments distinguish themselves with larger MRT and larger valley bottom areas. It is these three catchments that, under dry antecedent moisture conditions, show significantly larger amounts of new water delivery to the stream channel, suggesting a significant change in dominant runoff mechanisms related to topography and landscape organization.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qr329.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx92f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Runoff -- Québec (Province) -- Mont-Saint-Hilaire.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Watersheds -- Québec (Province) -- Mont-Saint-Hilaire.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8s45qd98f"><dcterms:title>Phosphorus sorption and release as influenced by fertilizer sources in conventional and no-tillage agroecosystems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jiao, You, 1966-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Eutrophication resulting from phosphorus (P) accumulation in water systems has been a worldwide concern for three decades. Agricultural soils are known to be an important non-point source of P in waterways. The objectives of this research are to identify agricultural management practices that reduce the risk of P loss from soils, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of P retention and loss from soils. In the short term (4 years), dissolved P loads were not affected by tillage and were similar in corn (in a continuous corn rotation) and soybean (in a soybean/corn rotation) production systems. Soils amended with composted cattle manure had a greater P load than chemically fertilized soils. On average, 30% of the total P leached was in organic P forms, indicating that organic P compounds could also be problematic to water systems. Although manure application improved soil aggregation and thus may increase P retention by avoiding soil erosion, P loss through subsurface flow by leaching may be substantial. A simple soil test, either Mehlich-3 P or P saturation ratio can predict the P leaching potential, but water ponding on the surface of agricultural land could significantly affect the accuracy of the prediction. The P adsorption data was fit with the Langmuir 2-surface model, which predicted that up to 90% of the native adsorbed P was distributed on the high-energy surface. Native adsorbed P in manured soils was weakly retained, as the binding strength coefficient was 50 times less in manured than chemically fertilized soil. This findings was confirmed by measuring P desorption, which showed that P desorption rate was almost 3 times greater from manured soils than from chemically fertilized soils. Manuring alters soil particle surfaces by increasing negative charge. This is the direct reason for less P adsorption and greater P desorption by manured soils. The Langmuir 2-surface model and the adapted non-ideal competitive adsorption (MICA) model were equally good at modeling P adsorption data. However, the NICA model is more robust and can predict phosphate adsorption with changing soil solution pH. The simultaneously modeling of P adsorption and hydroxyl adsorption with the NICA model makes it a promising tool for analyzing competitive adsorption among anions in soils.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x547v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qd98f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>No-tillage -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cattle -- Manure -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wh76p"><dcterms:title>The relevance of involvement in micro-credit self-help groups and empowerment : findings from a survey of rural women in Tamilnadu</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Joseph, John Santiago.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this dissertation is to establish the extent to which women's membership in self-help groups and their involvement in various activities of these groups, with particular reference to Micro Credit programs, impacted their socio-economic empowerment. The objective is to study the socio-economic empowerment impact factors (evidences) in women members of micro-credit self-help groups in rural India upon the self, the family and the community. Data selected for analyses was based on an operational model of empowerment that encompassed indicators of purported empowerment at the personal, family and community levels. The working hypotheses in quantitative analyses are that there are significant differences in income, savings, assets, expenditure, basic amenities, as well as attitudinal and behavioral changes in the rural women before and after their group membership. The qualitative interviews helped to assess the life conditions of the women as the process of empowerment before and after their participation in self-help group micro-credit program. The qualitative interviews were to corroborate the veracity of reported progress from the survey to shed some light on the specific factors that contributed to their empowerment in line with their present quality of life at personal, family and community levels. Hence, the impact of the program is measured as the difference in the magnitude of a given parameter between the pre-and post-SHG situations by comparing the life condition of members before joining the self-help group to their condition three years after joining.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc88b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wh76p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- India -- Tamil Nadu -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Microfinance -- India -- Tamil Nadu.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tamil Nadu (India) -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Employment -- India -- Tamil Nadu.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rq58v"><dcterms:title>Linear programming : pivoting on polyhedra and arrangements</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kaluzny, Bohdan Lubomyr.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Linear programming is perhaps the most useful tool in optimization, much of it's success owed to the efficiency of the simplex method in practice --- its ability to solve problems with millions of variables with relative ease. However, whether there exists a strongly polynomial algorithm to solve linear programming remains an open question. Pivot methods, including the simplex method, remain the best hope for finding such an algorithm, despite the fact that almost all variants have been shown to require exponential time on special instances. Fundamental questions about the path length (number of iterations) of pivot methods remain unanswered. Some, such as the related Hirsch Conjecture, are famous long-standing problems in polyhedral theory. How long can a pivot path be? How many distinct degenerate solutions (bases) can appear during a simplex method cycle? How long can a finite pivot rule stall without improving the solution? Can we enumerate all possible pivot paths to optimality? Can we compute monotone disjoint pivot paths? These are some of the questions we tackle in this thesis in a quest to better understand pivot methods.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257j92f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rq58v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sm47j"><dcterms:title>Producing carbon nanotubes using the technology of DC thermal plasma torch</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Harbec, David.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are long hollow fibers made exclusively of carbon. They are generally synthesized from the dissociation of a carbon source and the co-injection of a metal catalyst. CNT interest the scientific community due to their impressive properties. They possess a high modulus of elasticity, high tensile strain, superconductor and semiconductor behaviours, high thermal conductivity and storage capabilities. These properties have been recently exploited to develop promising applications in the field of advanced materials, electronic components, and storage of gas and materials. However, the implementation process of these products is hindered due to the unavailability of large quantities of CNT and the current high cost of production. Presently, CNT are commercially produced via the arc discharge on graphite electrodes and the laser ablation of graphite. These methods yield limited production rates and represent low scale-up potential. In this work, this problem is solved by developing a new process in which CNT are produced via the dissociation of a liquid carbonaceous raw material in the water-cooled nozzle of a 100 kW DC non-transferred thermal plasma torch. The attractive aspect of this process is its scalability, since the technology of DC thermal plasma torch operating at the megawatt level is readily available. Here, tetrachloroethylene (TCE) is selected as the carbon raw material. It is preliminarily vaporized and injected into the plasma torch nozzle. The metal catalyst for the growth of CNT is provided from the erosion of the torch electrodes made of tungsten. The erosion of the electrodes generates tungsten vapours that are nucleated into catalyst nanoparticles of 10-20 nm in diameter in the plasma torch nozzle. Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) of 50 urn in length and 10-30 run in diameter are found in a graphitized coating condensed on the walls of the water-cooled torch nozzle. These MWNT are particularly grown on the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles at a temperature above the peritectic transformation of tungsten carbide (WC). This synthesis method also generates byproducts. Carbon nano-onions and nanoparticles are notably observed in the soot. CNT mass yield values are evaluated from thermogravimetry analysis and corroborated using electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. This led us to conduct a parametric study in order to determine the influence of the different operating parameters on the yields of carbon nanotubes. Low pressure, high TCE feed rate and long time of operation all enhance the yield of CNT. This parametric study and CFD modeling reveal that the formation of a supersonic jet, high vapour pressures of carbon and a control of the temperature profile within the water-cooled torch nozzle generate a rapid growth of CNT. Optimization work with the view to push the formation of CNT downstream of the torch nozzle and to synthesize thinner CNT is also exposed. In summary, the injection of the carbonaceous raw material in a hot torch nozzle prevents the condensation of a graphitized coating and enables continuous operation over several hours. Nickel and iron are injected into the plasma jet as metal catalyst. The resulting metal vapours are nucleated into small sized nanoparticles (≤ 10 nm). These successfully catalyze the synthesis of thinner CNT of ≤ 10 run in the soot collected downstream of the hot torch nozzle, some of which are SWNT of 1 nm-2.5 nm in diameter. The thermal plasma dissociation of toluene as liquid carbonaceous raw material generates hydrogen gas (H2) in the plasma jet, which sensibly reduces the formation of amorphous carbon and yields cleaner CNT.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29bb12v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sm47j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kf98b"><dcterms:title>The development of argument representation : a crosslinguistic discourse-pragmatic analysis of English and Japanese child language</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guerriero, A.

Another objective was to investigate whether a discourse-pragmatic approach could be employed to explain children's patterns of argument omission and production, developmentally and crosslinguistically. To answer these questions, referential choice in the spontaneous language of monolingual English-speaking and monolingual Japanese-speaking children and their mothers was developmentally investigated whereby a sentence argument's morphological form (null, pronominal, lexical), referential status (given, new), and syntactic location (transitive subject, transitive object, intransitive subject) were systematically analysed. The first and second studies revealed that neither the English-speaking nor the Japanese-speaking children showed sensitivity to the referential distinction between given and new information early on in development (at 21 months of age). The English-speaking children mastered English-specific referential conventions between MLU 2.00 and 3.99 (between 24 and 32 months) and employed non-linguistic pragmatic correlates to supplement unconventional argument use from as early as MLU 1.00 (between 21 and 23 months). By contrast, the Japanese-speaking children showed unconventional referential choices as late as MLU 4.00 (between 33 and 36 months), as well as inconsistent use of non-linguistic pragmatic correlates. The third study revealed that, although language-specific differences were observed, neither group of children violated any of the four Preferred Argument Structure (PAS) constraints: The children avoided using more than one new or lexical argument per transitive clause and avoided casting new or lexical arguments as transitive subjects. However, evidence of sensitivity to PAS strategies from early on in development was inconclusive because the children omitted most sentence arguments at the beginning of speech production. Finally, all three studies revealed that children's referential choices that were inconsistent with expected discourse-pragmatic principles reflected similar patterns observed in parental input. Altogether, this set of studies led to the following general conclusions regarding the learning of argument representation and distribution in syntax: (1) a discourse-pragmatic approach can explain language-universal features of argument omission and production in child language and (2) language-specific strategies are learned via parental input.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333659c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kf98b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Topic and comment.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Japanese language -- Topic and comment.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language acquisition.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20sz13p"><dcterms:title>Regulation of inflammation in cystic fibrosis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Guilbault, Claudine.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cystic fibrosis (CF) female patients have a worse prognosis compared to their male counterparts. CF patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been shown to have dysregulated cytokine profiles. Therefore, we studied the importance of sex and interleukin-10 in the susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice to pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. The results clearly demonstrate that both wildtype and interleukin-10 knockout (KO) female mice are more susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection than males, and that they mount a stronger inflammatory response in the lungs. Several animal models of CF show most of the CF symptoms; however, only a few of these display the CF lung phenotype. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr)-KO mice that we developed in collaboration with Drs. Tsui and Kent represent a unique model of spontaneously occurring lung disease. We studied the characteristics of this model and analyzed the differences between the lungs of wildtype and Cftr-KO mice by assessing their histopathological status, gene and protein expression and fatty acid profiles. We recently developed a novel non-invasive method of lung infection. The studies described contain major improvements for lung infection techniques employing P. aeruginosa bacteria embedded in agar beads. This novel and less invasive technique is crucially important in studying the host response to bacterial infection using the Cftr-KO mouse model. CF lung disease is also characterized by imbalanced lipid profiles. Interestingly, docosahexanoic acid (DHA) has been shown to have antiinflammatory properties and to reverse intestinal and pancreatic pathologies in a CF mouse model. We have therefore treated our Cftr-KO mice developing spontaneous lung disease with DHA and observed a reduction in lung inflammation in the CF-affected organs compared to the untreated Cftr-KO mice. It has also been demonstrated that ceramide is crucially important for P. aeruginosa internalization. Fenretinide is a synthetic retinoid inducing the cellular level of ceramide. Using our Cftr-KO mouse model, we tested the effect of fenretinide treatment during the course of lung infection with P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, we observed major decrease in the bacterial burden of Cftr-KO mice that were treated with fenretinide.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h8529.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sz13p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qv18v"><dcterms:title>Biased estimates in depressive realism : effects of mood, motivation, valence, response frequency and outcome density</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hanley, Neil T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Several past studies have identified that dysphoric undergraduates (those with depressed mood) sometimes give estimates of their control over outcomes closer to the actual contingency than estimates made by the nondepressed.

The present paper investigates this phenomenon with a more powerful design for comparing estimates. Experiment 1 manipulated motivation for accuracy to compare the prevalent self-serving motivational bias explanation to an information processing bias perspective. Depressive realism was found under the typical conditions, but under conditions of higher motivation for accuracy, all participants overestimated their control on the key task. Response patterns appeared to influence estimates via the proportion of exposure to different trial events. Experiment 2 confirmed an influence of response frequency on estimate bias. In Experiment 3 the depressive realism pattern was found for positively valent outcomes, but the reverse pattern occurred for negatively valent outcomes. Both those with and without depressed mood showed biased processing on some tasks. The implications for contingency processing in depressives and the general population are addressed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c4793.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qv18v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Depression, Mental.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asq87bz597"><dcterms:title>Evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences confer transcriptional regulation to the Myelin Basic Protein gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Farhadi, Hooman F.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Myelin formation is an evolutionarily late acquisition that contributes to fast conduction in vertebrate axons. Continuous bidirectional signaling is required for the acquisition and maintenance of the mature nerve fiber phenotype. Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) is a representative structural component of compact myelin that is co-ordinately regulated with other myelin protein genes, primarily at the transcriptional level. In an effort to define the regulatory network controlling MBP expression, I located and functionally characterized conserved regulatory sequences in 5' non-coding sequence. First, I identified four widely-spaced segments of preferential conservation in orthologous human-mouse genomic sequences (termed modules 1-4) that range from 0.1 to 0.4 kb. In order to compare qualitative and quantitative regulatory programs mediated by modular and inter-modular sequences, a novel in vivo transgenesis system was adopted and validated. Targeted insertions of single-copy reporter constructs at a predetermined location within the hprt locus allowed for direct inter-construct regulatory program comparisons. The proximal modules M1 and M2 confer relatively low-level expression in oligodendrocytes, primarily during early postnatal development. The upstream M3 module confers high-level oligodendrocyte expression extending throughout maturity. Furthermore, constructs devoid of M3 fail to target expression to newly myelinating oligodendrocytes in the mature CNS. High-level and continuous expression is conferred to myelinating or remyelinating Schwann cells by M4. M3 also confers expression to Schwann cells but only transiently during active myelin elaboration and only when isolated from surrounding MBP sequences. These observations define the regulatory roles played by a complex network of conserved non-coding MBP sequences and lead to a combinatorial model in which specific permutations of regulatory sequences are engaged differentially in various glial cell states. This experimental system also was shown to provide sufficient quantitative resolution to reveal the regulatory functions contributed by particular modular sub-domains and individual enhancer elements. M4 regulatory activity requires simultaneous contributions from elements located in both a core targeting as well as surrounding enhancing sub-domains with Sox10 and Krox-20 M4 binding appearing to mediate targeting and enhancer function, respectively. From this investigation, the complex network of elements and transcription factors that control expression of one important myelin gene has begun to emerge. This knowledge should lead to a deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling the overall myelination program and, ultimately, to novel therapeutic strategies effective in ameliorating the consequences of inherited or acquired demyelinating disease.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g6677.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bz597</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78th41d"><dcterms:title>Etiological factors related to gambling problems : the impact of childhood maltreatment and subsequent psychological stressors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Felsher, Jennifer R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The goal of the current research design was to determine whether childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor in the development of gambling problems.

Participants completed self-report measures on gambling and substance use problems, childhood maltreatment, psychological symptomology, stress, and resilience. Approximately 36.5% of the sample met criteria for a substance use disorder, 4.0% reported problems with gambling and substance use, and 2.1% were problem gamblers. Problem gamblers and individuals with substance related problems reported the overall highest levels of childhood maltreatment, psychological symptomology, stress, and lowest levels of resilience. Gender (being male), high stress, and childhood maltreatment accurately predicted gambling group membership (76.7%). Importance of childhood maltreatment as a risk factor in conjunction with other variables supported the hypothesis regarding the cumulative effects of adversity and was well able to predict future outcomes at 82%. No single risk factor differentiated between the problem gamblers from the problem substance users. The results of this study highlight the substantial interrelation between childhood abuse and other negative circumstances that increase the risk for general addiction group and problem gambling group membership.

At root, this conclusion is derived from an organizational perspective prevalent in contemporary academic culture theory. I argue, instead, that academic culture needs to be re-addressed to consider the complexities between its traditional boundaries and new technological pressures. My research suggests there are high levels of contestation across the full range of technologies, and that the nature of this contestation is ideological, aesthetic, and pedagogical. Furthermore, the contestation is both a product of, and is productive of, a reshaping of academic culture. Drawing on the theory of cultural production of Pierre Bourdieu, who views culture as constitutive of fairly engrained practices I demonstrate that academic culture stands as a check on institutional powers, yet it is also influenced by the integration of new technologies. This suggests that academic culture is formed and maintained by an ever-negotiated and shifting set of activities.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wv827.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236658v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Educational technology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning and scholarship.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education, Higher -- Social aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Universities and colleges.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abk128g23g"><dcterms:title>Job : la souffrance et le mal dans sa relation au divin selon Carl Gustav Jung</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Enia, Cézar.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is a critical analysis of Carl Gustav Jung's interpretation of the book of Job. It presents first the methodological approach adopted in Jung's reading of the book of Job and the epistemology at the basis of his enterprise. It then explores the biographical context of Jung's writings on the book of Job followed by the reconstruction of Jung's interpretation of it with reference not only to Antwort auf Hiob ( Answer to Job) published in 1952, but also to other writings. A series of critiques addressed to Jung's reading of the book of Job are analyzed and followed by a careful study of key concepts of Jung's psychology necessary to properly situate his understanding of the book of Job. The latter is the bulk of this study and emphasizes the relevance of the notion of the self and of the individuation process. All this provides the background for an exploration of the positive aspect of the unconscious. Doing so is necessary to put in a new light the experience of Job, and thus the suffering of the righteous or the innocent. The conclusion widens the issue concerning the reality of evil and suffering in its relation to the divine according to Jung, and it suggests some possible research topics for further examination.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c480v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128g23g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Job (Biblical figure)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Suffering -- Biblical teaching.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jung, C.

In this thesis, we investigate two important applications of them in optical integration and nonlinear frequency conversion. The work presented in this thesis is composed of two main parts. In the first part, we present a compact double-grating coupler between silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. This type of waveguide coupler has potential applications in multi-layer photonic integrated circuits. In the second part, we investigate nonlinear frequency conversion, such as second harmonic generation, in directional couplers. The double-grating coupler consists of two gratings: one acting as an outcoupler to couple the guided light from a waveguide to its radiation mode, and the other acting as an incoupler to couple the light in the radiation mode to the guided mode of another waveguide. The coupling between these two waveguides is therefore achieved. Since the coupling does not require field overlap between the guided modes of the two waveguides, the separation between the two waveguides can be large. This advantage leads to promising applications in optical integration in multi-layer photonic integrated circuits. A transfer efficiency of 29% is achieved between two SOI waveguides, and further optimization is possible by using blazed-gratings and Bragg reflectors. In the second part of this thesis, we investigate a new theory for nonlinear frequency conversion in directional couplers. As is well known, when a harmonic oscillator is driven at resonance by an external harmonic force, the largest possible oscillation amplitude is obtained. Coupled mode theory shows that similar phenomena occur when the nonlinear effect takes place in a waveguide directional coupler. We show that by considering the amplitude of the second harmonic signal in the coupled waveguides as an oscillator and the nonlinear polarization as an external harmonic force, a resonant condition can be found, resulting in highly efficient power transfer from pump to signal. Similar resonant effects also occur in other nonlinear frequency conversion effects. The proposed phenomena can also be understood by phase-matching between the supermodes of directional couplers. On one hand, the new theory has fundamental significance for nonlinear optics, on the other hand, it also demonstrates that waveguide directional couplers can be found in a new application area besides integrated optics and optical communication. We also report the first experimental observation of continuous-wave second-harmonic generation in waveguide directional couplers. We employ a GaAs/AlGaAs system and observe four resonance peaks in a ~15nm spectral range, with a maximal conversion efficiency of 1.6%W-1cm-2. This new configuration has the potential to open a new range of applications for nonlinear frequency conversion.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913v079.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xq85c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
