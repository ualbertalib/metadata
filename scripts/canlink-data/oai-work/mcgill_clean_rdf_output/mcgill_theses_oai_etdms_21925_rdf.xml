The hypotheses were that the annual species would be more productive within one growing season than red clover, that increased N levels would increase herbage dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP), that the proportion of N derived from N$ sb2$-fixation in IC-legumes would be higher than that of MC-legumes and that within intercrops there would be evidence of N transfer. In neither year was the total DM yield of red clover, MC or IC, less than the rest of the legumes. In 1991, the total DM yield of intercrops responded to 30 kg N ha$ sp{-1}$; in neither year did the estimated total CP yield of MC-legumes or intercrops respond to N levels. Only in 1992 was there evidence of N$ sb2$-fixation and the proportion of N derived from fixation by IC-legumes was 145% higher than that of MC-legumes. Only the $ sp{15}$N direct labelling method gave evidence of N transfer, to associated legume and barley plants in 1991, and to associated legume plants in 1992.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, D.

A data collection instrument (DCI) was developed to obtain clinical data from medical files in each of the Community Health Centres. Impairments rather than disabilities were described and possible causal factors were identified. Data collection took place during the month of June, 1989. Nearly 13% of Inuit children living in the Baffin area have impairments. Of this group, 15.9% have multiple impairments. The prevalence of children with sensory impairments is 49.4/1000, with neurological impairments is 28.7/1000, with systemic impairments is 30.2/1000 and with multiple impairments is 20.5/1000 children. Over 50% of the impairments reported were due to infectious diseases such as meningitis and chronic otitis media. The results of this study provide a basis for the development of community based programs which emphasize prevention of impairments in children. Recommendations for the development of appropriate rehabilitation programs are discussed in the context of the policies of the Canadian government pertaining to the needs of Aboriginal persons with disabilities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Macdougall, J.

Studies demonstrated that early inoculation of young apple plants, prior to transplanting, results in healthy and vigorous plants with better growth and nutrition than uninoculated plants. We studied the efficiency of VA-fungal species and isolates on young apple rootstocks, produced by in vitro propagation. Mycorrhizal inoculation promoted plant growth, dry mass production and leaf P concentration. Mycorrhizal efficiency was associated with larger external hyphal network but showed no relation with the internal colonization. Despite the high P-fertility of the soil used, growth enhancement due to mycorrhizal inoculation was attributed to an improved P nutrition. In a second experiment, the effect of herbicides currently used in orchards was tested on the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Paraquat, simazine and dichlobenil were applied to soil with mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal apple plants. Mycorrhizae increased herbicide toxicity in apple, as demonstrated by the greatly increased plant mortality. While both paraquat and simazine decreased spore germination in vitro, none of the herbicide treatments affected root colonization in soil. Effects on the photosynthetic rate, measured after herbicide application, indicated a physiological interaction between mycorrhizal colonization and dichlobenil, involved in the toxic response of apple plants.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Donald L.

Through the use of PCR mutagenesis, progressive deletions from the C-terminal end of IRF-1 and IRF-2 were generated; 6 IRF-1 and 8 IRF-2 deletion mutants were created to study the structure-function relationship of these two proteins. The deletion mutants were named according to the number of amino acids remaining from their N-terminal end: IRF-1 (120), IRF-1 (150), IRF-1 (170), IRF-1 (200), IRF-1 (250), IRF-1 (300); IRF-2 (100), IRF-2 (125), IRF-2 (160), IRF-2 (200), IRF-2 (240), IRF-2 (270), IRF-2 (300), IRF-2 (320). Using the Th CAT and SV$ sb{ rm O} beta$ CAT constructs as reporter genes, the transactivation potential of each deletion mutant was assayed through co-transfection studies in 293 cells. Also, transactivation potential was correlated to the ability of the various deletion mutants to bind DNA using the PRDI sequence as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Much of the transactivation potential in IRF-1 lies past the first 200 amino acids. Within this C-terminal region between amino acids 226 to 230, is a stretch of 5 consecutive acidic residues (Asp-Glu-Asp-Glu-Glu) which may be critical for transcriptional activation. Also, there are numerous potential phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region of IRF-1 which may contribute to IRF-1 activity as well. Transcriptional repression by IRF-2 is contained within the first 125 N-terminal amino acids and correlates with the ability of IRF-2 to bind DNA.

The study uses NMC data for the years 1965-89 and examines separately the positive and negative phases of the monthly mean PNA anomalies. Northern Hemisphere maps of the eddy kinetic energy, the barotropic conversion between the eddies and the monthly mean flow and the eddy vorticity forcing are presented for both PNA phases. The eddy vorticity forcing of the PNA anomalies by the eddies is presented in terms of monthly mean geopotential tendencies. It is found that the geopotential tendencies generated by the synoptic-scale eddies are spatially in phase with the PNA anomalies at the 250 hPa level. The characteristic time scale of the forcing in winter is about 6 to 10 days. The strongest anomaly in the eddy forcing is collocated with the largest amplitude PNA centre over the northern Pacific. During periods of strong PNA patterns, the synoptic-scale eddy kinetic energy and its transfer into the monthly mean flow is most important in the mean jet exits. The maxima in eddy activity and kinetic energy transfer for the positive PNA phase are situated over the eastern Pacific and are significantly greater than the corresponding maxima for the negative phase, which are located over the central Pacific.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Derome, Jacques (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh90m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698836v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526d270"><dcterms:title>Kinetics of domain growth in the presence of an external field</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lacoursière, Claude</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We study the kinetics of domain growth in deeply quenched anisotropic ferromagnets in the presence of a small external field H, using three simulation methods in two dimensions.

The inverse perimeter density evolves as $R sp2$(t,H) $ sim$ t$ sp{n}$, where n = 1 for early time and n = 2 for late time. We characterize the crossover behavior of this growth law and demonstrate that the inverse perimeter density behaves like $R sp2$(t,H) = $ alpha$(H)tf($tH sp2$) where f(x) $ to$ 1 as x $ to$ 0 and f(x) $ to$ x as x $ to$ $ infty$. We further demonstrate that the squared magnetization and the structure factor do not scale, indicating that not all lengths in the problem behave in the fashion mentioned above.

This relationship is used to calculate the NMR dose sensitivity. Practical considerations of Fricke-gelatin dosimetry, such as the spontaneous conversion of ferrous to ferric ions and the effects of oxygen and sodium chloride on the dose response, are determined. Sensitization of the dosimeter by bubbling with a nitrous oxide/oxygen gas mixture is investigated. The system is modelled assuming a multi-site fast exchange between water bound to gelatin, water bound to ions, and water in the bulk.

Changes in Eh, pH, and microbial activity are believed to alter the metal binding capacity of solid substrates (e.g., organic matter, reactive Fe and Mn oxides, and clay minerals) within the soil profile, leading to the remobilization of mercury associated with these phases. Four cores were collected along a transect from an unflooded forest soil to a pre-impoundment lake bottom sediment in the La Grande-2 (LG-2) Reservoir and watershed. The samples were sequentially extracted to determine the distribution of mercury between three operationally-defined solid compartments: organic carbon (1N NaOH-extractable), reactive Fe and Mn oxides/hydroxides (1N HCl-extractable), and the solid (clay and sulphide) residue. Results indicate that up to 80% of the mercury in the O-horizon in forest soils and flooded forest soils, and up to 85% of the mercury in lake sediments, is bound to the NaOH-extractable organic carbon fraction. In the B-horizon of a forest podzol where organic content is low, 40-60% of the total mercury was found to be associated with reactive Fe minerals. In contrast, the flooded soil contains very little reactive Fe at any depth and the associated mercury concentrations are low. I propose that, upon inundation, oxide minerals are reduced and Hg released to the pore waters where it is immediately bound to an available substrate. Analyses of the residues suggest that there is an enrichment of mercury in the residual fraction immediately above the B-horizon of a flooded soil while sulphide mineralization appears to play a role in sequestering mercury in lake sediments.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mucci, A.

At the request of a working group formed to recommend policy with respect to partner notification (PN) for HIV infection in Quebec, we examined practice and attitudes of seropositive patients and physicians. Methods. We reviewed published studies on PN for HIV and conducted interviews with seropositive patients as well as focus groups and a telephone survey with a sample of clinicians treating HIV infection. Results. Among previously undiagnosed partners notified through PN programs, seroprevalence ranged from 11% to 32%, with costs varying from 800$ to 3200 $ per new HIV diagnosis. In our study, most current partners had been contacted (interviews: 14/15 (93%); survey: 29/30 (97%)), but not previous partners (interviews: 6/39 (15%); survey: 29/200 (14%)). Many patients wanted more of their partners to be informed, but preferred to remain anonymous to these partners. Most clinicians were favorable to PN but felt they needed a clearer mandate and additional resources to do active notification beyond encouraging index patients to notify their partners. Discussion. In Quebec, PN is carried out unsystematically and is usually limited to the index patient notifying his or her current partner. Most patients and physicians would be willing to collaborate with a more systematic PN program if it were voluntary and confidential.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Remis, Robert (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634464d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh626</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tv97d"><dcterms:title>The effect of changes in bleached kraft pulp mill effluent on plasma cortisol of fish /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Downing, Gavin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a three year study, the applicability of the cortisol response to capture as a biomarker of the health of fish from areas chronically exposed to pollution was assessed.

Following a reduction of the amount of absorbable organochlorines (AOX) in the BKME, fish downstream of the mill regained their normal cortisol response to capture. The time frame for this recovery was from between 6 to 18 months. Fewer young fish downstream of the effluent provided evidence for the impact of long-term exposure to BKME at the population level.

Temperature shifts from 37$ sp circ$C to 44$ sp circ$C enhanced the synthesis of five major heat shock (or stress) proteins (HSP) of 100, 50, 42, 37, and 28 kDa. Similarly, exposure of amebae to lymphokine activated macrophages and hydrogen peroxide caused HSP expression. Heat shock caused the reversible inhibition of amebic adherence to Chinese hamster ovary cells and human colonic mucin binding to trophozoites by ${&gt;80 %}$. This was due to a decrease in the surface expression of the Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin and a marked reduction in the lectin mRNA expression. However, the presence of target Chinese hamster ovary cells during recovery at 37$ sp circ$C augmented amebic adherence. These results suggest that E. histolytica trophozoites produce a variety of HSP in response to different stimuli and can modulate the expression of the surface adherence lectin which maybe important in pathogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chadee, Kris (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s5729.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds958</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Entamoeba histolytica.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amebiasis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heat shock proteins.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c668"><dcterms:title>The effects of a human b-amyloid gene on learning and memory in transgenic mice /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tirado Santiago, Giovanni</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Brain deposition of the $ beta$-amyloid protein is an early marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Four measures of learning and performance were analyzed statistically: latency, total distance swam, mean distance to a platform, and number of trials correct in reaching a platform. Transgenic mice were impaired relative to their litter mates in spatial learning and performed better in the non-spatial task than in the spatial task in the first three measures. An age effect for transgenics was observed in the total distance measure.

The Biblical account of Samuel's life provides a paradigm for both namer and named that is informative in recognising this pattern in each of the works studied. The virtues essential to living out the call of a namer are faith and obedience; and personal fulfilment as well as heroic feats can only be achieved if those virtues are cultivated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w77x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784m63c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>McCaffrey, Anne -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kennealy-Morrison, Patricia -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tolkien, J.

Women in The Collected Works of Billy the Kid (1970) and Coming Through Slaughter (1976) are objectified: lacking the tools for self-representation, the women are framed as sites of sexuality, negativity, and darkness. In Running in the Family (1982), however, the narrator finds community with female family members, recognizing in himself the penchant for storytelling of his female relatives. Running bridges the earlier texts with the later In the Skin of a Lion (1987), where the narrator grants a more complex subjectivity to the women, empowering them with ability equal to that of men to take "responsibility for the story"(Skin 157).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>TreLearne, Brian (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv469.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b12q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ondaatje, Michael, 1943- -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct85n"><dcterms:title>Economics of the Tao : social and economic dimensions of a Taoist monastery</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Simon, Scott, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most studies of monasticism have concentrated on the religious discourse of asceticism as a withdrawal from the secular world.

The focus of the current paper is how to explain the observed occupational distribution of women across occupations. In particular, we assess the evidence put forward in support of the standard view within the economics profession--the human-capital notion of 'occupational choice'--and compare its explanatory power with a non-competitive approach to women's labour market opportunities, based on the notion of a labour market characterised by job rationing. While occupational decision-making remains ill-understood, there are several reasons for believing that the subject will become more noteworthy in coming decades, not least the rumblings of the 'comparable-worth' lobby. Our investigation points to a lack of economic research in this important area, both at the aggregate level and the level of individual occupations, and suggests that greater attention should be paid not simply to empirical validation of existing theories of occupational decision-making, but also that more detailed scrutiny might be given to the few results which are available. We argue that 'discrimination' is still a powerful force within the labour market, and that women's sudden access to non-traditional occupations owes far more to shortages of men in individual markets than is typically acknowledged.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903088t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp858</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women -- Employment</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967460r"><dcterms:title>Feminist practice and the problem of "objectivity" : techniques of observation for communications studies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Johnson, Stacey</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis examines the problems of the "observer" and "objectivity." I review Thomas Kuhn's concept of "paradigm shift" in order to access wider debates in the history and philosophy of science concerning epistemological development. I argue against traditional notions of "objectivity" and "rationality" that proceed to "naturalize" the binary opposition between the natural sciences and other intellectual pursuits. To make this argument I draw from feminist critics of science, including Sandra Harding, Evelyn Fox Keller, and Donna Haraway, who reconsider more palpable conceptions of "objectivity" and "rationality" for a feminist science project. Jonathan Crary's revisionist, and non-linear approach to a history of vision and the modern observer suggests that feminist critiques of science represent an epistemological shift imperfectly constituted in the nineteenth century. In conclusion, I analyze Donna Haraway's multi-dimensional approach to cultural, and feminist theory as a visual metaphor that resonates with the nineteenth-century technology of the stereoscope.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burnett, Ron (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537205k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967460r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Objectivity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminist theory</dc:subject><dc:subject>Observation (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Communication -- Methodology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977v803"><dcterms:title>Intention and interpretation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hoyer, Steven</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is in two chapters. Chapter one is about intentions. Literary theorists have, by and large, dismissed their relevance to interpretation, so it will be useful to consider what exactly is being ignored. Therefore, I devote chapter one to a clarification of the nature and role(s) of intention within the interlocking network of basic propositional attitudes. I argue that intentions incorporate both a functional and a representational dimension, triggering actional mechanisms and structuring the process of practical reasoning. Chapter two is about interpretation. I open the chapter with an examination of extreme conventionalist theses, arguing that their success depends on an unjustifiably strict demarcation between intentionality and textuality. Appropriating aspects of Donald Davidson's work in the philosophy of language, I argue for the recognition of linguistic communication as a form of intentional action. I then defend this thesis against more moderate conventionalist theories to offer a viable approach to the interpretation of literary works.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Livingston, Paisley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm44v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977v803</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Intentionalism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085m052"><dcterms:title>Expectations, experience and life choices : analyzing the aspirations of Cree women in Chisasibi, James Bay</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jacobs, Susan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis studies how Native women make life choices and set goals for themselves, and what influences those choices.

Cree women's descriptions and perceptions of their own lives, in their own words, forms the basis of the framework used here to analyze women's comments on their aspirations, expectations and obligations.

Two more conditions were present in the study: materials in draft (MID) and no treatment (NT). The NT condition consisted of students who were tested without exposure to the instructional materials. The instruction that was formatively evaluated was a six-page article describing the relationship between diet and cancer. The article was written by chemistry professors for an "undergraduate chemistry course for non-science students". Undergraduates (n = 187) provided the effectiveness data. They randomly received one of the four formatively evaluated versions of the article, read the article, answered questions on an objective test, and indicated their confidence with respect to their responses. Professional revisors (n = 8) provided cost data. Each revisor provided cost estimates for all formative evaluation conditions. Efficiency was provided by combining effectiveness with cost data. Effectiveness differences were found between the MID and RLD, and the MID and RBD. The mean test scores, as well as the mean confidence-weighed test scores, of both RLD and RBD were significantly higher than those of the MID. Cost differences indicated three levels of cost. RND was the least costly formative evaluation condition. RLD and RED were equivalent in cost and more costly than RND. RBD was the most costly formative evaluation condition. With respect to efficiency, RLD was recommended. RLD was the least costly condition that was significantly more effective than MID.

Both work were written in a "pre-feminist" period in the history of German women writers. However, with the aid of contemporary feminist approaches, they can be rediscovered and deciphered for the modern reader. In the first chapter I will introduce the theories to be applied, the biography of her author and the reception of the work, focusing on areas relevant to the topic of the thesis. The recurring themes of spatial isolation and speechlessness will then be analysed in terms of form and content. Through the observation of physical spaces and their psychological implications, and through the investigation of a new form of verbal expression and freedom, a process of writing continuity ("Fortschreibung") emerges from Haushofer's world. In the related characters of two women figures, Annette in Die Tapetentur and the unnamed heroine in Die Mansarde, Marlen Haushofer establishes a line of development in her work. At the end of her literary career, she succeeds in delivering to the reader her encoded version of the liberation of women from their fettered, hopeless existence.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goldsmith-Reber, Trudis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww68b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892b699</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Haushofer, Marlen, 1920-1970.
