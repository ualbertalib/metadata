Estrogen and progesterone receptors were detected exclusively in the nuclei of epithelial and stromal cells of the endometrium. Their highest levels in both components were found during the late proliferative phase of the normal menstrual cycle. Estrogen receptors decreased faster in the stroma than in the epithelium throughout the post ovulatory phase, whereas progesterone receptors decreased more rapidly in the epithelium during the mid and late secretory phases. Estrogen and progesterone receptor levels were high in the epithelium of hyperplasia without cytologic atypia. They were low in the epithelium of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (hyperplasia with cytologic atypia) and the majority of invasive carcinomas. The stroma contained relatively high estrogen and progesterone receptors levels, irrespective of whether the epithelium was hyperplastic or neoplastic.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vk680.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634437h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859g373"><dcterms:title>Effects of devaluation in a small open economy with application to Jamaica</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thomas, Desmond</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation advances a model which assumes extreme openness characterised by the absence of nontradables. The pivotal relative price is the real wage which is of central importance in the analysis of devaluation. The model incorporates a simple supply function on the basis that the supply response to a devaluation cannot be taken for granted because of structural factors and unstable expectations characteristic of the transitional period following a devaluation. The effects of devaluation depend on a combination of factors among which are highlighted capitalists' expectations of future stability and the constraints on disabsorption. Our analysis underlines the need for financial assistance to sustain the adjustments associated with devaluation episodes. An econometric application of this model to Jamaica finds devaluation to be adverse both with respect to output growth and the trade balance.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p066.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g373</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Foreign exchange -- Jamaica.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Devaluation of currency -- Jamaica</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jamaica -- Economic conditions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g576q"><dcterms:title>Body image and sexuality in surgically menopausal women</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bellerose, Satyā B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Negative effects of oophorectomy (castration, or removal of the ovaries) on a woman's sexual functioning, mood and body image have been documented in previous studies, but these studies did not measure vaginal blood flow and often did not include a non-surgical control group. Five groups of women aged 35 to 55 years were studied, a non-surgical control group (CTL), a hysterectomy-only group (TAH, at least one ovary intact) and three oophorectomy groups: an untreated group (BSO), women on estrogen-replacement therapy (ERT) and women on androgen-estrogen replacement therapy (HRT). The interview/questionnaire assessed mood, body image and sexual functioning (sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, interpersonal sexual activities). In a second session completed by 58 and 129 subjects (45%), a vaginal photoplethysmograph measured vaginal blood flow in response to an erotic stimulus while subjects concurrently monitored subjective arousal. Overall, the BSO and ERT groups had significantly lower self-reported desire and arousal. Body image as measured by a new scale, 'body comfort', was significantly poorer in the BSO group. The hysterectomy groups had more sexual problems than the control group. Further, about a third of the CTL group reported positive changes in body image and sexuality in the previous 5 years. This effect was attenuated in the TAH, HRT and ERT groups and almost absent in the BSO group. No significant group differences were obtained however, on mood, or vaginal blood flow and subjective arousal to an erotic stimulus. Vaginal blood flow and subjective arousal were significantly correlated. The possibility that these findings may be due to differential levels of testosterone in the various groups is discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t702m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g576q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Menopause.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Sexual behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body image.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp363"><dcterms:title>Social classes and Social Credit in Alberta</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bell, Edward</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The centrist theory of the lower middle class is widely used to explain the Social Credit movement in Alberta.

However, the application of the theory to the Alberta movement is shown to be problematic for several reasons. Those offering this explanation do not back up their claims with evidence. Empirical analyses of the provincial elections of 1935 and 1940 present findings which are at odds with the conventional interpretation. A review of the Social Credit philosophy and the party's first term of office also reveals that the standard class analysis has some serious shortcomings.

This study examined the uniform presence of immense symbiotic bacterial populations of four of these species: Hippospongia lachne, Spongia barbara, S. cheiris and S. graminea. The nutritional characteristics and antibiotic sensitivities of bacteria isolated from the four species were also examined. A combined light and transmission electron microscopic investigation outlined the reproductive processes and larval development, behaviour, settlement and metamorphosis in these four species. Symbiotic bacteria in these four sponge species are specific to the sponges and different from ambient seawater bacteria. Populations of intercellular bacteria within the tissues of these sponges are greater than those of ambient seawater. A variety of morphologically different types of sponge specific bacteria were observed. The symbionts are not fastidious organism but utilize a variety of amino acids, carbohydrates and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates as sole carbon and energy sources for growth. The bacteria showed sensitivities to a variety of antibiotics but were not susceptible to fluid from the sponges. These sponges are viviparous and probably dioecious. Egg production and larval development are localized in patches or "nurseries" of endosomal tissue. Statistical analyses of specific morphological characteristics of female reproductive elements have identified four specific stages in the process of oogenesis. Umbilici connect young and maturing embryos to the maternal mesohyl and are the pathway for extracellular transfer of intercellular symbiotic bacteria and other mesohyl substances. These bacteria were observed in the embryos and larvae of all four species. Oocytes and embryos develop asynchronously within a given individual. Spermatogenesis occurs synchronously within cysts by transformation of entire choanocyte chambers. Cysts develop asynchronously within an individual. Male gametes exhibit a bright yellow-white autofluorescence when excited with blue light (460-485 nm). Spermatozoa do not possess intermediate segments or acrosomes. The incubated parenchymella larvae of these four species are ovoid with dark grey pigmentation and enlarged posterior regions encircled by a black pigmented ring of cells bearing long cilia. Laboratory behavioural studies indicate that free-swimming larvae display directional swimming with constant rotation and negative phototaxis. Larval behaviour probably reflects the ecological situation of adult populations. Larval settlement occurs 26-56 hours after release and involves the rapid formation of a basal lamella between the larvae and substrate. There is no evidence of substrate selection or orientation by larvae. Precocious development of choanocytes does not occur in the larvae or post-larvae of these four species.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j1662.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c115x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Symbiosis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Demospongiae -- Caribbean Sea.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bacteria -- Caribbean Area -- Ecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sponges -- Caribbean Sea -- Reproduction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agh93h0216"><dcterms:title>Modelling polymorphism with categories</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1988</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lamarche, François, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this work we describe a category of domains, whose objects are in general categories instead of posets, such that J.-Y. Girard's category of qualitative domains and stable functions is contained in it as a full subcategory. We describe two ways of interpreting Martin-Lof type theory in this category, the first one allowing $ Sigma$ and $ Pi$, the second one only $ Pi$. Finally we show how to extend the second interpretation to a model of the theory of constructions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n8698.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h0216</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
