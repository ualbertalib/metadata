In the first study, a go/no-go discrimination learning task developed by Newman, Widom, and Nathan (1985) was used to investigate the effects of reward and response costs on the ability of ADHD and normal children to learn to respond to some stimuli and inhibit responding to others. Children were tested on four conditions involving different combinations of rewards and response costs. ADHD children showed poorer inhibitory control compared to control children across the four conditions, implicating a generalized inhibitory deficit. Study 2 assessed the psychophysiological responses of ADHD and control children to reward and the termination of reward during a repetitive motor task. Based on Gray's (1982, 1987a, 1987b) psychobiological model, Fowles (1980, 1988) suggested that heart rate increases during reward are reflective of activity in Gray's hypothesized behavioral activation system, while skin conductance increases when reward is removed are reflective of activity in his behavioral inhibition system. Compared to control children, ADHD children failed to show the expected increase in skin conductance during extinction, implicating a deficit in their behavioral inhibition system. In addition, ADHD children showed faster heart rate habituation to reward which, together with other evidence discussed, suggests that they also have behavioral activation abnormalities. This, the findings from the two studies provide strong evidence that ADHD children have both generalized inhibitory deficits and an abnormal response to rewards which, in some situations, may exacerbate their poor inhibition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Douglas, Virginia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw01w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd33z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afq977w62c"><dcterms:title>Organometallic-type reactions in aqueous media : the issue of regio-, chemo- and stereoselectivity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Isaac, Methvin B.

Despite the efficiency with which indium mediates carbon-carbon bond formation between allyl halides and aldehydes in an aqueous environment, it is not without short-comings. Nitro-functionalised aldehydes were found to be susceptible to the reductive conditions of this aqueous indium Barbier-Type reaction. In this connection, bismuth was found to chemoselectively mediate the coupling of allyl halides with aldehydes in water in the presence of tetrabutylammonium halides. The indium Barbier reaction in an aqueous medium was extended to include propargylic bromides. The coupling of aldehydes with propargylic bromides gave regioselectively either the homopropargyl alcohol or the $ alpha$-allenic alcohol depending on the $ gamma$-substituent of the propargylic bromides. The regio- and stereochemical course of the indium-promoted coupling of $ gamma$-substituted allylic halides with aldoses (water soluble carbohydrates) has been investigated. The stereoselective generation of two new contiguous stereogenic centres has been applied to the synthesis of novel 2-substituted carbohydrates. The stereoselectivity of the reaction was explained on the basis of chelation of the allyl indium species with the $ alpha$-hydroxycarbonyl function. This gives syn selectivity for the $ rm C gamma$-$ rm C beta$ diol function in the product. The relative stereochemistry of the $ rm C beta$-$ rm C alpha$ linkage in the product is governed by the preferred geometry of the allyl indium species.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chan, Tak Hang (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th07j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977w62c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Organic.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967518z"><dcterms:title>Representing the Canadian North : stories of gender, race, and nation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hulan, Renée.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis addresses the teleological relationship between national identity and national consciousness in the specific definition of Canada as a northern nation by giving a descriptive account of representative texts in which the north figures as a central theme, including: ethnography, travel writing, autobiography, adventure stories, poetry, and novels.

Rate measurements for the oxidation of the low carbon steel during reheating in a walking-beam steel reheat furnace were also carried out. Scaling rates during reheating were predicted from oxidation rates obtained in the laboratory. In-situ characterization of the phase compositions of the iron oxides, "scale", that form on low carbon steels during their oxidation at elevated temperatures was carried out using a neutron diffraction technique. Growths in the intensities of the diffraction peaks associated with characteristic crystal planes of the various oxides (Fe$ rm sb{x}$O, Fe$ rm sb3O sb4$ and Fe$ rm sb2O sb3)$ were monitored on-line. The volume fractions of the oxides in the developing scale were calculated on the basis of ideal structure factors and measured relative intensities of diffraction peaks. Oxidation in binary gas mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen in the temperature range from 1000 to 1250$ sp circ$C was carried out. Sample weight gain versus time data were analyzed, along with measurements and calculations of sample heating rates due to exothermic reactions at the sample surface. It was found that initial rates of oxidation depended on oxygen content in the gas mixture and that these rates were linear up to oxide thicknesses between 0.4 and 0.5 mm. The linear rates of oxidation were found to be controlled by the mass transport of oxygen from the gas phase, to the reaction surface, through a gas boundary layer. Subsequent oxidation rates followed a parabolic oxidation mechanism. Oxidation experiments were also carried out in binary, ternary and quaternary gas mixtures of O$ rm sb2, CO sb2, H sb2O$ and N$ sb2$ at various temperatures. Reaction rates during oxidation in binary gas mixtures of CO$ sb2$-N$ sb2$ and H$ sb2$O-N$ sb2$ followed a linear rate law and were found to be proportional to the partial pressures of CO$ sb2$ and H$ sb2$O in the gas mixtures. The oxidation rates showed a strong dependency on temperature. Oxidation in oxygen containing atmospheres showed that the main oxidizing agent was free O$ sb2.$ Additions of CO$ sb2$ and H$ sb2$O had little effect on the magnitude of oxidation rates. Oxidation in these atmospheres exhibited an initial linear rate law which gradually transformed to a parabolic rate law. During reheating in a walking-beam steel reheat furnace, it was observed that scaling rates can be reduced by lowering input air/fuel ratios to the furnace, which resulted in lowering concentrations of free oxygen in the combustion products from about 3% to about 1.5%. The predicted scaling rates during reheating using isothermal oxidation rate constants suggested that rates of oxidation during reheating in the industrial reheat furnace followed a combination of linear and parabolic rate laws, with the components of the linear oxidation rates being predominant. The observed reduction in scaling rates was a result of the decrease in the free oxygen within the furnace atmosphere.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R. T. L.

The overall aim was to find out how brain function is suppressed when metabolism is greatly reduced by the lack of oxygen or glucose, or by cyanide applications, and therefore to provide some insights in the cellular mechanisms underlying these depressant effects. Experiments were carried out on hippocampal slices kept submerged and constantly superfused with oxygenated saline at 33-34$ sp circ$C. Energy deprivation was produced by either removal of oxygen or glucose, or applying cyanide. Extra-/intracellular and whole-cell patch recordings (both in current- and voltage-clamp mode) were used to assess synaptic function and postsynaptic properties. A most interesting phenomenon is the reversible suppression of neuronal function that occurs in the very early phase of energy deprivation. Adenosine receptor antagonists reversibly reduce this suppression. In contrast, neither glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K$ sp+$ channels, nor a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor prevents the suppression of neuronal activity induced by energy deprivation. The depressant effect acts selectively on excitatory synapses, since in the presence of excitatory receptor antagonists, anoxia causes only a small reduction of monosynaptic inhibitory responses. Also adenosine antagonists, but not the K$ rm sb{ATP}$ channel blocker, reversibly attenuate anoxia- and cyanide-induced post-synaptic hyperpolarizations. Furthermore, under normoxic conditions, ongoing adenosine release exerts an inhibitory tone on excitatory synapses but not on inhibitory synapses. The effects of ongoing adenosine release are mainly on synapses, since after blockade of transmitter actions, ongoing adenosine release has no detectable effect on membrane conductance. The evidence presented in this thesis shows that increased adenosine release induced by energy deprivation is a major cause of the reversible loss of synaptic transmission and fall in membrane resistance, and therefore indicates a mechanism by which adenosine release contributes to the reversal depression of neuronal activity seen during energy deprivation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Krnjevic, K.

Following the administration of a receptor saturating dose of EGF, there was a rapid internalization of receptor coincident with its tyrosine phosphorylation. In the endosome, the adaptor protein SHC was recruited to and tyrosine phosphorylated by the EGF receptor. GRB2 and the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, was primarily associated with the EGF receptor in endosomes. This is believed to contribute to a cytosolic pool of a complex of tyrosine phosphorylated SHC-GRB2/SOS. The activation of these molecules lead to the initiation of the mitogenic Ras-MAPK cascade as assessed by mobility shifts of Raf-1 and MAPK by SDS-PAGE. This culminated in the increase in mRNA levels for the early response genes, c-fos, c-jun, c-myc. Upon internalization into the endosome, insulin dissociates from its receptor and is rapidly degraded. The role of the endosomal acidic insulinase (Authier et al., 1994) in the regulation of signaling from the insulin receptor was investigated using an insulin analog, H2, which binds more tightly to the insulin receptor and was less susceptible to endosomal degradation. In response to H2 stimulation, the level of receptor phosphorylation at the plasma membrane was lower than that in response to insulin. While the insulin-activated receptor became partially dephosphorylated upon internalization, the H2-activated receptor maintained its state of phosphorylation. Insulin stimulation resulted in a higher level of IRS-1 phosphorylation than H2 stimulation, but here was no observable SHC or Ras-MAPK cascade activation in response to either of these ligands. However, H2 stimulation resulted in an increase in the mRNA levels of c-jun and c-myc transcripts. The kinetics and extent of internalization of the receptor were the same in response to both ligands, however, in the endosomal fraction, a transient accumulation of the H2-stimulated receptor was observed. These findings demonstrate specificity of signaling from the mitogenic EGF receptor and the metabolic insulin receptor tyrosine kinases and support the hypothesis that signaling and the regulation of signaling from these receptors can take place at the level of the endosome in rat liver in vivo.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bergeron, John J.

The intrusive rocks consist of leucocratic and melanocratic peralkaline granites. The occurrence of plastically deformed melanocratic xenoliths in the leucogranite and vice versa indicate that the two granite types were intruded coevally. The stock is extensively altered, especially in the north. Early alteration is manifested by the replacement of arfvedsonite with aegirine. Later alteration involved an exchange of calcium for sodium. Zr, Ti, Y, REE, Nb, Be are concentrated in Ca-bearing minerals that, together with quartz, commonly pseudomorph Na-bearing minerals. Hematite typically coats the rare-metal enriched minerals. Pseudomorph outlines are frequently delineated by trains of fluid inclusions.

The method is based on generating a graphical model of the system using Petri nets and simulating that model to obtain the required performance measures. The collected performance indexes are then analyzed to determine the functionality of the modeled system. The method we present is a hybrid implementation of two very powerful strategies, namely: Petri nets and object-oriented programming. The Petri net model is used to generate precise graphical representations that can model such aspects as synchronization, parallelism, control flow, and data flow. Furthermore, we will emphasize the capabilities of Petri nets to provide a model that can be easily evaluated using event-driven object-oriented simulations. The simulation environment is based on the object-oriented capabilities of C++ (a super set of C) which provides an excellent tool for evaluating and analyzing Petri net models. The simulator utilizes the concepts of class hierarchies, application-specific instance variables, application-specific instance methods, and object interactions that are typical of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. The simulator is capable of producing all the required information for calculating the performance measures of the system. It contains a dedicated scheduler and debugger, and can perform with a polynomial (of the second order) time complexity. The method is mainly used for performance evaluation purposes in the areas of systems design and synthesis.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr41c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064706v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h20n"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of a laminincollagen receptor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tawil, Nabil Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Carbonetto, Turner and coworkers have isolated a monoclonal antibody (Mab 3A3; Turner et al., 1989) which selectively inhibits neurite outgrowth by PC-12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, on laminin and collagen.

Finally, protein microsequencing data of the N-terminus of the 185 kDa protein shows that it is homologous to the $ alpha$ subunit of VLA-1 of the integrin family. Together these results suggest that the Mab 3A3 recognizes a laminin/collagen integrin receptor and this integrin is $ alpha sb1 beta sb1$.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644s77x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h20n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mg72p"><dcterms:title>Light and electron microscope localization of 3H-dexamethasone 21-mesylate in adult rat testicular leydig cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stalker, Alison</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The distribution of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the rat testis was examined in vivo using (3H)-dexamethasone 21-mesylate (DM) which binds covalently to GR.

In this thesis, we investigate a multi-path algorithm proposed by Gallager (GALL77) which, given continuously differentiable link flows, has been proven to generate "optimal" routes in a quasi-static environment. However, the performance of the algorithm in a realistic environment has not been established. We show that the Count-to-Infinity problem is inherent in this algorithm and we describe a method of dealing with it. Employing two separate approximations for network flow gradients, we compare its performance to that of a single-path algorithm (using a network simulator based on the ARPANET). We establish the fact that Gallager's algorithm can achieve significantly better results in networks which are not failure prone and are not too large.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b669.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591952b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52j928g"><dcterms:title>The effects of cyclosporine on T cell maturation and clonal elimination in syngeneic bone marrow chimeras /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sanders, Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Under some circumstances CsA induces autoimmune phenomena.

The AKR, C57BR, CBA/J, C57B1/6 and SJL mouse strains were resistant to disease induction. We studied the effects of CsA on T cell maturation and clonal deletion in rats and mice. We found (as have others) that in the thymus CsA partially blocks the generation of mature-type T cells. In the periphery, we observed the transient appearance of an unusual population of CD4+CD8+ T cells. The T cells of CsA-treated mice of several strains, including diseased DBA/2 mice, showed a normal pattern of clonal deletion when analyzed for expression of TcR Vbeta6 and Vbeta17. Disease could be prevented in rats and mice by injecting normal spleen cells. We postulate that CsA causes autoimmune disease by altering a population of suppressor cells, rather than by blocking clonal deletion.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m7776.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j928g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88ch84k"><dcterms:title>Performance analysis of an integrated axial microfilter-fermentor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schnell, André D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel fermentation unit comprising an axial microfilter for cell retention was evaluated for continuous-flow aerobic cultivations of a yeast, bacterium and fungus.

A viscous extracellular polymer solution was also tested. Yeast (S. cerevisiae) and bacterial (E. coli) cell concentrations were enhanced by as much as 16-fold and 8-fold over ordinary batch growth, respectively. Concomitant filtration rates were stable over operating times of up to 130 h, and thus were independent of cell concentration. System performance for fungal (A. niger) cultivations was less satisfactory because of progressively declining filtration rates. The highest flux of cell-free filtrate for each culture type was achieved using a 0.45 micron membrane microfilter. However, filtration rates were limited by thin hydraulically resistant layers of microbial deposits which formed during yeast and bacterial broth filtration or by a surface growth in the case of fungal cultivations.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w8561.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch84k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jp93q"><dcterms:title>L'écriture minimaliste; suivi de Journée programmée</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roy, Alain</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This master's thesis in creative writing is divided into two parts.

Furthermore, it represents one of two poles by which we can evaluate all literature.

As a solution to this problem, this work explores the use of weighted random patterns (WRP) to reduce, by orders of magnitude, the test application time in self-testing circuits. Much work has been done on the off-line development of compact test sets, but a problem which still remains is how to efficiently apply them on-chip. A means of transforming a given test set into a relatively short weighted sequence and pseudorandom sequence, whose cumulative fault coverages approximate that guaranteed by the original test set, is proposed. The single weight set is formulated using a method which does not explicitly consider the circuit structure. Instead, sufficient circuit information contained in the given test set can be extracted using simulation techniques. This is done by analyzing a random pattern detection profile and isolating the vectors which cover faults difficult to detect using random patterns. After extracting the useful bits from these vectors, a weight set characteristic of the corresponding faults is estimated as the ratio of 1's to 0's at each bit (input) position. The generation scheme is evaluated using five large scannable circuits. A local approach to on-chip pattern generation is examined.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w37638145.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr27b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arr171z301"><dcterms:title>Synoptic scale ice-atmosphere interaction off the east coast of Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nazarenko, Dennis Matthew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Seasonal ice cover off Canada's east coast was examined in relation to synoptic scale atmospheric events.

Atmospheric variability was monitored using the 850 hPa height at three upper air stations along the western edge of the study region. Additional information was drawn from storm track records, providing an indication of surface variability. Properties of specific storm events were obtained from the storm track data, permitting evaluation of the ice response to passing synoptic disturbances. Results of this investigation indicate that, (1) passive microwave-derived ice information can be used to monitor high frequency variability in the marginal ice, (2) despite short time series, spectral relationships between ice concentration variability and 850 hPa pressure height indicate a strong association between the two at synoptic frequencies zone, and (3) variability in ice cover extent and concentration can be related to the passage of individual synoptic events.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731514n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171z301</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sea ice -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Synoptic climatology</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nj28k"><dcterms:title>Household headship and the nutritional status of children in western Kenya</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Onyango, Adelheid Werimo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines how income, household division of power and maternal decision-making ability influence dietary intake and child morbidity.

Information on household and maternal characteristics, morbidity, dietary intake and anthropometry was gathered between July and November 1988. Household headship was found to have no significant or direct influence on children's nutritional status. Total income was higher in female-headed households. While women in male-headed households had greater financial responsibility for household maintenance, female heads of household assumed more farming responsibilities but had higher remittances from husbands. A measure of maternal differentiation was generated by principal components analysis, constituted mainly by schooling, language ability, nutrition knowledge and information seeking behaviour. Differentiation had a strong impact in lowering morbidity and was a significant predictor of greater dietary diversity and weaning practices that supported better child nutrition and growth.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kp35c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj28k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children -- Nutrition -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heads of households -- Kenya.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nutrition -- Kenya.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w8579"><dcterms:title>From humanistic education to critical humanism : the dialectics of theory and praxis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nemiroff, Greta Hofmann, 1937-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis articulates the philosophy of The New School of Dawson College, an alternative pre-university Arts programme in a community college in Montreal.

The thesis focuses, however, on the dialectical relationship between theory and praxis in the development of educational philosophy. It describes the process by which various elements to be found in the works of these educational philosophers are tested by and integrated into the pedagogy of the school, contributing to its educational philosophy of Critical Humanism.

The strata have been intruded by abundant dykes, a felsic pluton, and satellite intrusions of an Alaskan-type ultramafite. Volcaniclastic rocks range from basic to felsic compositions and were deposited by several pyroclastic flows which originated subaerially and flowed into water. Igneous rocks are believed to have been comagmatic and differentiated by fractional crystallization. Major and trace element discrimination diagrams indicate an island arc tectonic setting.

The development of new media technologies changes into existing media systems, and profoundly influences economies which are increasingly dependent upon information services. Japan's case is particularly interesting. Relatively little is known about its DBS policy compared to other industrialized countries, even though Japan has already begun to operate DBS under its own version of the "information society", the Kodo Johoka Shakai (Highly Advanced Information Society). The formulation of DBS policy is related to many factors, including space development, research and development, broadcasting, international telecommunications regulations and economic competition both in international and domestic markets.
