The cDNA coding for a recombinant fusion protein of IGF 1I and SDF-1 was synthesized by PCR and inserted into a commercial non-lytic insect cell expression system. The successful production of the recombinant protein in the culture medium of insect cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid was monitored using HPLC. Purified protein was characterized by following 3H-thymidine incorporation into bovine fetal liver cells for the identification of IGF II and using Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the identification of SDF-1. A modified IGF II-SDF 1 chimera, which included a N-glycosylation site, was also successfully produced by insect cells. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins had molecular masses of 17.6 kDa and 14.5 kDa, respectively. The recovery of the glycosylated protein was higher than that obtained with the non-glycosylated form after purification by heparin affinity chromatography, a property that could be an advantage for the large scale production of the protein. Finally, three additional cDNAs were successfully generated and cloned into insect cell expression vectors. Two of them encoded the glycosylated-and non glycosylated forms of the chimera incorporating a Kozak sequence to improve translation efficiency. The third cDNA encoded a chimera of IGF II and a soluble form of the HIV-binding protein CD4, a potential inhibitor of HIV infection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Congote, L. F.

Evolutionary biologists use quantitative genetics to model variation in traits related to fitness and, ultimately, to make predictions about the impact of natural selection on populations. However, there are few cases in which quantitative genetics has been used to predict changes in natural populations, and only two cases in which it has been used to predict a correlated response to natural selection. I use a quantitative genetic model to predict the correlated response to natural selection in geographically distinct wild populations of the wing dimorphic sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. Three populations of G. firmus that naturally vary in proportion macroptery are used to qualitatively assess, for the first time, predictions from a quantitative genetic model postulating that an increase in proportion macroptery is correlated with a decrease in fecundity. Variation observed among the populations when raised in a common garden supports predictions and demonstrates that a difference in mean fecundity is the result of a response in fecundity within wing morphs in addition to a change in the proportion of macropterous females. My results indicate that the complexity behind evolutionary changes in traits genetically correlated with proportion macroptery can be modeled through quantitative genetics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fairbairn, Daphne (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Roff, Derek (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967553j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s32w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gryllus -- Morphology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gryllus -- Evolution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quantitative genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524jq572"><dcterms:title>The diagnosis of depression in advanced HIV disease /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Montoro, Richard.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Diagnosing major depression in the medically ill is difficult because of the overlap of somatic symptoms between the two entities. No studies have examined this issue in advanced HIV disease. Methods. Male subjects with a CD4 count â‰¤200 were recruited from a specialised outpatient HIV treatment centre. They completed a 30 minute questionnaire and then participated in a diagnostic interview with an HIV psychiatrist. Results. Eight (19.0%) of 42 subjects were diagnosed with major depression. Both inclusive and exclusive approaches to the diagnosis increased the prevalence to 21.4%. Predictive items on the self-report depression scales were inserted in a logistic regression. Four items pertaining to self-worth, discouragement, crying and irritability were left in the model. All somatic items were excluded. Conclusion. This study is an important first step in devising a self-report instrument that would be useful in detecting clinical depression in patients with advanced HIV disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>du Fort, Guillaume Galbaud (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b5190.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jq572</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Clinical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0k225c84t"><dcterms:title>NK cell-mediated lysis of human autologous oligodendrocytes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morse, Rachel H.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity and requirements for natural killer (NK) cells to induce cytotoxicity of autologous human adult central nervous system derived oligodendrocytes (OLs) as measured by cytotoxicity assays (51Cr release). Levels of cytotoxicity directed at either heterologous OLs or U251 glioma cell targets correlated with progressive enrichment for NK cells and were dependent on exposure of the NK cells to IL-2. We found that the IL-2 treated enriched NK cell preparations were capable of mediating significant cytotoxicity of autologous OLs. These results suggest IL-2 activated NK cells can induce autologous OL injury, bypassing putative protective effects of self-MHC class I molecules. The inflammatory milieu in MS lesions could provide conditions required for NK cell activation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Antel, Jack P.

The irregular shape of individual tumors, however, often requires custom made shielding in order to geometrically shape the radiation field to the target, while minimizing the dose to surrounding tissues. In many institutions, low melting alloy or lead cutouts are used for electron beam shaping. In this work, electron dosimetry beam parameters such as percentage depth dose (PDD), outputs, and beam profiles, were measured with ten different electron beams from two linear accelerators. The dependence of beam characteristics on field size and shape, particularly for small cutouts, was investigated. In addition, this project examined different methods for measuring electron PDDs, including film densitometry, ion chambers, and diode dosimetry. The work presented here demonstrates that the depth dose effect is significant when one of the field dimensions of the cutout is less than R p, the practical range of electrons. For these cutouts, it was observed that both PDD and outputs vary significantly due to the lack of lateral electronic equilibrium. As the cutout becomes smaller, the depth of dose maximum (dmax) shifts towards the surface, while the output at dmax decreases. Therefore, it is crucial that PDDs and outputs are either measured or calculated for small field electron cutouts used in the clinical setting.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, Michael (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Olivares, Marina (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b520r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7414</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956h75z"><dcterms:title>Abuse, psychopathology, and attachment styles in women with persistent human papillomavirus and squamous intraepithelial lesions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lambrinos, Angela.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Screening for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), known to be a precursor of Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (SIL), involves an expensive Polymerase Chain Reaction technique.

Since the beginning of the "Special Period in Time of Peace", brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, Cubans have engaged in many forms of urban agriculture (UA) to cope with the food crisis affecting the Island. In Havana, the popular garden movement occupies 8% of total urban land in agriculture (3.4% of urban land) and is practiced by 18,000 gardeners who produce vegetables and fruit, and raise small livestock to increase food security and generate income. The purpose of this study was to provide estimates of the user benefits of UA, as well as qualitative and quantitative information related do this activity. The contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to elicit users' willingness to pay (WTP) for the land they use, that is currently provided at no charge by the stale. The average WTP was estimated at 23.5 pesos/1000 m2/month under current conditions and 34.4 pesos/1000 m2/month with improvements in water and anti-theft services. These amounts represent about 11% and 14% of monthly household income, respectively. Aggregate WTP for popular gardens in the city of Havana was estimated to be 6.88 million pesos/year (344,000 $US) and 10.07 million pesos/year (503,500 $US) with the proposed improvements. The study has produced important results that give an indication of the use and non-use value of UA for gardeners of Havana. Results also suggest that CVM is a non-market valuation technique that can be successfully applied in Cuba, and can provide information to be integrated in cast-benefit analysis frameworks that assess the importance of UA.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henning, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn35v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c009w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Urban agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Cuba.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Contingent valuation -- Cuba.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tb29c"><dcterms:title>Effect of organic amendments on soil atmosphere</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hossain, Mohamed Sarwar.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gaseous movement in soil varies with soil's physicochemical properties and biochemical oxygen demand.

Raw cow manure was then added to the sandy soil at four different rates 0, 20,40, and 80 Mg/ha. Depletion of soil oxygen and changes of carbon dioxide and ammonia for different concentrations were compared against the control. The oxygen depletion or carbon dioxide and ammonia accumulation reached the highest level at initial 16 hour followed by gradual reversal to a steady state. A significant amount of oxygen depletion was noticed with the different concentration levels. Oxygen depletion had shown an oscillatory behavior towards zero. Among different concentrations that of 40 Mg/ha showed the highest oscillatory behavior, but the shortest time was required to recover its original oxygen level. Thus the 40 Mg/ha application of organic matter is seems to be the optimum level for sandy soil.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barrington, Suzelle (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q8112.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb29c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Manures.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Soil air.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c450w"><dcterms:title>Assessing the economic feasibility of a carbon tax on energy inputs in Ontario's pulp and paper industry : an econometric analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>He, Miaofen, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Knowledge of price responsiveness of energy is important for designing effective price-based controls to curb the GHG emissions in Canada.

ERRgamma is closely related to the other ERR family members. ERRalpha and ERRbeta. ERRgamma binds to both an ERR response element (ERRE) and an estrogen response element (ERE) and displays constitutive transcriptional activity which is enhanced when ERRgamma is fused to the VP16 activation domain. ERRalpha, ERRbeta, and ERRgamma heterodimerize both on an ERE and in solution in absence of DNA. This may allow for a more versatile mode of gene regulation. Furthermore, the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERRgamma interacts with coactivators and corepressors in vitro. Expression of ERRgamma in mouse embryogenesis starts at 7.5 until 10.5 day stage and is observed in the ventricular zones of the brain and the spinal cord. This suggests a role for ERRgamma in the developing nervous system. Although ERRgamma is more closely related to ERRbeta than ERRalpha, the expression pattern of ERRgamma is similar to ERRalpha and distinct to ERRbeta, suggesting a unique role for ERRgamma in development.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Giguere, Vincent (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rg323.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9675553</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289k86d"><dcterms:title>Human hexosaminidases : databases and modelling analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cordeiro, Paulo.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of recessive disorders, which lead to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neuronal cells.

Specimens were collected at primary study sites between 1996--2000, by sweeping, malaise traps and pan traps. In order to establish species distributions in eastern grasslands, Agromyzidae were also obtained from other surveys in southern Ontario grasslands. Over 850 specimens were identified from 49 species (15 genera) from the Manitoba sites. The most diverse genera were Liriomyza (10 species) and Cerodontha (8 species), and the latter genus was the most abundant, primarily because of two dominant species: C. superciliosa and C. inconspicua. The zoogeographic distribution of tallgrass prairie agromyzids is dominated by Nearctic and Holarctic species, suggesting that many of the species are generalists. Species shared with eastern grasslands are primarily widespread Nearctic species. Twenty-eight percent of the species show grassland affinities; further investigation is required to confirm the distribution and habitat preference of these species.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wheeler, T.

The present work demonstrates how in some cases different manipulations of the same raw data, corresponding to different commonly used methodologies, produce discordant results. Midsagittal CC area was measured from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 137 young normal volunteers. Three strategies intended to normalize for average differences in brain size between the sexes, as well as five different normalization variables, were contrasted and evaluated. The stereotaxic method normalizes for inter-subject differences in overall brain size by scaling MRIs into a standardized space. The ratio method uses one of five different indices of brain size and divides it into CC area. The covariate method uses one of these indices as a covariate in statistical analyses. Male subjects show significantly larger absolute total area, as well as anterior third and posterior midbody. However, in 2 of 3 normalization strategies, namely the stereotaxic and ratio methods, females show relatively larger total area, anterior midbody and splenium. The covariate method did not show any significant differences at the .05 level. Results suggest that different approaches to normalization and analysis are not necessarily equivalent and interchangeable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zatorre, Robert J.

Furthermore, lake-resident Arctic charr are frequently infected with larvae of the cestode, Diphyllobothrium dendriticum. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of toxaphene exposure on Arctic charr growth, nutritional quality, physiology, and susceptibility to infections of D. dendriticum. A preliminary experiment found no effect of toxaphene on charr visceral organ and fat weights, plasma Vitamin A and E and plasma cortisol, although dominance hierarchies within groups may have masked treatment effects. For the main experiment, hatchery-reared Arctic charr were subjected to one of four treatments: (i) a single oral dose of corn oil (control); (ii) a single oral dose of 10 mug/g wet weight toxaphene dissolved in corn oil; (iii) exposure to 15 larval D. dendriticum; and (iv) a combination of both.

The implementation of such systems raises several regulatory issues: after a brief explanation of the technical characteristics of different satellite systems in the first chapter, the second chapter will introduce the principles of space law relevant to satellite communications, with particular attention to the provisions which the development of global satellite telecommunication system could infringe. In the third chapter, there will be place for further analysis of international regulations established in the framework of the International Telecommunication Union and the World Trade Organisation, dealing more specifically with satellite telecommunications. The discipline established by the former organisation aims to the optimal management of the orbit and spectrum resources, particularly controversial because of the divergence of interests and exigencies of the member countries, whereas the latter intervened in the liberalisation of the telecommunication services, with the purpose to create an open environment for their diffusion. Furthermore, telecommunication activities are subjected to national regulation. The domestic discipline pertaining to global mobile satellite telecommunication services will be analysed in the fourth chapter, with particular attention to the U.S. Federal Communication Commission regulations and to the developments of Italian legislation in the light of the recent European initiatives in the field. National authorisation requirement conditions, in spite of the international effort toward regulatory harmonisation and liberalisation, are the key elements in the deployment of global mobile telecommunications services.

The 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees does not list 'gender' as one of the persecution grounds that entitle a person to seek refuge. In attempting to solve this apparent dilemma, the 'membership of a particular social group' category was long considered to be the appropriate assessment framework. While nowadays the other four enumerated Convention grounds---race, religion, nationality, and political opinion---have increasingly received regard, the approach to gender-based persecution has so far been neither systematic, nor consistent. Moreover, the most critical interpretative hurdles continue to arise in the context of the 'membership of a particular social group' category, This study therefore examines the link between the two concepts of gender-based persecution and the 'membership of a particular social group' category. For this purpose, both concepts are first considered independently (Parts II and III). Following this, the larger part of the analysis is assigned to the examination of the international case law concerning gender-based claims (Part IV) which shall determine if and how gender-based persecution can appropriately be accommodated under the 'membership of a particular social group' category,</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leuprecht, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns810.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v460</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sex discrimination against women -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Legal status, laws, etc.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women refugees -- Legal status, laws, etc.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v8382364"><dcterms:title>The role of the state in the privatization of telecommunications : a comparison between British Telecom and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Stoytcheva, Bistra.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis contains an analysis of the role of the state in the privatization of two of the world's largest telecommunications operators, British Telecom (BT) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), illustrated by a comparative examination of the different means of intervention of the state at the three stages of the process, and the impact that state intervention has on the corporate governance of the enterprises concerned. Chapter 1 clarifies the notions of privatization and control. The subsequent chapters are organized on the basis of the percentage of shares held by the state. Chapter 2 analyzes the legal problems accompanying "complete control" of the state during the corporatization stage of privatization, in which there is a one-man stock company with the state as sole shareholder. Chapter 3 outlines the different private and public law devices used by the state in order to exercise "internal control" on the company after the sale of part or all of the government-owned ordinary shares. Chapter 4 focuses on the "external control" which is the last weapon of the state to monitor enterprises that are already deemed to be "privatized" from an ownership point of view.

Case law, academic commentaries and gender guidelines now recognize that women may constitute a particular social group under the definition of refugee. However, only those who belong to certain subgroups of women are usually granted asylum because being a woman only is considered too broad to comprise a particular social group. Such restrictive interpretation is theoretically and practically problematic, and it is the primary cause for the inconsistency in the interpretation of the definition of a particular social group and refugee determination in gender-based claims. Through an analysis of recent gender-based cases before the Canadian courts and the Immigration and Refugee Board, this paper argues that this inconsistency will be avoided when categorization of women does not require female claimants to prove characteristics other than their gender. Female refugees who are persecuted for being women do not need to provide additional reasons for their suffering, and this broad categorization of women should be consistently applied in Canada.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Colleen (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3657080.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719p057</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women refugees -- Government policy -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women refugees -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pp89f"><dcterms:title>The regulation of global mobile personal communications by satellite : a comparative analysis of regulations, policy and perspectives in the European Union, in particular Germany, and the United States</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cloppenburg, JÃ¼rgen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses the current regulatory regimes in the European Union---in particular Germany---and the United States governing the authorization of global mobile personal communications by satellite (GMPCS). Current satellite licensing regimes fail to take into account the international character of satellite telecommunications. The reliance on a national public interest standard does not properly address the interests of the community of states, industry and consumers and is not suitable to meet the aspirations of international space law. The international harmonization of frequencies and international standardization are indispensable for the introduction of these new services. The establishment of an international communications regulator with the power to adopt binding decisions if required is the most suitable way to address these problems. However, the development of an international public interest standard with clear policy objectives will be hard to achieve. With regard to the different aspects of ground segment licensing, a gradual approach is the best way to balance the different interests and concerns in this field. The International Telecommunications Union GMPCS MoU and the development of European regulations show a feasible way to achieve a regulatory regime that facilitates the introduction of these new services. Lighter regulations, possibly the introduction of one stop shopping procedures, mutual recognition of licenses and the introduction of general authorizations are measures that can and should be taken at the international level. The interdependence of earth and space segment licensing may lead to the understanding that some aspects of earth segment licensing should also be regulated at international level. The question will be whether States, industry and users are able to reconcile their interests and the sometimes opposing trends of international cooperation and international competition for the benefit of "all mankind".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jakhu, Ram S.
