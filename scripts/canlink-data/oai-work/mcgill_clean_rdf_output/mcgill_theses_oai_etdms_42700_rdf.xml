Differentially expressed genes were identified by the differential display technique, cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP). To distinguish between caterpillar-specific responses and general wound responses, a subset of plants was mechanically damaged. Furthermore, to identify responses to salivary elicitors, plants were subject to herbivory by caterpillars with normal salivary secretions and those that had their spinneret, the appendage through which labial saliva is secreted, cauterized shut. Eighteen differentially expressed gene fragments, representing 16 genes, were identified. The expression pattern of 5 of these genes was analyzed by Northern analysis, confirming a caterpillar-specific reduction in transcripts encoding rubisco activase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This research shows that plants are able to differentiate between caterpillar herbivory and mechanical damage and that transcriptional response are initiated within one hour after caterpillar infestation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wv81z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vn176</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medicago truncatula -- Diseases and pests.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spodoptera.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687n49h"><dcterms:title>Genomic and functional studies of SERTAD3, an oncogenic protein of the SERTAD family of transcription factors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Darwish, Hanni.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gene amplification alters gene expression and can promote oncogenesis. In particular, the amplification of chromosome 19q13.1-13.2 has been found in several cancers and is known to contain the AKT2 oncogene. Two members of the SERTAD gene family of transcription factors, SERTAD1 and SERTAD3, are also located within this region. We report herein the genomic structure, regulation, and functions of SERTAD3. This gene has two transcript variants with short mRNA half-lives, and one of the variants is tightly regulated throughout G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Overexpression of SERTAD3 induces cell transformation in vitro and tumor formation in mice, while inhibition of SERTAD3 by siRNA results in a 2-4 fold reduction in cell growth rate. Furthermore, luciferase assays based on E2F-1 binding indicate that SERTAD3 increases the activity of E2F, which can be strongly reduced by siRNA inhibition of SERTAD3. Together, our data support that SERTAD3 contributes to oncogenesis at least in part via an E2F-dependent mechanism.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712mc10n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687n49h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pf77b"><dcterms:title>Friction studies using multi-tip arrays</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>David, Jonathan, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In an attempt to understand how surface contacts affect friction, and to bridge the gap between single contact and large scale friction studies, silicon and PDMS multi-tip arrays were produced in the McGill Microfabrication Facility.

In this study, fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were measured in a cattail-dominated marsh in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) revealed that the marsh was an annual sink of 264 g C m-2, and that growing season net CO2 fluxes were strongly correlated with vegetation biomass and leaf area index. Fluxes of CH4 were measured from water, soil and plants using closed chambers and resulted in a net annual area-weighted emission from the marsh of 206 g C m-2. Consequently, the net (CO2 + CH4) annual carbon (C) balance of this wetland corresponded to a sink of 58 g C m-2. A simple radiative forcing model based on the marsh CO 2 and CH4 emission patterns suggests that, despite the net carbon uptake, this wetland is contributing to atmospheric warming because of the large CH4 efflux. Future potential climate impacts of this marsh were evaluated using different emission scenarios that could result in response to climatic or environmental changes. Overall, short-term impacts are driven by CH4 emission rate, while the CO2 flux determines the impacts on longer time horizons. Uncertainties in predicting future wetland GHG balance arise from uncertain feedbacks and responses. Future alterations of the marsh GHG emission and uptake patterns resulting from land use or climatic changes could lead to a shift in the marsh C balance, showing the importance of wetland ecosystems in national and global C budgets and GHG-related political decisions.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jt01t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z709195z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atmospheric methane -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Marshes -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon cycle (Biogeochemistry) -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apg15bk205"><dcterms:title>A case of scientific fraud? : a statistical approach</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bohossian, Nora.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In 1986 Thereza Imanishi-Kari, then an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was at the peak of her career. She had just coauthored a paper in the prestigious journal Cell with David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate. Their research was exciting and their findings promising. Margot O'Toole, Imanishi-Kari's postdoctoral fellow at the time, was unable to reproduce some of the experimental results published in the paper and could not resolve this with her postdoctoral supervisor. Subsequently, O'Toole became convinced that there were serious errors in the paper and, shortly afterwards, the National Institutes of Health began officially investigating the questions she raised about it. It may have been simply a character clash between Imanishi-Kari and O'Toole but partly due to the involvement of a figure such as Baltimore, this clash possibly ruined their careers, took 10 years to settle down, cost millions of dollars of public money, polarized the scientific community, and went down in history as one of the most widely followed cases of scientific fraud. Based on statistical, forensic and other evidence, Imanishi-Kari was found guilty of scientific misconduct and banned from receiving public funding for 10 years. This was not the end of the matter, however, because Imanishi-Kari appealed the decision and was later exonerated. In this thesis, we tell the statistical story by putting forward the statistical arguments that were used against Imanishi-Kari and the counterarguments to them.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gm65r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bk205</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214t43k"><dcterms:title>Biodiversity and activity of microbial mat communities from Canadian high Arctic ice shelf ecosystems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bottos, Eric.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Microbial mats exist in freshwater pools atop the Ward Hunt and Markham ice shelves in the Canadian high Arctic.

The roving flux tower measuring system of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada was used to make continuous measurements of N2O fluxes in an edible pea field in Western Quebec in 2003-04 and then in an alfalfa-timothy forage field in Eastern Ontario in 2004-05. The experiment was designed to capture, at the field scale, the expected large N2O emissions occurring as a result of fertilizer application for a year, in relation to both large precipitation events and spring thaw. Growing season N2O emissions averaged 0.5 to 5 mg N2 O-N m-2 d-1 with peaks following snow melt (between 5 and 8 mg N2O-N m-2 d-1) and manure applications (8 to 37 mg N2O-N m-2 d -1). Although generally small (&lt;0.25 mg N2O-N m -2 d-1), emissions were detectable during the fall and winter, indicating the importance of including them in annual emission totals. The measurements were used to verify the performance of the simulation model DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition) in estimating N2O emissions from legumes and in response to dairy manure application. Sensitivity tests were also carried out in which baseline input values were modified. Results suggest that the current model version (DNDC8.9) requires further modification prior to application for estimating greenhouse gas emissions in national accounting systems.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gc46n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x806p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Manure -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Legumes -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Legumes -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atmospheric nitrous oxide -- Measurement.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Manure -- Environmental aspects -- Ontario.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m8301"><dcterms:title>Windowed direct exponential curve resolution quantification of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with applications to amniotic fluid metabonomics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Botros, Lucy L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a quantitative protocol of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) that allows the determination of human amniotic fluid metabolite concentrations, which are then used in a metabonomic study to establish patient health during gestation. 1H NMR free inductive decays (FIDs) of 258 human amniotic fluid samples from a 500MHz spectrometer are acquired. Quantitative analyses methods in both the frequency- and time-domain are carried out and compared. Frequency-domain analysis is accomplished by integration of the metabolite peaks before and after the inclusion of a known standard addition of alanine. Time-domain analysis is accomplished by the direct exponential curve resolution algorithm (DECRA). Both techniques are assessed by applications to calibration biological solutions and a simulated data set. The DECRA method proves to be a more accurate and precise route for quantitative analysis, and is included in the developed protocol. Well-defined peaks of various components are visible in the frequency-domain 1H NMR spectra, including lactate, alanine, acetate, citrate, choline, glycine, and glucose. All are quantified with the proposed protocol. Statistical t-test and notched box and whisker plots are used to compare means of metabolite concentrations for diabetic and normal patients. Glucose, glycine, and choline are all found to correlate with gestational diabetes mellitus early in gestation. With further development, time-domain quantitative 1H NMR has potential to become a robust diagnostic tool for gestational health.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/028711298.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m8301</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av692tb53q"><dcterms:title>Development of a method for the LCMS determination of vicinal diketones in beer</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bioresource Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Blanchette, Maxime.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>No existent analytical method allowed the determination of the vicinal diketones (VDK), 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl) and 2,3-pentanedione, by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

A method allowing the determination of the amino acids (AA) related to the formation of VDK during fermentation was also developed. VDK were derivatized with o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) to form quinoxaline compounds. The reaction of VDK with OPDA was studied to optimize reaction time. Conversion of the diacetyl precursor, alpha-acetolactate, was tested using multiple oxidative decarboxylation techniques. Attempts were also made to determine simultaneously the AA, leucine, isoleucine and valine with the VDK. Simultaneous determination was unsuitable for the AA levels found in beer fermentation and separate methods for the determination of AA were developed. Total VDK were measured over a concentration range of 10 mug/L to 10 mg/L with less than 10% variation. These analytical methods were tested using a laboratory scale experiment to assess the impact of fermentation temperature on total VDK production and AA absorption. Samples collected in a local brewery were analyzed for total VDK using the developed method.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720j06j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692tb53q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Beer -- Analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ketones.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liquid chromatography.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mass spectrometry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33s166f"><dcterms:title>Sub-surface hydrology and vegetation drivers at macrotidal Bay of Fundy salt marshes : implications for future restoration</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Byers, Stacey.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There is a growing interest to restore Bay of Fundy salt marshes diked for agriculture. Marshes recovering for several decades from storm-breached dikes can serve as analogues for restored marshes. In this study I examine factors driving sub-surface hydrology and vegetation at recovering and reference Bay of Fundy salt marshes. In Fundy marshes, groundwater at channel edges is insensitive to tidal flooding (&lt;10 cm change in depth) and deep draw-downs (40-100 cm) occur. Sub-surface hydrology here differs from organogenic, microtidal marshes due to low saturated hydraulic conductivity, infrequent flooding of marsh interiors, and larger hydraulic gradients imposed at channel edges. By calculating marsh elevation at dike-breach and considering Spartina alterniflora's vertical range, it is apparent that salt marsh vegetation could establish when dikes breached. Multivariate analysis indicates that reference and restored/recovering sites should have similar sizes and tidal ranges. These criteria introduce problems as Fundy dikelands are more extensive than marshes not targeted for agriculture and tidal range increases exponentially up-Bay.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848v59q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s166f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Salt marshes -- Fundy, Bay of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wetland hydrology -- Fundy, Bay of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wetland restoration -- Fundy, Bay of.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gj170"><dcterms:title>Suburban typologies : historical examples and alternatives</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Flynn, Michael Sean.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is an inquiry into the evolution of the North American suburb by way of review of notable historical precedents of various types of suburban developments. A precept of this thesis is that the current, dominant form of urbanization is of a suburban nature, characterized by vast areas of low-density, single-use, disjointed compartments of daily life; that suburbanization has become the physical de-construction of community; and that suburbanization at its most extreme is ultimately deleterious to a healthy society and environmentally unsustainable. The suburban environment is far from the desired ideal and in fact is an aberration. Given our seemingly innate desire for the ideal of a "home within a garden," and through the inquiry into the successes and failures of past planned suburbs, it is hoped that a better understanding and a melding of the ideal and an equitable reality can be obtained, promoting a healthy, vibrant sense of community that is environmentally sustainable. The examples of planned suburban precedents that are examined include industrial towns, railroad and streetcar suburbs, as well as pre- and post-war automobile suburbs. Also there is some examination of utopian and alternative planning theories as well as contemporary examples of successful planned communities. All of which provide a greater understanding of the principles that must be applied to address the issues of our future urbanization process, which will likely be of a suburban nature. It is hoped that through this inquiry into successful suburban precedents, that a clearer understanding can be achieved of how to more closely attain the individual ideal of a home within a garden, while balancing the collective needs of a community and sustainability, within an inherently chaotic, free-market process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692tb540.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gj170</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Suburbs -- North America -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Suburbs -- Design and construction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajh343x00j"><dcterms:title>The productive house : autonomy, integration &amp; diversity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kongshaug, Rune.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cities evolve in a rhizome-like fashion interconnected nodes accelerating the flow of information, rate of innovation, and the accumulation of wealth, but also making apparent new inequalities and informal economies.

Successful prevention campaigns in the 1980s had the immediate impact of lowering the rate of HIV infection among gay men, and anti-retroviral drug therapies in the mid-1990s have literally brought thousands of gay men back from the brink. However, by the middle to late 1990s, epidemiological and anecdotal evidence has strongly suggested that gay men have begun to move away from the safer sex orthodoxy of the 1980s. Forty gay men ranging in age from 21 to 55 were interviewed for this study in order to determine if they have changed their approach to safer sex strategies implemented in the mid-1980s. In contrast to approaches to risk behaviour that emphasize the Health Belief Model, with its focus on the rational individual, this dissertation focused on the social contexts that shape gay men's decisions. This study found a number of factors that influenced gay men's sexual choices, including age and the changing role of community. Younger gay men, those who have come of age during the 1990s, have taken a different approach to the AIDS epidemic. None of the younger participants in this study had lost anyone to HIV. Furthermore, they were now part of a group of men who no longer considers a HIV diagnosis to be immediately fatal. New medications have definitely shifted their approach to AIDS. Finally, this group of gay men no longer feels defined by a gay community like older gay men interviewed for this study. They believe they are coming of age in a time and place where they have more choices in how they will define themselves as gay men. For older gay men, those who lost many lovers, friends, and acquaintances during the HIV epidemic, changes in gay men's sexual risk-taking are both surprising and inevitable. These men are dealing with issues of ageism, loss and lack of visibility in a changing gay community. Although there are different age-related arguments for abandoning safer sex strategies, this study helps to explain why there is a definite shift in risk-taking behavior underway as we enter the third decade of HIV/AIDS. It suggests new challenges and approaches for AIDS service organizations to deal with a substantive change in gay men's sexual behaviour.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z233r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117t066</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Risk-taking (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Safe sex in AIDS prevention.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gay men -- Sexual behavior.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azw12z937g"><dcterms:title>On distance measurement methods for turbo codes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ould Cheikh Mouhamedou, Youssouf.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>New digital communication applications, such as multimedia, require very powerful error correcting codes that deliver low error rates while operating at low to moderate ratios (SNRs). Turbo codes have reasonable complexity and can achieve very low error rates if a proper interleaver design is in place. The use of well-designed interleavers result in very low error rates, especially for medium to long interleavers where turbo codes offer the greatest potential for achieving high minimum distance (d min) values. The reliable determination of a code's error performance at very low error rates using simulations may take months or may not be practical at all. However, the knowledge of dmin and its multiplicities can be used to estimate the error rates at high SNR. This thesis is concerned with efficient and accurate distance measurement methods for turbo codes. Since high values of dmin can be caused by high input weight values, say up to 20 or higher, if a brute force algorithm is used the accurate determination of dmin requires that all possible input sequences of input weight up to 20 be tested. Testing all possible input sequences becomes impractical as the size of the interleaver and the value of input weight increase. Thus, the accurate determination of the distance spectrum, or at least dmin and its multiplicities, is a significant problem, especially for interleavers that yield high dmin. Based on Garello's true distance measurement method, this thesis presents an efficient and accurate distance measurement method for single- and double-binary turbo codes that uses proper trellis termination such as dual-termination or tail-biting. This method is applied to determine the distance spectra for the digital video broadcasting with return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS) standard double-binary turbo codes. It is also used to design new interleavers for DVB-RCS that yield a significant improvement in error performance compared to those in the standard. This method fits particularly well with tail-biting turbo codes that use structured interleavers. This is because the distance properties repeat and this method can use this knowledge to reduce the search space. The reduction in search space results in significant reduction in complexity (i.e., execution time), which allows the determination of high dmin values in reasonable time. This efficiency is demonstrated for both single- and double-binary turbo codes, using structured interleavers that have high dmin values for various code rates. This method reduces the execution tunes by a factor of 40 to 400.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd473153h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z937g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fn377"><dcterms:title>Écrire à partir de la fin : Georges Bernanos et le roman de combat</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ouellette, Julie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>"Books are books, and can suffer the same fate as men. They too can be killed in battle," wrote Georges Bernanos in Francais, si vous saviez. Bernanos' work thus demands to be read through the optic of his battle against the modern spirit. If the polemical focus is clear in his political writings, criticism of his work has never fully recognized its deployment throughout his novels. It is therefore when Bernanosian fiction renounces any expression of its intention, eluding any dimension of rhetoric---when it is dramatically demobilized---that it is meant to be its most scandalous. What is the mission of fiction in the Bernanosian project? Based on the tools of reconciled rhetoric of figures and argumentation, the aim of this work is to re-examine the Bernanosian triple paradox of "convincing of the obvious without using words those who share his beliefs" which generates the tension of his project of writing from the end; that is to say finding a language worthy of Christian truth, a language so "true" and so "transparent" that it could be capable of immediate conversion of souls. To fully understand the place of battle in Bernanosian writing, the notion of the end as a creative principle is examined through three main themes: the preludes to the end of time (eschatology), the final struggle for the end (agony) and the end results of writing (aim). Writing from the end fundamentally implies a return to the origins. The focus of this study will be to demonstrate that the Bernanosian project, through a return to the source of spiritual authority and a re-examination of asceticism, is a central part of the vast enterprise of reappropriation of language defining French literature after the armistice. The search for this language capable not of convincing but of conquering is mainly studied through the voices the author gives his characters who are simple in heart and soul: to his heroes who are "strangers to a certain fencing with language," locked in a perpetual battle with words. The analysis of these heroes' discourse in this "slow tongue" attempts to determine the exact, though improbable, degree to which their babbling voices carry a weight of authority.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354k54g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fn377</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bernanos, Georges, 1888-1948 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583z027g"><dcterms:title>Visions of vitalism : medicine, philosophy and the soul in nineteenth century France</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Normandin, Sebastien.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Vitalism is an underappreciated and often misunderstood idea. This thesis seeks to explore the historical origins and meanings of vitalism in 19th century France; tracing the transition from medical vitalism in the Montpellier School in the late 18th and early 19th century to a largely philosophical vitalism in the late 19th century, emblemized by Henri Bergson. I argue that the decline of medical vitalism was brought about by the rise of scientific medicine, the experimentalism of physiologists like Claude Bernard and the growing influence of positivism in late 19th century France. I see the seminal moment of this transition from a metaphysical to a scientific world-view in the materialism-spiritualism controversy of the 1850s, which was sparked by the development of modern biology and the experimental life sciences. Despite its general disappearance from mainstream medicine and science, vitalism continued to have echoes in a number of fields in the 20th century, and remains a concept relevant to our contemporary circumstances.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913v05r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583z027g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medicine -- France -- History -- 19th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vitalism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967778t"><dcterms:title>The evolution of functional diversity in tree seedlings /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marks, Christian O.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation examined the participation of eight lower-achieving readers in two intermediate-level elementary classrooms (one fourth- and one fifth-grade) during group discussions about literary texts. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the extent to which lower-achieving readers (defined as students who had persistent struggles to attain minimum scores on state, district, and classroom assessments in reading) displayed discourse features that indicated the students' high-level thinking during heterogeneous and homogeneous (by reading level) discussions about literary texts. Several characteristics of discourse indicate high-level thinking, including but not limited to: generalizations, analyses, speculations, affective responses, inter-textual connections, and elaborated explanations. A secondary purpose was to describe what happened when lower-achieving readers, their peers, and teachers engaged in group discussions about text. A multiple case study design was used in this investigation. Data were collected between October 2005 and May 2006. Data sources included: field notes collected from participant observation, transcripts and indices of student and teacher interviews, transcripts and indices of audiotaped and videotaped discussions and reading lessons, and students' writing assignments and other artifacts. Multiple strategies were used to analyze the data, including analytic induction and descriptive statistical techniques. A discourse analysis coding scheme was used to determine the extent to which lower-achieving readers likely used high-level thinking about literary texts during group discussions. The findings revealed focal students used the discourse of discussion as a tool to comprehend text in two ways. The students used the discourse about texts as intellectual scaffolds for their own thinking and transformation in understanding of the texts. In addition, the discussions created authentic opportunities for students to explore reading comprehension strategies (e.g., meanings of new words, visualizing the story). This means students drew on their knowledge of comprehension strategies and incorporated them into their discussions to reason about the texts without explicit instruction from the teacher. Focal students both evoked and heard others refer to and talk about the comprehension strategies during discussions. Moreover, an important contextual foundation of the discussions that seemed to relate to the focal students' thoughtful responses, or those that suggested the students went beyond recalling the literal details of the stories, was the use of the discourse to problem-solve about the meaning of the texts. Finally, in respect to the students' writing assignments that often followed the discussions about the texts, lower-achieving readers made use of the ideas of the discussions in their writing. Regarding high-level thinking during discussions, the lower-achieving readers' discourse suggested that they thought in high-level ways about texts during discussions, and that they thought in high-level ways to the same extent or nearly the same extent as their peers did in the same discussions about texts. The one major difference in their talk about texts related to the instances of elaborated explanations or instances when students stated a position and explained their thoughts about the position with more than one reason or with evidence from the text. Higher-achieving readers produced significantly more 'elaborated explanations' during discussions than the lower-achieving readers in this study. From a theoretical perspective, this investigation extends our understanding of lower-achieving readers' use of discursive practices that influence thinking and reasoning about text. From pedagogical perspectives, the findings suggest teachers might need to understand ways to encourage a kind of discourse that elicits genuine problem-solving about the meanings of text. Likewise, teachers might need to understand the discourse features that indicate high-level thinking to model and discuss the features in their work with lower-achieving readers during discussions about literary texts.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/765375366.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967778t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Trees -- Seedlings.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Ecology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trees -- Variation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w405t"><dcterms:title>An experimental and analytical investigation of the nonlinear behaviour and modal analysis of a structurally nonlinear, two-dimensional airfoil in subsonic flow /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marsden, Catharine Chauvin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Modal testing is often employed in the determination of natural frequencies and damping levels in aircraft structures. In aircraft flutter testing, potentially dangerous flight regimes are avoided by obtaining modal frequency and damping values at airspeeds well below the flutter speed and extrapolating the data to estimate the airspeed at which the onset of flutter instabilities is expected to occur. In the modal analysis, the structure is typically assumed to be linear and the parameters to be time-invariant. Nonlinearities in aeroelastic systems can arise from both structural and aerodynamic sources and may initiate aeroelastic instabilities both above and below the flutter speed predicted by linear theory. Typical nonlinear responses include limit cycle oscillations and in some cases, chaotic response. For aeroelastic systems containing even small nonlinearities, the nonlinear frequency response curve may be distorted, and this distortion can contribute to errors in the values of frequency and damping obtained during modal testing. The current study includes an analytical and an experimental investigation into the modal testing of a nonlinear aeroelastic system. In the case of aeroelastic systems containing limited structural nonlinearities, the nonlinearity, although it changes the system frequency and damping values and distorts the transfer function, does not substantially affect the critical flutter speed. For this reason, the nonlinearity behaves a little like "noise" in that it prevents accurate values of frequency and damping from being obtained during the modal test. One solution to this problem is to separate the linear and nonlinear portions of the frequency response using spectral decomposition methods. In the analytical portion of this study, a specific spectral decomposition technique is tested on numerical data, and the results show that the technique may be used to separate the linear and nonlinear portions of the transfer function obtained from the nonlinear aeroelastic system response to a random forcing input. In the experimental portion of the study, subsonic wind tunnel experiments are performed on a two degree-of-freedom wing section with a freeplay-type nonlinearity in the pitching degree-of-freedom. The experiments demonstrate the effect of the freeplay on the aeroelastic response, including the presence of limit cycle flutter for specific parameter combinations. The effects of variations in both freeplay length and frequency ratio of the underlying linear system are examined for both the damped and the limit cycle response. Time histories of the damped response are used to estimate frequency and damping values, and to predict critical flutter speeds. The amplitude and frequency of the LCO response is presented for three different freeplay lengths and five frequency ratios. The experimental setup is modeled analytically, and the equations solved numerically to obtain time-history data for the free response of the airfoil to initial displacements in each of its two degrees-of-freedom. The results are used to validate the mathematical model of the aeroelastic system subject to subsonic flow. Numerical results are obtained for the transient behaviour of the system including the damped and limit cycle responses observed during the experimental portion of the study. The model is used to demonstrate the influence of frictional forces on the response of the experimental system. In conclusion, three additional techniques of nonlinear dynamical analysis are investigated for their potential within the context of the nonlinear aeroelastic modal analysis problem. Two of the methods are tested on the experimental time-history data, while the third is shown to be applicable to the simulated data for the forced response of the system.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354k55r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w405t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712mc14r"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of liquefaction potential of mine tailings using elastic wave velocity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mantegh, Afshin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The extensive damages resulting from static liquefaction re-emphasized the need for reliable criteria in predicting the possible development of this phenomenon. This research presents and evaluates elastic wave velocities in determining the boundary between contractive or dilative tailing materials in the laboratory. The effects of factors such as strain rate, confining pressure and fine contents on liquefaction potential of tailings are also discussed. To achieve the above objectives, an experimental investigation of the behavior of undrained tailings at confining pressures ranging from 25 to 280 kPa and under two strain rates of 0.5 and 1 mm/min was carried out using a modified Wykeham Farrance triaxial apparatus. As part of this research, a bender element system consisting of piezo-ceramic transducers placed in the loading head and base pedestal of the triaxial cell, a control box and software to generate and receive signals were developed. The system was employed to measure shear and compressive wave velocities (Vs and Vp) during both consolidation and ultimate steady state. These elastic wave velocity measurements were used to develop relationships between void ratio (e), mean effective normal stress (P') and elastic wave velocities. After consolidation, the specimens were loaded in shear under constant strain rates to determine their ultimate steady state at large strains. The analysis of the results obtained from this research shows limited strain softening response (limited liquefaction) in fine and medium-grained tailings whereas coarse-grained tailings illustrate a strain hardening response or dilative behavior. Shear wave velocities measured during the consolidation stage show better correlation with the ones obtained from the relationships, particularly in fine and medium-grained tailings. This is due to the fact that pore water may affect compressive wave velocity measurements and cause errors in the P wave measurements. An increase in strain rate in fine-grained tailing does not increase contractiveness, but rather does exactly the opposite. In other words, higher strain rates are associated with higher stability for fine-grained tailings. This is in contrast with the effect of high strain rates on coarse and medium-grained tailings. The membrane effect as well as vibration induced by high strain rates and low volume compressibility in coarse-grained tailings may explain the lower liquefaction resistance in medium and coarse-grained tailings under high strain rates. It should be noted that the instability region becomes larger as confining pressures increase showing more liquefaction potential under higher confining pressures.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b539s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mc14r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aws859k83t"><dcterms:title>Wrestling with angels : T.

Following an introduction which discusses the nature of their relationship as well as their basic theological positions, Chapter One examines their postconversion criticism, and particularly their stance on what is typically formulated as "the problem of belief in poetry," which focuses on how ideology influences a work's creation and reception. Chapter Two considers their transitional poetry, wherein their new religious beliefs figure prominently and their anxiety over the potential conflict between artistic and spiritual values is most acute. Chapter Three looks at their major postconversion poems and specifically at how Eliot's and Auden's understanding of the Incarnation informs their views on time, history, language, and literature, as embodied by these works. Chapter Four centers on their drama, initially comparing their early plays---written when Eliot was a Christian but Auden was not---to show how they employed similar techniques to further different ends, before turning to an examination of Eliot's later verse plays and Auden's libretti. I investigate the ideological motivation behind the adoption of these different dramatic forms, as well as the specific ways in which they affect how belief is conveyed. Throughout the dissertation, the effects of Eliot's and Auden's conversion upon their reputations and the difficulties facing modern Christian artists in general are given particular consideration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tt441.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859k83t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Auden, W.

Additionally, the large-amplitude vibrations of clamped shells subjected to an external radial harmonic force excitation are also investigated theoretically. The experiments were conducted with three experimental set-ups: one for experiments with elastomer shells in annular air-flow, the second for elastomer shells with internal air-flow, and the last one for aluminum or plastic cylindrical shells with internal water-flow. In all cases the interaction between the shell and the fully developed flow gives rise to instabilities in the form of static or dynamic divergence at sufficiently high flow velocities. The experimental results show a softening type nonlinear behaviour, with a large hysteresis in the velocity for the onset and cessation of divergence. Only static solutions were observed. In the theoretical study, the standard form of the Donnell's nonlinear shallowshell equations is used. The solution expansion includes both driven and companion modes, thus allowing for a traveling wave in the circumferential direction; it also includes axisymmetric modes to capture the nonlinear inward shell contraction and the correct type (softening) nonlinear behaviour observed in the experiments. The clamped-clamped beam eigenfunctions are used to describe the axial variations of the shell deformation, automatically satisfying the boundary conditions and the circumferential continuity condition exactly. The fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid, and the fluid-structure interaction is described by linear potential flow theory. The theoretical results indicate loss of stability by divergence, and a strong nonlinear subcritical response. In the case of external excitation the shell exhibited a softening type of nonlinearity. The results from the theoretical model are compared with experimental data, and in all cases good qualitative and quantitative agreement is observed. In addition, a parametric analysis investigates the effect of the length/radius and thickness/radius ratios and transmural pressure on the nonlinear response of the shell with internal flow.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nz700.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fw87r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9c67ws040"><dcterms:title>Second language acquisition of Japanese relative clauses</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Linguistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kayama, Yuhko.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis investigates the second language acquisition of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by native speakers of English or Korean. Researchers have argued that Universal Grammar (UG) can be accessed in adult second language (L2) acquisition. The Full Transfer Full Access (FTFA) Hypothesis (Schwartz and Sprouse 1994, 1996) claims that after initial transfer from L1, learners reset their parameter values and are able to acquire L2 properties that are different from their L1. Japanese and English relativization: while Japanese relativization does not involve movement in the syntax (Kuno 1973, Saito 1985, etc.), English relativization involves obligatory operator movement and is subject to movement constraints like Subjacency. Because of Subjacency, certain RC structures are prohibited in English. In Japanese, on the other hand, a zero pronominal, pro, is base-generated in the gap position of an RC and coindexed with the relative head noun, and thus long distance relativization is possible. I argue that the presence or absence of pro is also a parametric difference between Japanese and English; pro is present in Japanese, but not in English. In order for English speakers to acquire Japanese RCs, they need to reset the values of these two parameters. Experimental studies were conducted with high-intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese (15 English speakers and 18 Korean speakers). Tests examined the learners' knowledge of the two grammatical properties in Japanese---namely, the lack of wh-movement and the presence of pro. Korean is different from English but similar to Japanese with respect to the parameters in question. Following FTFA, it is hypothesized that English-speaking learners initially transfer their L1 values, and that eventually they are able to switch parameters to the L2 values by accessing UG. The results of several tasks (including interpretation tasks and judgment tasks) confirm this hypothesis; while Korean speakers generally performed well irrespective of proficiency levels, English-speaking intermediate learners transferred their L1 values, failing to accept grammatical Japanese sentences that are not possible in English. English-speaking advanced learners, on the other hand, performed better than intermediate learners, and exhibited evidence that they had acquired the two properties of Japanese, supporting FTFA.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418s40w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67ws040</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Second language acquisition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language transfer (Language learning)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Japanese language -- Relative clauses.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
