A longwave radiation model was developed. The model was first applied to the case of an isolated cumuliform cloud in the form of a cylinder, the results of which illustrate the importance of cloud side cooling. We proposed that the radiatively forced sinking of air at the sides of cumuliform clouds would lead to lower-level convergence and thereby enhances the upward motion in the interior of the cloud. A study of cloud top cooling rate in stratiform clouds with positive (lifting) or negative (sinking), axially symmetric perturbations shows that a lifting of the cloud top does not increase cooling rate, whereas the peak cooling rate decreases rapidly in depressions. For small perturbation, $ approx$10 m, this may tend to inhibit the growth of negative perturbations. For larger perturbations, $ approx$100 m, changes to the radiative cooling rates within the positive perturbations and next to the negative perturbations may act to sustain the perturbation and promote its growth. Using a three-dimensional longwave radiation model and a slab-symmetric cloud dynamics model, we demonstrated that longwave radiative cooling substantially enhances the maximum cloud water content. The maximum increase reaches 96%. The total cloud water was also increased somewhat (maximum 20%). In the initial stage of the development, the augmentation of cloud water content near the cloud top and sides is traced mainly to the direct effect of longwave radiative cooling on cloud microphysics (i.e. radiative cooling reduces the local temperature and hence the saturation water vapor pressure, which leads to additional condensation). In the mature stage of cloud, the increase of total cloud water content comes from a combination of the effects of radiation on microphysics and dynamics. The cooling from radiation and evaporation produces additional downward motion at the sides of the cloud. The enhanced low-level convergence invigorates the updraft promoting further cloud development. In the decaying stage, the negative buoyancy produced by cloud top radiative cooling and a higher liquid water load speeds up the decay process in the LW run. In a sheared environment, shear suppresses convection. In conjunction with horizontal momentum transport, radiative cooling also results in a more negative temperature perturbation and a stronger downdraft on the downshear flank relative to the upshear side. In an axially symmetric simulation, longwave cooling produces a weaker updraft in the cloud core. This phenomena was attributed to the shorter lifetime of the axially symmetric cloud, and the fact that the cloud side sinking motion can spread around the cloud core instead of being confined to a vertical plane. As a result, a weaker secondary circulation develops which is offset by the negative effects of the cloud top radiative cooling and the higher liquid water load.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yan, M.

These drugs can reduce viral load and improve quality of life. However, drug-resistant viruses emerge over time and are a major obstacle to successful therapy. We have demonstrated two novel mutations in HIV-1 RT as responsible for HIV-1 resistance to a number of nucleoside analogs, using tissue culture selection procedures. A substitution of methionine to valine at residue 184 of RT (M184V) encoded low-level resistance both ddI and ddC and high level resistance to 3TC. A second mutation, lysine$ to$arginine at amino acid 65 (K65R), conferred cross resistance among each of ddC, 3TC, ddI and PMEA. Neither of these mutations conferred decreased sensitivity to AZT. Both the M184V nd K65R mutations have been observed in viruses isolated from patients who received long-term therapy with these drugs. The recombinant K65R mutant RT had selectively altered catalytic efficiency and recognition of dNTP substrates/ddNTP inhibitors in steady-state kinetic assays. Furthermore, by employing chain elongation/dNTP incorporation assays, using a HIV-1 genome-derived RNA template and either deoxyoligonucleotide or tRNA$ rm sp{lys3}$ as primers, it was shown that this mutant RT had decreased frequency and altered patterns of chain termination in the presence of a variety of nucleoside analog triphosphates. Thus, both altered recognition of dNTPs/ddNTPs and decreased chain termination effect of ddNTPs constitute aspects of the molecular basis of HIV-1 resistance. Additionally, a murine MAb, 1E8, which competitively inhibits HIV-1 RT polymerase activity with dNTPs, recognizes an epitope at residues 65-73 in RT (J. Wu et al., 1993). 1E8 inhibited both wt and K65R mutated RTs to similar extent, suggesting that the K65R nutation does not significantly alter the 1E8 epitope. Interestingly, 1E8 showed an antagonistic effect with ddNTPs but additive/synergistic effects with nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) re-inhibition of RT polymerase activity. A chain elongation/dNTP incorporation assay revealed that the NNRTI, Nevirapine, can inhibit HIV-1 RT polymerase activity in the absence of chain termination and interfering with interactions between RT and template and/or dNTPs/ddNTPs. Combinations of Nevirapine with different ddNTPs had additive or minor synergistic effects on inhibition of RT activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainberg, Mark A.

It is widely accepted that the interaction between CD4 and MHC class II molecules enhances T cell response to specific antigen. CD4 is non-covalently associated with the src-related tyrosine kinase p56$ rm sp{lck}.$ Using the T cell clone 2.10, we have shown that CD4 can sequester lck and inhibit anti-TcR induced proliferation if not co-aggregated with the TcR. Our results suggest that MHC class II molecules through their simultaneous interaction with the TcR and CD4 potentiate T cell activation by bringing the CD4/lck complex to the proximity of the TcR. This cellular system was also used to demonstrate that the extracellular domain of CD4 can also regulate the initiation of T cell activation independently of its interaction with MHC class II molecules. Indeed, cells expressing chimeric molecules composed of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) extracellular domain and the CD4 cytoplasmic tail were still responding to anti-TcR simulation in the absence of co-aggregation. The role of the extracellular domain of CD4 was further demonstrated in experiments in which the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 was used to inhibit antigenic stimulation of CD4-independent T cell responses. This inhibition was occurring whether CD4 is associated with lck or not, suggesting that gp120 is modulating a CD4 function other than association with lck and which is related to its extracellular portion. In addition to its effect on T cell activation, interaction between gp120 and CD4 modulates HIV replication at a post-transcriptional level. The CD4/lck association is required for this effect as the virus replicates much more efficiently in cells bearing a CD4 which is not associated with lck. Activation of lck through the CD4/gp120 interaction may thus be responsible for the induction of latency.

We first review the formalism required for a typical calculation and then proceed to examine a few applications. All the simulations were performed using plane wave based pseudopotential methods and by a direct minimization of the Kohn-Sham total energy functional. Using this method, we have investigated the effect of impurity atoms like boron, sulphur and phosphorous on the adhesive properties of two aluminium minimum slabs. We found that both sulphur and phosphorous (both substitutional impurities) decreased the adhesive energy and the interfacial strength, while boron (an interstitial impurity) increased the interfacial strength marginally. It was also found that the impurities act as spacers and increase the interfacial spacing. This increase was found to increase with atomic size. These observations are consistent with experimental work. We have also investigated the possibility of using orbital-free kinetic energy functionals in ab initio simulations. Various functionals, their limiting forms and response properties were studied. The results obtained using this method agree well with full Kohn-Sham calculations. This was demonstrated using a variety of systems (Si clusters, H$ vert$Si(100), c-Si). The excellent scaling properties of the method was illustrated with a simulation of the interactions between a tip and substrate (150 atoms). The normal forces experienced by the small cluster serving as the tip were used to map out the top surface of the substrate. An ad hoc scheme to incorporate pseudopotential non-locality into the orbital-free formalism was also proposed and tested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guo, Hong (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k71s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765372715</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw6634543v"><dcterms:title>Quantification, predictability and alleviation of high axle load compaction in Quebec soils</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gameda, S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Soil structure and crop response under annual compactive loads of 10 and 18 t/axle and compaction alleviation treatments were assessed in a continuous corn production system. The alleviation treatments consisted of chemical conditioning with a non-ionic surfactant, and subsoiling with narrow-tined and winged implements. Parameters utilized for determining effects on soil structure were bulk density, water retention characteristics and soil profile characteristics. Significant topsoil and subsoil compaction resulted from both loading levels. Crop yield reductions due to compactive loading ranged from 18 to 27% under optimal weather conditions and were as high as 55 to 86% under adverse weather conditions. Soil amendments by chemical conditioning had no beneficial effect on soil structure or crop yields. Inter-row subsoiling with narrow-tined and winged subsoilers was effective in reducing soil compaction and increasing crop yields. Soil bulk density measurements gave good indication of overall compaction to a depth of 0.4 m and correlated well with crop yields, but were unable to locate differences between compactive treatments. Water retention characteristics indicated significant differences between compactive treatments to a depth of 0.6 m. Soil profile characteristics were useful for determining ped type and size as well as rooting depth and gave the best overall assessment of compaction alleviation effects. Studies were also conducted to develop a method for predicting soil compactibility that would serve to manage soil compaction at the farm level. Preliminary studies focused on the determination of soil material properties for predicting bulk density changes under applied loads. Further investigations were conducted on the variations in constrained modulus, cone index and soil bulk density values under uniaxial loading. A model relating constrained modulus as a function of cone index, bulk density and soil moisture content was developed. Subsequent studies conducted yielded significant relationships between penetration resistance and soil compactibility as indicated by constrained modulus and coefficient of compressibility. Relationships obtained between penetration resistance and parameters of compactive work and bulk density change indicated the feasibility of assessing soil compactibility at the farm level.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raghavan, G.

I describe how EFM use appeared contradictory because medical understanding of EFM use was limited to what I define as "case centered" research; research limited to measuring the impact of the EFM on individual patient outcome. Case centered studies were not examinations either of the EFM itself, or of its associated technical regimens. Moreover, case centered studies were not used to relate the EFM to women's experiences during birth, hospital traditions, or community expectations. These latter relationships, which are ignored in case studies, form the focus of this research and explain why an EFM was used in this community.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lock, Margaret (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p178.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b80v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medical technology -- British Columbia -- Invermere.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Obstetrics -- Practice -- British Columbia -- Invermere.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetal heart rate monitoring -- British Columbia -- Invermere.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ang451k194"><dcterms:title>A mathematical model of high-speed wheel mobility on soil for application to aircraft landing and take-off</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Antia, Hogan E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Motivated by the problem of aircraft and space-shuttle landing on an underlying unpaved soil surface in an emergency, a time-dependent mathematical formulation of high-speed wheel mobility on soil is developed and solved by a control-volume-based finite element method. The wheel-soil contact forces are determined solely on the basis of the physics of the problem. Thus, none of the usual assumptions or simplifications regarding the distribution of interfacial normal and/or shear stresses, albeit in the context of quasi-static wheel mobility, is made. The formulation allows for the incorporation of arbitrary soil constitutive equations, hence strain-rate effects. Soil and wheel inertia are fully accounted for. Consideration is given to the possible existence of a stick-slip phenomenon along the wheel-soil interface. An object-oriented dynamic wheel-soil interaction C++ computer program is developed and validated. Predictions of soil drag and associated wheel sinkage during simulated aircraft landings are presented. The use of object-oriented programming allows for an easily re-usable and extendable code. Thus the code developed herein can readily be specialized or generalized to solve other practical soil-structure interaction problems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yong, Raymond N.

The dynamic scaling form, which completely determines the fractal properties of the interface morphology, has been derived and found to be in extremely good agreement with numerical simulations. A new universality class of the growth regime, characterized by a novel superscaling relation, is obtained. For substrate dimension d = 1, the interface morphology is significantly less rough than that observed in the nonconserved system; at the critical dimension $d sb{c}$ = 2, the interface is found to be logarithmically rough. The dynamic roughening transition of the conserved driven interface has also been studied by taking into account a lattice pinning potential. This conserved system exhibits a true phase transition, rather than crossover behavior, as has been observed for nonconserved driven interfaces. The conserved nonlinear driving force is favorable for smoothing the interface, implying that the roughening transition shifts to higher temperatures as that driving force is increased. The nature of the phase transition remains the same as the equilibrium transition; the critical properties are controlled by a Kosterlitz-Thouless fixed point.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grant, Matin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999828q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225c62s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5425kc26p"><dcterms:title>Appreciating the present : Smith, Sutherland, Frye, and Pacey as historians of English-Canadian poetry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kokotailo, Philip, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis argues that as historians of English-Canadian poetry, A.

Nevertheless at times, and particularly in the Tragedies and in the Romances, the actual children in the plays become agents of reconciliation and regeneration; in Macbeth, the victimized children acquire the status of a powerful symbol.

In the first meta-analysis the malformation risks associated with the use of anticonvulsants in general by women with epilepsy were quantified and clarified. Comparison of the congenital malformation risk among offspring of mothers with epilepsy with first trimester anticonvulsant exposure ("exposed") relative to offspring of non-epileptic parents yielded a summary estimate of relative risk (RR) of 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.2). (All RR's in this abstract are study-stratified Mantel-Haenszel summary estimates.) Congenital malformation risk among the offspring of exposed women with epilepsy compared to unexposed women with epilepsy yielded a summary RR of 2.9 (CI = 2.0-4.2). No evidence of increased risk to unexposed women with epilepsy compared to non-epileptic women was evident (RR = 0.9, CI = 0.5-1.6). In the second meta-analysis the risks associated with specific types of anticonvulsant therapy were qualitatively synthesized. The analysis demonstrated the inadequacies of many study reports--vague descriptions of methods often restricted assessment of study quality and incomplete reporting of results as largely responsible for restricting the analysis to 31 studies. Women with epilepsy treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy experienced increased risk of congenitally malformed children relative to both unexposed women with epilepsy (RR = 1.8, CI = 0.8-4.8), and unexposed non-epileptic women (RR = 2.5, CI = 1.8-4.0). Insufficient data were available to demonstrate statistically significant differences in malformation risk among specific commonly-used anticonvulsant monotherapies, although phenobarbital and carbamazepine appeared to have the lowest risks. Two-drug therapy was associated with a 20% increase in risk relative to monotherapy, but three-drug therapy was associated with more than twice the risk of one-drug therapy (RR = 2.2, CI = 1.3-3.7). Although the potential role of confounding by type and severity of epilepsy could not be evaluated, the analysis suggests that avoiding therapy with three or more anticonvulsants during the first trimester would be prudent. The second component of the thesis was a large record linkage study utilizing information from the databases of Saskatchewan Health. An essentially population-based database of maternal drug use and reproductive outcomes was created which included 104,534 livebirths and 13,685 non-livebirth outcomes occurring between April 1977 and March 1984 linked to 299,152 prescriptions dispensed to the mothers in the year preceding the pregnancy outcome. A study of anticonvulsant use during pregnancy and birth outcome was completed using the created database. The study yielded results with respect to congenital malformation risk generally consistent with the conclusions or the meta-analyses. Evaluation of the database of maternal drug use and reproductive outcomes raised questions about the utility of Saskatchewan Health's databases for pharmacoepidemiologic research into congenital malformations.

Restoration planning is a complex decision and control problem important to the power industry from both practical and theoretical points of view. It involves a wide range of approaches and disciplines. This thesis proposes an integrated methodology for power system restoration planning which incorporates heuristics (e.g. restoration guidelines), algorithms (e.g. load flow, optimization), friendly graphical user interface and data bases. Heuristics provide rules for dividing the power system to be restored into subsystems (each of which is restored independently), for selecting suitable scenarios (sequence of switching operations) from the scenario library, and for creating appropriate scenarios whenever these do not exist in the scenario library. The conventional trial-and-error approach to restoration may easily lead to infeasible restoration scenarios, usually requires a large number of control adjustments and it is slow. On the other hand, the optimization algorithm presented in this thesis can systematically ensure the feasibility of a defined restoration scenario as well as to give an optimal solution for all controllable variables in the sense of minimizing the number of control variable adjustments from stage to stage. The optimization algorithm, therefore, reduces the duration of the restoration procedure which is a critical consideration during power system blackouts. The interactive graphics man-machine interface (MMI) greatly facilitates the creation of restoration plans directly on the dynamic diagram of the network as well as displaying simulation and optimization results. Through the graphics MMI, users can easily sub-divide the grid to be restored into sub-networks, request the execution of simulation programs such as finding available paths from generation to load for energization purposes, define and modify scenarios of switching sequences, and execute the scenario optimization. Users can also test a restoration plan interactively with a load flow simulator. Data bases contain the graphical representation of power systems and their numerical data. They also contain numerical data for the simulation programs. With the data base, users can easily store and retrieve power system networks on which the restoration process is simulated. In the data base, there also exists a scenario library which stores all pre-defined restoration scenarios. These restoration scenarios can be retrieved for later study. The optimization algorithm and graphical user interface were extensively tested by creating and simulating numerous and restoration scenarios on actual networks. The results show that the graphical user interface is powerful and useful. In addition, the optimization algorithm not only provides a systematic way to find feasible solutions for restoration (usually very difficult with a trial-and-error approach) but also greatly reduces the duration of the restoration process.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr82m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n019j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246t604"><dcterms:title>Postnatal expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by rat peripheral neurons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mandelzys, Allan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Synaptogenesis is a complex process involving several steps that ultimately results in the matching of neurotransmitters released from the presynaptic nerve terminals with the appropriate receptors expressed by the postsynaptic neuron. In this thesis, I examined one step in the process of synaptogenesis, the expression of postsynaptic receptors. Cultured neonatal rat nodose neurons are a good model for these studies; in vivo, nodose neurons do not form synaptic contacts, but interestingly, when they develop alone in dissociated tissue culture most neurons express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and form de novo cholinergic synapses. First, I investigated the factors that influence nAChR expression by nodose neurons. I determined that in vivo, only 40% of nodose neurons have functional nAChRs, however, when grown alone in culture more than 80% express nAChRs and the majority have ACh current densities comparable to those on neurons that normally received cholinergic innervation. I found that ganglionic satellite cells control nAChR expression by nodose neurons, whereas trophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), can up-regulate ACh current density in the absence of the satellite cell influence. Second, as several different genes encode nAChRs, I was interested in determining the nAChR transcripts expressed by nodose neurons; mRNA for $ alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, beta2, beta3$ and $ beta4$ were detected by RNase protection assay. In addition, these changes in differentiated properties suggested that nodose neurons were developing a phenotype resembling that of autonomic neurons. Consequently, for comparison, I examined nAChR expression by rat sympathetic neurons, both at the functional and molecular level. Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons express five nAChR transcripts: $ alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, beta2$ and $ beta4.$ To address which subunits are incorporated into the functional receptor, I used both electrophysiolog</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, E.

Methyltrienelone (MT), a synthetic androgen, dissociates normally from this receptor but mibolerone (MB), another synthetic androgen, dissociates from it two-fold faster than normal. This mutant receptor was identified within genital skin fibroblasts (GSF) from two unrelated individuals with different degrees of androgen insensitivity (AI). Sequence analysis of the AR gene from both subjects revealed a G to A transition at nt 2969 in exon 6 that alters codon 813 from serine to asparagine (S813N). Transiently expressed hAR.S813N did not reproduce the mutant phenotype in several heterologous cells: COS-1, BHK, CHO or HeLa cells. In contrast, when AR free (R$ sp-$) GSF were used as host cells, MB-R.S813N complexes dissociated almost two fold faster than the controls (n = 4) while MT-R.S813N complexes dissociated normally. These results establish the G to A transition at nt 2969 as the cause of the ligand-selective phenotype. Such host-cell restricted expression of the mutant dissociation rate points to cell-specific factors that can suppress abnormal dissociation of A-R complexes. Host cell-restricted expression of the abnormal dissociation rates has also been observed for two other transiently expressed mutant AR, hAR.V865L and hAR.R839H (n = 3). Expansion of the glutamine (gln) tract within the N-terminus of the AR causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a disease of motor neurons, but the mechanism of this neuropathology is unknown. To determine the effect of gln-tract expansion upon AR function, SBMA-associated mutant AR was transiently expressed and characterized in COS-1 cells. The androgen-binding parameters of the mutant receptor were normal, but it had decreased transactivation competence (50-66% of normal; n = 3). This abnormal transregulatory function may account for the expression of traits associated with minimal androgen insensitivity (MAI) that are variably expressed in the SBMA patients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pinsky, L.

It deals with the fictional image of I. V. Stalin and the impact of his life and politics on history. For several decades it was the core of socialist realist literature and Stalin's personality cult. The first chapter discusses the phenomena of Stalin's personality cult in the context of the intellectual history of the post-revolutionary Soviet society in the 1920s and 1930s. Chapter two offers different classifications of a vast amount of fiction written on Stalin. The genesis and documented development of staliniana is discussed in the third chapter. Special attention is paid to the manipulations in the genre exercised by ideological and cultural authorities in the USSR from the 1920s to the 1970s. The fourth chapter discusses some aspects of staliniana in Western Europe as contrasted to Soviet literature. In the fifth chapter a detailed analysis of key elements of the codified literary image of Stalin is undertaken. Chapter six explores the folklore background of Stalin's cult and its interaction with the cult of V. I. Lenin. The final chapter offers an analysis of the development of the language used by Stalin as a fictional character in works of literature. This study uses the recently declassified materials from Soviet archives in order to demonstrate that staliniana was not only a key element of the Stalin cult but also a cornerstone of Soviet literature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fodor, Alexander (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw12x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wr845</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stalin, Joseph, 1879-1953 -- In literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Russian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53wx42d"><dcterms:title>Celebrity and power : celebrity status as a representation of power in contemporary culture</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marshall, P.

First of all, it establishes that celebrities are linked to both the development of a democratic culture, where there is an investment in conceptions of the popular will for political and cultural legitimation, and consumer capitalism, where power and subjectivity are intimately connected to the commodity and a consumer identity that is formed through commodities. Secondly, the dissertation establishes that the significance and meaning of the celebrity in contemporary culture are linked to its dual formation by the culture industries and by the audience which embraces and remakes the meaning of the produced celebrity. A critical reading of individual celebrities that have emerged from different domains of the culture industries is conducted which integrates a hermeneutic of intention into a hermeneutic of reception. Thirdly, the work shows how the forms of public subjectivity privileged in the entertainment industries are elemental parts of the construction of the contemporary political leader. The dissertation concludes that the celebrity, along with other forms of public personalities that emerge in the public sphere, is an attempt to contain or embody a certain type of power that is difficult to sustain because of its connection to mass sentiment and supposed forms of irrationality. The celebrity then is the continual attempt to embody this affective power in contemporary political and popular culture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finlay, Marike (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vj36s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53wx42d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fame -- Social aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6m311q97h"><dcterms:title>Reduction of sulphur dioxide over supported molybdenum sulphide catalysts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mulligan, David John</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The reduction of sulphur dioxide with methane using various supported molybdenum catalysts has been studied.

An empirical study using data from an extensive literature survey showed that aquatic plants do not differ markedly in element composition from the sediments in which they grow, and that during uptake the plant's roots do not discriminate between elements essential and not essential for growth. The organic content, pH and redox potential of the sediments were shown to affect the bioavailability of metals to the plants. Biomass density was used to categorize species to assess broad patterns in plant-sediment metal relationships. It was found that the presence/absence of an understory contributed variation to the plant-sediment metal relationships. The role of rooted macrophytes as vectors for various elements between the sediments and attached epiphyte was quantified by growing Myriophyllum spicatum in radio-labelled sediments. This species was found to be a link between the sediments and attached epiphytes for the 4 elements studied (Co, Cs, Eu and Mn). Finally, the export of dissolved metals from weedbeds during plant senescence was quantified using a mass balance approach. It was found that approximately 15% to 30% (depending on the metal) of the metal inventory of the plants at maximum seasonal biomass was lost as dissolved compounds during senescence. During the growing season the macrophyte beds were net sources of metals to the lake, but were net sinks annually.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472z15h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z35x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Freshwater plants.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lake sediments</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mineral cycle (Biogeochemistry)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sx51m"><dcterms:title>Maternal dietary fatty acids : effects on reproduction and embryolipid metabolism in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vilchez, Niceas Carlos</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Japanese quail hens were used to study the effect of feeding palmitic, oleic or linoleic acids on the reproductive performance, tissue fatty acid composition and embryo lipid metabolism.

The highest level of reproductive performance was observed in quail fed palmitic acid followed by those fed oleic and linoleic acids. The highest level of embryo survival, observed in the palmitic acid fed group, was associated with more rapid mobilization and assimilation of yolk material by the embryo during incubation and it was not related to changes in eggshell quality. High levels of oleic and linoleic acids were found in egg yolk, plasma and liver lipids from quail fed oleic and linoleic acids, respectively. However, feeding palmitic acid resulted in elevated levels of palmitoleic acids in all three tissues. The fatty acid profiles of phospholipid, triglyceride and cholesterol esters of embryonic tissues were consistently influenced by the fatty acid composition of the yolk lipids and the stage of development. Feeding palmitic acid promoted more retention of labeled fatty acids in embryo lipids. Labeled oleic acid was preferentially esterified in the cholesterol ester fraction of yolk sac membrane lipids, and it appears that this fatty acid is utilized to a great extent by the quail embryo during its development.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nn02t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx51m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Japanese quail.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fatty acids.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lipids -- Metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Birds -- Embryology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fj751"><dcterms:title>The epic of the Irish nation state : history and genre in James Joyce's Ulysses</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ungar, Andras</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study examines Ulysses as a response to the Irish Literary Revival's expectation that a native epic would crown Ireland's literary achievements and to the country's imminent independence under the Sinn Fein.

The pulp delignification is characterized by determining the development of the concentration of methanol and methoxyl group containing material in the bleach liquor and that of the functional groups in the residual lignin. A complete chlorine mass balance was obtained throughout the bleaching reaction. Based on the development of the chlorine containing species, a series of reactions are formulated which give a complete description of the transformation of atomic chlorine during ClO$ sb2$ bleaching. It is found that all organic chlorine, defined as the sum of AOX in the spent bleach liquor and the organically bound chlorine in the chlorinated pulp, is formed within the first 10 minutes of reaction. Subsequently, the increase in AOX in solution is matched by an equivalent decrease of organically bound chlorine in the pulp. The organic chlorine during ClO$ sb2$ bleaching is mainly formed from the reaction between lignin and hypochlorous acid. It is also shown that chlorate is mainly formed by the reaction of two intermediates generated during chlorine dioxide bleaching, chlorite and hypochlorous acid. A theory is presented which explains the effect of operating variables on chlorite formation. The methoxyl group loss from softwood kraft pulp during chlorine dioxide treatment can be accounted for by the methanol produced and the methoxyl content of dissolved organic material in the bleach filtrate. It was found that ClO$ sb2$ rather than the in-situ generated hypochlorous acid is mainly responsible for the methanol formation. The experimental evidence suggests that demethylation and delignification are closely related during ClO$ sb2$ treatment of softwood kraft pulp. Based on the present experimental evidence the ClO$ sb2$ delignification mechanism presented earlier by Gierer and others is modified. Finally, two techniques are evaluated to decrease the AOX formation in a bleach plant based on respectively the removal of hypochlorous acid by reaction with chlorite, and on decreasing the dissolved lignin concentration. The former can be achieved either by mixing chlorite with pulp prior to the addition of chlorine dioxide, or by converting part of chlorine dioxide to chlorite with hydrogen peroxide. The latter is accomplished by introducing a washing step between the D and C stages of a DC bleach sequence.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107077p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md48g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
