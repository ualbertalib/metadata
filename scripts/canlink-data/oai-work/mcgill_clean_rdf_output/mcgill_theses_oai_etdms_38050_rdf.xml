During embryonic kidney development, PAX2 exerts an anti-apoptotic function however its expression typically attenuates during the post-natal period. On the other hand, PAX2 aberrant expression is observed in the majority of Renal Cell Carcinomas (RCC). RCC is resistant to chemotherapy; up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes is recognized to contribute to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic effect of the PAX2 gene that is expressed in RCC cells contributes to RCC and their resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell death. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells transfected with a PAX2 expression vector and exposed to cisplatin, were protected from apoptosis compared to control cells. Conversely, murine collecting duct cells stably transfected with PAX2 antisense cDNA had twofold increases in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Similarly, PAX2 knockdown using PAX2 siRNA in RCC cells CAKI-1 and ACHN enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro. To test the combination of PAX2 expression silencing and cisplatin treatment in vivo we developed a model of renal tumors by injecting ACHN cells as a xenograft under the skin of nude mice. I showed that a PAX2 shRNA successfully knocks down PAX2 mRNA and protein levels in a RCC cell line (ACHN). ACHN cells stably transfected with shRNAs targeted against the PAX2 homeodomain, are more susceptible to cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation than the control ACHN cell line. Furthermore, growth of subcutaneous ACHN/shPAX2 xenografts in nude mice is significantly more responsive to cisplatin therapy than control of ACHN cell tumors. This work proposes PAX2 as a potential therapeutic gene target in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and suggests that adjunctive PAX2 knockdown may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. Wilms tumor, the most common pediatric renal cancer, is thought to arise from a progenitor cell of the metanephric mesenchyme that fails to complete nephrogenesis. In addition to its characteristic triphasic histology, WT can exhibit myogenic differentiation. Myogenic programming during muscle development is controlled by a PAX3 transcription factor determinant for muscle development; unexpectedly PAX3 transcriptional activity has been recently identified in the embryonic mouse kidney. These observations led us to hypothesize that PAX3 plays a role during kidney development. Furthermore, we predict that if PAX3 expression is verified during renal development, PAX3 may also be expressed in Wilms tumor with a myogenic component. I showed that PAX3 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme and stromal compartment of the developing mouse kidney. In a panel of 20 Wilms tumors, PAX3 was identified in tumor samples with myogenic histopathology. Furthermore, mutations of WT1 were consistently associated with PAX3 expression in Wilms tumors and modulation of WT1 expression in HEK293 cells was inversely correlated with the level of endogenous PAX3 protein. This work supports a novel model of normal renal development in which progenitor cells of the metanephric blastema express PAX3 when targeted toward the stromal cell fate. Suppression of PAX3 is integral to the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition, which defines the nephrogenic cell fate and may be accomplished, in part, by WT1. Conversely, failure to suppress PAX3 may account for the myogenic phenotype in a subset of WT1-negative Wilms tumors.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cm803.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903418z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Carcinoma, Renal Cell -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kidney -- embryology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>PAX2 Transcription Factor -- therapeutic use.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wilms Tumor -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kidney Neoplasms -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Therapy -- methods.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cisplatin -- therapeutic use.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd376190d"><dcterms:title>Expression and function of chemokine receptors on airway smooth muscle cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Joubert, Philippe.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Asthma is a respiratory disease that affects 2.5-3 million Canadians. This condition is characterized by a Th2-driven immune response that implicates the infiltration of eosinophils and remodelling of the airways. In the last decade, airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) have became the subject of intense research in the field of inflammatory lung diseases including asthma. It is known that ASMC respond to a wide variety of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. Function of ASMC in the context of asthma has extended beyond its traditional role of a structural cell. Indeed, it is believed that they can participate in the initiation and the perpetuation of the inflammatory response that takes place in the airway of asthmatic subjects. The general aim of this work was to investigate the role of ASMC in the pathogenesis of asthma. More specifically, we studied the expression of two C-C chemokine receptors, CCR3 and CCR1 in the context of asthma. For the first time, this work describes the expression of chemokine receptors by ASMC. We have shown that eotaxin, an important chemokine in asthma, induces migration of ASMC through the activation of CCR3. Although CCR3 expression is not regulated by Th2 cytokines in vitro, ASMC isolated from asthmatic patients expressed intrinsically higher levels of the surface receptor when compared to controls. We also describe the expression of CCR1 by ASMC, a receptor involved in airway remodelling in an animal model of asthma. We reported the expression of CCR1 mRNA in biopsies obtained from mild, moderate and severe asthmatics and showed that mild group express the highest level of CCR1. We also confirmed that ASMC express the receptor in vivo and showed that stimulation of this receptor with its ligands induces intra-cellular calcium mobilization, which confirms its functionality. Regulation of CCR1 on ASMC was also assessed using proinflammatory, Th1 and Th2 cytokines. We found that TNF-alpha and to a lesser extent, IFN-gamma, upregulated CCR1 mRNA and protein expression, while Th2 cytokines had no effect. The effect of these two cytokines was totally suppressed by either dexamethasone or mithramycin. Collectively, our results demonstrate the expression of functional C-C chemokine receptors by ASMC. Interestingly, we have shown that CCR3 activation mediates ASMC migration and provides a new possible mechanism for the increased smooth muscle mass observed in asthmatic patients. Although the exact function of the CCR1 expressed by ASMC is unknown, our results suggest an involvement in asthma pathogenesis, possibly through airway remodelling.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53k225w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd376190d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bronchi -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Asthma -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Myocytes, Smooth Muscle -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, CCR3 -- metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, CCR1 -- metabolism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akh04dt59w"><dcterms:title>Acceptability and feasibility of heat-treated expressed breastmilk following exclusive breastfeeding by HIV-1 infected South African women</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sibeko, Lindiwe Nobesuthu.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of HIV-1 infected, urban South African mothers being able to feed their infants heat-treated expressed breast milk (HTEBM). Nutritional status assessment of HIV-infected breastfeeding mothers (n=84) indicated that maternal status was not compromised; mean body mass index 26.8 (4.0) kg/m2, triceps skinfold 14.8 (5.50) mm and hemoglobin 11.6 (1.49) g/dL. However, severely immunocompromised mothers (CD4 + &lt; 200 cells/mm3) were more likely to be anemic. Breastmilk viral loads were also higher in mothers with lower CD4+ cell counts. Community based inquiry on the acceptability of HTEBM was accomplished through in-depth interviews of participants (n=31), at the individual (mothers), family (partners, grandparents, mothers-in-law) and at the community level (traditional healers, daycare worker, health care counselors). Although an unfamiliar concept for all interviewed, overall, HTEBM was found to be an acceptable feeding choice regardless of respondents' gender, age, maternal status, family or community role. Further, data indicated mothers rarely received quality infant feeding counseling, consequently mixed feeding, a high risk for HIV transmission, was a common practice. In a pilot longitudinal study, using mixed-methods, the feasibility of mothers successfully implementing a modified breastfeeding intervention (6 months exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), cessation of breastfeeding, followed by use of HTEBM with complementary diet) was evaluated. The majority of mothers (36/66) practiced EBF for 6 months, 42% of whom also used HTEBM, expressing a range of approximately, 65 ml to 600 ml of breastmilk daily, for varying durations (2 weeks to 5 months). Mothers did not experience breast pathology. Home visits were highly enabling as was disclosure of HIV status to a partner. This is the first study to demonstrate that use of HTEBM is a feasible infant feeding option for HIV infected women. HTEBM may offer one solution to reduce vertical transmission of HIV and help maintain nutritional adequacy, as a component of complementary feeding.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35698370.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt59w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>HIV infections -- Transmission -- South Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) in infants -- Prevention -- South Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breast milk -- Heat treatment -- South Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breastfeeding -- Health aspects -- South Africa.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75dh614"><dcterms:title>State-similarity metrics for continuous Markov decision processes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ferns, Norman Francis.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In recent years, various metrics have been developed for measuring the similarity of states in probabilistic transition systems (Desharnais et al., 1999; van Breugel &amp; Worrell, 2001a). In the context of Markov decision processes, we have devised metrics providing a robust quantitative analogue of bisimulation. Most importantly, the metric distances can be used to bound the differences in the optimal value function that is integral to reinforcement learning (Ferns et al. 2004; 2005). More recently, we have discovered an efficient algorithm to calculate distances in the case of finite systems (Ferns et al., 2006). In this thesis, we seek to properly extend state-similarity metrics to Markov decision processes with continuous state spaces both in theory and in practice. In particular, we provide the first distance-estimation scheme for metrics based on bisimulation for continuous probabilistic transition systems. Our work, based on statistical sampling and infinite dimensional linear programming, is a crucial first step in real-world planning; many practical problems are continuous in nature, e.g. robot navigation, and often a parametric model or crude finite approximation does not suffice. State-similarity metrics allow us to reason about the quality of replacing one model with another. In practice, they can be used directly to aggregate states.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nj969.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dh614</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Markov processes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reinforcement learning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agf06g665p"><dcterms:title>Bayesian collocation tempering and generalized profiling for estimation of parameters from differential equation models</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Campbell, David Alexander.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The widespread use of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models has long been underrepresented in the statistical literature. The most common methods for estimating parameters from ODE models are nonlinear least squares and an MCMC based method. Both of these methods depend on a likelihood involving the numerical solution to the ODE. The challenge faced by these methods is parameter spaces that are difficult to navigate, exacerbated by the wide variety of behaviours that a single ODE model can produce with respect to small changes in parameter values. In this work, two competing methods, generalized profile estimation and Bayesian collocation tempering are described. Both of these methods use a basis expansion to approximate the ODE solution in the likelihood, where the shape of the basis expansion, or data smooth, is guided by the ODE model. This approximation to the ODE, smooths out the likelihood surface, reducing restrictions on parameter movement. Generalized Profile Estimation maximizes the profile likelihood for the ODE parameters while profiling out the basis coefficients of the data smooth. The smoothing parameter determines the balance between fitting the data and the ODE model, and consequently is used to build a parameter cascade, reducing the dimension of the estimation problem. Generalized profile estimation is described with under a constraint to ensure the smooth follows known behaviour such as monotonicity or non-negativity. Bayesian collocation tempering, uses a sequence posterior densities with smooth approximations to the ODE solution. The level of the approximation is determined by the value of the smoothing parameter, which also determines the level of smoothness in the likelihood surface. In an algorithm similar to parallel tempering, parallel MCMC chains are run to sample from the sequence of posterior densities, while allowing ODE parameters to swap between chains. This method is introduced and tested against a variety of alternative Bayesian models, in terms of posterior variance and rate of convergence. The performance of generalized profile estimation and Bayesian collocation tempering are tested and compared using simulated data sets from the FitzHugh-Nagumo ODE system and real data from nylon production dynamics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19fb170.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g665p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Differential equations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Markov processes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bayesian statistical decision theory.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mv140"><dcterms:title>A Diels-Alder approach to palau'amine /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cernak, Timothy Andrew.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Described in this thesis is the development of a key Diels-Alder reaction for use in a total synthesis of the potently immunosuppressant marine alkaloid palau'amine. This study focuses on the originally proposed structure of palau'amine. The strategy utilizes a computationally designed thiohydantoin dienophile as the 2pi component and a thermally stable 2-silyloxy-5-(silyloxymethyl)cyclopentadiene as the 4pi component in the critical Diels-Alder reaction. Essential to the design and study of these partners was the use of computational density functional theory (DFT) predictions. Four families of dienophiles---oxazolones, dehydroalanines, hydantoins and thiohydantoins---were investigated. The hydantoins and thiohydantoins react with cyclopentadiene with up to 13:1 exo-selectivity while the dehydroalanines are modestly selective and the oxazolones are unselective. The exo-selectivity of the hydantoin and thiohydantoin dienophiles is attributed to a novel stabilizing interaction whereby the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen interacts with a developing positive charge on the diene in the transition state. In terms of reactivity, the oxazolones are the superior dienophiles. The reactivity of the thiohydantoins is greater than that of analogous hydantoins and approaches that of the oxazolones. The bolstered reactivity of the thiohydantoins is attributed to the increased donation of the nitrogen lone-pair into the thiocarbonyl bond. This phenomenon was recognized first in DFT predictions and then proven experimentally. Synthetic access to the requisite beta-(chloromethylene)thiohydantoins necessitated the development of a reaction between dilithium diamides and thiophosgene. 2-silyloxy-5-(silyloxymethyl)cyclopentadienes were studied experimentally and computationally and found to be much more stable than conventional 5-substituted cyclopentadienes towards thermal decomposition by 1,5 hydride shift. The new dienes undergo Diels-Alder reaction with oxazolone and thiohydantoin dienophiles with exoselectivities as high as 6:1 for nonchlorinated dienophiles. Fully functionalized chlorinated exo-cycloadducts were prepared with up to 1.5:1 selectivity and subjected to oxidative ring-opening to reveal the persubstituted core of palau'amine.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032713c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mv140</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Alkaloids.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Diels-Alder reaction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Guanidines.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pyrroles.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A08612s81m"><dcterms:title>Early environmental regulation of neural systems mediating fearfulness</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Caldji, Christian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Postnatal handling of rat litters during the first week of life greatly decreases behavioural fearfulness to novelty in the adult offspring. Our first question was to what extent the Benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor complex, a system critical for the expression of fear, might be involved in mediating the observed reduced fearfulness in handled animals (H). Benzodiazepine receptor (BZ) binding was reduced in the amygdala and locus coeruleus (LC), regions important for the expression of fear in non-handled (NH) and maternally separated animals (MS). Moreover, levels of the mRNA for the gamma2 sub-unit of the GABAA receptor complex, which confers high affinity BZ binding, were higher in the amygdaloid nuclei as well as in the LC of handled compared with both NH and MS animals. Studies with the handling paradigm have lead to the idea that variations mother-pup interactions may actually be the cause of the handling effects. As adults, the offspring of mothers which exhibited high levels of licking/grooming and arched-back nursing (LG-ABN) showed substantially reduced behavioral fearfulness in response to novelty compared to the offspring of low LG-ABN mothers. In addition, the adult offspring of the high and low LGABN mothers showed the same receptor and molecular profiles as H and NH adult offspring. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and alpha2 norepinephrine receptor levels, additional receptor systems thought to be important in the expression of fearfulness, differed in these animals too. Adoption studies give further support to the maternal hypothesis in the finding that the expression mRNA for the gamma2 sub-unit of the GABAA receptor complex can be differentially expressed as a result of different offspring to mother combinations. Taken together, these findings suggest that early life events (ie: naturally occurring differences in maternal care) during the first few days of life have long-term effects on the development of central neurotransmitter systems, which mediate the expression of fearfulness to novelty.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68km31p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612s81m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rats -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fear -- psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, GABA-A -- physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Maternal Behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Anxiety Disorders -- physiopathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021k29n"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of fully Bayesian disease mapping models in correctly identifying high-risk areas with an application to multiple sclerosis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Occupational Health</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Charland, Katia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Disease maps are geographical maps that display local estimates of disease risk. When the disease is rare, crude risk estimates can be highly variable, leading to extreme estimates in areas with low population density. Bayesian hierarchical models are commonly used to stabilize the disease map, making them more easily interpretable. By exploiting assumptions about the correlation structure in space and time, the statistical model stabilizes the map by shrinking unstable, extreme risk estimates to the risks in surrounding areas (local spatial smoothing) or to the risks at contiguous time points (temporal smoothing). Extreme estimates that are based on smaller populations are subject to a greater degree of shrinkage, particularly when the risks in adjacent areas or at contiguous time points do not support the extreme value and are more stable themselves. A common goal in disease mapping studies is to identify areas of elevated risk. The objective of this thesis is to compare the accuracy of several fully Bayesian hierarchical models in discriminating between high-risk and background-risk areas. These models differ according to the various spatial, temporal and space-time interaction terms that are included in the model, which can greatly affect the smoothing of the risk estimates. This was accomplished with simulations based on the cervical cancer rate of Kentucky and at-risk person-years of the state of Kentucky's 120 counties from 1995 to 2002. High-risk areas were 'planted' in the generated maps that otherwise had background relative risks of one. The various disease mapping models were applied and their accuracy in correctly identifying high- and background-risk areas was compared by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic curve methodology. Using data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on the island of Sardinia, Italy we apply the more successful models to identify areas of elevated MS risk.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pm369.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021k29n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Multiple Sclerosis -- epidemiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Models, Statistical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bayes Theorem.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epidemiologic Methods.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053m518"><dcterms:title>Regulation of neuronal diversity in the mammalian nervous system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Theriault, Francesca M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To acquire its characteristic structural and functional complexity, the mammalian nervous system must undergo several critical developmental processes. One such process requires factors that regulate the decision of dividing progenitors to leave the cell cycle and activate the neuronal differentiation program. It is shown in this thesis that the murine runt-related gene Runx1 is expressed in proliferating cells on the basal side of the murine olfactory epithelium. Disruption of Runx1 function in vivo does not result in a change in the quantity of progenitors but leads to a decrease in precursor number and an increase in differentiated ORNs. These effects result in premature and ectopic ORN differentiation. Further, exogenous Runx1 expression in cultured olfactory neural progenitors causes an expansion of the mitotic cell population. In agreement with these findings, exogenous Runx1 expression also promotes cortical neural progenitor cell proliferation without inhibiting neuronal differentiation. These effects appear to involve transcriptional repression mechanisms. Consistent with this possibility, Runx1 represses transcription driven by the promoter of the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 in cortical progenitors. Taken together, these findings suggest a previously unrecognized role for Runx1 in coordinating the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of selected populations of neural progenitors/precursors. Another significant step in the development of the mammalian nervous system is the acquisition of distinctive neuronal traits. This thesis also shows that Runx1 is expressed in selected populations of postmitotic neurons of the murine embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems. In embryos lacking Runx1 activity, hindbrain branchiovisceral motor neuron precursors of the cholinergie lineage are correctly specified but then fail to enter successive stages of differentiation and undergo increased cell death resulting in neuronal loss in the mantle layer. Runx1 inactivation also leads to a loss of selected sensory neurons in trigeminal and vestibulocochlear ganglia. These findings uncover previously unrecognized roles for Runx1 in the regulation of neuronal subtype specification. This thesis thus presents a novel factor which functions at several steps in the development of the mammalian nervous system and adds to the growing body of work on the processes involved in elaborating such a complex and vital structure.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qn99b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053m518</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nervous System -- growth &amp; development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit -- genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4x51hp567"><dcterms:title>Artificial aging treatments of 319-type aluminium alloys</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tavitas-Medrano, Francisco Javier.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Aluminum-silicon-copper cast alloys of the 319-type have attained a commercially important status because of their widespread use. Artificial aging treatments are routinely applied to these alloys in order to obtain precipitation hardening and improve their mechanical properties. Standard treatments may not always yield the optimum achievable properties, thus Mg and Sr are commonly added to improve the response of the alloy to aging and to modify the eutectic Si morphology from acicular to fibrous, respectively. The present study was carried out to investigate aging behavior of four 319-type alloys in regard to such mechanical properties as their ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, microhardness, percent elongation and impact toughness. Non-conventional aging cycles were applied so as to evaluate the degree of the improvement in strength obtainable. These treatments, labeled in this study as T6- and T7-type multi-temperature and interrupted aging treatments, involve several heating stages at different temperatures, as opposed to the single stage at constant temperature specifications of the standard T6 or T7 heat treatment regimes. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the fracture surfaces of selected tensile-tested samples to compare the fracture behavior. Transmission electron microscopy was used to reveal and identify the tiny precipitates which appear in the microstructure as a result of the precipitation-hardening process due to artificial aging. It was found that the main strengthening phase is theta-Al2Cu in the form of needles; other phases were observed as minor constituents in this alloy, including the binary beta-Mg2Si, the ternary S-CuAlMg 2 and the quaternary Q-Al5Cu2Mg7Si 7. The results show that while Mg and Sr additions improve the properties of the alloy, the standard T6 treatment may not be the best available option to produce optimum properties. In fact, when the peak-aged (T6) condition is desired, the optimum treatment consists of a continuous artificial treatment at 170°C for 8 h; when the overaged (T7) condition is desired, a T7-type multi-temperature treatment consisting of underaging at 170°C for 1 h, then at 190°C for 1 h, and finally overaging at 240°C for 2 h is the best option.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t627t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp567</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Silicon alloys -- Heat treatment.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Copper alloys -- Heat treatment.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aluminum alloys -- Heat treatment.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asx61dr290"><dcterms:title>Increasing physical activity and self-determination for individuals with autism spectrum disorder</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Todd, Teri.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Despite the important benefits of physical activity, many people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty participating long enough to reap the rewards.

The studies were carried out at a high school for students with intellectual disabilities over three consecutive years. The results of studies and 2 were used to adapt the intervention to meet the needs of this population. Recent research has shown that when people act in a self-determined manner they become more engaged in what they are doing. The intervention for study I included one self-determination skill, self-monitoring. Goal-setting was added during study 2, this resulted in participants setting goals and self-monitoring as they walked and jogged. The intervention for the third study included 3 self-determination skills: goal-setting, self-monitoring, and self-reinforcement. The self-determination attitude of self-efficacy was measured during study 3 to better understand the relationship between self-efficacy and physical activity for individuals with ASD. Distance walked, jogged, or cycled, increased during studies 1 and 3. Visual methodologies were used during studies 2 and 3 to provide these participants with severe communication problems the opportunity to share their experiences during the physical activity with the researchers. Participants and teachers interpreted the facial expressions, which were captured with photographs, in terms of affect but their interpretations did not always match. The participants indicated that enjoyment of the activity increased over the duration of the physical activity program but this was not always obvious to the teachers. It was concluded that interventions which include self-determination skills increase engagement and enjoyment during physical activity for adolescents and young adults with ASD.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860c03h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dr290</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Autism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical education for people with disabilities.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q8533"><dcterms:title>High-speed parallel optical receivers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tang, Wei, 1976-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Parallel optical interconnects (POI) have attracted a great deal of attention in the past two decades as the system bandwidth continues to increase. Optical interconnects are known to have more advantages than their electrical counterparts in many aspects such as crosstalk, bandwidth distance product, power consumption, and RC time delay. The parallelization of several optical links is also an effective method to increase the aggregate data rate while keeping the component count manageable and to reduce the unit cost of optics, electronics, and packaging at lower line rate. Parallel optical transceiver modules running at several gigabits per second are commercially available nowadays. Parallel optical receivers are one of the key components of parallel interconnected systems. In this work, we describe how a low-power parallel CMOS preamplifier IC and a deskew IC have been designed and fabricated through the IBM 0.13mum CMOS technology. The performances of three different transimpedance amplifier (TIA) topologies are compared experimentally. The best of the three TIAs shows a differential gain of 56.2dBO, 2.6GHz bandwidth, and less than -16dBm sensitivity with a bit-error-rate (BER) less than 10-12. The TIA consumes 2.5mW of power from a 1.2V supply while the channel power is 22mW with a 400mV pp differential output swing. A novel method of accurately measuring the crosstalk power penalty with an on-chip PRBS generator is proposed and its implementation is described. The use of an on-chip PRBS generator to drive the dummy channels eliminates the data pattern dependence between the aggressors and the victim. The inevitable channel skew associated with parallel channels can be removed by a phase-locked loop (PLL) based deskew method. We investigated the skew compensation range of this method theoretically and our experimental results confirm our conclusion. Various practical design and test techniques such as photodiode modeling, AC coupling, low-pass filtering and continuous skew generation, and their implementations, are discussed and implemented in this thesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p890p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q8533</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Optical interconnects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metal oxide semiconductors, Complementary -- Design and construction.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axk81jq782"><dcterms:title>Synthesis of organic layer-coated metal nanoparticles in a dual-plasma process</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Qin, Cao.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A novel dual-plasma process for the synthesis of organic layer-coated metal nanoparticles is presented. Metal nanoparticles are synthesized by the low-pressure pulsed arc evaporation of a metal cathode surface, followed by the in-flight deposition of a thin organic layer by capacitively-coupled radio-frequency (CCRF) plasma polymerization from a gaseous hydrocarbon monomer. The system is simple to operate and can be designed for high throughput. The combination of the synthesis and surface treatment of metal nanoparticles in the whole system avoids newly produced metal nanoparticles from being contaminated by surrounding environment. A home-made self-oscillatory pulsed power supply has been designed and built for the arc evaporation of metal sources. The stability of the pulsed arc system and the cathode erosion rate are discussed. The inductor present in the discharge loop is shown to have a stabilizing effect on the train of pulsed arcs. It was shown that the erosion rate was strongly dependent on peak arc currents due to the increased emission of macroparticles with peak arc currents, and the yield of metal nanoparticles was found to be slightly influenced by the peak arc current. The produced coated copper nanoparticles were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was revealed that the coated copper nanoparticles have a metal core of size ranging from a few to 50 nm, and that the thickness of the organic layer ranges from 3 to 10 nm. The smallest copper nanoparticles are crystalline, while the organic coating has a macromolecular structure and shows a hydrophobic behavior. The XPS results showed that the plasma polymer film is chemically adsorbed onto the surface of the copper nanoparticle. The effects of operating conditions such as reactor pressure and inert gas flow rate on the average size of the produced bare copper nanoparticles were studied. It was demonstrated that the metal nanoparticle size tends to decrease with decreasing reactor pressure, while inert gas flow rate has little influence on the mean nanoparticle size. The morphology of the plasma polymer coating was revealed to be strongly dependent on the RF plasma power, reactor pressure, and inert gas flow rate. Two kinds of organic films were produced: a smooth, uniform and dense polymer film and a liquid polymer film. Based on a series of experiments, a "characteristic map" for the in-flight plasma polymerization from the C2H 6 monomer generating an organic layer onto the Cu nanoparticles was developed. A simplified free-radical mechanism was proposed for the plasma polymerization from ethane. Other metal sources such as iron and aluminum were used as cathodes in the arc evaporation reactor. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the production of coated nanoparticles similar in morphology to the ones obtained with the copper cathode. Lastly, ethylene glycol vapor were introduced as an alternative monomer into the plasma polymerization region. A non-uniform coating was observed on the metal nanoparticle surface.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451n829.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jq782</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nanoparticles.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metal clusters.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plasma polymerization.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At148fn32v"><dcterms:title>The Met receptor tyrosine kinase in mammary gland tumorigenesis and development /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Petkiewicz, Stephanie L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is expressed in the mammary gland under both normal and neoplastic conditions. Overexpression of the Met receptor is found in 15--20% of human breast cancers and is correlated with shortened disease-free interval and overall survival. In order to explore the role of dysregulated Met receptor signaling on the development of mammary tumors I have characterized a transgenic mouse model that expresses either wild type or a dysregulated Met receptor in the mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/enhancer (MMTV-Met). The Met receptor variants contained a mutation that results in decreased receptor ubiquitination and prolonged receptor signaling (Y1003F) or an activating mutation that was originally observed in patients with papillary renal carcinoma (M1250T) or both mutations (YF/MT). In vitro and in vivo transformation assays demonstrated that each mutation singly is weakly transforming, however, there was an additive effect on transformation when both mutations were present. This additive effect was observed in the transgenic mice where multiparous MMTV-Met-YF/MT mice developed tumors earlier and with much greater penetrance than did mice expressing either of the single mutants. This provides the first in vivo model that demonstrates a role for ubiquitination in suppression of transforming activity of an RTK. MMTV-Met-YF/MT tumors displayed a range of histological phenotypes but were mainly comprised of luminal lineage cells. Notably, MMTV-Met-M1250T tumors contained cells from both the basal and luminal populations, suggesting transformation of a progenitor cell. Progenitor cell transformation in RTK transgenic mouse models is uncommon and highlights distinct signaling differences and potentially lineage specificity of the two Met mutants. Through assays of overexpression in vivo and inhibition in vitro, Met receptor signaling has been correlated with the development of the mammary gland. To examine the effects of loss of Met receptor signaling on mammary gland development I have utilized the Cre/LoxP1 recombination system to knock-out the Met receptor from the mammary epithelium. Mammary-specific Cre recombinase efficiently excised floxed DNA as visualized by activation of a beta-galactosidase reporter In Met+/+ glands, however, few beta-galactosidase positive cells are retained In the Mefl/fl glands and an intermediate number are retained in the Met fl/+ glands. This indicates that Met-null cells are selected against and supports a role for Met in the development of the mammary gland.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010v13q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fn32v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse -- genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r9677768"><dcterms:title>Effect of microstructure on static and dynamic mechanical properties of high strength steels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Qu, Jinbo, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The high speed deformation behavior of a commercially available dual phase (DP) steel was studied by means of split Hopkinson bar apparatus in shear punch (25m/s) and tension (1000s-1) modes with an emphasis on the influence of microstructure. The cold rolled sheet material was subjected to a variety of heat treatment conditions to produce several different microstructures, namely ferrite plus pearlite, ferrite plus bainite and/or acicular ferrite, ferrite plus bainite and martensite, and ferrite plus different fractions of martensite. Static properties (0.01mm/s for shear punch and 0.001s -1 for tension) of all the microstructures were also measured by an MTS hydraulic machine and compared to the dynamic properties. The effects of low temperature tempering and bake hardening were investigated for some ferrite plus martensite microstructures. In addition, two other materials, composition designed as high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steel, were heat treated and tested to study the effect of alloy chemistry on the microstructure and property relationship. A strong effect of microstructure on both static and dynamic properties and on the relationship between static and dynamic properties was observed. According to the variation of dynamic factor with static strength, three groups of microstructures with three distinct behaviors were identified, i.e. classic dual phase (ferrite plus less than 50% martensite), martensite-matrix dual phase (ferrite plus more than 50% martensite), and non-dual phase (ferrite plus non-martensite). Under the same static strength level, the dual phase microstructure was found to absorb more dynamic energy than other microstructures. It was also observed that the general dependence of microstructure on static and dynamic property relationship was not strongly influenced by chemical composition, except the ferrite plus martensite microstructures generated by the TRIP chemistry, which exhibited much better dynamic factor values. This may suggest that solid solution strengthening should be more utilized in the design of crashworthy dual phase steels.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gc400.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9677768</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Steel, High strength -- Mechanical properties.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steel, High strength -- Microstructure.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79408228r"><dcterms:title>On the temporal Talbot effect in optical communication systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pudo, Dominik.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Presented in this thesis is a study of the Temporal Talbot effect within the context of return-to-zero data communication systems.

In addition to determining and quantifying the effects of all these impairments, we demonstrate a beneficial, mitigating effect of the Talbot self-imaging process on the two last ones. We then demonstrate a novel, tunable pulse repetition multiplier using cascaded fiber Bragg gratings, with an output repetition rate exceeding 100 GHz. We finalize our study on the system level by exploring and characterizing the Talbot effect for all-optical clock recovery. Two distinct implementations are considered, one with fiber Bragg gratings and the second with single-mode fiber. The latter also allows us to perform a proof-of-principle demonstration of simultaneous clock recovery at two wavelengths.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h156s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79408228r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Data transmission systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Talbot's law (Optics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Optical communications.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vg687"><dcterms:title>Production of lithium peroxide and lithium oxide in an alcohol medium</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khosravi, Javad.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Experiments to measure (i) the reactivity of lithium peroxide and lithium oxide in ambient air as a function of relative humidity and reactant particle size, (ii) the solubility of lithium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide monohydrate in three alcohols, namely methanol, ethanol and 1 and 2-propanol, as a function of time and temperature, (iii) the efficiency of the production of lithium peroxide in alcohol medium as a function of the concentration of LiOH.H 2O in methanol, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the kind of alcohol, the kind of feed material, and temperature and the time of mixing, (iv) the analysis of the precipitates, (v) the temperature of the precipitate decomposition in isothermal and non-isothermal conditions in ambient and neutral conditions as function of time, (vi) the activation energy of the precipitate decomposition, (vii) the temperature of the lithium peroxide decomposition in isothermal and non-isothermal conditions as function of time and (viii) the activation energy of lithium peroxide decomposition were performed. The purpose of the study was to gather the data necessary to evaluate the production of lithium peroxide, Li2O2, and subsequently lithium oxide, Li2O, to be used as a feed for a silicothermic reduction process for the production of metallic lithium. The proposed basis for the production of Li2O2 was the conversion of lithium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide monohydrate by hydrogen peroxide in an alcohol medium. Alcohols were chosen because they are members of a class of non-aqueous solvents that can selectively dissolve the anticipated contaminants while precipitating the desired products. It was found that the addition of hydrogen peroxide to alcohol solutions containing lithium hydroxide monohydrate resulted in the formation of lithium peroxide as lithium hydroperoxidate trihydrate with eight adduct molecules of methanol, i.e., Li2O2•H2O 2•3H2O•8CH3OH and involved the peroxide group transfer. The optimum conditions for the production of lithium peroxide were found to be (i) the least water concentration in the system (ii) the use of the temperature lower than ambient temperature and (iii) fast separation of the precipitate and raffinate to prevent dissociation of the precipitate or dissolving into the raffinate. The high solubility of LiOH.H2O and at the same time the low solubility of Li2CO3 and of Li2O2 in methanol resulted in selection of methanol as the best alcohol of those studied for the proposed method of Li2O2 production. It also yielded high purity lithium peroxide. The production of Li2O 2 using H2O2 (35 %wt) required an excess of hydrogen peroxide equal to 2.6 times the stoichiometric amount. The thermal decomposition of the lithium hydroperoxidate trihydrate precipitate started with the rejection of the adduct methanol molecules, followed by co-evolution of H2O and H2O2 from the resulting Li 2O2•H2O2•H2O. The activation energy of the decomposition reaction of the precipitate was measured as 141 kJ/mol. At temperatures greater than 200°C, lithium peroxide was found to be very reactive with atmospheric air. However, in an argon atmosphere, it rapidly decomposed losing the majority of the oxygen atoms, followed by the gradual slow diffusion of oxygen gas absorbed on the lithium oxide.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fr050.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vg687</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lithium.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lithium compounds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lithium compounds -- Solubility.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w882x"><dcterms:title>Literacy instruction in a constructivist elementary classroom : a qualitative inquiry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kingsley, Joanne Elizabeth.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is a response to the need to support literacy development in an increasingly diverse and complex culture. Some school boards have identified early literacy as a priority for school improvement and there has been much debate about what constitutes effective literacy instruction. The Quebec Education Program (2001) recommends adopting a constructivist approach that embeds literacy instruction within interdisciplinary learning situations. Some teachers ask what a constructivist classroom looks like in practice. In light of teacher and school board concerns this study examines the literacy practices of a grade two/three elementary teacher in order to address the question, how does literacy learning occur within an espoused constructivist classroom? Besides describing the literacy events themselves, the role of context and the teacher in the literacy learning are examined. Using a qualitative research methodology, the dynamic interactions between and amongst teacher and students were documented. Participant observation utilized photographs, audio and video taped lessons, semi-formal interviews as well as student work and teacher materials to provide a rich description of classroom practice. The researcher used both categorizing and contextualizing strategies to complement each other in a rigorous and systematic analytical process. Visual research methodology augmented the richness of the study. The researcher discovered four major steps in a dance between teacher and students that developed literacy skills in a caring environment by nurturing self-esteem and self-regulation in learners. The teacher designed a peer tutoring program with first grade students in which literacy skills instruction was embedded within an authentic context that responded to second language learners with learning challenges. The teacher's roles as director, philosopher, enabler and connector were explored and a mirror image of students and teacher were provided through a narrative tracing of three focus students. Besides describing the literacy practices of the teacher, this study uncovered a spiritual dimension of the teacher's role in that she began from the sacred space of teaching from the heart. Using gentle judgment and praise she built self-esteem by reflecting back to her students an image of competent, intelligent, human beings. Her spiritual epistemology enabled her to create a harmonious balance of responsible freedom within a flexibly structured environment. The spiritual dimension that emerged through the study suggests that research of literacy practices needs to include an examination of the role of the teacher in developing students' identities as self-confident members of a literacy community.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322j87x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w882x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Language arts (Elementary)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Constructivism (Education)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g909p"><dcterms:title>Help-seeking behavior in early childhood</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Koulnazarian, Manouchak.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the literature on adults, there is an abundance of studies in which there are clear gender differences in the overt expression of vulnerability. Significantly more females than males have been found to express vulnerability. Similar findings have been reported in the adolescence literature, indicating that these gender differences begin much earlier than adulthood. However, the age at which these gender differences occur is not known because few studies have investigated these behaviors in early or middle childhood. The primary focus of this study was to determine if there are gender differences in young children's help-seeking behavior and at what age these differences emerge. The type of help children sought and the orientation of their statements were also examined. Sixty-four preschoolers and kindergarteners from lower and upper-middle socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds were engaged by 1 male or 1 female researcher on 4 non-sex-typed tasks. Key variables that were examined were the number of requests for help, latency to request help, types of request, and types of orientation. The results of this study revealed that, between 3 and 6 years of age, girls sought help more often and more rapidly than boys. Children from lower SES backgrounds sought significantly more help than children from upper-middle SES backgrounds. Similarly, preschoolers sought help more often and more rapidly than kindergarteners. Females made significantly more direct requests whereas males made significantly more references of having difficulty with the tasks. Furthermore, preschoolers made significantly more statements that were oriented to the experimenter and task. Lastly, the results revealed clear gender differences that emerge as early as 3 years of age. These findings are important because help-seeking behavior is related to achievement (Lee, 1997; Ryan, Patrick, &amp; Shim, 2005). Therefore, training boys who are avoidant help-seekers to seek appropriate help as well as training psychologists, teachers, and parents to identify those who are avoidant help seekers may help children increase their academic performance and experience success in school.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x335x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g909p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Group work in education.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Help-seeking behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex differences.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An296x334n"><dcterms:title>The relationship between lipid metabolism and suicidal behaviour : clinical and molecular studies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lalovic, Aleksandra.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Suicide continues to claim hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide each year, in spite of the significant progress of research efforts aimed at understanding the complexity of this tragic behaviour. Data accumulated over the last decades suggest a certain biological predisposition to suicidal behaviour. Among the possible biological risk factors, cholesterol has frequently been cited. Several lines of evidence support the relationship between altered lipid metabolism, particularly low levels of serum cholesterol, and suicidal behaviour, yet the possible mechanisms governing the relationship remain to be elucidated. Three separate strategies were employed in order to explore the link between lipid metabolism and suicidal behaviour, each one from a novel perspective on this issue. The first approach aimed to substantiate the existing evidence of an association between low serum cholesterol and suicidality by examining psychiatric data, suicidality and related behavioural characteristics in a sample of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome heterozygotes---a clinically normal population with altered cholesterol metabolism due to an inherited partial deficiency in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase enzyme---compared with controls. The second approach consisted in measuring the lipid profile in brain tissue from suicide completers, in order to address whether there are alterations in cholesterol and/or fatty acids in the brain. The final approach involved the use of exploratory gene expression studies to identify novel candidate genes and proteins that may be involved in mediating the link between lipid metabolism and suicidality. The results of these studies will be presented and discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r517g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x334n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome -- psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Suicide.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brain Chemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q855n"><dcterms:title>Exploiting the use of plasminogen kringle domains for cancer gene therapy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Perri, Sabrina R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Angiostatin is one of the most widely studied inhibitors of angiogenesis and encompasses the first 3 or 4 kringle domains of human plasminogen (Plg). Of particular interest, is the fifth kringle of human Plg (KS), which displays higher anti-angiogenic potency than angiostatin. In fact, kringles 1 to 5 exhibit greater inhibitory activity against endothelial cells than angiostatin, and this finding suggests that K5 domain acts synergistically to enhance the anti-angiogenic effect of angiostatin. Therefore, we proposed that the K5 domain---on its own---could act as a potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor protein within the context of a cancer gene therapy strategy. In our first study, we assessed the angiostatic properties of the K5 peptide domain in an orthotopic brain cancer model. We demonstrated that the disulfide bridging conformation of K5, necessary to maintain its functionality, is conserved upon secretion by gene-modified mammalian cells. Kringle 5 retrovirally gene-engineered human U87 glioma cells produced functional soluble K5 protein capable of suppressing growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration in vitro and inhibiting glioma-induced angiogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, secreted K5 protein blocked the recruitment of tumor-associated CD45+Mac3 +Grl- macrophages in vivo and inhibited the migration of CD206+ human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. Moreover, in a clinically relevant orthotopic glioma model, soluble K5 induced long-term survival in a majority of test animals. Thus, these findings validate the use of a gene therapy approach to deliver Plg K5 protein and suggest that K5 acts as a novel 2-pronged anti-tumor agent, mediating its inhibitory effect via its action on host-derived endothelial cells and tumor-associated macrophages. To determine if K5 mediated its anti-tumor effect by modulating other immune effector cells, we tested the use of soluble K5 in a murine DA/3 mammary adenocarcinoma model. Soluble K5 produced by retrovirally gene-modified DA/3 cells led to long-term survival (over 1 year) of immunocompetent BALB/c mice however, we failed to observe tumor rejection in immunodeficient NOD-SCID and BALB/c nude mice. Further analysis revealed that K5 enhances the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ lymphoid cells, in particular the natural killer T (NKT)-lymphocyte phenotype. Consistent with our previous findings, we demonstrated that K5 led to a significant decrease in tumor-associated microvessel length and density. Interestingly, K5 tumors were characterized by a robust neutrophilic infiltrate. This may be explained by the ability of K5 to act as a strong chemotactic agent for human neutrophils in vitro as well as its ability to promote CD64+ activation within the CD11b+ neutrophil phenotype. These findings confirm that K5 acts as a potent angiostatic agent and possesses a novel pro-inflammatory role via its ability to recruit tumor-associated neutrophils and NKT-lymphocytes, leading to a strong anti-tumor response. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are key immune effector cells implicated in promoting tumor progression and metastasis. It would thus be desirable to explore strategies to reduce TAM infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. In our first study, we demonstrated that soluble K5 protein blocks macrophage recruitment. In addition, the recent observation that angiostatin reduces macrophage infiltration in an atherosclerosis model prompted our laboratory to further explore the use of angiostatin as an anti-macrophage agent. We demonstrated that angiostatin suppresses the in vitro migration of both murine peritoneal macrophages and human monocyte-derived CD206 + macrophages. Furthermore, we showed that angiostatin led to a decrease in the gelatinolytic activity of macrophage-produced matrix metalloproteinase-9, which may explain, in part, the observed angiostatin-mediated inhibition of migration. Additionally, we detected the presence of the beta-subunit of ATP synthase on the cell-surface of macrophages. ATP synthase was previously found to be a receptor for angiostatin on the cell-surface endothelial cells. We propose that the presence of ATP synthase on the surface of macrophages may promote interaction with angiostatin and prevent migration, similar to what has been reported with endothelial cells. Our findings suggest that angiostatin holds promise as an inhibitory agent against macrophages.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wr982.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q855n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k943r"><dcterms:title>Genetic dissection of the host response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection in Toll-like receptor 4 transgenic mice and recombinant congenic strains</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2006</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roy, Marie-France.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Different individuals react differently to infection with similar pathogens and weakly pathogenic organisms can cause life-threatening infections in some, while highly virulent microbes may go undetected in others. The basis of these differences lies within the genetic makeup of each individual, which determine their response to infection. Unraveling the genetic determinants of susceptibility to infection brings a much clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases and paves the way to potential prophylactic and therapeutic interventions urgently needed in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance, globalization of infectious diseases, and emerging or re-emerging pathogens. Salmonella spp are highly successful pathogens that have co-evolved with countless host species. Even today, they continue to threaten public health throughout the world. Their zoonotic nature, their propensity to establish long-term carrier states and the emergence of antimicrobial resistant, highly virulent strains greatly complicate the fight against this pathogen. As for other infectious diseases, the host response to Salmonella is genetically controlled. In order to genetically dissect this response, a mouse model was developed and allowed identification of a few genes having a strong impact on the outcome of Salmonella infection. The mouse response to Salmonella is, however, complex and several additional genetic variants influencing the response to infection remain to be identified. Here, we present a series of experiments, which contribute to our understanding of the host response to acute Salmonella Typhimurium infection in mice. First, we investigated the impact of Tlr4 expression during Salmonella infection by comparing host responses in mice carrying 1, 2 and 3 copies of Tlr4 on the same genetic background. We show for the first time, in this narrow range of Tlr4 expression, an incremental protective effect against Salmonella due to improved control of bacterial growth and increased expression of important downstream immune genes. Second, using a set of reciprocal A/J and C57BL/6J recombinant congenic strains, we identified five novels QTL influencing the outcome of Salmonella Typhimurium infection in mice. Finally, we present evidence for the genetic basis for one of the newly identified QTL and describe a role for anemia and iron balance in the mouse response to Salmonella.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236649w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k943r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35td366"><dcterms:title>Actual versus best practices for young children with cerebral palsy : a survey of pediatric occupational therapists and physical therapists in Quebec, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saleh, Maysoun.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background and rationale. Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common disabling disorders of childhood and constitutes a substantial portion of pediatric rehabilitation. This condition demands comprehensive rehabilitation using age-appropriate tasks and activities and encompassing aspects of body function and structure, activity and participation, and personal and environmental factors. Yet little is known regarding actual occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) practices. Objective. The primary objective of this doctoral thesis was to describe OT and PT practices for young children with CP in the Province of Quebec, Canada. Methods. This was a cross-sectional, multi-centered survey. All eligible and consenting pediatric occupational therapists (OTs) and physical therapists (PTs) were interviewed using a structured telephone interview based on vignettes of two typical children with CP at two age points---18 months and 4 years. Reported practices were grouped according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Literature review of pediatric assessments and interventions potentially used for CP was done to determine their level of evidence of effectiveness. In addition, two expert groups provided, for each vignette, a best practice problem identification list and a best practice intervention list. Results. A total of 62 PTs (83.8% participation rate) and 85 OTs (91.4% participation rate) participated in the study. Overall, 91.9% of PTs and 67.1% of OTs reported using at least one standardized pediatric assessment for at least one vignette. OT and PT interventions focused primarily on impairments and primary function, with less attention to interventions related to play and recreation/leisure. Clinicians reported the need for more training and education specific to CP and to the use of research findings in clinical practice. Wide variations and gaps were identified in therapists' responses suggesting the need for a basic standard of PT and OT management as well as strategies to encourage knowledge dissemination regarding current best practice. Further, implementation of evidence-based practice necessitates more collaboration between researchers, clinicians and administrators.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rn386.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35td366</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3t945w10q"><dcterms:title>Characterization of nuclear transport pathways of heat shock protein 70 upon ethanol stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Quan, XinXin, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main objective of this thesis is to characterize the mechanisms of nuclear transport of the cytosolic yeast heat shock protein 70 Ssa4p upon ethanol stress and the effect of stress and nutrient availability on transport carriers. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) plays an important role in cell damage recovery and transport of proteins across intracellular membranes. Upon stress, trafficking of the majority of proteins is inhibited with the exception of Hsp70 that accumulates in the nucleus. Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model, this thesis specifically demonstrates that Ssa4p transiently and reversibly accumulates in nuclei upon ethanol stress and exports to the cytoplasm during ethanol recovery. The cNLS-mediated classical nuclear import pathway is not required for stress-induced Ssa4p nuclear trafficking, and the N-terminal 236 amino acid residues are sufficient for Ssa4p nuclear accumulation. The importin beta family member Nmd5p forms import complexes with its cargo Ssa4p and translocates cargo into the nucleus. Upon withdrawal of ethanol stress, Ssa4p exports to the cytoplasm by binding to the exporter Msn5p. Transport of Ssa4p in both directions requires the Gsp1p system. Pkc1p and the cell integrity pathway sensors are involved in Ssa4p nuclear import upon ethanol treatment. The thesis also states that ethanol stress regulates Ssa4p nuclear transport by enhancing the import complex Ssa4p/Nmd5p formation and the docking of Nmd5p at the NPC. Stresses regulate Ssa4p nuclear export by regulating exporter Msn5p cellular localization and formation of the export complex Ssa4p/Msn5p. Therefore, the carrier-mediated nuclear trafficking might also be regulated by the transport carrier localization. Furthermore, intracellular localization of yeast nuclear exporters is sensitive to different stresses and regulated by Snf1 kinase and cell nutrient availability. In summary, this thesis defines the nuclear import and export mechanisms for the Hsp70 Ssa4p and their regulation in stressed cells. The novel finding of how the nutritional state and Snf1 kinase regulate exporter localization in general may provide a better understanding of protein transport regulation and the multiple levels cells use to adjust to environmental changes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sp59g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945w10q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn00b290d"><dcterms:title>The in vivo neuroprotective role of the normal cellular prion protein /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gains, Malcolm J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The role of prion protein (PrPC) as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE's) is well known. However, the physiologic role of this highly conserved protein in vivo is thus far, largely unknown. In vitro evidence shows that PrPC may have a neuroprotective role, inhibiting Bax-mediated apoptosis, by preventing the conformational change of Bax, which is one of the early steps leading to Bax activation and subsequently, apoptosis. In vivo evidence indicates that in some transgenic mouse models overexpressing a mutant prion protein that result in neuronal death, the simultaneous expression of PrP protects against this neuronal death. The pathogenesis of the neuronal death in these in vivo models is unknown. Our objective was to determine if PrPC could protect against Bax-mediated cell death in vivo. We used two experimental paradigms to investigate this neuroprotective role of PrPC in vivo. The first paradigm involved an external insult (ethanol injection) to 7 day old mice, which induces massive Bax-mediated neuronal death. We then quantified the number of active caspase 3 positive cells, as a downstream marker of Bax activation, induced in mice on various genetic backgrounds, PrP overexpressors (PrpOexp), PrP wild-type (PrP+/+ ) and PrP knockout (PrP0/0). We also examined Bax activation by immunoprecipitation of subcellular fractions, as well as total Bax activation and cytochrome c release directly in ex-vivo mouse brains. In addition, we examined the insertion of active Bax into the mitochondrial membrane, also using subcellular fractionation. The second paradigm involves an internal insult (physiological Bax-mediated neuronal death during embryonic development). This insult results in massive Bax-mediated cell death in embryonic mice that do not express the natural antagonist of Bax i.e. BClxL. We have therefore created 3 lines of transgenic mice expressing Syrian Hamster PrP (SHaPrP) under the control of the Bclx promoter, to cross with Bclx+/- mice to see if the SHaPrP can assume the role of Bclx in Bclx knockout mice and rescue the neuronal cell death. In the first paradigm, greater numbers of neurons undergoing apoptosis following ethanol insult were seen in PrP0/0 than in PrP +/+ mice, although the differences were not statistically significant. The ex-vivo examination of mouse brains did not provide definitive results. In the second paradigm, 3 lines of transgenic mice have been created and are in various stages of breeding to obtain the required genotypes to test our hypothesis. The level of expression of SHaPrP in these mice is below the level of detection via western blot or immunoprecipitation. The trend shown in our results suggests that in vivo, PrPC may provide some protection for neurons from Bax-mediated cell death as a result of an external insult. Research is ongoing to see if PrPC can protect neurons in vivo against developmental Bax-mediated cell death. The work presented here highlights the variability and technical difficulty inherent with in vivo studies, particularly when the available knowledge of the biochemical pathways involved is incomplete.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859k78z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b290d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
