It has long been known that the human red blood cell has a high content of potassium ions and a very low content of sodium ions despite the reverse of this ion distribution in the plasma, but earlier workers explained the situation by assuming that the cell membrane is impermeable to these ions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.

Richard and Kavanagh (1945) define growth as "an attribute of living organisms manifested by a change in size of the individual or in the number of organisms in a unit of environment". Sholl (1950) and Medawar (1950) agree with this definition while some authors have considered certain important chemical processes to be characteristic of growth, for instance protein synthesis (Boell, 1955) and DNA synthesis (Davidson, 1950). Weiss (1949), bearing in mind these varied attempts to grasp the concept of growth, wrote the following comment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.

Although the methods have also been applied to a few arctic localities (see page 8), very little is known about the size of the crop in the vast region between Greenland and the Pacific coast of Alaska. Quantitative surveys of the marine benthos were therefore made in Baffin Island during 1954 and 1955 and in West Greenland during 1956 in order to estimate the standing crop of benthos in these regions.

Insects, in most cases, may be considered to be typically poikilothermic. There exists a specific response in metabolic rate to changes in temperature, under specific conditions. The response of insect metabolism to temperature, within the limits of the effective temperature range, traces an unbroken curve when the oxygen consumption per unit weight is plotted against temperature. The effective temperature range has been defined by R. N. Chapman (1931) as the range within which the metabolism of an insect is not actually inhibited by adverse temperature.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stanley, J.

The American counterpart to the C.F.S.P. has enjoyed spectacular success, and certified seed of improved varieties forms a considerable part of total seed production.

The postsynaptic events pose two further questions: how ACh. combines with the postsynaptic membrane and how it excites (or inhibits) the postsynaptic cell. The last of these questions is now fairly well understood (for recent reviews see Castillo &amp; Katz, 1956; Weidmann, 1956), but little is known of how ACh. combines with the postsynaptic membrane.

The parasitic stage of the cycle is spent within the host. In Bunostomum trigonocephalum, which is a hookworm of sheep and goats, the parasitic stage inhabits the small intestine of the host, while Graphidium strigosum parasitises the inner wall of the stomach of the rabbit and hare. Both of these parasites are blood-suckers and reasons for their discrimination with regards to their foci are not fully established.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cameron, T.W.M.
