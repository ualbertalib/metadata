Loss of lung elasticity appeared to be the most prominent mechanical abnormality in the group with normal arterial blood gases. Airway obstruction due to expiratory check valving was less marked than in the hypercapnic group where it seemed to be the major difficulty, impairment of lung elasticity being a secondary feature. These and other demonstrated differences, suggested that qualitatively different disease processes were represented in the two groups, possibly centrilobular emphysema in the hypercapnic group as opposed to diffuse emphysema in the group with normal blood gases. In addition, the findings suggested that the chief mechanism producing chronic hypercapnia in emphysema is an inability to compensate for distributional defects by increasing ventilation, due to mechanical restriction of the respiratory bellows.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sharp, R.

If today different schools of thought are still opposed with respect to the intrinsic mechanism of edema formation, they at least agree as to its definition. Edema is a condition which is manifested by chronic, progressive accumulation of salt and water in the extra-cellular space, accompanied by an increase of body weight. This definition allows the exclusion of all syndromes in which there is only redistribution of fluid within the body, as in acute pulmonary edema.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Giroud, C.

An analysis of the errors arising in such a restoration is presented. A method of simulating such filters using operational amplifiers is suggested and the requirements which the various components in such a schema must satisfy is investigated. The circuitry employed in such a system is described, including the design and performance of a direct-coupled diode switch, capable of high operating speeds which may be used for sampling and gating. The experimental results obtained with a prototype simulation system are compared with z- transform predictions. • Some applications of these sampled-data filters are suggested as areas for future research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pavlasek, T.

Today the significance of the city square has diminished and with it the attachment of people to the values it expressed. People are often unaware of its significance other than as a place on the way to work from which a larger stretch of sky is visible than from a street.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spence-Sales, H.

It is underlain by a series of metamorphised basic intrusives, volcanic rocks, sedimentary rocks and two granitic intrusive of early (?) Precambrian age. All intrusives are apparently younger than the stratified rocks; the granites are probably the youngest rocks in the area. The meta-basic intrusives consist of a main mass of hornblende gabbro and lesser amounts of associated rocks which are thought to be differentiates of the gabbro magma.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eakins, P.

This study proposes a methodological approach to the topic by exploring the division of tasks set out by Bernard Lonergan (1904-1984). Lonergan’s methodological framework, which he called functional specialization, provides a generic differentiation of tasks, each of which is central to the overall project of understanding religious diversity. This thesis explores the relevance and utility of functional specialization as a methodological approach to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion.

The results indicate that the static method employing higher compaction pressure tends to align particles in a more horizontal array as a result of the larger shear strains induced. Samples prepared by the same method of kneading compaction but using different compactive effort of twenty and ten blows with a 20-pound tamper on each of the five layers designated 20-20-5 and 10-20-5 samples respectively show that the less dense 10-20-5 samples have a higher pore pressure response than the 20-20-5 samples as predicted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yong, R.

Under these conditions, the animals are frequently obliged to satisfy their total daily free water requirements in one or two drinking sessions with water at temperatures near freezing. The daily water requirements of all animals are known to be proportional to dry matter or energy intake. As environmental temperatures decline below the comfort zone, feed consumption and consequently water requirements increase.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacDonald, M.
