One of the last wilderness areas of North America, this peninsula has undergone intense mineral exploration and development since World War II. So spectacular has been the industrial expansion in Labrador-Ungava, that native populations and their food gathering economies have been over-shadowed. Despite the steady northward movement of the frontier in the interior of Labrador-Ungava, other portions of the peninsula have been abandoned and returned to wilderness. In this thesis, I have chosen to examine the northeastern coast of the Labrador-Ungava peninsula. This area has been little affected by the mineral developments in the interior.

The effect of conditions, such as temperature, concentration, metallic surfaces, surface area, atmosphere and motion of the solution, was examined. During the investigation, etching, cracks, pits, tree growth, dendrites, and the deposition of cadmium around gas bubbles were observed.

The effective area of integration by first writing and then reading the pattern is one square mile. The areally-averaged signals are subsequently stepped into seven levels, a factor 10 apart in received power, and displayed on a stepped grey scale on facaimile paper.

To a considerable extent, therefore, the discussion of carbohydrates resolves itself into a consideration of the metabolism of glucose and its closely related derivatives. Glucose contributes a major part to the total energy production in most animal tissues. Several metabolic pathways are open to glucose: (a) conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage (b) utilization of glucose for energy production (c) utilization of glucose for the synthesis of other compounds, such as fatty acids and certain amino acids.

However, a number of other engagements, equally important, took place. One of the most prominent and fascinating of these engagements was the Dardanelles Campaign. Beginning in February 1915, the campaign lasted until the evacuation of the Cape Halles positions in January 1916. It originated as an attempt by the political leadership in London to seek a victory which would ease the Imperial situation, strengthen allied diplomacy with the neutrals, boost morale and achieve a victory without the expansive methods being advocated by the 'Westerners' in northern France.

The field work entailed surface mapping at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet, underground mapping at a scale of one inch equals 20 feet and the logging of several thousand feet of diamond drill core. Laboratory research included flat- and universal-stage thin-section study, mineral identification by X-ray diffraction and refractive index methods and wet chemical analyses to determine the contents of major elements in twelve rocks.

Scientif articles dealt with its toxic properties when used in preservatives and pesticides, and with the ill-effects of extremely high concentrations of fluoride in drinking water and in industrial processing. About 1942 the beneficial effects of optimum concentrations of fluorine became apparent. It was found that certain communities had water supplies which contained fluorine at a level which tended to reduce dental caries. As a public health procedure other communities began to fluorinate their water to a level which was cansidered optimum for the reduction of dental caries. This level was generally found to be one part per million of fluorine. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lloyd, L. E.

The ground state of a nucleus zXan is then constructed by consecutively filling the lowest available levels of the potential well with Z protons and N neutrons in a manner consistent with the Pauli principle. Mayer and Jensen demonstrated that a considerable body of data could be understood in terms of this model if one included in the potential a spinorbit term. For example the magic numbers and the ground state spins and parities of most odd-even nuclei could be explained in this fashion. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kahana, S.

However, lying as it does at the junction of the Appalachian ridges to the south and the St. Lawrence Lowlands to the north, one might expect it to be interesting from two points of view: firstly in having morphological features common to both areas and secondly in offering the possibility of a comparison between their sequences of development. In recent years the attention has been focussed on two particular topics which reflect increasing awareness of the significance of the area as a field of geomorphological research: the development of pre-glacial topography (Sangree, 1953; Bird, 1961) and studies of glacial geomorphology (Dresser and Denis, 1944; Sangree, 1953; Cooke, 1957).

Recently Lambert and Jakobovits (1960), in attempting to develop a more objective measure of the change, devised a procedure based on the Semantic Differential Scales of Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum (1957). They used the term "semantic satiation" to refer to the decrease in extremity of rated meaning on these scales after repetition or fixation and related the decrease to the concept of "reactive inhibition" (Hull, 1943).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambert, Wallace E.
