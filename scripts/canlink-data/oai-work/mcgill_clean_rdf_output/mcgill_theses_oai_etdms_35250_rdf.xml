This is also a key issue in more serious applications like an automobile driver  training simulator. In order to determine where the vehicle is at any time, while  the speed is controlled with the trainee's accelerator pedal, we need a  computationally efficient way to establish this position by, say, defining an arc  length parameterized curve to represent the "road" or other trajectory  constraint. To compute the are length of a parametric curve or define the arc length  parameterized curve using the analytical methods compromises many real-time  simulations where designers compete to continuously add realism enhancing visual and  audio effects. In this thesis, an efficient and novel way to parameterize a cubic  curve with respect to arc length is adapted and implemented. Its use in real-time  application is demonstrated and its performance is compared to that of another  recently proposed method. The main advantage of our approach is the simplicity. That  is, Bezier segments are subdivided as required and arc length parameterization is  obtained offline for fast look-up, thus requiring less computation in  real-time.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x455s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731452v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw95051089"><dcterms:title>After the riot : taking new feminist youth subcultures seriously</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wilson, Angela, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis argues that in North America since the late 1980s,  young women's interest in feminism has been expressed through participation in  feminist music subcultures. The project provides an overview of the studies of  culture, musical subculture, and gender and music making, as well as an historical  context of feminism and a discussion of the relationship between second and third  wave feminism. The first case study explores Riot Grrrl's roots in the DIY  activism of DC hardcore punk, its links to the female-oriented indie music scene of  Olympia, Washington, and the subculture's use of alternative media. The second study  examines efforts to integrate queer politics into third wave feminism through  lesbian punk rock music subculture. The final study of electronic feminist punk rock  examines how young feminists use alternative media such as zines, internet message  boards, web sites, music making, and performance to educate young women about sexual  abuse and homophobia. Analysis of the Riot Grrrl, lesbian punk rock, and electronic  feminist punk rock subcultures demonstrates how young women claim spaces for their  own feminist politics, even if they have gone relatively undetected by the  mainstream culture.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt24p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95051089</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lesbian musicians</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feminism and music</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lesbian feminists</dc:subject><dc:subject>Punk rock music</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad217qq113"><dcterms:title>A doubly-fed induction generator and energy storage system for wind power applications /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Abbey, Chad</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Wind generation has become the most important alternate energy  source and has experienced increased growth in Europe during the past decade while  more recently, the same trends have been exhibited in North America. Although it has  great potential as an alternative to less environmentally friendly energy sources,  there are various technical challenges that cause wind to be regarded negatively by  many utilities. Others are hesitant to accept its widespread implementation,  particularly when the penetration of wind in a given area is high. This work presents the addition of an energy storage system to a  wind turbine design. Various advantages are exhibited for the wind turbine with  energy storage. Firstly, the generator is capable of accurately controlling the  output power of the generator and inevitably of the wind park. Reactive power  requirements are also reduced as a result of a more stable voltage at the point of  interconnection. In addition, improved transient performance is exhibited for  various local disturbances.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462604x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qq113</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Energy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b661z"><dcterms:title>Universal codes of ethics for medical research on human subjects : insights from the community orientation of the Zulu and Kikuyu</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Warrick, Rebecca Whitt</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Numerous ethical guidelines are referred to when medical  research is conducted on human participants.

The literature in  International Relations (IR) understands this concept as a relation, a resource, a  structure, or a social element that changes the behaviour, the position, or the  identity of an actor. Power is therefore understood as a "cause". Yet, at  the methodological level the causal conception of power is not fruitful. This thesis  offers a non-causal conceptualization of power. After reviewing the IR literature on  power, it shows that power is a spectacular instant-image that emanates from the  "screenal " space. This definition is based upon the under-researched  variables of "time" and "space" of power. The argument relies  both on an "instantaneous" temporal understanding (phenomenology, factual  history) and on a "videopoliticized" spatial understanding (television  screen as political space) of international affairs.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b6627.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm82x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Power (Philosophy)</dc:subject><dc:subject>International relations</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m7181"><dcterms:title>Your roots will be here, away from your home : migration of Greek women to Montreal 1950-1980</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dounia, Margarita</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Ce travail est une analyse historique de l'experience migratoire  feminine, examinee par le coin de femmes emigrants grecques.

The first part of the study analyses the religions beliefs of  Porphyry (232--305 AD). With this analysis, I demonstrate that Iamblichus rectified  Porphyry's philosophical approach to religion, which minimizied the distinctions  between magic and religion.

New techniques are developed, pharmaceutical companies  manufactured thousands drugs and medical devices each year, these products are put  on the market immediately; therefore, the consequences can be  terrible. In the US, thousands even millions of people suffer from  personal injuries because they use a defective medical product; this is referred as  a mass tort. The class action procedure is often used in order to repair these  personal injuries. Plaintiffs always ask for the use of this procedure, but the  federal American courts always refuse the certification of the class because the  conditions of Rule 23(b)(3) are not fulfilled. This is what is called "the new  trend of American courts". The non application of the class action procedure leads to  terrible results; victims of a defective medical product cannot receive compensation  for the injury they are suffering from. These victims choose the class action  procedure because of its advantages, if the class action is not certified they won't  sue individually. If the real problem was the non respect of Rule 23(b)(3)'s  conditions, a modification or a reform of the Rule would have been done.  Unfortunately the laxity of the federal judges tends to influence the American  Congress who ignores the need for a reform of this rule. This makes us wonder what  the real justifications motivating this refusal of certification  are.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j56g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g075x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Products liability -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical instruments and apparatus -- Law and legislation -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical instruments and apparatus -- Safety regulations -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Class actions (Civil procedure) -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xf83q"><dcterms:title>Certain tax aspects of corporate divisive reorganizations in Canada and the UK</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Georgescu, Ana-Luiza</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A divisive reorganization involves a series of transactions  having as effect and purpose the division of the trading activities carried on by a  single company or group of companies between two or more companies or groups of  companies.

The Ogura CMS system originated in radish, but has since been transferred to, and  confers male sterility on, plants in the related genus Brassica . A gene which  restores male fertility is needed for the Ogura CMS system to be exploited  commercially for hybrid seed production in oilseed species such as Brassica napus.  The restorer gene Rfo is a dominant radish nuclear gene that restores the male  fertility to plants with Ogura cytoplasm. This gene has been transferred into  Brassica napus through intergeneric crosses; however the introgressed segment of  radish DNA contains an unknown number of genes, some of which confer undesirable  traits, such as an elevated content of seed glucosinolates, antinutritive compounds  that render the seed meal unusable as animal feed. A fine scale linkage map of the  region in radish containing Rfo was constructed, and a map-based cloning approach  relying on synteny between radish and Arabidopsis was used to clone Rfo. A radish  gene encoding a 687 amino acid protein with a predicted mitochondrial targeting  presequence was found to confer male fertility upon transformation into Ogura CMS B.  napus . This gene, codes for a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)-containing protein  with multiple, in this case 16, PPR domains. Two similar genes that do not appear to  function as Rfo flank this gene. A transcript representing a non-functional allele  (rfo) was detected in sterile radish plants. Comparison of the Rfo region with the  syntenic Arabidopsis region indicates that a PPR gene is not present at the  Rfo-equivalent site in Arabidopsis , although a smaller and related PPR gene is  found about 40 kb from this site.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn81h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx098</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cytoplasmic male sterility.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rape (Plant) -- Cytogenetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radishes -- Cytogenetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Radishes -- Genome mapping.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abr86b406q"><dcterms:title>Photoneutrons and induced activity from medical linear accelerators</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Yi Zhen, 1965-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study involves the measurement of the neutron equivalent  dose ( NED) and the induced activity produced from medical linear accelerators.

However the details of fault geometry and where porosity  develops around faults remains poorly documented. Integration of 3-D seismic,  wireline and production data from Saybrook Field in northeastern Ohio has shown that  the productive trend is controlled by a 3.4mi (5.5 km) long, NW-SE oriented basement  fault that was probably reactivated during the Taconic Orogeny in the Mid- to Late  Ordovician. The far-field stresses of this compressional activity caused strike-slip  movement of the pre-existing fault to create echelon synthetic shear faults that  branch 1350ft (411.5m) upward into the Trenton-Black River interval. Circular  collapse structures between overlapping shear faults are the primary drilling  targets. Faults were mapped using amplitude and coherency versions of the seismic  data. Curvature analysis of horizons mapped in the seismic data allowed us to  further constrain the location and orientation of subtle structures. Fault  morphology provides insights into the path of the dolomitizing fluids. The  distribution of porosity, and thus the location of the reservoir, has been mapped in  3-D using a seismic attribute study that integrated wireline log-based measurements  of porosity with seismic attributes. Our results show that the best porosity is  developed in areas between overlapping synthetic shear faults. These locations  likely represent areas where antithetic shear faults formed, and when combined with  minor dip-slip movement created conduits for subsequent porosity generating fluids.  The results of this study and the methodology presented here have application in  analog settings elsewhere.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r379.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf31v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A765371816"><dcterms:title>Multi-scale analysis of the effects of forestry operations on the stream morphology and sedimentology of the Cascapédia River, eastern Québec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rousseau, Mélanie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Forest harvesting is blamed for a perceived increase in the  flashiness and turbidity of the Cascapedia River's water. This has raised questions  over the source of the sediment (harvest parcels, roads, or stream banks) and its  potential impact on the sedimentology of the river. The objectives of this research  are twofold. The first is to ascertain if harvesting operations are associated to a  widening of low-order tributaries, creating a source of sediment. The second is to  determine if variations in the sedimentology along four segments of the Cascapedia  can be associated to harvesting operation intensity. Firstly, analysis of stream  width in low-order tributaries shows that, once the variations associated with basin  area and D50 are removed and within the range of harvesting in our dataset, there  appears to be a 25% increase in width associated with the harvesting activities of  the last five years, as well as with road density, both in a 60 m stream buffer for  a number of the sampled streams. Secondly, the models relating harvesting intensity  and changes in sedimentology are sensitive to a few sites or contrary to theory.  Future studies should determine the underlying hydrological processes responsible  for stream enlargement and the process of sediment deposition.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv54c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765371816</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Logging -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sediment transport -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed.</dc:subject><dc:subject>River channels -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zn99w"><dcterms:title>Male germ cell development in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mouse model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Neaga, Oana-Raisa</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the  reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a substrate  for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.

If at all, they  only address it much later in the development cycle. However, most modern systems  can benefit from some form of fault-tolerance. Especially, complex, concurrent,  distributed, or heterogeneous applications are likely to contain software design  faults that can lead to system failures. In case of real-time or safety-critical  systems, such faults can also result in catastrophes. This thesis aims to investigate whether software development  approaches have integrated the concern of fault tolerance into the early software  development stages to satisfy dependability requirements. Software development  methods, frameworks, middleware, and other proposed approaches have been studied and  are discussed with particular focus on methodological support. Not surprisingly,  most approaches are specialized, targeting distributed, real-time, and embedded  systems. Finally, a comparison of the various approaches, based on several criteria,  is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mm836.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp16k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73pw64q"><dcterms:title>Improving the spatial resolution and image noise in densily pixilated detectors for positron emission mammography</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hinse, Martin J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In positron emission mammography, the use of planar detector  limits the angular coverage and introduces more noise than conventional positron  emission tomography. We first studied the sampling artifacts introduced from the use  of discrete crystals. The images are reconstructed by back-projecting lines of  response from and to the centroid of interaction within the crystal. We postulate  that the sampling artifact should be reduced by allowing the lines of response to  shift away from the centroid towards the next most probable crystal  element. We then studied noise in the peripheral region of the images.  The solid angle function is an image uniformity correction function. The solid angle  function is the last thing applied before the images are displayed. We postulate  that image quality should improve by re-ordering the solid angle function and the  smoothing algorithm. These two techniques have shown an improvement in contrast,  resolution, and noise.

The purpose of this study was to assess the role  of ROCK (Rho-kinase), a signaling protein in the Rho GTPase pathway, in malignant  glioma invasion in a three-dimensional model system. Primary glioblastoma (GBM)  explants or multicellular spheroids were implanted into a three-dimensional collagen  type I matrix. Individual tumor cells detached from the explants or spheroids and  invaded the matrix, or invaded human fetal astrocyte spheroids. Treatment of  implanted spheroids or explants with selective pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK  was found to significantly decrease invasion. Inhibition of ROCK did not affect  glioma cell or human astrocyte survival or proliferation. The identification of the  Rho/ROCK pathway as being important for glioma cell invasion might be of therapeutic  value in treating highly invasive glioblastoma.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p774h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch08r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af1881m523"><dcterms:title>Simulation of glacial inceptions with the "green" McGill paleoclimate model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cochelin, Anne-Sophie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The McGill Paleoclimate Model (MPM) was used to simulate the  past and future glacial inceptions. This model of intermediate complexity was first  run between 122 and 80 kyr BP (Before Present). After some parameter tuning, the MPM  simulated the last glacial inception at 119 kyr BP. The recent addition of a  vegetation component in the model led to an improvement of the results, especially  for the ice sheet distribution over Eurasia. The MPM was then run to simulate projections of the climate for  the next 100 kyr and possibly the next glacial inception. When forced by a constant  atmospheric CO2 concentration, the model predicted three possible evolutions for the  ice volume: an imminent glacial inception (low CO2 levels), a glacial inception in  50 kyr (intermediate CO2 levels) or no glacial inception during the next 100 kyr  (CO2 levels of 370 ppm and higher). This is mainly due to the exceptional  configuration of the future variations of the summer insolation at high northern  latitudes. The MPM also responded realistically to rapid CO2 changes. If a global  warming episode was included at the beginning of the 100-kyr run, the evolution of  the climate was slightly different and the threshold over which no glacial inception  occurred was lower (300 ppm).</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hv89q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m523</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax633f176v"><dcterms:title>Equations of one and two variables over a free group</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chung, Derrick Kin Hank, 1980-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we study the theory of equations over a free  group.

In  particular, this study focused on the MC calculation of cutout factors for clinical  electron beams. A MC model for a Varian linac CL2300C/D was built and validated for  all electron energies and applicators. A MC user code for simulation of irregular  cutouts was then developed and validated. Supported by a home-developed graphical  user interface, it determines in situ cutout factors and depth dose curves for  arbitrarily shaped electron fields and collects phase space data. Overall, the  agreement between simulations and measurements was excellent for fields larger than  2 cm. The MC model was also used to calculate dose distributions with  the fast MC code XVMC in CT images of phantoms of clinical interest. These dose  distributions were compared to dose calculations performed by the pencil-beam  algorithm-based treatment planning system CadPlan and verified against measurements.  Good agreement between calculations and measurements was achieved with both systems  for phantoms containing 1-dimensional heterogeneities, provided a minimal quality of  the CT images. In phantoms with 3-dimensional heterogeneities however, CadPlan  appeared unable to predict the dose accurately, whereas MC provided with a more  satisfactory dose distribution, despite some local discrepancies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000061q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t252b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Radiation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ank322d95s"><dcterms:title>Martin Streda : a monodrama for baritone and ensemble</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language/><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Svoboda, Andrew</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Martin Streda is a one-act monodrama for baritone and an  ensemble of eight instrumentalists.

This thesis  appreciates the injustices suffered by common-law spouses during and at the  termination of their spousal relationships, and reinforces the view that the denial  of marital property benefits dishonors the dignity of common-law spouses. Common-law  spouses experience similar needs as their married counterparts when the relationship  ends. Most of the current functions of marriage can be fulfilled within common-law  spousal relationships and should more appropriately be called functions of the  family. Both Canadian courts and the legislatures have acknowledged and  responded to the injustices that often flow from power imbalances in unmarried  persons' families and have thereby given increased recognition to common-law spousal  relationships. They have taken stock of the fact that by not recognizing the rights  of common-law spouses in Canada on the basis of their marital status is an affront  to justice. Legislatures have also enacted various statutes and have amended  existing ones to extend certain rights to common-law spouses. The various ways in which the rights of common-law spouses have  been recognized in Canada will be examined and discussed, in particular the remedial  notion of constructive trust which is imposed by courts to prevent injustice and  unjust enrichment. It is argued this notion of constructive trust has proven  effective, especially in cases where property is being divided after a long-term  intimate relationship. Common-law spouses have advanced constitutional challenges in  their quest to benefit from marital benefits and protections in their relationships  since it is argued that both relationships are functionally the  same. Finally, this thesis suggests lessons that can be learned from  the Canadian developments of recognizing common-law spouses. It also concludes by  examining similar developments that have taken place in other countries of Europe  and Africa.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Colleen (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b666b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wg50s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Domestic relations -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Common law marriage -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw3763743d"><dcterms:title>The relationship between competition law and telecommunications regulation : a comparative assessment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Oya, Kazuo</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis seeks to contribute to solving the debate about the  framework of rules and institutions applicable to public utility sectors, by  adopting both economic theories, such as natural monopoly, network effects, and  public goods, and practical analysis of the telecommunications sectors for both  Australia and the United States. Governments must reevaluate the framework  regulating public utility sectors whenever rapid technological advancements occur.  This thesis argues that the antitrust authority better enforces competition rules,  and that the sector-specific authority better enforces technical and universal  service rules. The justification of the special competition rule concerning  bottleneck facilities access should be limited. As for the universal service scheme,  the enforcer should ensure competitive neutrality and adopt pro-competitive  instruments. This framework would allow for a more market-oriented and economy-wide  regulatory administration, as well as enforcement of the universal service scheme  based on a more accurate reflection of the fundamental values of  citizens.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q6977.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763743d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Antitrust law -- Australia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition -- Australia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation -- Australia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antitrust law -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Competition -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
