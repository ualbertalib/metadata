This source permits us to establish the crucial relationship between people and farms and to then link them to differences in capital investment, production and farming techniques. By understanding the common, day-to-day farming operations, we can address ourselves to the larger questions of what contributed to the state of Lower Canadian agriculture, a subject of contentious debate in Quebec historiography. The island of Montreal, already favoured by the geographic circumstances of climate, soil and location, was also a crucible for two profound changes which were occurring in Quebec society during this period--the beginning of a wave of English-speaking immigrants who would permanently alter the ethnic composition of the province's population, and the development of a significant urban market. In the 564 notarized farm leases passed in this forty-year period, half of the lessors were merchants and professionals, most of whom resided in the city and suburbs of Montreal. The farms of the urban bourgeoisie were on average larger and better-stocked than the farms of habitants, artisans and other proprietors. Most attempts at agricultural innovation and more intensive cultivation occurred on the farms of this elite, not on the lands owned by those with less capital resources: capital, not ethnicity, directed the approach taken to farming.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d601.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gm01p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Farm tenancy -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Region</dc:subject><dc:subject>Land tenure -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Region</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agriculture -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Region -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0r967489q"><dcterms:title>Desire in Beckett : a Lacanian approach to Samuel Beckett's plays Krapp's last tape, Not I, That time, Footfalls and Rockaby</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wulf, Catharina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis argues that desire is a major theme in Samuel Beckett's dramatic works. Central to our analysis is Jacques Lacan's concept of the Desire for the Other, as the outcome of the human subject's division. We will investigate how desire is expressed at the level of Beckett's characters' utterance. The characters' attempts at and inability to achieve a reconciliation with their speech correlate with the impossibility of reunifying Lacan's split subject. The first part of our discussion focuses upon desire-as-paradox--the lack of will to desire and the continuation of desire--in Not I, Footfalls and Krapp's Last Tape, whereas Rockaby and That Time are indicative of the regression of desire leading toward the characters' death. The second part emphasizes the dramatic presentation of these plays, except for Footfalls. It will become clear that desire affects the performance and the audience, thus preventing them from attaining a unified perception of self and other.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128c01t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967489q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Desire in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beckett, Samuel, 1906-1989 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lacan, Jacques, 1901-1981.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arv042v10s"><dcterms:title>Geological justification of fractal acoustic impedance models</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Agapeew, George</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Physical analogs to the statistical properties of a theoretical flicker noise model are extracted from published accounts of the character of the record. Analogies are drawn between the temporal scales of variability of sedimentary processes, and the spatial scales of acoustic impedance variability. A linear model is proposed as a first approximation. It is consistent with both impedance characteristics and the dual, cyclic spatial and episodic temporal, nature of the sedimentary record. This model consists of the superposition of independent random processes having logarithmically distributed correlation times. Processes occurring over some discrete frequency range define distinct scales of 'stability' in the evolution of sedimentary environments. The contribution which a range of frequencies makes towards the character of the impedance spectra is a reflection of the continuity of conditions favouring the deposition of a particular lithology. The magnitude of change at a particular scale is a reflection of the recurrence interval of effective processes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860814d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v10s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3b5919512"><dcterms:title>Childhood sexual abuse : disclosure in the school setting</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Barbeau, Andrée Yvonne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research attempted to examine the reasons why children and youths disclose their sexual victimization, as well as the manner of their disclosure, specific to the school setting.

It was hypothesized that if a child or youth had decided to disclose their sexual victimization in the school setting they would do so in a planned and overt manner, choosing an adult with whom they had a close, positive and trusting relationship; a positive authority figure. Both hypotheses were borne out, although the strongest predictors of planned disclosure in this study, were that the victim had a positive relationship with the adult they told, knew them fairly well, and that they were being abused by their natural father or live-in father-figure.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf791.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b5919512</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>School children -- Social conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sexually abused children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x254n"><dcterms:title>Design of circuit breakers for large area CMOS VLSI circuits</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Madhyastha, Sadhana</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Large-area ICs require adequate defect-tolerance to achieve a reasonable yield. One concern is that the power distribution network is shared by a number of modules, and any single short between the supply (V$ sb{dd}$) and ground can disable all these modules. The object of this thesis is to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating circuit breakers in large area ICs, which provide protection against such defects by disconnecting the defective modules from the array. A critical analysis and comparison of MOS transistors and parasitic bipolar transistors as circuit breakers are carried out. It is shown that MOS transistors offer a better and a more practical solution than their bipolar counterparts. Several rules applicable to a MOS circuit breaker in a bulk CMOS process are defined and discussed. These rules, if strictly adhered to, are predicted to result in a design which is defect-tolerant, latch-up free and optimal in size. The design of a large MOS transistor, based on the Manhattan style of "waffle-iron" design is described. Results of two test chips provide the experimental validation of this design. The peak instantaneous current through the modules has to be known in order to realize a circuit breaker of optimal size. A preliminary analysis of a possible technique to estimate the magnitude of this worst case peak current for a CMOS combinational block is carried out. Finally a short discussion on the defect sensitivity of the power switch is presented.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3656245.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x254n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n4533"><dcterms:title>Les Chemins de Milarepa /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Music</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Desjardins, Jacques A., 1962-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This project consists of two parts. The first part is a composition for orchestra of approximately thirteen minutes in duration. The second part, an analysis of the work, describes the music in terms of its form, harmony, rhythm and orchestration. The piece can be considered as a free rondo in the sense that it does not necessarily follow the usual plan of the classical rondo. This particular composition sometimes displays two verses in a row, thus trying to introduce some new ideas into this very old type of musical form. In terms of harmony, the work deals with two basic categories of chords. First, some chords are designed as to show different ways of combining together the two whole-tone scales. Second, the chords sometimes mimic the behaviour of the harmonic series by using a decreasing sequence of harmonic intervals from the lower register to the upper register. The rhythms of the piece mainly follow Olivier Messiaen's theory of added durations. Finally, the orchestration aspect basically shows examples of chords which are held still in a certain number of voices while they are slightly ornamented by other voices in the orchestra. This device has simply been named the technique of "simmering sound".</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h865.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n4533</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orchestral music -- Scores.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At435gf17c"><dcterms:title>Optimizing racquethead-shuttle interaction for an effective overhead forehand clear in badminton</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Currie, Gary</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this investigation was to determine, the difference in selected kinematic variables of the shuttle-racquet head interaction for players of different ability levels executing the badminton overhead forehand clear.

The flux J was found to follow an exponential function of the solid angle $ Omega$ subtended by a cone normal to the cathode surface: J = J$ sb{ rm o}$ exp ($- Omega sp2$ / k$ sp2$). Another angular distribution of the ionic flux which can be associated with the effusion of a gas from an enclosure by an orifice is J = J$ sb{ rm o}$ cos ($ theta$), where $ theta$ is the angle from the cathode surface normal.

A technique is presented, using volumetric rendering of tomographic data, to create anatomical perspective projections that can be easily merged with vascular projections. The geometry of the digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) projection is reproduced by the rendering process to enable registration between the DSA radiograph and the volumetric projection. The viewing parameters are calculated from the location of fiducial markers in the image. Each angiogram is overlayed onto a translucent volumetric projection of computed tomography (CT) or magnetric resonance (MR) data, rendered to give a matched view. Until recently, rendered medical volumes have been used qualitatively in the diagnostic and surgical planning process. Since the volumetric projections are matched to the DSA images, the complete set of stereotactic surgery planning tools can be used to identify points and measure distances in the rendered images. A point spread function of the rendering process is derived to establish a theoretical limit on the accuracy of the technique and is verified by experimentation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k833q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g632v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An870zr95v"><dcterms:title>An economic analysis for subsurface irrigation of maize in Quebec /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Drouet, Marc Philippe</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purposes of this thesis are to examine experimental results obtained with subsurface irrigation of maize in 1988, and to provide preliminary plans and an economic analysis for the subsurface irrigation of maize in Richelieu County, Quebec.

However, a review of results obtained at the same experimental site from 1982 to 1988 indicated that the mean increase in maize yield with subsurface irrigation was 29 %. Plans for two possible water supply systems designed to provide 180 mm a year of irrigation water for the subsurface irrigation of 1,250 ha in Richelieu County were considered.

The Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace (CCODP), a major Religious NGO (RNGO), serves as the focus of this study. Four five-year stages are studied to determine how factors such as government, church, Third World recipients, and staff influenced the evolution of CCODP's development strategy. Case studies from Senegal, India, and Brazil show that CCODP has yet to be able to fully employ its development strategy. The principal hypothesis is that Church teachings and initiatives were more influential than other variables in determining CCODP's development strategy.

Incorporation of $ sp{35}$SO$ sb4$ into proteoglycans and $ sp3$H-thymidine into deoxyribonucleic acid used as measures of the biosynthetic response of cartilage. Young cartilage showed the ability to behave in an autocrine or paracrine manner to stimulate its basal biosynthetic rate. Immature chondrocytes respond well to somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I) and insulin but there was no significant stimulation in old cartilage. This data suggests a specific loss of responsiveness to IGF-I in mature cartilage. However, adult cartilage was stimulated by IGF-I and insulin after prolonged incubation times. Adult cartilage could also be stimulated by the addition of fetal calf serum and to some degree by platelet derived growth factor, indicating that adult chondrocytes still have the capacity to respond to external stimuli.

The ultimate goal is to duplicate the role an expert designer performs in synthesizing devices such as transformers, motors, and actuators. A missing quality from these CAD systems is a convenient representation of design space. Interval mathematics is proposed as a means of dealing with this elusive representation. The present work details an interval mathematics package that allows the user to put practical limits on certain parameters enabling the program to deduce the valid design space of the device. This facility permits the system to recognize and eliminate impossible designs and to guide the novice designer through the true search space. Intervals may also be used in other types of expert knowledge such as if-then rules and heuristic "rules of thumb" derived from years of design experience.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763813w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx01d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A47429b440"><dcterms:title>Variation at two hypervariable loci on chromosome 16p in the multicultural population of Montreal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marshall-Shapiro, Adele H.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency distributions of alleles at the 3$ sp prime$HVR (hypervariable region) and 5$ sp prime$HVR, two highly polymorphic regions on chromosome 16p. About 300 DNA samples from individuals of East Asian, French Canadian, Greek, Italian, Jewish and Middle Eastern origin were analyzed by hybridization to probes for the 3$ sp prime$HVR and 5$ sp prime$HVR. The distributions of alleles at both loci are skewed with the long tail towards the larger alleles. The observed heterozygosity at the 3$ sp prime$HVR locus for 281 individuals was 0.91, ranging from 0.85 in the Jewish group to 1.00 among French Canadians and East Asians. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant variation among some of the ethnic groups. The observed heterozygosity at the 5$ sp prime$HVR locus in 225 individuals was 0.75. Heterozygosity varied from 0.91 in East Asians to 0.61 of Middle Eastern samples studied. 28% of samples also display a RsaI site polymorphism near the 5$ sp prime$HVR locus. Genetic distance analysis demonstrated that the largest distance at these two loci exists between the Jews and East Asians (D = 0.119). Both the 3$ sp prime$HVR and the 5$ sp prime$HVR are extremely variable in all the populations studied, and thus will serve as informative markers for chromosome 16p for clinical as well as population studies.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt29w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b440</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Human population genetics -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human genetics -- Variation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human chromosomes.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472x56j"><dcterms:title>Effects of acute and chronic cocaine on the breathing pattern and chemosensitivity in the adult awake and anesthetized rats</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kelly, Gisèle</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Effects of acute and chronic cocaine on the respiratory pattern, and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, were studied in awake and anesthetized adult rats. In addition, effects of the drug on vagal reflexes, respiratory mechanics and gas exchange were investigated in anesthetized animals. Acute cocaine elicited rapid and shallow breathing in awake rats. Ventilatory excitation, but not tachypnea, was present in anesthetized animals. In untreated rats, respiratory rate (f) increased during 10% O$ sb2$ and 5% CO$ sb2$ exposures; f decreased after cocaine, but in absolute terms, it was still higher after than before treatment. In anesthetized animals, augmentation of minute ventilation and f recorded in response to low O$ sb2$ and high CO$ sb2$ were higher with than without acute cocaine. Chronic cocaine depressed ventilatory responses to both stimuli in awake, but not in the anesthetized chronic rats. Neither acute nor chronic cocaine affected respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity of the lungs. Finally, strength of the expiratory-promoting reflex increased following acute cocaine. The data suggest that while acute cocaine acts as ventilatory stimulant triggering behavioral polypnea, it depresses ventilation in chronically treated rats.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vm22k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x56j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Toxicology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3r074w336"><dcterms:title>Sexual behaviors and knowledge of AIDS among undergraduate students</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khehra, Nina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study surveyed the sexual behaviors and knowledge of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among 117 undergraduate students from McGill University, Montreal.

The total sample was split into three knowledge groups, Low, Medium, and High, based on answers provided to questions about AIDS. The data were analyzed separately for the total sample, men, women, and the three knowledge groups. The findings indicated that these students were relatively knowledgeable about AIDS (73.23% correct responses out of 21 items), but were engaging in high risk sexual activities. It appears that personal concern about contracting AIDS, not knowledge of this disease, is related to behavior change among undergraduate students. It was recommended that AIDS education programs focus more on increasing the personal concern than the AIDS knowledge of adolescents.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf709.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w336</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>College students -- Sexual behavior -- Case studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Safe sex in AIDS prevention -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rf69j"><dcterms:title>The effect of body mass and body composition on mean power output in the 30 second Wingate test at five resistance settings /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lopato, Marisza</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose was to examine the effect of body mass and body composition on the mean power output in the 30 second Wingate cycling test at five resistance settings.

Descriptive data were used to explain the intervention program. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to compare the pre-test and post-test performance on Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), and the Pearson product-moment correlation technique was used to compare the results of the TTCT post-test and the Schmidt test. Results showed minimal differences attributable to the intervention and no relationships between the two tests.

In his Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language, Saul Kripke sees this paradox as potentially leading to a radical semantic scepticism that renders meaning itself meaningless, and attributes a sceptical solution of the problem to Wittgenstein. After a critical examination of Kripke's work, I conclude that this solution fails on account of allowing neither for a normativity beyond the subjection of the individual to correction by others in her community, nor for a non-interpretive conception of the understanding. Finally, I propose an alternative solution that incorporates the notion of communal background understanding into that of a form of life and thus preserves the normativity of rule-following and of language.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375x49w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz79t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wittgenstein, Ludwig, 1889-1951</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language and languages -- Philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kripke, Saul A., 1940- Wittgenstein on rules and private language</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x255x"><dcterms:title>Effects of hypoxanthine upon dopamine neurons : an animal model for Lesch-Nyhan disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Heshka, Timothy William</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Lesch-Nyhan disease, concentrations of hypoxanthine are elevated especially in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid; dopamine and its metabolites are reduced in the caudate and putamen.

Behavioural effects were monitored by apomorphine-induced rotation; ipsilateral turning was time and dose-dependent. Turning was competitively blocked by a non-specific DA antagonist, suggesting that dopamine neurons were altered. In hypoxanthine treated animals, a D1 antagonist specifically blocked rotation; catalepsy occurred after caffeine administration. After two or three weeks treatment all groups had elevated purine levels in the caudate nuclei, while catecholamine levels were variably altered.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053h21x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x255x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s599q"><dcterms:title>Measures affecting domestic and foreign competition in the Canadian computer-telecommunications sector</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Frits, Paul K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis examines the Canadian policy and law affecting those services sectors affected by the provisions of the Canada - U.S. Free Trade Agreement which relate to telecommunications, enhanced network services, and computer/information services.

Their use of Western scientific methods to apprehend the study of religion is not systematic. It varies from Abu Zahrah's limited use to Shalabi's exuberant use, both being highly subservient to polemical intentions. Only Diraz shows familiarity and appreciation for scientific methods, without however subscribing to the epistemology of science which underlies them. The resulting relationship between the scientific study of religion and the Islamic study of religion, as epitomized in the fusion of my own commitments to the former and my authors' commitments to the latter, proves ultimately irreconcilable.
