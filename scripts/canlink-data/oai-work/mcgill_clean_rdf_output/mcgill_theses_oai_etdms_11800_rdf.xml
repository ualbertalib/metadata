Detailed study of thèse disintegrations revealed several types not previously reported. Mesons were observed which produced at the end of their range a single proton, a single alpha particle, or one or more of each, and in one case, a secondary meson. Mesons were found among the particles of nuclear disintegrations. Other phenomena included the fast neutron disintegration of boron, the éjection of an alpha and a proton from nuclei, a "star" of 26 particles, and proton tracks with energies greater than 40 mev.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

Consequently, it seemed worth while to determine whether such a reaction might be induced to occur between saturated polymer molecules in solution in the absence of the monomer when a catalyst capable of producing free radicals is present.

Results indicate that in freezing vegetables the slower the speed, the larger are the ice crystals formed. It has been shown that ice forms in and around water conducting vessels to a greater extent than in neighbouring areas of undifferentiated parenchyma cells Injury to tissues is caused by the mechanical action of ice formation both intracellularly and extracellularly.

Since earlier work on plants had shown that ascorbic acid was coupled with an essential flavone, the experimenters proceeded to isolate this substance. From about 200 kg of lemons or 70 L of lemon juice, approximately 2 g of flavone material could be obtained, which because of its yellow color and origin was named citrin.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hoff, H.

L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This paper deals with the results of a study and review of the petrographical, stratigraphical, and structural characteristics of certain basic intrusives, generally distributed throughout the Canadian Shield, which are described as "diabase" dykks and sills. It is found that the cutting relationships reported afford positive evidence of at least four sequences of "diabase" intrusion. Except for degree of alteration, the sequences resemble each other so closely that positive age correlation on a petrographical basis is precluded. The dykes have predominant north west, north-south, and north a act trends. The writer concludes thab structural evidence suggests" the hypothesis that the dykes are emplaced in fissures which began opening in the crust above a basaltic substratum, along lines of weakness striking approximately north west, north-south, pnd north east, during stretching of the crust; and that surface trends have been modified somewhat by diversion of the magma into some pre-existing local fissures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gill, J.
