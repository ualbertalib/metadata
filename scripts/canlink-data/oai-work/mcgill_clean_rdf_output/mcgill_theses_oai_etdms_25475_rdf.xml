As well, it explores how a shared awareness of  authority's performed nature forces the spectator into knowing her own creative  authority and in doing so, heightens not only the tension between gazer and  gazed-upon, but also lays bare the spectator's need to watch a desired object and  the performing object's overarching wish to be watched. The paper's critical  foundation ranges from phenomenological approaches to the theatre and gender  performance to studies on the spectacle of kingship.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.

If and when it does arise, it  is treated cursorily at best and is almost always misrepresented. This thesis  undertakes to re-present the concept of chastity by situating it against the context  of four contemporary philosophical concerns: the problem of technology; the search  for authenticity; the experience of beauty; and the anthropology of violence. Within  this context chastity emerges as the anthropological hermeneutic which reveals human  sexuality and identity in a manner consistent with the ideal of authenticity and the  horizon of beauty. In the absence of this hermeneutic, identity and sexuality are  revealed against a horizon of technology and violence, and confined and distorted  accordingly. This has implications for sex education: the authentic education of  sexuality is an education in chastity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>McDonough, Kevin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c326.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wn51j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chastity</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb4949060"><dcterms:title>(Re)turning home : narratives of Bolivian transnational migrants</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brockmann Rojas, Maria Eugenia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an exploration of how particular Bolivian men and  women who have migrated from Bolivia to Argentina, and have recently 'returned' to  Bolivia, define, negotiate, and (re)create their identities in the migration  experience.

Furthermore, I suggest that this experience  varies according to the multiple encounters with 'others' along the transnational  circuit.

Sorel defines the Histoire comique as a realistic genre by opposing it to  the heroic, pastoral and burlesque genres. Whereas Rabelaisian works showed an  ambivalent and carnivalesque laughter, the tone of Sorel's Francion is both  satirical and univocal. The carnivalesque and popular traditions are mocked for the  benefit of an elitist rationalism. The Francion shows a hero who distances himself  from the popular culture to become a honnete homme. In order to respect the  bienseances, laughter becomes spiritual, abstract and moderated. It attacks humans'  ridiculous shortcomings instead of mocking the dominating classes as did the  carnivalesque laughter in a debunking process. The polite laughter of the Francion  distinguishes itself from the corporeal, excessive and regenerating laughter that  one finds in Rabelais. The satire of Francion prepares for more serious  endeavors.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Doiron, Normand (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666512r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq26f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sorel, Charles, 1582?-1674.

This objective implies defining the human  being considering its history as well as studying its representation in  narratives. In order to circumscribe today's self, we undoubtedly have to  study its historical evolution. Exploring the diametrically opposed conceptions  suggested by modernity and postmodernity will lead us to a better understanding of  the hybrid composition of the contemporary self, which is characterized by a search  for coherence and meaning to a multidimensional and constantly evolving  individual. This definition, so far theoretical, will have to be confronted  with the representations of the self found in autobiographies. The study of such  self-narratives will provide the opportunity to observe in concrete terms the  conception of the human being today. The essential role of narratives will be identified beforehand.  Narrative form certainly allows the representation of the self, but moreover it  enters in the constitution and definition of the being itself. Self-narrative  permits to establish the coherence of the self, hence it clearly appears at the  basis of the identity. Overall, the narrative constitutes the foundation of the  contemporary self amidst modernity and postmodernity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lamonde, Yvan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q676.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wg53m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Postmodernism (Literature)</dc:subject><dc:subject>French literature -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self in literature</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arx913q511"><dcterms:title>Power suits her : an arts-based portrayal of women and power</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wright, Michele E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This arts-based study examines how three women, who hold senior  positions in development organizations, perceive of power.

Using qualitative methods, the  researcher observed, recorded, transcribed and analyzed prenatal visits with nine  midwives and their clients in Quebec birth centres. Findings revealed that relaxed  conversation was a pivotal feature of the visits and primarily served the client's  purposes. At multiple levels, the reciprocal, genuinely dialogic nature of the  conversational process allowed the client to take charge and encouraged her to name  her world. Educational aspects of care started with the client's agenda, assumed  that she had expertise of her own, and affirmed that she could know and act for  herself. The key characteristic of midwives' work was the communication of  confidence in the essential normalcy of pregnancy and birth, and in the inherent  strengths of women in these experiences.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Butler-Kisber, Lynn (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jx61r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs27b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Midwifery</dc:subject><dc:subject>Midwives</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jv24h"><dcterms:title>Pirandello nel teatro di Eduardo</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ita</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Italian</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marotta, Antonella</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The subject of this thesis is an intertextual and  psycho-analytic study of the relationship between two major dramatists of twentieth  century Italian Theatre, Luigi Pirandello and Eduardo De Filippo.

These demonstrate  how this compartmentalization and marginalization is due to a misunderstanding of  the nature of reason and its relation to being, religious consciousness, language  and symbol and reveal religion as the inescapable center of human experience.  Tillich reunites these fragments of the psyche and returns religion to the center of  human experience without falling into the hubris and subjectivity of idealism. This  thesis examines Tillich's ontological approach to knowledge, his idea of  "theonomous" culture, religion as "ultimate concern". It  presents Tillich's understanding of being-itself as the religious source of human  thought, activity; and creation and as the presupposition of truth, meaning and  certainty.

This period stands  out for its unique cultural atmosphere, heavily influenced by the turbulent advent  of modernity. Traditionally accepted norms that dictated individuals' sense of  identity were being questioned as new understandings of class, gender, sexuality and  nationality gained acceptance. Aspiring artists and writers who sought to express  these new identities were excluded from the world of official culture. Many  congregated in the traditionally bohemian Montmartre where a sense of belonging to a  youthful and energetic community afforded the opportunity to struggle and come to  terms with their opposition to dominant ideals. Montmartre became, and continues to  be, heavily commercialised but its enduring legacy testifies to its significance as  herald of numerous social and cultural changes that would mark the twentieth  century.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hellman, John W.

This  is especially as a nexus of legal definitions for biological, intellectual and  cultural resources will inform a National Sui Generis Legislation for the protection  of these resources. Even further, because foreign pharmaceutical companies seeking  plant genetic resources, called 'green-gold', benefit from derivatives of  traditional medicinal knowledge it is important to protect these practices as part  of an entire social and symbolic system. This system can be conceived as traditional  medicinal knowledge is accessed, kept, shared, used and valued as a spiritual gift  that links individuals, families and community in relationships. Change to this  arrangement occurs when the derivatives of it are appropriated for local  non-customary use in Zimbabwe's street markets, in a trade union of  traditional-healers, as well as for research and development schemes. Acknowledging  the spectrum of divergent interests and practices surrounding traditional medicinal  knowledge is a prerequisite to creating a system of protections for it as a cultural  resource. A National Sui Generis Legislation framework that clearly supports and  protects the cultural right of local individuals and communities will thereby need  to identify the important customary and non-customary regional practices around  traditional medicinal knowledge and create entitlements to them  accordingly.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602124x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc41b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Conservation of natural resources -- Zimbabwe</dc:subject><dc:subject>Traditional medicine -- Zimbabwe</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acv43nx56n"><dcterms:title>Approximating periodic and non-periodic trends in time-series data</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fok, Carlotta Ching Ting, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Time-series data that reflect a periodic pattern are often used  in psychology.

Jameson aptly describes an economic  disorientation and identity crisis created by postmodern capitalism. The SI brings  to light a loss of enchantment resulting from mass produced products and spaces. I  describe the way in which the symbolism, architecture, and aesthetics of the  megaplex are a direct result of the space's capitalist needs and form a place that  is alienated, in every sense, to locality. Sorkin and Auge serve to further  illustrate the way in which postmodern spaces are rootless non-places and risk  destroying vital aspects of locality. I will also explore, using Buck-Morss and  Eagleton, how the bonds of the megaplex non-place community are maintained through  the sensual pleasure of virtual entertainment.

Previous research has shown  that the absence of washers can significantly lower the bearing resistance of these  connections. Experimental studies have also revealed that the bearing capacity can  be formulated with a gradated bearing coefficient that is governed by the ratio of  fastener diameter to sheet thickness. A gradated bearing coefficient method, which was based on an  investigation of bolted connections composed of mild steel as well as thin high  strength steel, has recently been proposed to cold-formed steel design code  committees in North America, Australia and New Zealand. However, the new bearing  method does not include provisions for the design of washerless bolted connections.  For this reason a total of 168 bolted connection shear tests designed to fail by  bearing were performed. The test program included connections with and without  washers, which were divided into single and double shear, as well as high strength  steel (Grade 550) and mild sheet steel (Grade 230) categories. The thickness of the  sheet steel material ranged between 0.43 mm and 1.53 mm. In addition, data for 381  washerless bolted connection specimens from previous experimental investigations was  included in an evaluation of current cold-formed steel design standards and  specifications. Modifications to the connection design procedure contained in the  2001 North American Specification were proposed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rogers, Colin A.

The ability to suggest a solution to a novel problem based on the  recall and reuse of specific experiences is a tenet of the case-based reasoning  paradigm. It has grown out of cognitive theories concerned with functional  justifications for the dynamic properties of human memory, and is growing into a  technology for expert systems. Studies examining the use of cases in design have  identified a broad range of application. This approach is well suited for the  engineering design domain. Cases can suggest entire or partial solutions, help  decompose problems, critique proposed designs, point to opportunities or suggest  relevant design criteria. The goal of this thesis is to develop a case database for  induction motors and to test it using a previously developed Case Based Reasoning  system. The testing results show that the CBR's adaptation mechanism system  (previous work of Dr. Quang) which combines different knowledge sources and multiple  reasoning paradigms can provide a dynamic environment for examining different design  requirements and suggest ways for solving design problems from its routine and  non-routine to creative design.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lowther, D.

Four instrumental analyses were employed. They were Sleeve UV  Transmittance (SUVT), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), and  Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray  Microanalysis (EDX). It was verified that permanent foulants were trapped initially  by the inherent holes and peaks on sleeve surfaces. After long term periodical  chemical/mechanical cleaning, the wipers of cleaning systems would damage sleeve  surfaces severely, causing scratches or holes with wide surface areas, which may be  termed mechanical deterioration of the sleeves. Thus, foulants would be trapped more  easily by these scratches, and would be attached tightly to the surfaces of these  scratches or to each other. Using instrumental analyses, the compositions of  permanent foulants were found to be site specific. In general, iron, aluminum,  calcium, magnesium and phosphorus composed the majority of the components of the  permanent foulants. This research attempted to correlate permanent fouling to the  site-specific wastewater quality. However, although it seemed that wastewater  quality could affect permanent fouling to some extent, there was no robust  relationship between them. Thus, wastewater quality parameters cannot be used at  this stage to predict the future influence of that wastewater on permanent fouling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehr, Ronald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x182.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh384</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t2555"><dcterms:title>Analysis of the steady flows past symmetr[i]cal thickness airfoils using velocity singularities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Raica, Bogdan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a method based on velocity singularities  applied to the analysis of steady flows over symmetrical thickness airfoils. The  method of velocity singularities has been originally developed by Mateescu for the  analysis of steady flows past thin airfoils and makes use of special singularities  associated to the leading edge and ridges of the airfoil to represent the complex  perturbation velocity. The application of the linear method to symmetrical thickness  airfoils presents inaccuracies near the leading and trailing edges of the airfoils  (namely, the magnitude of the perturbation velocity in the vicinity of these points  is infinite). The aim of the present thesis is to provide a non-linear extension of  the velocity singularities method, in order to eliminate these  inaccuracies. Closed form solutions were derived for the perturbation velocity  for various airfoils with pointed and rounded leading edges. The non-linear boundary  conditions on the airfoil have been vigorously implemented in the present analytical  formulation. The present method has been validated by comparison with the  exact solutions obtained by conformal transformation for the lenticular circular-arc  airfoils and for Karman-Trefftz airfoils, and by experimental results for NACA  airfoils. The present solution was found in very good agreement with these previous  results.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mateescu, D.

Traditionally, RF circuits are implemented  using high performance technologies such as GaAs or SiGe in order to minimize noise  and achieve high gain. However, those high performance processes are incompatible  with mainstream digital circuitry, which are usually implemented in CMOS  technologies. In this thesis, an RF receiver frontend which consists of a  differential low noise amplifier, active mixers, passive mixers, and a quadrature  voltage-controlled oscillator, for 5 GHz applications are designed and manufactured  in a digital CMOS process, in order to demonstrate the RF potential of CMOS  processes. We explore the use of simple circuit topologies and common packaging to  build CMOS receivers that can operate from IV supplies and lower, while providing  reasonable image rejection without the use of any special image rejection filters.  In addition, a high image rejection receiver is explored after designing it based on  good and simple frequency planning. Apart from inductors and capacitors, transformers are very  useful passive components in RF applications. For example, transformers can act as  on-chip single-ended to differential converters. In this thesis, a comprehensive  study of transformer modeling is presented and discussed. A modeling program has  been developed, and its accuracy verified through measurements of several  transformer prototypes fabricated in a variety of state-of-the-art CMOS  technologies. The program allows the generation of compact lumped transformer models  to be used in circuit simulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>El-Gamal, Mourad N.

The  purpose is to find the forming loads, the thickness changes and the springback  angles. It has been found that the springback angle after unloading depends on the  amount of blankholding pressure, the material properties, and the tool geometry.  Increasing the blankholding pressure almost eliminates the springback if the tensile  stress caused by the blankholding pressure reaches the yield in the material. To  compliment the experiments, a theoretical model has been developed by calculating  the tensile strain developed from applying the blankholding pressure. This strain  then was considered in finding the total bending moment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemes, James A.

Ductile coupling beams must possess excellent  energy absorption characteristics and significant ductility. Coupling beams with  small span-to-depth ratios typically utilize diagonal bars to resist the shear and  flexure. The present method for the confinement of the diagonal reinforcement  requires closely spaced seismic hoops. This type of coupling beam is difficult to  assemble and has several areas of congested steel bars. To simplify construction and  ease the steel congestion, it is proposed that the confinement of the diagonal bars  be provided by headed bars. Two full-scale coupling beam specimens, one with confining hoops  and one with headed bar confinement, were tested under reversed cyclic loading at  McGill University. Both specimens contained identical diagonal bars and distributed  reinforcement and were constructed from the same batch of concrete. The responses of  the specimens were compared with respect to the general hysteretic responses,  including ductility, energy absorption and load sustainability. The specimen using  headed bar confinement performed as well as, or better than the specimen with  seismic hoops. The ease of construction and excellent performance of the specimen  containing headed bars make this type of confinement a viable alternative for  ductile coupling beams.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, D.

Subjects lay supine with their foot attached to an electro-hydraulic actuator by a custom-fitted boot. Series of pseudo-random binary sequences were used to rotate the ankle. The position, torque, and EMG recorded during these perturbations were used to separate the reflex and intrinsic contributions of ankle stiffness. The results of this study showed that ankle stiffness was increased in four (4) stroke patients, mostly due to the increased reflex stiffness component. Furthermore, the changes in reflex stiffness varied with position; ankle stiffness increased in these stroke subjects as the ankle was dorsiflexed.

Germline missense mutations in human MLH1 (hMLH1) are frequently detected and their  functional characterization is critical to the development of genetic testing for  HNPCC. We used several functional assays to characterize two hMLH1 mutations: T117M  and R182G. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were transformed with hMLH1 cDNA expression  vectors containing either mutation. The presence of functional hMLH1 produces an  accumulation of mutations in mismatch repair (MSM)-proficient yeast due to MLH1  protein homology and interference with normal MMR. The transformants were tested for  increased mutation rates using three assays: mutation of the gene for canavanine  resistance (CAN1 ), reversion of the hom 3--10 allele, and insertion-deletions at a  dinucleotide repeat regulating expression of beta-galactosidase. Based on the  results of these assays T117M is likely a functional mutation while R182G may be a  polymorphism. We conclude that this assay may be applicable in genetic testing for  HNPCC.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trifiro, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Gordon, Philip (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d4849.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w054x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apc289j63w"><dcterms:title>Design and implementation of an XML web service : stock information service</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zhang, Hua, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>XML has been extensively adopted by the industries for data  exchange in the E-business environment.
