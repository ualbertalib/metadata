The larvae were videotaped to determine effects of food quality, food quantity, and nutrient deprivation on vertical distribution of larvae over time. At least two-thirds of the larvae consistently aggregated at the surface and on the bottom. The proportion depended on the nature of the substratum and was influenced by nutrient deprivation. In contrast, density of larvae in the 3 remaining zones was consistently low and was unaffected by either of these variables. Larvae were typically very active during a 15 minute period of acclimation upon introduction into the observation arena; subsequently, levels of activity declined. Most starved larvae in the presence of a high-quality food substrate fed to repletion faster than fed larvae, whereas in an arena devoid of food, they foraged on the bottom for a longer duration of time than the fed. With a substrate of a semi- or highly non-nutritive nature, foraging again appeared more intense among starved than fed individuals. Starved larvae consistently aggregated on the bottom, in contrast to fed individuals that became more evenly distributed between the surface and the bottom.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lewis, David J.

Dimeric GSTs come from a multigene family and their subunits can be grouped into five classes $( alpha, mu, pi, zeta, theta)$ based on amino acid homology. These isozymes catalyze the conjugation of glutathione with a wide variety of electrophiles, thereby protecting important cellular constituents from electrophilic attack. Light microscope immunocytochemistry using antibodies raised against the Ya and Yc subunits of the alpha class and the Yb$ sb1$ and Yb$ sb2$ subunits of the mu class revealed the distribution. The variability and immunoreactivity to the various subunits of GSTs in the epithelial cells of the extratesticular ducts indicate a marked evolution of the potential role in the detoxification of electrophiles during development and a specialization of this function in the various types of cells along the epididymal epithelium in adult animals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hermo, L.

The experiment tested the effects of different watertables on soybean yields, and on moisture distribution and nitrogen concentration of the soil profile. The watertable depths were 40, 60, 80, and 100 centimeters (cm). Yields were measured in terms of number of beans per plant, number of pods per plant, number of beans per pod, and seed protein content at harvest. Soil samples collected at depths of 30 and 70 cm from the soil surface were analyzed for moisture content and NO$ sb3 sp-$-N and NH$ sb4 sp+$-N concentrations. The experimental results showed that controlled watertable management increased the yield and decreased soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N levels. The best results from the watertables tested were found to be at 60 and 80 cm.

This thesis describes a method and supporting tool to address these needs. The method is based on an empirically derived contingency model consisting of a definition of the characteristics of a software process model and an environment, and their inter-relationships. The tool, on the other hand, makes the method operational by accepting, as input, the characteristics of a software process and its environment and producing, as output: (i) an evaluation of how fit (or congruent) the model of the process is in the given environment, and (ii) design suggestions for building a customized process model. In this thesis, we demonstrate the usage of the tool by giving examples from three applications: fitness evaluation and improvement of a process model, selection of the fittest process model from among several models, and process reuse. The data used in the examples was gathered in a field study of fifteen software projects, and the method was validated using data from 6 of these projects.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569568c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f48v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hw65b"><dcterms:title>Randomized controlled trial of artesunate plus tetracycline versus standard treatment (quinine plus tetracycline) for uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria in Brazil</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Duarte, Elisabeth Carmen</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A triple blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken in a Brazilian Amazon region (Cuiaba-MT), to compare the effectiveness and side effects of oral artesunate (7 days, total dose = 0.75 g) plus tetracycline (7 days, total dose = 10.5 g) (AT) and oral quinine (3 days, total dose = 6 g) plus tetracycline (7 days, total dose = 10.5 g) (QT). Eligible patients had uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria; age $ geq$ 14 years; no previous malaria treatment related to the present attack; and, if women, indication of absence of pregnancy. Clinical exam and blood tests were performed at baseline (day 0) and thereafter at days 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28. Effectiveness was assessed by cure rates (WHO criteria) and parasite clearance at day 2. 176 patients were randomized, 88 to each group. 96.6% of the AT group and 93.2% of the QT group completed the 7-day treatment. 81.8% of the AT group and 78.4% of the QT group completed follow-up visits to day 28. Groups had similar clinical characteristics at baseline. The incidence of side effects was much higher in the QT group (82%) than in the AT group (50%) (p $&lt;$ 0.0001). Cure rates were similar: 80% in the AT and 77% in the QT group (p = 0.68). Parasitemia (by day 2) cleared faster in the AT group than in the QT group (98.5% versus 47.6%, respectively) (p $&lt;$ 0.0001).

Comparison of different data sources for the completeness of ascertainment of injury mortality showed that no single source of information provided a complete count of deaths. Coroners' reports provided some details on the circumstances of fatal events but would gain usefulness if police and coroners employed a more structured approach to the collection of information on the circumstances of injury deaths. Circumstances of deaths were obtained from mortality interviews with relatives of victims. Drownings were the most common cause of injury death. Groups at high risk of drowning were adult males during boating and snowmobile transport for hunting and toddlers not supervised during their play near the water. None of the victims had worn a personal flotation device. Motor vehicle fatalities affected adult males and were often associated with acute alcohol ingestion. Few victims wore safety belts. Suicides affected mostly males. Half of the suicides resulted from gunshot wounds and 70 percent of victims had ingested alcohol prior to the event. Detailed information on the determinants of injury mortality should help in establishing injury prevention strategies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barss, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Robinson, Elizabeth (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x9726.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z9091</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rm59h"><dcterms:title>Spectral interpretation of the melting layer using a wind profiler</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Drummond, Fiona Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A boundary-layer wind profiler has been operated continuously in downtown Montreal as a collaborative project of McGill University and the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory. The records contain hundreds of hours of data on the melting layer of snow, consisting of Doppler spectra in the vertical profiler beam with a typical height resolution of 100 m and a time resolution of about 1 minute. A particular case study day was selected for analysis of precipitation processes associated with the melting of snow to become rain. We have examined the Doppler spectra just above and below the melting layer for evidence of aggregation or breakup during melting. Apart from the complete spectrum, we also show that the product of the mean Doppler velocity and the reflectivity factor in snow should be equal to that in the rain if aggregation and breakup are negligible. Both approaches indicate that there are times when snow merely melts to become rain, each snowflake forming one drop, but other times when aggregation or breakup are evidently important. It appears breakup is associated with regions of higher reflectivity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rogers, R. R.

A number of studies have been conducted with one particular combination--opioids combined with the amphetamine drugs. Despite the existing literature, this combination is rarely used in clinical practice. One purpose of this thesis is to review the literature pertaining to the opioid-amphetamine combination. Another purpose of this thesis is to investigate whether dextroamphetamine sulfate ($ circler$Dexedrine) can potentiate morphine sulfate analgesia in rats in the formalin test (Experiment 1). To investigate whether these results can be generalized to another psychostimulant, methylphenidate hydrochloride ($ circler$Ritalin) is used in Experiment 2. Methylphenidate has been chosen instead of another amphetamine drug because it is currently being used in clinical studies without supporting evidence from animal studies. The results of the two experiments indicate that low doses of d-amphetamine and methylphenidate can potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Melzack, Ronald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mk26n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j220n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Morphine -- Physiological effect.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amphetamines -- Physiological effect.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analgesia.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
