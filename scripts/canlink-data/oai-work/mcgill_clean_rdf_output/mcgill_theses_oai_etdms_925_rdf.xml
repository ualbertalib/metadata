If a QoS violation occurs, possibly due to the temporary overload of one of the system components, either the user will notice this and may request a renegotiation of the quality and cost parameters, or the system will automatically do some internal reconfiguration in order to recover from the problem. In the latter case, the system needs to continuously monitor the relevant performance parameters. In this thesis, we develop means for performing such monitoring in the context of a News-on-Demand application. We have designed and implemented a distributed QoS monitoring facility that can be used by distributed multimedia applications for QoS monitoring and QoS violation detection. The system consists of a measurement component and an administrative component. The measurement component is responsible for continuously measuring the end-to-end QoS parameters of connections between the server and client application, while the administrative component is responsible for the overall administration of the monitoring system, which includes raising QoS violation notifications if the quality of service is violated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratzer, G.

This enzyme preparation, purified 10,000-fold, phosphorylated 5$ sp prime$-OH-terminated oligodeoxyribonucleotides and double stranded DNA, yet was inactive on an oligoriboadenosine ladder. SNQI functions optimally at an acidic pH in 10 mM MgCl$ sb2$, but is inhibited by both sulfate and pyrophosphate anions. The estimated K$ sb{ rm M}$ values were 2.3 $ mu$M for the oligonucleotide substrate and 11.8 $ mu$M for ATP. Similar to an enzymatic activity previously isolated from rat liver, SNQI is the first bovine preparation to display both 5$ sp prime$ kinase and 3$ sp prime$ phosphatase activities. Partial purification and characterization of SNQII revealed similarities to SNQI, such as an acidic pH optimum and the presence of 3$ sp prime$ phosphatase activity.

It results in the leaching of toxic heavy metals from waste rocks and tailings into the environment. Solidification/stabilization is a process whereby hazardous wastes are chemically stabilized and their handling properties improved. The objective of the project was to stabilize two tailings obtained from base metal mines in Quebec by adding varying proportions of lime and fly ash to them. The fixing capabilities of the two additives were tested by a modified Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test after 1, 14 and 35 days of curing. Mineralogical changes were monitored by the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of 6 selected samples. Results indicated the capability of lime-fly ash binders in the immobilization of heavy metals. XRD analysis showed the formation of gypsum and the gradual decline in pyrite content in most of the samples. The mineral ettringite was not detected, probably due to the relatively low pH of the samples and a deficiency in reactive aluminum. Hence, the results suggest the existence of other phases, possibly amorphous calcium silicates, which were responsible for the reduction in leachability.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hassani, F. P.

We studied the regulation of APP mRNA expression in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells which had been induced to differentiate in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP. APP mRNA levels gradually increased concomitant with the appearance of differentiated features. In the present studies, Northern blot analysis showed a 3.1 fold increase in APP expression at day 6 of dibutyryl cAMP treatment along with increase in expression of the neuronal markers, GAP-43 and NF-L. Run-on assay experiments confirmed a 2-fold increase in the rate of APP mRNA transcription. Although the half-life of APP mRNA was long, differentiated and nondifferentiated cells showed the same half-life of about 21h. The presence of APP mRNA binding proteins was also investigated. We found that RNA binding proteins were present in both differentiated and non-differentiated cells. These experiments strongly suggest that APP mRNA induction is due to increase in transcription rate. Studies of mRNA decay in the presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, in primary cultures revealed large differences in APP mRNA half-life between fetal neurons and fetal astrocytes without any qualitative changes in APP mRNA binding proteins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nalbantoglu, Josephine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f560g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r84s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adn39x340h"><dcterms:title>Molecular genetic composition, origin, and evolution of B chromosomes in the New Zealand frog Leiopelma hochstetteri</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sharbel, Timothy F.

In order to assess whether the B chromosomes had been derived from the autosome complement, B DNA was isolated and amplified by micromanipulation in conjunction with degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR. Southern hybridization patterns of B DNA probes to genomic DNA from males and females characterized by differing numbers of B's demonstrated that the B chromosomes were derived from the univalent W chromosome which is specific to females. The presence of homologous B specific sequences in B chromosomes from geographically-distinct populations show that only a single univalent W to B event had occurred. Furthermore, a plesiomorphic homology shows that the B chromosomes originated soon after the univalent W had been derived from the ancestral WZ/ZZ karyotype, which is still present in frogs from Great Barrier Island. Finally, sequence analysis of the probes reveals that B DNA is composed of repeat sequences, and has the ability to form stable hairpin structures in vivo. The molecular dynamics of these structures may reflect the inherent propensity to undergo rapid change in nucleotide sequence and chromosome structure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Green, David M.

The results show the advantage of multifrequency, multicomponent tympanometry over standard low frequency tympanometry in differentiating otosclerotic ears from normal ears. In particular, for identifying high impedance pathologies, the present findings support the use of sweep frequency (SF) recording for measuring resonant frequency and frequency corresponding to admittance phase angle of 45$ sp circ$ (F45$ sp circ)$ and positive tail compensation for measuring resonant frequency. The relationship among the measures obtained in this study also revealed that two distinct signs are evident in the patient group; (1) an increase in the stiffness of the middle ear best shown by F45$ sp circ$ measured using SF method, and (2) an increase in the sharpness of the tympanogram best shown by tympanometric width.

It is shown that MM4 captures very well the genesis, track and intensity of three secondary cyclones, their associated thermal structure and precipitation pattern as well as their surface circulations. It is found that an upper-level potential vorticity (PV) ring plays an important role in determining the initiation and track of the frontal cyclones. The cyclones appear to form as a consequence of the superposition of upper-level PV anomalies on the low-level intense baroclinicity in the cold sector behind the slow moving primary cold front, and then they propagate into colder air towards the parent cyclone's center. It is also found that as the MFC intensifies, a mesoscale trough is induced in the low-to-middle troposphere, creating a favorable phase lag between the new pressure trough and a slow moving thermal wave. This phase lag provides a baroclinic conversion mechanism by which the system's kinetic energy could increase rapidly at the expense of available potential energy. Diagnosis of sensitivity experiments reveals (i) dry dynamics determines the initiation and track of the frontal cyclones, accounting for about 59% of the final intensity of the MFC; (ii) the low-level baroclinicity and the upper-level PV anomalies are near-equally important in the genesis of the dry systems; (iii) the Ekman spin-down tends to slow substantially the development of the frontal cyclones; and (iv) surface heat and moisture fluxes could produce a significant impact (i.e., 59%) on the final intensity of the cyclones in the presence of latent heat release, but its impact is small in the dry dynamical framework.

Because Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) tolerate a narrow range of depths, velocities and substrate sizes, the quality and quantity of habitat available to salmon should vary with level of river instability. In the Riviere Nouvelle, a Gaspe river destabilized by deforestation and past channelization projects, the effect of lateral instability on habitat was variable. Fines content in riffle substrates did not show a significant relationship to local bank erosion rates, even where the rate was as high as 10 myr$ sp{-1}$ and the proportion of fines entering the channel was much higher than that found in riffles substrates (an excess of fines in potential spawning riffles reduces spawning success among salmonids). For juveniles, availability of hydraulically suitable habitat was largest where lateral instability resulted in aggradation of the river bed and development of a braided pattern. Hydraulic habitat availability was lowest where erosion patterns led to high planform curvature levels and to scouring of bed materials. In general, because of the relatively high power of the Riviere Nouvelle, structures or processes leading to diminishment of depths or velocities (e.g. aggradation) resulted in an increase in the amount of juvenile habitat available.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapointe, Michel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365728g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z900</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Habitat -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Nouvelle River</dc:subject><dc:subject>Atlantic salmon -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Nouvelle River</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58pf992"><dcterms:title>The use of tarsal scale patterns to identify individual birds of prey</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Palma, Cristi√°n R.

Negative effects on survival, reproductive success and behavior have been reported for most marking methods, significantly affecting the very parameters being studied. Birds of prey have suffered the shortcomings of artificial marking methods. In light of the known and potential deleterious effects of marking, attention has been focused on developing new techniques to identify individual raptors without attaching artificial markers. This study investigated the use of tarsal scale patterns as unique individual identifiers in birds of prey. The American kestrel (Falco sparverius) was chosen as a model. Both legs of seventy-five kestrels were photographed over a two-year period. Photographic comparisons of 150 scale patterns demonstrated the uniqueness of each and therefore its ability to be used as an individual's natural identifier. Furthermore, patterns were found to remain unchanged from one year to the next. These findings support the hypotheses that tarsal scale patterns are unique to each bird and do not change over time. A method of coding the tarsal scale patterns was developed. These codes can be used in a computerized data base to significantly enhance the speed of pattern searches.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bird, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666664q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf992</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Leg.</dc:subject><dc:subject>American kestrel.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bird banding.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Animal marking.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848s513"><dcterms:title>Bayesian estimation from diagnostic test results in the absence of a gold standard</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Paget, Marie-Ange</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In a screening survey for a particular disease, suppose that results from one or more imperfect diagnostic tests are available.

The price level and price variability changes are tested using a T-test and F-test respectively while market integration is tested using traditional price correlation analysis and Granger's and Johansen's methods of cointegration analysis. Deregulation has resulted in an increase in real prices which has also, in most cases, been accompanied by an increase in price variability. The price correlation and Granger methods indicate improvement in market integration under deregulation while Johansen's method indicates similar levels of market integration for both regulated and deregulated marketing systems. Increased price variability might thwart the perceived benefits of deregulation and further research is needed to identify its causes and to provide appropriate policy recommendations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Henning, J.

The results suggest an in vivo role of the cytokines in modulating allergic responses and support the role of Th2 type cytokines in asthma.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamid, Qutayba (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw55f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n0722</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236409h"><dcterms:title>Visuospatial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Naidj, Sonia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this study was to identify subgroups in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), based on a dissociation in their performance on visuospatial tasks: one subgroup with predominant impairment on object recognition or the "What" system, and another subgroup with predominant impairment in spatial recognition or the "Where" system. Also, an attempt was made to clarify the relationship between attention on these two visuospatial processes. Amongst twenty-four patients with AD, we identified two pairs of patients with dissociated performances. However, except for one case, the dissociations found were mainly based on the prominent impairment of the spatial ability or the "Where" system. Based on the performance of cohort, our results suggested that spatial abilities are more impaired than the object recognition ability. In addition the results showed that AD also affects the central executive system, and that the impairments in visuospatial processes, especially the "What" system, may at least partly be explained by deficits in this system. These findings also indicate that certain sub-components of visuospatial processes can be distinctively affected by AD.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Panisset, M.

In order to eventually clone and characterize the Tu gene using a map-based cloning strategy, the chromosome region in which Tu is located needs to be saturated with molecular markers. Random polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were screened using bulked segregant analysis. Nine new RAPD markers, UBC431$ rm sb{420}, UBC431 sb{940}, UBC434 sb{360}, UBC434 sb{1000}, UBC439 sb{520}, UBC448 sb{685:750}, UBC135 sb{240}, OP108 sb{410} and OP108 sb{1305},$ were identified as linked to Tu. Each marker was mapped relative to Tu using F$ sb2$ individuals previously known to be recombinant in the area surrounding the Tu locus. Three new markers, UBC431$ rm sb{420}, UBC439 sb{520} and UBC135 sb{240}$ are within a 5 cM area of Tu. As the number of DNA markers on the map increased map expansion and difficulties in determining a unique order were encountered. To increase the confidence in the estimate of genetic distances, a population of 500 F$ sb2$ plants was screened in order to identify more recombinant individuals around the Tu locus. The population was screened using markers UBC431$ sb{420}$ and UBC135$ sb{240}.$ Thirty-three recombinants were identified in an interval of 6.6 cM. Two markers, UBC346$ sb{1067}$ and OP108$ sb{634},$ tightly flanking Tu were converted to sequence characterized amplified regions (SCAR 346 and SCAR L08). No polymorphism was detected among the SCARs generated. The area surrounding Tu now includes 24 RAPD markers in an interval of 44 cM.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fortin, Marc G.

However, SC places severe restrictions on the use of high-performance hardware and compiler optimizations. In order to mitigate the performance limitations of SC, designers have proposed relaxed consistency models that retain the SC programming interface for a restricted class of programs, and at the same time allow more aggressive hardware implementations by relaxing restrictions on memory access ordering. In cache-based systems, the management of the cache is an important issue in the implementation of a consistency model, since the presence of multiple copies of the same location in multiple caches requires that these copies be managed in a way that does not violate the requirements of the consistency model. Aggressive cache management schemes can exploit looser constraints on event ordering by reducing consistency-related cache-coherence traffic. Location Consistency (LC), a consistency model first presented in (GS93), was designed expressly to minimize the constraints on event ordering, in an attempt to improve performance. At the same time, LC presents a formally defined interface that is easy to understand and reason with. In this thesis, we present sufficiency conditions for LC, propose a cache coherence protocol that implements the model, and present a preliminary cost and performance analysis of the protocol.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gao, Guang (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w437v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278w328</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, System Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nn46w"><dcterms:title>Comparison of photoperiod-sensitive and photoperiod-insensitive oat genotypes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mendez, Jocelyn V.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two experiments were conducted in 1994 and 1995 to compare the field performance of photoperiod sensitive (PS) and photoperiod insensitive (PI) oat (Avena sativa L) genotypes. In the first experiment, bulks of PS and PI lines from four covered oat crosses, as well as the cultivars Sylva, Newman, the PI naked oat cultivar AC Lotta and the breeding line NO820-3L were tested at seven locations across Quebec and Ontario. The second experiment was a seeding. date trial performed at Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue in which individual PS and PI lines of three covered oat crosses were utilized. In the multi-location experiment, the PI genotypes generally reached the different growth stages significantly earlier. At Normandin, Quebec the northernmost site, PS genotypes had consistently higher yields than the PI genotypes. At one southern site (Elora, Ontario), PI bulks yielded more than their PS counterparts. The PS genotypes sometimes had higher leaf numbers in most of the seven locations. In the experiment with different seeding dates, the PS lines had significantly higher numbers of leaves, biomass, grain weight per plant, harvest index, and yield compared to the PI lines. The response of the PS and PI lines to delayed sowing was similar. There was a progressive reduction in the number of days to reach Zadoks' 30, heading, and maturity: and a reduction in height, above-ground biomass, and yield with delayed sowing. Number of culms, leaves, and fertile culms, and harvest index were not affected by delayed sowing. Based on the results of these experiments, it seems that the Di1 gene does not confer any consistent yield advantage or disadvantage. Nevertheless, there may be some northern environments for which photoperiod sensitive oat genotypes are better suited.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mather, Diane (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g99z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn46w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Plant photoperiodism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oats -- Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n5318"><dcterms:title>Antioxidant micronutrient intake and oxidative stress in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McDermid, Joann M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An imbalance of the oxidant-antioxidant equilibrium has been associated with disease progression in HIV-seropositive individuals. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in reducing the concentrations of oxidative stress markers. The objectives of the present cross-sectional study were to evaluate the dietary intake and nutritional supplementation practices of 24 HIV-seropositive persons in Montreal and explore the relationship between dietary intakes of antioxidant micronutrients (ascorbic acid, vitamin E, $ beta$-carotene, zinc, selenium), oxidative stress (plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), leukocyte glutathione (GSH)) and immunological indices (absolute CD4+ counts, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)). Unexpectedly, and paradoxically, a tendency to higher MDA concentrations in subjects with higher CD4+ counts was observed (r = 0.39, p $&lt;$ 0.10). Moreover, supplementation with vitamin E was associated with significantly higher MDA concentrations (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Ascorbic acid intake, even at levels in excess of the tissue saturation (200 mg/d) did not significantly lower MDA concentrations. Neither GSH concentrations nor CD4+ counts were significantly different between supplement users and non-users. In general, the small sample size of this study may have been in part responsible for the failure to detect statistical significance in some associations, however, trends were noted. These included the observation that vitamin supplement users were more likely to have a history of a clinical event associated with HIV infection (opportunistic infection, neoplasm, unintentional weight loss), have a longer duration of IV-seropositivity and have significantly higher MDA concentrations (p $&lt;$ 0.05). In this study, it appears that antioxidants, and vitamin E in particular, were ineffective in reducing the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with HIV infection.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kubow, S.

High frequency, gamma waves are present and occur intermittently on the filtered and unfiltered EEG across the sleep-waking cycle. Gamma activity is distinctive from other high frequency bands, in that the amplitude varies systematically in association with (1) state, having the highest amplitude in Waking and Paradoxical Sleep (PS) as compared to Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) and, (2) behavior, having the highest amplitude in attentive and active waking behaviors and 'active' sleep with twitches indicative of PS, as compared to quiet waking and 'quiet' sleep. Coherence in gamma activity also varies as a function of state-behavior, having the highest values in Waking moving and PS. Gamma activity varies positively with theta and inversely with delta activity over the sleep-waking cycle. Gamma activity is thus shown to reflect the degree of behavioral and cortical arousal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jones, B. E.

One aspect of this regime is the regime of liability imposed on air carriers, which is characterised by a presumption of fault and liability on the carrier, thereby reversing the burden of proof, while at the same time imposing monetary limits to the damages for which the carrier is liable. In the sixty-one years that the Convention has been in force, several points of controversy have arisen in the interpretation of the Convention. Of these, the main controversies are whether carriers are liable for mental injury under Article 17, whether punitive damages may be awarded to victims, and what is meant by willful misconduct under Article 25. Since there are 126 States party to the Convention, the investigation of the above issues is necessarily multi-jurisdictional. The conclusion of the investigation is that in the course of judicial interpretation by the various courts, applying various approaches and guided by different policy considerations, the Convention has unfortunately become disunified.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Milde, Micheal (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430673f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r518g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transportation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5d86p238f"><dcterms:title>Price incentives for resource quality investments : a hedonic study of agricultural land markets in Quebec's agricultural regions 5,6,7, and 10</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lussier, George Richard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Public concern for the intergenerational transfer of natural resources has generated an interest in sustainable development and sustainable agriculture. Policy makers have a new mandate to insure the promotion of sustainable agriculture. At the same time these policy makers must also reduce public expenditures in agriculture. These two conflicting mandates can only be accomplished when private market values for various soil conservation investments are known. Once this market information is known, policy makers can formulate appropriate policies to achieve both goals. The focus of this research is to measure the significant factors affecting land values in the study area. The sample farm sales data used were drawn from four of Quebec's twelve agricultural regions. Two of these regions are among Quebec's most productive. These data were used in conjunction with a Hedonic Pricing Model for the analysis. This research seeks to quantify the implied price paid for land characteristics, soil conservation and capital improvement investments. The research should determine whether the studied land market provides adequate price incentives for private market implementation of soil conservation and capital improvement investments.

However this procedure is still infrequent, partially because there is still no reliable method to preserve the small bowel (SB) for a reasonable period of time between removal from the donor and transplantation. In search of a suitable medium for SB preservation, we evaluated different solutions which have been successfully used for preservation of other human organs (Eurocollins (EC), University of Wisconsin (UW) and lactated Ringer's (LR)) and tried to improve their effectiveness by adding superoxide dismutase and catalase or verapamil. The adequacy of preservation was assessed by evaluating the physiological properties of the intestine in vitro, using either the rat syngeneic model of intestinal transplantation, or human intestine obtained from organ donors. LR is a simple, inexpensive and universally available solution, and when supplemented with verapamil, it was as effective as the more complex EC and UW as a protectant against ischemic damage during cold storage of rat ileum. Studies on human intestine validated the rat as an experimental model since the relative effectiveness of the different solutions was similar, however, the human bowel appeared more vulnerable to ischemic and mechanical damage. The results indicate that creation of an effective preservation solution for the small intestine should be possible through appropriate modification of currently available preparations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zorychta, E.
