Adam Smith also who gave priority to agriculture, stating that capital should first be used in agriculture and the excess invested in trade, paid attention to the benefits that can be derived from international trade. Smith was preoccupied with economic development in relation to the range of the market. The wider the market, the greater the chance for economic growth.

The solution is performed on the Control Data G-20 computer located at the Central Analysis Office at Montreal Airport. The computations are carried out on a 1709 point octogonal grid covering the northern hemisphere from the Pole to 15°N latitude. The two 500 mb cases selected illustrate the efficiency of the balance equation in reducing the tendency for excessive anticyclogenesis frequently displayed in geostrophic barotropic forecasts, and show that it provides a good representation of the initial wind field.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robert, A.

In the past, the major concern of those studying this problem was with discovering whether bilingualism has any detrimental effect on intelligence as measured by standard intelligence tests. The research literature on the relation of bilingualism to intelligence is reviewed in the author’s M.A. thesis (Peal, 1961; see also Peal and Lambert, 1962) where it was concluded that: In view of the weaknesses of the studies reviewed, the best general conclusion is that there is little evidence to suggest that bilinguals differ from monolinguals on nonverbal intelligence, but that there may be differences in verbal intelligence as measured by intelligence tests. At a certain stage in the learning of the second language, a bilingual may suffer from a ‘language handicap’ (1962, p.5).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambert, W.

This report describes the design and construction of the shock tunnel and discusses its hypersonic simulation capabilities. The construction of the shock tunnel has now been completed and it is ready for instrumentation and calibration. The driving gas is a combustible mixture of stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen diluted with 60 to 75% helium to avoid detonation. The maximum mixture loading pressure is 2000 psi. The driven gas is air, usually at room temperature and pressure. Successful evacuation of the test section to 5 microns of mercury has been achieved. The shock tunnel has been designed to produce air at minimum stagnation temperature and pressure of 4200°R and 2300 psi respectively and 0 maximum stagnation temperature and pressure of 14300°R and 20,000 psi respectively1 at the nozzle entrance. Air at these stagnation conditions, when expanded in the test section, will completely simulate free flight conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature, unit Reynold's number, Mach number, etc.) in and around a hypersonic ramjet flying over an altitude range of 90,000 ft to 250,000 ft and a corresponding Mach number range of 7.5 to 18.5. Preliminary tests have been successful and have indicated that (a) the recoil mechanism is capable of absorbing the shock forces, (b) the gun barrels, joined end to end, produce a well aligned, rigid and strong driven section and (c) the actual recoil stroke will probably be considerably less than the initially assumed value of 4".</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Salter, G.

Circuitry of the type used in fast coincidence measurements has been used, with avalanche transistors as fast discriminators and limiters. The intrinsic electronic resolution is considerably better than one nanosecond. The spectrometer was used to examine the radio frequency structure of proton pulses generated by the cyclotron. This was found to vary greatly with operating conditions and to depend greatly on the stability of the radio frequency oscillator. The short-term width at half height was 4 nanoseconds when the accelerating voltage applied to the dees was 7 kV, and the mean value of this quantity for long runs was 5-7 nanoseconds.  With a flight path of 25 feet, the energies of neutrons or protons between 30 and 80 MeV can thus be measured. The total cross sections for neutrons of calcium, potassium and copper were measured in the range 30 to 100 MeV and found to confirm existing measurements except in the case of calcium. The deep minimum found at about 36 MeV by Moody was not confirmed, though energy resolution was sufficient to detect it.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, R.

The term "microstructure" in this case means simply a description of the sizes and shapes of the grains; there is nothing else that is accessible to visual or microscopic observation. The microstructure of a two-phase alloy is more complicated since the grains of the two phases differ in composition, structure and shape. In addition, the second phase may be present as a distinct set of grains interlocking with those of the first set or they may take on the form of needles, plates, rods or spheres which are enclosed within the matrix of the first phase (Fig. 1). The purpose of the study of microstructures or metallography then becomes the identification of the phases and the description of the sizes and shapes of the grains, needles, plates, etc. These observations the metallographer may then relate to the behaviour of the metal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Williams, W.

The cells of the crypts of Lieberkuhn ('crypt epithelium') and the cells covering the villi ('villus epithelium') are of common embryological origin and of similar morphological characteristics, thus together they are called the intestinal epithelium (Paneth, 1888; Heidenhain, 1888).

M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is presented in two parts. In the first part, an attempt has been made to evaluate the possibility of application of gas sampling probes for kinetic and mixing studies of reacting, high velocity, high temperature gas streams. A water cooled, constant area type of probe has been proposed and its internet aerodynamics have been analysed theoretically on the basis of a one dimensional model considering both frictional and heat transfer effects. Quenching rates of the sampled gas have been obtained considering free stream Mach numbers 4, 3 and 2. From the quenching rates, quenching efficiencies of the probe were determined by considering sampling from a H2-O2-N2 reaction system. From these theoretical analyses it has been concluded, that when sampling from a high velocity, reacting gas stream, quenching by convection alone is insufficient to freeze the sample within the sampling time and expansion and dilution of the sample are necessary. The second part of the thesis deals with an experimental determination of the composition profiles of an open, rich, CH4-O2 flame and interpretation of the profiles in terms of chemical kinetics. An atom balance, along the flame axis, obtained from the experimentally determined composition profiles has given reasonably satisfactory results and indicated that there are no large errors in the data as a whole. Kinetic interpretation of the data has shown that CH4 disappears predominantly by reaction with H atom, in the primary reaction zone of a rich flame. An experiment to determine the radical concentrations has been suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, A.

Analyses of the animal body and of eggs reveal the presence of a large number of mineral elements. However only a few of these have to be added to the normal ration either because some are not essential in the performance of the physiological activities of the animal or the ingredients used in the ration contain enough of the ethers in available form. The two most abundant minerals both in the body and the egg of the chicken are calcium and phosphorus. Supplementation of the ration with both of these elements is essential in order to meet the birds’ requirements.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nikolaiczuk, N.

The speed range of interest is scanned at constant acceleration so as to simplify corrections for inertia torque, the speed being measured by a highly accurate tachogenerator. The torque is measured by a magnetostrictive torque meter mounted between the dynamometer and the machine under test, the linearity and reproducibility being better than ±0.5% of the rated torque. A 12 KW 3-phase power unit, which may be operated in either the constant voltage or constant current mode, has been constructed to supply the induction motor. The equipment has been successfully employed in the determination of stray loss at large slips but deficiencies have become apparent when the measurement of loss at small slips is attempted. This will require an improvement in the speed of response of the 3-phase power supply and a method for the continuous determination of the machine input impedance. Methods for accomplishing this are suggested.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barton, T.

Preliminary experimental calibration of this instrument is compared with those two particular aspects of theoretical behaviour which have been dealt with. A platinum/platinum-rhodium thermocouple was used in calibration to a temperature of 1300°C. The instrument is a conductive-convective heat flux device. A fine stainless steel tube is heated by the hot gas and cooled internally by flowing water. The water is supplied by and returned respectively, through one of two copper tubes inside a water cooled stainless steel jacket. It is shown that with proper calibration and analysis the heat flux to the instrument is uniquely defined in terms of only two variables, the tube side pressure drop and the electrical resistance of the needle tube. The latter quantity can be made constant, however, and the heat flux is related solely to the instrument coolant flow pressure drop. The instrument can be calibrated versus other thermometric devices so that the outside film transfer coefficient and temperature can be deduced separately. A linear relationship and a high degree of sensitivity between instrument coolant pressure drop and the external gas temperature was discovered Rigorous analyses of tube side pressure drop of a one-dimensional fluid stream in cross-flow heat transfer and the electrical resistance of a thick walled annular conductor with three dimensional cross-flow temperature distribution are performed. Graphs of these quantities versus temperature are plotted for various conditions of heat transfer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wu, J.

Limitations in this approach have been recognized and laboratory testing is gradually being introduced as another source of information. An adequate correlation of laboratory test results with field conditions has not been established but test results are being published, as in the report on mining practices at Elliot Lake (1)*, on the basis of their comparative value. This study aims at establishing some of the physical properties of an andesite rock by conducting tests on specimens cut from diamond drill core. The results may be useful for comparison with other rock types and for relating laboratory test results to rock behaviour under mining conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morrison, R.

There is some evidence that androgens can be converted to more polar compounds by the incubated glands. Two such metabolites of 17α-methyl-Δ5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol (MAD) have been investigated. One is methyltestosterone, probably formed by the oxidation of MAD by the enzyme, 3β-hydroxydehydrogenase. The other may, in addition, contain one or more extra hydroxyl groups. Even more polar compounds have been observed. Whether these originate from the exogenous androgens or arise as a consequence of diversion of corticoid synthesis from corticosterone is not known.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saffran, M.

But to make the term "rethor” virtually synonymous with "makar," as Dunbar seems to do, is to pass a critical judgment which even in recent times would not pass unchallenged. It is the aim of the present study, however, to show that the great Scottish Chaucerian was by no means using words loosely.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hemlow, J.
