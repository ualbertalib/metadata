For some applications, it is necessary to control the attitude of the base by the use of on-off thrusters. However, thruster operation produces a rather broad frequency spectrum that can excite sensitive modes of the flexible system. This situation is likely to occur especially when the manipulator is moving a big payload. The excitation of these modes can introduce further disturbances to the attitude control system, and therefore, undesirable fuel replenishing limit cycles may develop. To investigate these dynamic interactions, an approximate two-mass system, where the manipulator is replaced with an equivalent spring-and-dashpot system, is used to reproduce the relative motion of the payload with respect to the spacecraft. A dynamic model of two-flexible-joint planar manipulator was derived to obtain its natural frequencies and then, to determine the corresponding spring stiffness and damping coefficient of the approximate system. SInce the attitude controller assumes the use of on-off thrusters, which are nonlinear devices, the describing function technique, an approximate method for the analysis of nonlinear systems, is used to perform a parametric study investigating the significant parameters of three models studied. This study provides some guidelines for the design of attitude control systems when flexibility is a major concern. As well, this study shows that one of the three models studied is a very good alternative to the actual attitude controllers. Finally, simulations are executed to confirm these results and to study the addition of noise and model uncertainties in the three selected models.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Papadopoulos, Evangelos (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk283.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s695t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m8896"><dcterms:title>Fabrication of three dimensional micro-structures by localized electrochemical deposition</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Madden, John David Wyndham</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new microfabrication technology capable of electro-depositing truly three dimensional metal micro-structures is presented. The method, known as Spatially Constrained Micro-Electro-Deposition or SCMED, is being developed as part of an effort to provide sub-millimeter sized tools and extra degrees of freedom to existing tele-operated micro-surgical robots and micro-manipulators. These applications require fabrication processes capable of producing three dimensional structures, with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, using a range of materials and at reasonable rates. Current micro-fabrication technology is,unable to meet these requirements. The three dimensional requirement is particularly relevant given the present dependence on essentially two dimensional micro-fabrication methods derived from micro-electronics. In SCMED, electrodeposition is localized by placing a sharp tipped electrode in a plating substrate, and applying a voltage. Structures are built by moving the electrode appropriately with respect to the substrate. Electrochemical theory, including mass transport to regions of localized field, is discussed, and a model of deposition profile presented. SCMED is shown to be capable of producing three dimensional polycrystalline nickel structures on the micrometer scale, including a multi-coiled helical spring. Vertical deposition rates of 6 $ mu m$/s are observed, two orders of magnitude greater than those of conventional electrodeposition. The process can potentially deposit and etch a wide rage of materials including pure metal, alloys and polymers with sub-micrometer resolution, thereby overcoming important limitations or current technology.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hunter, Ian W.

The key result is a novel parametrization of the motion space from which collision information can be directly inferred. In the development of our approach, we present an original exposition of the looming detection problem, in which we extend the notion of focus of expansion (FOE). The parametrization procedure involves a prior velocity estimation stage, for which we propose a new 4-D plane-fitting algorithm for calculating the normal components of velocity. This method is not only simple and direct, but also provides for a reliability measure to evaluate the goodness of the velocity estimates. These estimates are then combined using voting, which is a technique robust to noise, before being built into a cost function. To the costs function we apply an iterative optimization process, which yields the optimal parameter-space triple $(v sb{x},v sb{y},{ cal R}).$ From these parameters, it can be determined whether or not an object in the scene will collide with the observer, and if so, the time of contact. The thesis also describes the implementation of this new approach. The results are encouraging, and indicate that the method is robust to both noise and occlusion, and performs well in the presence of multiple objects.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, Martin D.

The teletraffic is modeled as an M/G/$ infty$ queueing system. Average error rates and outage probabilities are evaluated for single-cell and multi-cell CDMA systems. Traffic capacities in terms of a fixed average error rate or outage probability are presented. Often in the literature the analysis of multi-cell systems assumes a regular cell geometry with precisely defined boundaries. This condition is rarely met in practice. We have derived an analysis technique that does not assume a precise cell geometry, where the portable unit is connected to the base station from which it receives the highest power. In our opinion this represents a situation that is closer to reality than geographically specified cells. Both CDMA systems with two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell layouts have been considered. Numerical results for CDMA systems with different processing gains and coding gains are presented. It is shown that imperfect power control reduces significantly the CDMA traffic capacity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw17x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z748k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht81w"><dcterms:title>Testability analysis of asynchronous circuits designed from signal transition graphs</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1995</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khomentrakarn, Chusak</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work investigates testability of asynchronous circuits and its relation with signal transition graphs (STGs), using a state based approach on non-scan asynchronous circuits. In addition to the testability characteristics studied, this work suggests some test generation techniques for asynchronous circuits designed from STGS. An event fault, interpreted as either a stimulating fault or an inhibiting fault of a transition, is used to cover the stuck-at-fault (SAF) behavior of an asynchronous circuit. An advantage of such analysis is that test vectors for an inhibiting fault can be obtained from operations on a signal transition graph (STG) or a state graph (SG) rather than simulation at the circuit level. A test vector for a test state is represented in an STG by a test marking for each event fault. The lock relation of signals is a property proposed for hazard-free asynchronous circuit's synthesis. However, it is found that there is a special case of the lock relation that can prohibit the testing of some faults, the introduction of which cannot be avoided by the circuit level mapping. Some independent undetectable faults due to uncontrollable test states however can be detected if the reset state is the test state. Using a minimized two-level sum-of-products representation, each literal in a cube of the sum-of-products form is found to have its own function corresponding to the STG. Consequently, four types of literals are defined and their relations with the SAF behavior over the stimulating/inhibiting fault are analyzed. Although factorization of a logic equation binded to a C-element or a set-reset (SR) flip-flop is not always possible, a correct implementation on a set-dominant SR flip-flop is guaranteed.

The thesis also experimentally implement an algorithm for trajectory optimization for estimation by the LMS adaptive law. Practical methods are suggested for carrying out the optimization. Results are presented based on experimentation conducted on an electric and a hydraulic manipulator; a brief description is also provided on the software that was developed for this purpose. Identification results in one case were seen to closely approximate those previously determined by explicit measurements by Khatib et al. Finally, a comparison between ordinary PD control and feedforward control using the available model shows the promise of actual ability to implement model based control. However, a comparison of the results of the control performance between a direct drive manipulator and a geared manipulator indicate that unmodelled dynamics play a central role in increasing the error bounds of the identified parmeters.

The method utilizes adders which are widely available in data-path architectures used in digital signal processing circuits and general purpose processors. Arithmetic test pattern generators produce test patterns by continuously accumulating a constant value. The generated patterns provide complete state coverage on subspaces of contiguous bits and are thus, excellent sources of pseudo-exhaustive tests. In this thesis, several metrics are developed to evaluate the testing properties of different arithmetic generators. Synthesis techniques for a class of generators that exhaustively cover single size subspaces in an optimal manner are formulated. Other generators that best target various ranges of subspace sizes are identified using an efficient search algorithm. Generators with interleaved output spaces are also evaluated. Detailed tables listing the best generators are provided. The proposed test pattern generation scheme, in conjunction with a previously introduced compaction scheme that uses similar existing hardware, now facilitates a non-intrusive, high quality BIST strategy for high performance data-path architectures. This strategy uses the functionality of existing hardware, is entirely integrated with the circuit under test, and permits at-speed testing, using simple BIST control, with no performance degradation or area overhead.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tyszer, Jerzy (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Rajski, Janusz (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811km757.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km74z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahh63sz01m"><dcterms:title>Development of a model applied to subsidence due to fluid withdrawal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gu, Dali</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A visco-elastic analytical model is presented for the simulation of large scale groundwater flow and land subsidence.

Both design and control of our machine borrow heavily from Raibert's work whose robots use much more powerful hydraulic actuators.

Lacking such estimates, the network planners tend to assume that the probability of failure of towers is negligible. On the other hand, reliability concepts implicit in the codes are not always compatible with those used in reliability analysis of the network, in particular, the implicit probabilities associated with partial load and resistance factors are obtained for idealized structural members and do not address the reliability of the structure as a system. Advances in structural reliability, combined with more extensive climatologic data, can be used to implement a probabilistc approach for the design of towers. The objective of this study is to propose a procedure for calculating the probability of mechanical failure of self-supported telecommunication towers. The procedure introduces the concept of calculating the conditional probability of failure which can be used with different joint distributions of wind and ice with a minimum of computations. As an example, the methodology is applied to the CEBJ tower in James Bay. The structure is assumed to behave linearly and to be statically determinate. In consequence, the structure can be modelled as a weakest link model. The study demonstrates the possibility of estimating the probability of failure for the whole structure using a rational approach. The critical members of the structure and the relative importance of each of the design parameters with respect to the probability of failure are identified in order to simplify the reliability analysis. The probability of failure is most sensitive with respect to the joint probability distribution function of wind speed and ice thickness. Upper and lower bound estimates of the probability of failure are presented for different assumption in the joint distribution. These results indicate the need for a better model for the environmental loads.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chouinard, Luc E.

For a large number of application there is a need to quantify the cleanliness of the liquid metals in the sense that the number and size of inclusions have to be controlled to be below some acceptable limits. The demand for quality helped the development of measuring systems that can count the number and size distribution of inclusion. One of the devices, called LiMCA ($ rm underline Liquid underline Metal underline Cleanliness underline Analyzer),$ was developed at McGill University and has been successfully used in the aluminum industry for a number of years. The LiMCA apparatus is based on the Electric Sensing Zone principle. By maintaining a constant current through a small orifice through which liquid metal passes, non-conductive particles passing through the orifice temporarily increase the electrical resistance of the orifice, therefore increasing the electric potential. The signal processing component of the LiMCA system detects the voltage transients, translates them into particle sizes, and counts them based on their sizes or stores the transients in certain time increments. The current LiMCA system uses analog electronic components to implement the signal processing part and describes a ransient only by its height or its time of occurrence. This implementation has limited the further development of the system for applications where the particle size distribution and particle occurrence must be counted concurrently. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technology has been successfully applied to upgrade the LiMCA system. With this technology, the DSP-based LiMCA system is able to describe each LiMCA transient by a group of seven parameters and to classify it into a certain category with the help of these parameters. Moreover, it counts the classified peaks based on their height (Pulse Height Analysis) and their time of occurrence (Multi-Channel Scan) concurrently for data acquisition. A conceptually new software was designed to accommodate the DSP-based LiMCA and the Object Oriented Programming technique was used to develop the Graphical User Interface which constitutes the framework of the overall host interface.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Carayannis, G.

Equilibrium batch sorption studies were performed using two-metal systems respectively comprised of (Cd + Cu), (Cd + Zn), (Cu + Zn) and a three-metal system comprised of (Cd + Cu + Zn). In the evaluation of the two-metal sorption system performance, simple sorption isotherm curves had to be replaced by three-dimensional sorption isotherm surfaces. In order to describe the isotherm surfaces mathematically, three Langmuir-type models were evaluated. The apparent one-parameter Langmuir constant was used to quantify FCAN2 'affinity' for one metal in the presence of another one. In order to represent the equilibrium data of the ternary system, a multicomponent Langmuir model was adopted and triangular equilibrium diagrams were used. Mathematical models for the two- and three-metal sorption systems enabled quantitative estimation of one metal sorption inhibition due to the influence of the other metal(s). For biosorption on FCAN2 at pH 4.5, the inhibition dominance observed in the two- and three-metal systems was Cu $&gt;$ Cd $&gt;$ Zn.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Volesky, Bohumil (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk29c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042w03k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acn69m615h"><dcterms:title>Measurement of oxygen mass transfer rates in a laboratory batch pressure reactor</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cheng, Terry Chi-Ming, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main objectives of this thesis were to develop a reliable experimental method for the determination of $k sb{L}a$ in laboratory autoclaves, and to apply the developed measurement method on investigating the effects of type and positioning of impeller, agitation speed, gassing rate, temperature, and solid particle on $k sb{L}a$. The new measurement method was developed in a 2 L closed-end autoclave in which the oxygen partial pressure was monitored, and was analyzed mathematically to determine $k sb{L}a$. The framework of the method was based upon an elementary oxygen mass balance equation, and the oxidation reaction of sodium sulphite under certain experimental conditions that the assumptions of zero dissolved oxygen content, $c sb{A}$ = 0, and of no change of dissolved oxygen content in time, $dc sb{A}/dt$ = 0, were valid. In the course of developing the method, ideal gas behaviour was assumed. $k sb{L}a$ values determined by the new measurement method at various conditions in the gas-liquid system were reproduced within $ pm$12% deviation from the average values. $k sb{L}a$ was found to increase modestly with temperature in the range of 25 to 75$ sp circ$C, and was fitted into an Arrhenius plot having an activation energy, $E sb{a}$, of 33.3 kJ/mole within $ pm$5% deviation.

It was used to determine the best of five time-frequency representations (TFR): the spectrogram, the time-varying autoregressive modeling, the binomial reduced interference distributions, the Bessel distribution, and the cone-kernel distribution (CKD). Although important limitations were found for the five TFRs tested, the CKD is the best technique for the analysis of S1. Application of the CKD to study the muscle sound produced by the human diaphragm showed that it presents a good time-frequency resolution for analyzing the frequency modulated muscle sound. Then, the CKD was applied to S1 from patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve. A depiction of separated valvular and myocardial components was observed. The analysis of the CKDs of the intracardiac and the thoracic S1 in dogs under various contractile states showed that the dominant components of S1 are in a band around 50 Hz with a horizontal flat or a semi-lunar shape. There was no systematic increasing frequency component like the muscle sound components. These results strongly suggest that the myocardial vibration due to the contraction of the myocardium contributes little to the generation of S1.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Durand, L. G.

For noncemented, porous coated implants in particular, initial stability is essential for fixation by bone ingrowth to occur. A method for evaluating initial stability by quantifying relative implant-bone micromotion has been developed. Based on the assumption that transverse sections of the implant are rigid bodies, the technique measured motion at proximal and distal sites, two clinically relevant regions of an implant. Mathematical transformations derived from measurements obtained by a series of linear displacement transducers were used to determine the three-dimensional displacement vector of any point on the plane. This method was successful in assessing stability of two different implants under physiological loading using either synthetic or cadaveric femora and different surgical protocols for the preparation of the intramedullary canal. The displacements of points at the implant-bone interface for both permanent and recoverable micromotion were obtained. This method may be of use in evaluating new implants and the effect on stability of alternative surgical protocols.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bobyn, J. D.

However, this distance decreases with time, even under conditions where metallurgical creep of the cable material does not occur, for instance, at room temperature. This phenomenon is first identified as "pseudo creep". The creep behavior of a cable is directly related to its mechanical properties, which correspond to the applied loads under certain boundary conditions. Twist due to cable rotation and radial compression due to layer-to-layer contact are taken into consideration, so that a deeper understanding of what happens inside the cable and a quantitative assessment of their influence on the effective rigidity of the cable are obtained. The radial creep of a cable is found to be more sensitive, since it takes a longer time to saturate owing to the accumulation of the radial deformations of individual wires and the time-dependent expansion and relocations of the hardened areas. The time-dependent behavior of a cable is evaluated by experiments. Comparisons of the configurational parameters that determine the cable behavior are made for particular load types and boundary conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lessard, Larry (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb550.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537313g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Energy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9306t129n"><dcterms:title>Thermolysis of mixtures of polyethylene and polystyrene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brues, Michael J.

There were, however, some differences in the secondary products. No incorporation of one polymer onto another was observed, either in the liquid or the residue. Different reaction conditions were examined. It was determined that using a single reaction temperature (445$ sp circ$C) was as effective at separating the aromatic and aliphatic products as using two different reaction temperatures.

Conventional catalysts (Mordenite and FCC zeolite) affected the overall production and product distributions for mixtures and polyethylene, while only changing the product distribution for polystyrene. Hydrogen in the purge gas only slightly decreased the ratio of 1-alkenes to n-alkanes.

These units represent the wall panels of a typical single storey precast concrete structure. In order to achieve improved ductility and energy absorption characteristic, it was found that the horizontal sliding of the wall panel along the grout-wall interface must be controlled. Due to the reversed cyclic loading and the increased wall panel participation from limiting the horizontal sliding of the wall, it was determined that shear reinforcement of each precast specimen was separated into three separate component parts, joint rotation, wall panel deformations and horizontal wall panel sliding, to compare and evaluate the seismic performance of the wall panels.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, D.

Using a foveated sensor, based on models of the primate retina, affords a compromise between requirements of a wide visual field, high resolution, and small fast-to-process output images. From a review of the biology literature and existing models of data reduction performed by the primate retina, it becomes apparent that overlapping receptive field models are more biologically realistic than nonoverlapping ones. They also provide more flexibility in terms of the type of computation masks that can be used. Examples are uniform, Gaussian, difference-of-Gaussians, and edge detection masks. Thus our foveated sensor is designed to map input images into a cortical representation using overlapping receptive fields. Computing the mapping using the overlapping field model produces a high resolution foveal output and a variable resolution periphery output. We have developed an efficient algorithm to achieve the requisite data reduction. Based on an adapted scan-line algorithm, we show that it requires less memory and computation time than the simpler look-up-table algorithm. A MIMD parallel processing network using Texas Instruments TMS320C40 (C40) processors has been designed to perform the data reduction mapping at rates of at least ten frames per second, depending on the selected model parameters. In addition to frame rate, performance data showing linear speedup and high processor usage are obtained along with measures of the system latency. The output of the system is being used to compute the points of interest for a gaze control system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, Martin D.

The objective of the study was to validate existing non-linear finite element models for estimating the loads and strength of offshore platforms. From August 24 to 26 1992, hurricane Andrew moved through the Gulf of Mexico with sustained winds of 140 miles per hour. Thirty-six major platforms suffered significant damage, of these, ten were completely toppled and twenty-six were leaning significantly or had significant topside damage. Structures "H" and "K" were bridge-connected platforms, located in the ST151 field of the South Timbalier area of the Gulf of Mexico, platform "H" collapsed during Andrew, while "K" survived undamaged. They were both designed, fabricated, and installed in the early 1960's. A push-over analysis, using the program USFOS was used to estimate the ultimate strength of the two structures in three direction: end-on, diagonal and broadside. In the first series of analyses, all the primary members such as legs, vertical and horizontal braces, piles, soil, conductors and deck structure were precisely defined with appropriate finite elements as well as secondary members such as conductors guides barge bumpers. In the second series of analyses it was assumed that there was no horizontal or vertical movements at the level of the mudmat. In the third series of analysis the model used in the first series of analysis was modified by increasing stiffness and resistance of the piles 10 times. Finally a fourth model was investigated in which the soil resistance of the mud-level horizontal members is modelled.

The key result is a method for generating classifiers in the form of conditional probability densities for recognizing an unknown from a set of reference models. Our procedure is automatic. Off-line, it invokes an autonomous process to estimate reference model parameters and their statistics. On-line, during measurement, it combines these with a priori context-dependent information, as well as the parameters and statistics estimated for an unknown object, into a conditional probability density function, which represents the belief in the assertion that the unknown is a particular reference model. Consequently, the model also permits the assessment of the beliefs associated with a set of assertions based on data acquired from a particular viewpoint. The importance of this result is that it provides a basis by which an external agent can assess the quality of the information from a particular viewpoint, and make informed decisions as to what action to take using the data at hand. The thesis also describes the implementation of this procedure in a system for automatically generating and recognizing 3D part-oriented models. We show that recognition performance is near perfect for cases in which complete surface information is accessible to the algorithm, and that it falls off gracefully when only partial information is available. This leads to a sequential recognition strategy in which evidence is accumulated over successive viewpoints (at the level of the belief distribution) until a definitive assertion can be made. Experimental results are presented showing how the resulting algorithms can be used to distinguish between informative and uninformative viewpoints, rank a sequence of images on the basis of their information (e.g. to generated a set of characteristic views), and sequentially identify an unknown object.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferrie, F.
