A theoretically unquestionable method far the determination of the molecular weight of high polymers, in the ranges between 104 and 106, is the application of osmotic pressure measurements, or measure~nts of the sedimentation equilibrium (1) using a Svedberg ultracentrifuge. The importance of these methods depends upon the fact that in the case of their evaluation, only the gas constant R is assumed (2}. Besides these methods, because of its extreme simplicity, the viscometric determination of the molecular weight has been used extensively, particularly in industry. However, the inherent uncertainty associated with the interpretation of the results limits its value considerably. In the present work viscosity and osmotic measurements have been undertaken.

Sedimentary rocks are formed from the destruction of igneous and metamorphic rocks, or from earlier sediments. Features which may have been distinctive of the source rocks are likely to be submerged during the processes of weathering, transportation, and deposition. Sediments of very diverse origins may look very much alike after a long period of transportation, since only certain kinds of material can withstand continued attrition or adverse climatic environment. Conversely within narrow limits the same source rocks can give derived sediments of more or less widely varying characteristics under differing conditions. A sediment is not an equilibrium product. A tendency towards equilibrium is exhibited by the various component minerals at the temperatures, pressures and other physical conditions existing on, or close to, the surface of the earth. Certain minerals are very unstable under these conditions, and are altered to other minerals which are stable. A granite is very stable at the temperature and pressure under which it was formed beneath the crust of the earth. If these temperatures and pressures, and other attendant physical conditions, are maintained, it is conceivable that the granite could exist indefinitely without any changes. Should this granite be exposed at the surface of the earth, it is no longer at equilibrium.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clark, T.

The second phase consisted of analyzing the properties necessary for the functioning of a null detector. The bridge is essentially a comparator and its basic property is to attain two equipotential points to compare the bridge arms to each other. The customary types of null detectors used in balancing impedance bridges may be classified under the following headings-, :- (1) Headphones with or without amplification; (2) Tuned vibration galvanometers; (3) A.C. galvanometers of the dynamometer type; (k) D.C. galvanometers of the d’Arsonval type, preceded by suitable rectification; (5) Electronic visual indicators of the cathode-ray oscillograph type. A more detailed discussion of the various types of detectors will be discussed in the following paragraph. Literature on as many types of commercial null detectors as possible was studied.

The reader will notice the extensive, I will not say disproportionate, use made of Montreal papers such as the Gazette, the Herald, the Courier, the Pilot, the Witness, La Minerve. Le Moniteur Canadien, and L’Avenir. I will not say disproportionate, because Montreal was really the seat of the movement, and although it thrived in the Eastern Townships, it was still largely inspired and directed by the Central Annexation Association in Montreal. This city was where the annexation movement began, it was the acknowledged leader, and many of its wealthy citizens were the movement’s chief supporters. For that reason Montreal papers naturally have a greater importance than Quebec ones. Because of this, and the tendency of the Quebec papers to report the agitation through the eyes of the Montreal press, the newspapers of this latter city should and do occupy the dominant position.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooper, J.

These factors have led to an extensive exploitation of the yellowtail fisheries, especially in New England waters where, in 1942, more than 65,000,000 pounds of yellowtails were landed. Since then yellowtail landings in New England have steadily decreased, although the fishing intensity has increased, and there are indications that this decrease may be the result of over-fishing.

These experiments, varied in kind to illustrate the peculiar value of the apparatus in following rapid independent changes as well as the time courses of photosynthesis and transpiration over long periods of time under the various conditions employed, must be regarded as largely exploratory in nature, pointing the way to further, more refined experimentation. In themselves they are united by a common theme - the relation between photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal opening and the water balance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gibbs, R.

Though there are a few forms of arthritis, like the traumatic and the infectious, that are localized in the joint, it is not primarily a joint disease. This interpretation of the arthritio syndrome was adopted by the American Committee for the Control of Rheumatism foimed in 1928 (302). The etiology of a few forms of arthritis is recognized, but the majority of the arthritides and the rheumatic disturbances are not fully understood. Relatively little inquiry has been made into the nature of the generalized processes involved in rheumatism until recently. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selye, H.

In spite of this fact the progress of elucidation has not been commensurate with the vigor and diligence with which the investigations have been conducted. This is, perhaps, largely due to the involvement of so many apparently unrelated factors. Notwithstanding the uniformity of the symptomatology and pathology evoked by different clinical and experimental conditions various groups of investigators have, according to their predilections, implicated the nervous system, the kidneys, dietary influences, primary disease of the blood vessels of unknown etiology and a host of other agencies.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selye, H.

For most purposes whole blood may be considered the ideal material for replacing lost blood, yet certain conditions, such as burns, in which hemoconcentration is to be combatted, call primarily for replacement of circulating fluid. In such cases plasma or serum may be the materials of choice. The chief advantage of plasma and serum, however, lies in their stability over long periods which makes possible the accumulation of large stores without wastage. The problem of maintaining such plasma or serum in the best possible condition for long periods of time thus assumes considerable importance.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.

The power-angle curve is derived, and the criterion of equal areas used to show the effects on stability of faults, switching and sudden load increases. Those synchronous machine constants which are involved in stability studies are discussed, and an outline, illustrated by experimental results, given of methods of determining them. A short chapter is included on transmission line and transformer impedances. The paper shows how these various constants are used to determine whether a system will retain stability under certain conditions. The step-by-step procedure for calculating swing curves is described in detail, and an actual stability calculation is performed to illustrate it and to show the beneficial effect of clearing faults quickly. Finally, various factors are reviewed to show how power system stability can be improved.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Christie, C.

This equipment was designed to accentuate the primary decomposition reaction. Analytical methods are adapted for estimating the composition of the reaction products, both volatile and non-volatile. The analytical data are tabulated, and certain generalizations are apparent on the basis of this data. In conclusion, an attempt is made to explain the results of this investigation on theoretical grounds.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Purves, C.

The discharge was initiated by an external control electrode. Tubes were made of Pyrex or quartz and had cathodes of mercury or nickel. Work was first done with mercury tubes at low pressures. Later, tubes were made having nickel cathodes and filled with argon. Tubes were tested to see at what voltage they discharged spontaneously one hence if they could be used with the 20,000 V power supply available. A 2500 V power supply was obtained for use with low voltage tubes. An integrating light output meter was constructed for measuring the light output of the tubes. Using this meter relative readings of the light output of tubes used under different conditions were obtained. Fine fibres were set up and illuminated in a manner reproducing conditions of cloud tracks in an expansion chamber. The fibres were then photographed to get an indication of whether the light sources would be practically useful, and of their effects on a photographic emulsion. Emperimental results indicate that low pressure arc tubes are not a practical means of obtaining high voltage operation, Mercury cathodes were shown to be little better than nickel ones in all types of tubes studied; and have the disadvantage of becoming dirty. In gas filled tubes having pressures of the order of a few centimeters of mercury, the light output is greatest when the bore of the tube is small.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Terroux, F.
