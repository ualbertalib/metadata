The interaction of the quadrupolar moment with the electric field gradient is derived from first principles and extended to include transient experiments. The response of the nuclear magnetization to a single pulse for a spin I = 3/2 system, assuming zero asymmetry, is calculated exactly under the Bloom, Hahn and Herzog model and applied to the NQR spin-lattice (T$ sb1$) relaxation in polycrystalline solids. The theory and use of available NQR methods of detection are treated extensively. Improvements to the conventional super-regenerative methods are proposed and the design of a new solid-state detector is given. Pulsed spectroscopic techniques are also treated in detail and approaches to variable temperature design, probe development and other instrumental considerations are discussed. The temperature dependence of the NQR frequencies and spin-lattice relaxation times (T$ sb1$) are examined in a series of model compounds for a variety of different nuclear species. A predictive model for the temperature dependence of compounds which exhibit "normal" Bayer temperature dependence is presented. In addition, T$ sb1$ relaxation times are used to analyze the molecular motions in a series of main group halides.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq387.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s554c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4b29b679d"><dcterms:title>Performance monitoring of electric mining shovels</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hendricks, Carl F.

Hoist and crowd motor armature voltages and currents, dipper trajectories, cycle times and load weights were recorded. A diggability index has been established based on the responses of the hoist motor. Values of the diggability index correlated well with digging conditions as observed during monitoring and with muckpile fragmentation size distributions as determined by a photographic survey. This correlation establishes the ability of an instrumented shovel to diagnose the efficiency of ground preparation practices (blasting) by identifying variations in muckpile diggability. The data on dipper trajectory has demonstrated that variations in digging practices do exist amongst an experienced group of shovel operators, and that variation in trajectory significantly influences values of the recorded motor performance parameters. An approach is described to account for variations in digging practice on assessments of diggability. An allied investigation into the ability of time studies to define diggability, revealed dig cycle times to be operator dependant, and unrelated to levels of digging effort.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505120k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b679d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awm117p584"><dcterms:title>Modelling metallurgical phenomena in ladle and tundish steel processing operations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Joo, Sanghoon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Cleanness and uniformity in steel properties are important for high quality steel. Physical and/or mathematical models can be used in order to achieve optimum conditions for the clean steel during steelmaking processes. In the present study, important metallurgical transport phenomena in steelmaking ladles and tundishes have been investigated using both mathematical and physical (water) models. Through appropriate solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, the intermixing of fluid within gas-stirred ladles can be modelled quite satisfactorily. It is shown that off-centered bubbling gives the most consistent results in terms of minimising mixing times, since angular velocity components intermix fluid across the width of a ladle. Comparisons between mathematical and experimental data are presented. Fluid flow, heat transfer and inclusion flotation have been modelled mathematically for testing the behaviour of several tundish designs. Computations are presented to illustrate the importance of thermal natural convection currents in mixing the upper and lower layers of steel. Particle removal rates are also experimentally studied with the aid of the novel E.S.Z. (Electric Sensing Zone) system, and compared with computational results.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh48c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p584</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xj37z"><dcterms:title>The "classical" monetary theories of Marshall, Wicksell, and Keynes and the General theory's critique : equilibrium, price trends, and cycles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gaynor, William Beryl</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We first demonstrate the importance of the doctrines of the quantity theory and the long-period stationary state in the formulation of Marshall's, Wicksell's, and Keynes' pre-General Theory monetary theories.

These studies were done in the SarCNU-sensitive SK-MG-1 glioma cells and the 20-fold more resistant SKI-1 cells. Indirect evidence for a sarcosinamide-related uptake for SarCNU was obtained by using cytotoxicity as an indicator for transport in SK-MG-1 cells. The transport of radiolabelled sarcosinamide was shown to proceed via facilitated diffusion, an energy-independent, carrier-mediated process which also accommodates SarCNU. Epinephrine was identified as the native substrate for this uptake which is similar to the catecholamine uptake 2. The source of resistance to SarCNU in SKI-1 cells was also examined. The decreased steady-state accumulation of SarCNU shown in SKI-1 cells was not secondary to the observed alterations in the kinetics of SarCNU transport in these cells. The decrease in SarCNU-induced DNA crosslinks noted in SKI-1 cells was neither a result of increased expression of ERCC-1 RNA nor repair by the O$ sp6$-alkylguanine DNA transferase nor the 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase activity. The slight elevation of glutathione transferase (GST) mu RNA in SKI-1 cells suggests that detoxification may contribute to resistance. These results indicate that resistance to SarCNU may be mediated by increased drug efflux and/or alternative DNA repair in SKI-1 cells.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hw05w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b612</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g8258"><dcterms:title>Import of proteins into Mitochondria : properties of precursor proteins</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Skerjanc, Ilona S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The mechanism of protein translocation into mitochondria has been investigated by studying properties of precursor proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix. Characterization of the amphiphilic properties of the signal sequence for pre-ornithine carbamyltransferase has led to the conclusion that precursors can not translocate across the inner membrane via a lipid route alone (i.e. in the absence of proteins). A correlation was established between the rate of precursor import and the degree of hydrophobicity of a short region in the presequence, suggesting that precursor binding to the two-dimensional phospholipid surface of the outer membrane may enhance the rate of diffusion to the translocation apparatus. The conformations of the mature portions of two hybrid proteins, pOCAT and pODHFR, were examined at various steps on the import pathway. The bulk population of these precursors remained in a near-native conformation prior to precursor engagement of the import apparatus. Unfolded polypeptide translocation intermediates, the formation of which requires ATP, an intact signal sequence, and a protease-sensitive component of the outer mitochondrial membrane, have been detected in association with submitochondrial fractions containing sites of contact between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s555n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g8258</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akd17ct698"><dcterms:title>Occupational solvent exposure and mental disorders</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Labrèche, France P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A case-referent study was designed to investigate the relationship between occupational solvent exposure and mental disorders.

The use of one of the chimeras, pO-DHFR, showed that the requisite factor in lysate functions to maintain precursors in an import-competent conformation. pO-DHFR diluted from urea in the presence of mitochondria was imported, but this competence was lost when urea was removed in the absence of organelles, unless the cytosolic protein(s) was present.

Glass beads, rice, millet and linseed were used as model particles. Overall mixing maps showing regimes of good and poor solids mixing are presented. Granular solids flowability was found to influence particle flow characteristics substantially within the bulk as well as the wall-to-blade clearance region of the bed. Bulk solids flowability in stirred vessels was characterized by a novel procedure which incorporated the combined effects of particle shape, surface roughness, moisture/stickiness and deformability. The torque required to stir the particulate bed is influenced strongly by the solids flowability and blade configuration. A physical model for the wall-to-bed contact heat transfer coefficient based on particle renewal rates at the heated surface is proposed. The particle renewal rates and particle-surface contact times are evaluated exclusively from the particle flow information in the clearance region with no empirical parameters. The effects of particle shape and bed porosity at the contacting surface on the surface-to-particle thermal contact resistance were evaluated. Experimental results showing the effects of agitator speed, wall-to-blade clearance, solids flowability and air flow rate on the wall-to-bed average heat transfer rate are presented and discussed.

Test work at laboratory scale first examined the nature of entrainment; froth structures with and without wash water; and the location, geometry, and flowrate of wash water addition. The relationship between slurry, total water recovery and gangue recovery was characterized. Confirmatory work at pilot plant was completed. The effect of wash water on metallurgical performance was tested with various streams from the Falconbridge Strathcona mill at laboratory and pilot and full plant scale, and with the secondary cleaner stage at the Eastmaque Kirkland Lake mill. Results show that mechanical entrainment is the major means of gangue transport up to the slurry-froth interface. Transport into the froth is mostly hydraulic, although entrapment becomes dominant at low water recoveries. Free gangue recovery was closely related to slurry water recovery at all three scales. Wash water at an optimum superficial rate of 0.03 to 0.07 cm/s reduced entrainment by anywhere from 30 to 70%, typical values being around 50%. Wash water can be further assisted by mechanical and ultrasonic vibration of the froth, difficult to achieve at plant scale, or with warm wash water, which becomes attractive if a waste heat source is available. A further rejection of 10 to 20% then becomes possible. Distributor geometry was aimed at washing the entire froth surface at laboratory and pilot scale. It was observed that the recovery of hydrophobic minerals generally increased because the froth was stabilized. At plant scale, two perforated pipes close to the concentrate weir yielded the most reject. Froth stabilization was lost, and recoveries decreased.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j998.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k5692</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bm398"><dcterms:title>Source-insulator interaction in high-voltage pollution tests</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nguyen, Duc Hai.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work develops a digital-computer simulation of the interaction between an artificially polluted insulator and a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) or an alternating-current (AC) source configuration. The polluted-insulator model includes conditions for the existance of arcs on contaminated surfaces; arc motion, speed of arc propagation, and arc reignition criteria; and thermodynamic phenomena in an unbridged wet layer. The effect of the source parameters on the leakage current waveform, the dynamic voltage drop and the critical flashover voltage is systematically investigated and supported by experimental results. The simulation results are used to establish the HV test source requirements and provide guidance for the design of the test source. For an AC source, it is important to consider the equivalent shunt capacitance in addition to the short-circuit current and the transformer reactance/resistance ratio when interpreting pollution test results. The use of series capacitance to compensate for a weak source is also considered. In the case of a DC source, the mean voltage drop during a critical leakage current impulse proves to be a better indicator of the error in the measured critical voltage. The studies are extended for the DC source configurations most commonly used by power utilities today.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bh96t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm398</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514nm15p"><dcterms:title>Application of the hybrid stress finite element method in stability analysis of mine excavations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Momoh, Osman Aliu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis reports the formulation and implementation of a finite element model, which is based on the so called Hybrid Stress Finite Element Method.

Among the special features of the model are the casting of the element stiffness equations in terms of local rather than global coordinate system, the use of the active column method known as the "Skyline technique for the solution of equilibrium equations", and the use of fast and efficient mesh generation and alteration routines developed specially for geotechnical applications. Verification tests carried out on problems in elasticity with closed form solutions show that the proposed method is accurate and that it requires relatively fewer elements than displacement-based finite element method to achieve the same accuracy.
