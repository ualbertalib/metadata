It compares the earlier with the later revised editions of the exegesis as it studies change in his thought and Weltanschauung. Qutb believed that the sacred text was a book of guidance and inspiration with immediate relevance to contemporary issues and challenges, giving direction to practical affairs as though it had been revealed specifically for today's problems. It is suggested that social, political, economic, and psychological factors contributed to his interpretation and revision. The thesis explores the degree of the revision made as well as its significance, with special reference to the case of zakat (alms) and riba (usury)-related verses in particular. Although the fundamental stance is basically consistent, i.e. that Islam is a distinct, divinely-ordained system for all aspects of life, it shows that Qutb tended to draw sharp distinctions between those who strove for the establishment of God's law in the world, and those who opposed them. Thus, in his exegetical endeavour, he became inevitably influenced by his socio-political background, and his exegesis was different from other contemporary ones, because it expressed the views of an activist advocate of social, political and religious reform, even though his thought was at times vague and idealistic.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boullata, Issa J.

Jane.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The last works of Jane Austen and Barbara Pym, written while each was knowingly dying, both continue and transform a discourse of illness and cure traceable through their canon. Illness figures both literally and metaphorically in their narratives; in Austen as failures in wholeness and in Pym as failures in love. After undergoing the metaphorically medical treatments of purging and vivifying in Austen and inoculating in Pym, their female protagonists achieve conditions of health and wholeness by closure of the narrative. In the dying works, individual metaphorical illnesses become a general societal condition of fragmentation, and cure becomes more elusive. The shared use of a village undergoing profound change reflects each writer's own bodily transformation as certain death approaches, and the restoration of health to the village-as-body becomes one of achieving balance or homeostasis. This is effected in the narrative by the hinted-at curative powers of nature in Sanditon and of restored faith in A Few Green Leaves. On a theoretical level, both texts reflect their narratives of dis-ease and cure. Pym's last text remained unpublished before her death and therefore "ill" because not functioning, but second opinions and faith in her reputation confirmed its public health. Austen's Sanditon as a fragment embodies its own discourse of dis-ease, or failure of wholeness, and requires a curative act on the part of the reader to restore it to some sense of ideal wholeness or health.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Conway, C.

Using newspapers, judicial documents, and correspondence, it seeks to re-examine the epidemic to further the understanding of the modernization of the Canadian state in the area of public health. Many of the histories concerning the modernization of the Lower Canadian state have focussed on the 1837 rebellions as a breaking point between the 'old' state and the 'modern' state. If modernization can be equated with the process of increased state influence on society, then the 1832 epidemic provided an opportunity for the government to become more involved in the social regulation of individual lives. And the process was not solely influenced by the 'state,' as citizen committees played a role during the epidemic. Nor must Lower Canada be seen in a vacuum, as the shifts that occurred in Montreal during the epidemic coincided with those taking place in London, Paris and New York. An analysis of the state during the epidemic suggests its growing significance in individual lives, particularly those of the poor. The appearance of cholera hospitals, the use and enforcement of public health regulations by a board of health, and the social assistance to the immigrants, orphans, and widows illustrate this modernizing state.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Young, Brian (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fb296.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p665x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Epidemics -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cholera -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public health -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ams35tb42x"><dcterms:title>Goal setting in the acquisition of a motor skill with children who have learning disabilities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Savoie, Nicole A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>According to Locke and Latham (1990), goal-setting is a powerful motivationa! tool which captivates the individual's attention and sense of effort in pooling all available resources to accomplish a task with accrued determination. Goal-setting has been used successfully in sports and physical activities (Kyllo &amp; Landers, 1995). Positive results have also been realized with low achievers in academic tasks (Bandura &amp; Schunk, 1981). The purpose of this investigation was to test the effects of goal-setting on basketball free throwing with normally achieving (NA) boys and girls, and with children having learning disabilities (LD), ages 9-13 years. This study also tested the relationship between Perceived Physical Self-Competence (Harter, 1978b) and performance. Results indicated that the children with LD in the goal-setting group outperformed the control group. However, goal-setting failed to differentiate the performances of NA children. No correlation was established between Perceived Physical Self-competence and the performance of these children. Methodological key points are discussed and suggestions are given for future research with goal-setting and children.

It covers three main points: Ahmad Khan's and Ahmad Dahlan's educational philosophy; the educational system of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College (MAOC) and Muhammadiyah schools; and the impact of the educational reforms of the two movements to Muslim education in general in the two countries. As will be explained in this thesis, Ahmad Khan and Ahmad Dahlan were deeply concerned with economic and social problems faced by the Muslims due to colonial policies. Both scholars came to the conviction that education was one of the most important ways to solve those problems. The two scholars, therefore, each contrived to design a new system of education for Muslims, which would produce graduates capable of meeting the new demands of the changing socio-political context while retaining their faith. Their ideas were eventually realized in the establishment of the MAOC and the Muhammadiyah schools, respectively. Even though these two institutions were unable to satisfy all Muslim aspirations, they succeeded in making Muslims in India and Indonesia aware of the need for pragmatic education, which was to contribute to the empowerment of Muslims in the colonial era.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alvi, Sajida S.

But this viewpoint is not valid if the novels in which those "mistaken readers" exist suggest, to the contrary, that reality is problematic; it is therefore impossible to judge the characters without "afterthoughts", since these characters, in a way, are pointing to the fact that the reality they live in is "unreal". Such is the case with Madame Bovary and Don Quijote. These two novels, as a result of different "techniques", essentially tell their readers to be suspicious about what is "true" and what is "false". These are novels without a strong authorial voice, novels that speak more about how characters conceive reality than about reality itself, which remains in both cases a complete mystery. This viewpoint can be extended into a definition of the novel, in terms of what it says (or doesn't say) about the world. And in fact, a novel doesn't say anything about the world, at least not directly. It could be described as "a machine" made from what the characters say. Obviously, such a machine cannot be taken too seriously, since nobody (that is to say no real person) is actually saying what is being said in its pages. But at the same time, by refusing to show the fictional world in itself, (by always showing it through the eyes of fictional characters), the novelist reminds his reader that the real world itself is inescapably ambiguous.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dx38w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bk10n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reality in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, 1547-1616.

Arguing that theatres were built in particular locations not just to escape City prohibitions, but to draw on proximate audiences, I provide a brief history of Clerkenwell and place the Red Bull in its local context. By figuring the Red Bull, both in terms of its standard repertoire and its audience, as a prototypical "community theatre," I develop a sociology of dramatic production which understands this Early Modern theatre as a crucial nexus of local solidarity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bristol, Michael D.

The results of this research indicate that schizophrenics who try to position themselves anew frequently tend to reject biomedical meanings and definitions as a privileged frame of reference.

The parallels discussed arise out of the Renaissance humanism shared by both of these artists and expressed their works of art. Beginning with Michelangelo, I will establish the relation of Renaissance humanism to the Sistine Chapel ceiling decoration and define Michelangelo's specific conception of the theories associated with this movement. Subsequently, the same critical approach will be applied to Milton's Paradise Lost, which will be revealed to be notably humanistic despite its positioning at the end of the Renaissance in a Protestant country. After exploring the individual works of Michelangelo and Milton separately, I will then consider the views shared by these two in their treatments of the myth of the Fall of humanity: both artists believe in the ultimate dignity and freedom of humankind, and portray both Adam and Eve as free and autonomous individuals; the Sistine ceiling frescoes and Paradise Lost likewise emphasize the regenerative rather than the damning aspect of the Fall of humanity, expressing the humanistic insistence on the value of human experience; finally, the humanistic notion that art, both literary and visual, instructs its audience while entertaining it, provides the governing artistic theory behind the works of both Michelangelo and Milton. Although the commonalities between Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling and Milton's Paradise Lost are extensive, I will not attempt to claim that Milton was specifically influenced by Michelangelo's frescoes. However, my study will reveal the potential for interart analogies to provide greater insight into the individual works of art and literature being analysed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Borris, Kenneth (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f7936.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924d67r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Humanism in art.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cappella Sistina (Vatican Palace, Vatican City)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Humanism in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Milton, John, 1608-1674.

This study attempts to put something into the void. Based mostly on original sources found in the Kriegsarchiv (War Archives) in Vienna, it examines the campaign from the perspective of Joseph II. The first chapter tries to explain how Joseph became involved in a conflict with the Porte. The second chapter covers the period of February-July 1788, when Joseph postponed his offensive on Belgrade until the fall and waited in Zemun on the defensive. The third chapter begins with the Ottoman advance into the Banat of Timisoara in early August 1788 and ends with the Habsburg army's retreat to winter quarters in November. Despite failing to take Belgrade, the Habsburg army captured strategically important positions for the campaign of 1789. The difficulties encountered cannot be blamed solely on Joseph's poor generalship. Other factors, such as insufficient Russian assistance, a difficult climate and terrain and a surprisingly strong Ottoman effort, must also be considered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Longworth, P.

Our analysis of various historiographical traditions produced in the Subcontinent between the eleventh and the twentieth centuries, will show that this image of Sufis qua missionaries is more the result of socio-political considerations (legitimization of imperial order; posthumous images of Sufis in the eyes of different folk audiences, etc.) than the reflection of historical reality. This thesis also examines the processes, most of them indirect, in which Sufis were involved and which on the long run led to the acculturation and to the Islamization of certain non-Muslim groups, thus opening the way for the birth and then consolidation of a Muslim identity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alvi, Sajida (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053j08k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fk048</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Muslim converts -- India.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sufis -- India.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sufism -- India.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708z80r"><dcterms:title>Intellectual responses to the establishment of Ikatan Cendekiawan Muslim Indonesia (ICMI), 1990-1995</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mardatillah, Fuadi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Following the creation of Ikatan Cendekiawan Muslim Indonesia ICMI, Indonesian Muslim Intellectual Association) on December 6, 1990, an event which had shaken the Indonesian political scene, discussion of the relation and affinity between Islam and the state once again came to the fore. The controversy surrounding ICMI's establishment revolved around two basic questions, namely, whether it was a political maneuver by the New Order government, or a true manifestation of the Muslim community's aspirations. The resulting situation prompted a large number of responses from people of various backgrounds. Support, opposition and neutrality towards ICMI arose during its five year existence (1990-1995). These responses took cognizance of the hidden motives behind the New Order's political support of the organization, as well as the government's new appreciation and accommodation of Islam and Muslim demands. The present thesis will thus note, evaluate and analyze these responses in light of the specific context surrounding ICMI's establishment, as well as the numerous analyses extended by various political observers. The thesis will also seek to explain why ICMI became a phenomenon welcomed by most Indonesian Muslims.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Federspiel, Howard M.

By examining the cases of Flanders and Scotland, it is argued that increased nationalism is a normal and predictable outcome of the process of integration in general, and of the EU more specifically. By analysing four factors--economic incorporation, system-wide policies, systems of transfer payments, and political isolation--the author finds two trends within the nationalist movements. The first is that the nationalist groups seek to acquire several of the powers currently held by the states of which they are currently part, Belgium and the United Kingdom respectively. The second is that these sub-state groups see themselves as part of a new order in which states are losing their significance. Neither of the theories associated with these observations on their own, however, satisfactorily explains the link between integration and increased nationalist assertion in the nationalist movements studied. The conclusion is that the nationalist groups accept the concept of an authority above the level of the state, nation, or region, but emphasise the necessity of a large degree of regional autonomy and a real voice for these regions in the decision-making process of this authority. Since the European Union is and always has been an exclusive club of member states, nationalist groups consider, within the framework of current institutional arrangements, that full statehood may be the only way to achieve their goals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brawley, Mark R.

To date, this methodological framework persists as most Western Islamicists continue to view the encounter between the two legal systems as conflict ridden. This thesis is an attempt to re-evaluate this entrenched paradigm. By utilising the principles of Islamic legal methodology (usul al-fiqh) in conjunction with legal and socio-political approaches, this study seeks to shed new analytical light on the encounter of Islamic law with adat law (customary law) in Indonesia. The two legal systems, it is argued, have a shared existence long pre-dating the intervention of the colonial powers in Indonesian legal affairs, which speaks of accommodation and coexistence. In what is both a syncretic and a purist society, Indonesians have successfully harmonized the two legal traditions such that compromise and derivative solutions, based upon elements from both legal systems, have often been attained. In post-colonial Indonesia, the dialogue between the two sets of laws persists today as the tradition of avoiding conflict in legal resolution continues uninterrupted by the flux in legal policy from colonial to national rule. Family law in particular illustrates the endurance of such a phenomenon in the current period. Three cases--conditional repudiation, common property in marriage and obligatory bequest--are discussed as models of the two substantive legal systems working jointly to construct a new legal entity. The conciliatory exchange between Islamic and customary law in Indonesia refutes therefore the paradigm by which the two legal systems are posited as irreconcilable.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hallaq, Wael B.

It maintains that much contemporary song criticism deals inadequately with the complex relationships between verbal, vocal and musical texts that comprise the three basic elements of the modern song. To justify this claim, and to grasp how the current situation might have arisen, the thesis delves into the history of song and traces its developments. It concludes that modern and classical song differ in ways that the "serious vs. popular" debate do not address: autonomy of authorship, frame of reference, and proper context for interpretation. To remedy this situation, the thesis anatomizes modern song and outlines a "top-down" approach to song criticism with lyrics as the primary frame of reference, supplemented by emotive cues found in the music and vocal performance. Concurrently, the anatomy is put into practice, using examples from the unofficial canon of modern song.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gibian, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft38d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d6141</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Popular music -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music and literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193b92p"><dcterms:title>The double in Dickens' final completed novels /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lawrie-Munro, Brian.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an examination of the double motif used by Charles Dickens in A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and Our Mutual Friend. There is a subtle shift that takes place in these last completed works, from a double motif which is used to prescribe individual behaviour along the lines of domestic or Christian ideology, to one which examines the social and psychological consequences of the individual's submission to such ideological imperatives. In fine, Dickens begins to distance himself from the stock, physical double he had inherited, turning instead to a double that finds its causes and ramifications firmly located in both the social and psychological spheres. This increasing complexity of the double motif is indicative of Dickens' gradually more sophisticated, less stereotypical view of the relationship between the individual and society than that suggested by his famous caricatures or his previous works.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>O'Toole, T.
