The collective excitations related to the propagation of scalar and vector mesons in dense nuclear matter are discussed in a relativistic mean field model. Finite temperature effects on the meson properties in nuclear matter are also considered. One of the main concerns of the present thesis is the evaluation of symmetry-breaking effects induced by the dense matter. Special emphasis is put on the study of scalar-vector meson mixing effect, a pure density-dependent effect forbidden in vacuum on account of the Lorentz symmetry. In this direction, a new symmetry-breaking effect---the rho-a 0 meson mixing---is revealed and studied in detail along with a similar effect induced by the o-sigma mixing. The possibility of a new dilepton channel, arising from pi-eta collisions and mediated by rho-a 0 mixing, is further discussed in a relativistic kinetic model. The effects of o-sigma mixing on the amplitude of the dilepton production process from pion annihilation is also evaluated in a similar manner. The possibility of observing such symmetry-breaking effects in nucleus-nucleus collision experiments is investigated. For the space-time evolution of the matter formed during the collision, a thermal model is employed and the equation of state is determined from the interacting nuclear matter within the scope of a mean field model. We argue that such processes can be observed in the dilepton spectra at GSI/SIS energies, while they are not so evident at higher energy experiments performed at CERN/SPS.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gale, Charles (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp60g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698908w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Nuclear.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784n35d"><dcterms:title>A search for high-energy Gamma rays from AGN ON+231 with the STACEE-32 detector /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Theoret, Claude G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cerenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) is a ground-based atmospheric Cerenkov telescope constructed to conduct gamma-ray astronomy.

A prototype of the telescope was constructed in 1998 which used 32 heliostat mirrors of the NSTTF with a total collection area of ~1200 m 2. This prototype called STACEE-32, was used to search for high energy gamma-ray emissions from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) ON + 231 (also known as W Coma and 1219 + 285). The STACEE-32 response as a function of energy was calculated for this source and we report a spectral energy threshold of E th = 130 +/- 50GeV. The analysis of data collected in the spring of 1999 resulted in a non-detection of the AGN at this energy. We derived a 95% confidence level upper limit on the integrated gamma-ray flux for this source of phiint(E &gt; 130 +/- 50GeV) ≤ 2.4 x 10-10 cm-2sec -1.

In order to elucidate the reason behind this switch, I studied the expression of both homologous proteins during muscle differentiation and apoptosis and, documented the relation between peptide elongation factors and caspase-3 activation. I found that during in vitro muscle differentiation of L6 myoblasts, a switch in peptide elongation factors 1A occurs as physiologically observed in skeletal muscles. While EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 is expressed in replicating myoblasts, S1/EF1A-2 is solely found in differentiated myotubes where it replaces EF-1alpha/EFIA-1 as the major elongation factor. Similarly, upon serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, a reversion in peptide elongation factors 1A is observed: EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 replaces S1/EF1A-2 and becomes the major form of elongation factor 1A present in dying myotubes. This switch correlates in myotubes with the activation of caspase-3 protein, a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis. When L6 myotubes constitutively express S1/EF1A-2 as caused by adenoviral gene transfer, they become resistant to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. In contrast, when L6 myotubes are transfected with EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 gene, they die more rapidly from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis than control cells. Transfection using anti-sense EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 gene protects myotubes from apoptotic cell death. Thus, both elongation factor 1As exert opposing effect on muscle survival: while EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 accelerates apoptotic cell death, S1/EF1A-2 protects muscles against apoptosis. I found that skeletal muscles are the only tissues where, despite the constitutive expression of caspase-3 mRNA, the protein can be absent. Furthermore, I found that while immediately after birth, caspase-3 protein is present in skeletal muscles, a few weeks afterwards, the protein cannot be detected by Western blotting. In skeletal muscle, this change correlates with the observed switch in peptide elongation factors from EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 to S1/EF1A-2 and suggests that caspase-3 is translationally regulated in skeletal muscles. The laboratory previously reported that while EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 protein reappears; S1/EF1A-2 protein becomes absent from regenerating muscles. However, once tissue regeneration is completed, the situation returns to normal as EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 disappears and S1/EF1A-2 reappears to become the only type 1A elongation factor expressed in muscle. In conclusion, I found that the developmental switch observed in peptide elongation factors from EF-1alpha/EF1A-1 to S1/EF1A-2 partly serves to protect muscle cells from apoptosis. Thus, I am the first to identify a noncanonical function for S1/EF1A-2.

The signal transducing systems that mediate the diverse biological functions of the neurotrophins are initiated by their interactions with two categories of cell surface receptors, the Trk family of tyrosine kinases, and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). In contrast to the rapid progress made in elucidating the mechanism of action of the Trk receptors, the physiological roles of p75NTR are uncertain, but two general functions have been ascribed to p75NTR. First, p75NTR can positively or negatively modulate Trk receptor signaling, and second, p75NTR can autonomously activate signaling cascades that results in cellular apoptosis. The signaling pathways employed by p75NTR to mediate its effects are unclear, but p75NTR was found to activate the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways, and to interact with several adaptor proteins, such as NRAGE, NADE, NRIF, TRAF proteins, and FAP-1. Nervous system injuries represent interesting models to study p75NTR because several types of injury induce p75NTR expression. In the first part of this thesis, we have used the pilocarpine model of seizure in the rat and found that this type of injury induces neuronal apoptosis and p75NTR expression. Apoptosis was tightly linked with p75NTR expression, suggesting that p75NTR may promote apoptosic cell death after seizure, and consistent with this, we have found that p75NTR can promote JNK activation and apoptosis in vitro. In the second study, we discovered that p75NTR can also facilitate survival under some cellular circumstances. The survival-promoting effect of p75NTR was accompanied with PI3-K-dependent Akt activation, and correlated with a reduction in cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, suggesting that p75NTR may regulate a tyrosine phosphatase involved in the regulation of Akt and survival. In the last study, we have found that the related neuroprotective compounds, K252a and CEP 1347, are potent. MLK3 inhibitors, yet they simultaneously activated Akt and ERK, and survival through MLK3-independent mechanisms. These findings suggested that K252a and CEP1347 may act on a novel target responsible for their survival-promoting activities. Taken together, the data in this thesis adds to our understanding of the physiological functions of p75NTR, and contributes to our knowledge of the cellular machinery that control neuronal cell survival and death.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barker, Philip (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Kennedy, Timothy (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft01r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr34b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awd375z01x"><dcterms:title>Microwave assisted drying of composite materials : modelling and experimental validation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sanga, Essau C.

Heat transfer results in terms of Nusselt numbers for the Reynolds number ranges studied are presented and discussed. In the second part of the study a mathematical model was developed to describe heat and mass transfer of a model material under microwave fields. The dynamic temperature and moisture profiles of cylindrical composite samples subjected to microwave and convective energy were determined and validated at microwave power density levels of 0.20 W/g, 0.3 W/g and 0.4 W/g based on initial weight of the sample. Model results were compared with experimental data and found to agree within 1.0--2.6%. Predicted temperature profiles at selected locations within the model material were also showed a good agreement with experimental data. However, a significant discrepancy between the numerical and experimental temperature results occurred after t &gt; 30 minutes. This might have been due to localized overheating, or to mathematical model overestimation. Lastly, a quality evaluation of the dried samples was also performed. Quality attributes evaluated were surface color, shrinkage and rehydration capacity.

The specifics of the metallocene polysulfide catalytic system were studied in detail. The most efficient catalyst in the sulfuration of dienes, molybdocene tetrasulfide, became an object of oxidative studies. These studies were extended to molybdocene disulfide and tungstenocene tetrasulfide. The main products of the oxidation of metallocene tetrasulfides, 1-oxides, were thermally unstable and at room temperature rearranged to corresponding 2-oxides. The mechanism and factors controlling this rearrangement were investigated. Oxidations of molybdocene tetrasulfide with excess of oxidant were also carried out. The unstable intermediates were identified. The rearrangement of highly oxidized molybdocene tetrasulfide 1,1,4,4-tetroxide yielding the intriguing ionic molybdocene disulfide dimer, was examined. Properties of the dimer, with emphasis on the deprotonation, were described. Molybdocene disulfide and its oxide were treated separately with SO 2, H2S and finally with a mixture of both gases to evaluate the potential catalytic activity in the Claus process. The formation of two products resulting from the novel insertion of SO2 into the S-S bond, molybdocene trisulfide 2,2-dioxide and molybdocene bis(O-alkylthiosulfate) was observed.

This is mainly driven by industrial development, which demands the fabrication of new, small, well-controlled devices as well as the desire to understand quantum effects which manifest in these small structures. In this thesis we theoretically investigate quantum coherent transport properties of nano structures in the form of molecular electronic systems. Our approach is based on Landauer-Buttiker transport theory. However, the details of the method depend on the interaction complexity. We have carried out detailed analysis on finite length carbon nanotubes based magnetic tunnel junction using tight binding atomic model and Green's function approach. This device shows clear spin valve effect even when contacted with the same ferro-magnetic material with a long spin scattering length. In addition to this, transport at the atomic level is highly affected by the molecular states resulting in conductance oscillation of finite size arm-chair carbon nanotube as a function of its length. When short carbon nanotubes are weakly contacted to external leads, they act as quantum dots with strong interaction at the molecular scale. To analyse these systems, we have developed a many-body wave function formalism which include spin degeneracy. This approach clearly shows the strong dependence of the device electronic response on the number of electrons already inside the tube. Finally, we have carried out ab initio analysis based on Density Functional Theory within Local Density Approximations to investigate the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various gold nanowires. Our results demonstrate that transport properties of these systems crucially depend on the electronic properties of the scattering region, the leads, and most importantly the interaction of the scattering region with the leads. For ideal, clean Au contacts, the theoretical results indicate a linear I-V behavior. However, when sulfur impurities exist at the contact junction, nonlinear I-V curves emerge due to a tunnelling barrier established in the presence of the S atom. The most striking observation is that even a single S atom can cause a qualitative change of the I-V curve from linear to nonlinear. Our theoretical results were compared to experimental data, qualitative and sometimes quantitative understanding of the experiments are obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guo, Hong (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b044w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322f91w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5138jg522"><dcterms:title>Integrated dual frequency permittivity analyzer using cavity perturbation concept</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Meda, Venkatesh.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Optimal utilization of microwave energy requires more basic knowledge of the dielectric properties of the material under investigation. The dielectric properties of materials subjected to microwaves are known to depend on moisture content, temperature and density of the material as well as the frequency of the applied microwave field. This thesis is focussed on the development and evaluation of the new Permittivity Analyser to measure the dielectric properties of agri-food materials at 915 and 2450 MHz using cavity perturbation concept. In this study, the dielectric properties measuring system was designed and developed using cavity perturbation concept to measure the essential and fundamental parameters of microwave-material interaction; dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor of selected agri-food substances and organic solvents. The TM010 mode of electromagnetic energy was selected and configured to operate at the peakresonant condition for both ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) approved frequencies of .915 and 2450 MHz frequencies. The resonant perturbation cavities were designed, fabricated and tested using the network analyser and the permittivity analyser. High Q (ratio of energy supplied to absorbed) values were reported for both frequencies. Basic calibration of the measurement system was performed using standard media such as air, water and alcohol. Necessary mathematical steps and algorithms were written and integrated into a user-friendly software program (Visual basic 6.0) to carry out the entire measurement. The dielectric properties (epsilon' &amp; epsilon ′) of materials such as; edible oils---canola, soya and sunflower oils, neem oil/pulp, homogenized milk (1, 2 and 3.25% fat), organic solvents such as ethanol, hexane and their mixtures were determined at various temperatures and frequency (915, 2450 MHz) combinations, using cavity perturbation technique. Linear relationships between the dielectric properties and temperature found in the literature were confirmed to be valid for certain ranges in case of edible oils, organic solvents and milk samples tested with the cavity perturbation method. Repeatibility and variability aspects of the permittivity analyzer at both the frequencies are presented.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Raghavan, G. S.

Interest in a relationship between MAO and aggressive behaviour derives from the report of a single family with a mutation which obliterates the activity of MAO A, as well as a long history of studies which substantiate a relationship between MAO activity and impulsive aggressive behaviour. The goals of this thesis were: (1) to examine the generalizability of the specific MAO mutation noted above; (2) to evaluate the relationship between platelet MAO activity and genetic polymorphisms in MAO genes, and (3) to extend knowledge regarding the developmental behavioural impact of MAO deficiency in mice treated pre- and perinatally with inhibitors of MAO. In the first study we genotyped the C936T mutation in 100 subjects followed longitudinally and oversampled for aggressive behaviour. None of the subjects in our sample carried this mutation. In the second study, we report the lack of association between platelet MAO activity and four intronic microsatellite polymorphisms of the MAO genes. Studies of MAO knockout mice are at significant variance with clinical pharmacological experience using MAO inhibitors. Prompted by this and by other seminal basic experiments, we hypothesized that inhibition of MAO activity during the developmental period would have profound behavioural effects. MAO A and B inhibitors were administered, separately or in combination, to mice during gestation and lactation. Total prenatal MAO inhibition produced a severe pattern of behaviour, while MAO-B inhibited mice demonstrated a similar pattern with lower intensity. Aggression was elevated in MAO-A inhibited mice only after acute pharmacological challenges suggesting prenatal sensitization. Thus developmental inhibition of MAO activity engenders behavioural effects which parallel those observed in animals devoid functional MAO. These data underscore the importance of neurochemical changes during development and provide a possible model for uninhibited aggression, common in clinical populations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Palmour, Roberta (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nw236.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763862t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aggressiveness.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monoamine oxidase.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aggressive behavior in animals.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s407c"><dcterms:title>Developmental regulation and molecular nature of an activity in murine oocytes that transfers histones onto sperm DNA</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McLay, David W.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At fertilization, the remodelling of the sperm nucleus into the male pronucleus is critical for normal development. Morphological and functional changes to the nucleus are underpinned by biochemical changes in the chromatin composition, most notably the removal of sperm specific protamines and assembly of histones onto the paternal DNA. This exchange is controlled by oocyte factors, as exemplified in Xenopus by nucleoplasmin. Though mammalian factors remain unidentified, a functional assay based on antibodies recognizing core histones has been developed to test the activity in oocytes that transfers histones onto sperm DNA, named histone transfer activity (HTA). The assay was applied to growing and maturing murine oocytes to determine when during oogenesis HTA develops, and to probe potential regulatory mechanisms. Fully-grown oocytes develop HTA upon maturation, in a protein-synthesis dependent manner. Large, growing oocytes also develop HTA upon entry into M-phase. Small growing meiotically incompetent oocytes, ones that do not spontaneously enter M-phase, do not develop HTA, though this can be overcome by culture of oocytes to meiotic competence, or by treatment with strontium to induce intracellular calcium oscillations. Taken together these findings form a model of how HTA develops throughout oogenesis. Finally, an attempt is made to identify a potential mammalian HTA factor. Transcripts for two remodelling factors, mNAP and Npm3, are identified in the murine oocyte, and injection of anti-sense oligonucleotides reveals that Npm3 plays a significant role in the deposition of histories and the remodelling of sperm chromatin at fertilization. Combined with the findings of the HTA assay, the data forms a testable model of how Npm3 may be regulated throughout oogenesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Clarke, Hugh (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g886.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s407c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Oogenesis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Embryology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mice -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Histones.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708z391"><dcterms:title>Opposing roles for TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors in the regulators of sympathetic neuron growth and target innervation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kohn, Judith.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Neurotrophins are key regulators of neuronal survival and growth. In sympathetic neurons, NGF generates positive biological signals through TrkA, while the p75NTR transduces negative responses. Activating the p75NTR with BDNF while NGF/TrkA signals are robust does not inhibit survival in vitro, but p75NTR activation causes apoptosis if TrkA activation is suboptimal. These findings support opposing roles for these receptors with respect to survival, but there is less data supporting their opposing roles in the regulation of neuronal growth and target innervation. The experimental work presented in this thesis has explored this theme in sympathetic neurons. First, I showed that a balance between the activation of TrkA and p75NTRs is necessary for achieving appropriate levels of growth and target innervation, so they act in a functionally antagonistic manner to regulate biological responses that lie beyond survival. I found that activating the p75NTR with BDNF when TrkA activation was robust, inhibited growth responses in vitro without affecting survival. Such regulation may occur through an inhibitory BDNF: p75NTR autocrine loop, since sympathetic neurons and their targets produce BDNF. I addressed the physiological relevance of this finding by examining innervation of a sympathetic target organ, the pineal gland, in BDNF-deficient mice. When BDNF expression is reduced or absent, this target is hyperinnervated by sympathetic fibres. Since the inhibitory effect of p75NTR is decreased when BDNF levels are low or absent, this indicates that BDNF can act through a p75NTR autocrine loop to regulate NGF-mediated growth and target innervation. These findings support the hypothesis that target innervation is regulated by a balance of positively and negatively acting neurotrophins produced by sympathetic neurons and/or their targets. I also investigated how altering the balance of TrkA/p75NTR signals would affect NGF-mediated sympathetic neuron growth. Since the balance of signaling may vary spatially, depending on the ratio of p75NTR to TrkA expression, I determined the spatial localization of TrkA and p75NTRs by immunocytochemistry. Since I found a differential distribution, I used confocal microscopy to measure relative receptor density, and showed that TrkA was expressed at much higher levels on the cell body relative to neurites, while the p75NTR exhibited a more even distribution.

If accurately forecasted, the timing of weed control operations could be optimized, enabling the implementation of more effective control strategies and consequently, the reduction of herbicide use. Little is known about weed emergence in Quebec. Weed emergence in the field results from the breaking of seed dormancy, seed germination and growth of the seedling to the soil surface. The purpose of this study was initially to review the environmental and cultural factors that affect these mechanisms, to determine which factors are mainly responsible for weed emergence in southwestern Quebec and, finally to develop a weed emergence model. This study focused primarily on common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli [L.] Beauv.) since they were the most abundant weeds, representing 37 and 22%, respectively, of the total number of annual weeds in the experimental sites. A 3-year study established that the presence of corn did not affect the density and the pattern of emergence of these weeds. A 2-year experiment demonstrated that rainfall and irrigation had no or little influence on the pattern of weed emergence since soil water content was at or greater than field capacity in the spring. In Quebec, temperature was determined to be the most important factor regulating weed germination and emergence, meaning that weed germination is initiated by a minimal temperature in the spring and that this temperature is specific to each species. Thermo-gradient plate experiments established a base temperature for common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), barnyardgrass, and green foxtail (Setaria viridis L.) of 4, 8, 11, 12 +/- 1 C and &lt;3, &gt;16, 12 and 12 +/- 1 C, respectively for seed lots originating from eastern and southwestern Quebec.

This shift is defined by the refusal to accept the traditional Western condemnation of the fetishist as primitive or perverse, and by the effort to affirm more productive uses for fetishism as a theoretical concept spanning the disciplines of psychoanalysis, Marxian social theory, and anthropology. Analyzing the depiction of fetishistic practices in selected contemporary American novels, the dissertation utilizes fetish theory in order to clarify the unique textual and historiographic features of postmodernist fiction. It also emphasizes the way in which conventional ideas about history and teleology are necessarily challenged by an affirmative orientation toward the fetish. Part One of the dissertation, comprising the first two chapters, traces the lineage of Western thinking about fetishism from Hegel, Marx, and Freud to Derrida, Baudrillard, and Jameson, among others. Recognizing that traditional theories attribute the symbolic power of the fetish to its mystification of historical origins, Part One posits that poststructuralist and postmodernist contributions to the subject enable, but do not develop, an alternative concept of fetishism as a practice with constructive historical potential. Part Two of the study seeks to develop this historical potential with reference to prominent descriptive models of postmodernist fiction, and through close readings of five contemporary American authors: Thomas Pynchon, Kathy Acker, Robert Coover, John Hawkes, and Don DeLillo. The four chapters of Part Two each examine the fictional representation of fetishism within a different theoretical framework, focusing on, respectively: temporality and objectivity in postmodern fiction theory; the interrelation between psychoanalytic theory and female fetishism in novels by Pynchon and Acker</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x0651.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm63x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Postmodernism (Literature)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fetishism in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>American fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784n36p"><dcterms:title>Three essays on aspects of patent-related information as measures of revealed technological capabilities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Yender, 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation consists of three papers on the theme of technological capabilities.

Each of the papers in this thesis takes-up the challenge of examining some particular aspects of RTC based on patents; and will advance our knowledge of the subject modestly in a different direction, by taking advantage of invaluable competitive information contained in patent databases. In the sense of data-mining into knowledge, we formulate and introduce a series of concepts, measurements and a methodology under the title of " patent calculation" in the first paper to mine this invaluable information. We apply this methodology, with multiple indicators, to detect the existence of technological capabilities and examine it in relation to the pattern of global collaboration in patented inventions. In the second paper we study the over time, patterns of technological capabilities in a number of countries in relation to their market and industrial structure. In the third paper we search for' potential patterns of selective concentration and specialization in the patent-intensive industries of newly industrializing countries by using the index of revealed technological advantage (RTA), which has been used as the conventional indicator in advanced countries since 1960s in technology-oriented studies. We also examine if the inherent complexities of this measure impacts the remits.

The main objective of this thesis is to estimate the effect of premigratory exposure to political violence on the social anchorage of refugees in the host country. The sample is made up of 270 Southeast Asian and Central American refugees with school-aged children who had been living in Canada for a mean of 7 years at the time of interview. Social anchorage is measured by five types of social anchor (i.e., political, professional, religious, academic and community) and by two indices of the diversity of social anchorage. Three measures of exposure to political violence are investigated personal acute (i.e., threat and torture), personal chronic (i.e., imprisonment, reeducation camp, forced labor), and family exposure (i.e., acute and chronic). In addition to the analyses focusing on the estimation of the effect of exposure to political violence, exploratory analyses are also carried out to identify other factors such as transferable skills and socio-demographic characteristics that may affect social anchorage once exposure to political violence and ethnicity are taken into account. Approximated risk ratios are calculated from the odds ratios obtained by binary and ordinal regression analyses. Data analysis shows that specific forms of political violence may act differently on the social anchorage of refugees from Southeast Asia and Central America and across ethnic groups. Overall, personal acute exposure tends to foster their social anchorage whereas personal chronic exposure tends to prevent it. Personal acute exposure appears to foster the probability of a wider range of social anchors in Southeast Asian refugees but to inhibit it in Central Americans whereas personal chronic exposure tends to have the opposite effect as it may be a driving force for Central Americans and a brake for Southeast Asians. Finally, when controlling for exposure to political violence and ethnicity, transferable skills (such as premigratory work experience compatible with an urban setting and level of schooling) and socio-demographic characteristics (in particular number of years spent in Canada, income category and age) contribute to the social anchorage of Southeast Asian and Central American refugees.

Nutritional problems of Indigenous peoples arise in the transition from a traditional diet to a market diet characterised by highly processed foods with reduced nutrient density. This study used food frequency and 24-hour recall questionnaires to quantify traditional food intake in 18 communities in Denendeh (Western Northwest Territories) and the Yukon. These data allowed comparisons between the two regions (Yukon and Denendeh) and the two seasons of data collection (summer and winter, perceived to be the seasons of highest and lowest traditional food intake, respectively). Food choice in general is affected by a multitude of factors determined by individual, societal and environmental influences. In this study, individual, household, and community correlates of traditional food intake were assessed in order to construct a multivariate statistical model to describe the correlates of the quantity and diversity of traditional food intake in the Western Canadian Arctic. The variables used in this study reflected household demography, market food affordability, access to traditional food, individual characteristics such as age and gender, and perceptions about traditional food. The analysis of the associations between the traditional food correlates and traditional food intake in terms of quantity and diversity allowed for the description of the profile of men and women who are high consumers of traditional food in both regions.

In the present study, we developed a new technique to derive the solar fluxes at the TOA and at the surface from operational meteorological satellites. Two key steps in the technique are the narrowband to broadband (NTB) conversion and deriving the net solar flux at the surface from TOA observations. We developed a new NTB conversion algorithm from ScaRaB observations and radiation transfer model simulations. In deriving the net solar fluxes at the surface from TOA measurements, the effects of absorbing aerosols have been investigated. The technique described above has been applied to AVHRR data to derive a dataset of solar flux in the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) for the Canadian GEWEX Enhanced Study (CAGES) period from June 1998 to September 1999. The derived net solar fluxes at the surface were evaluated with the surface measurements in the basin and good agreement was achieved. Radiation fields from two atmospheric models used in the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS) project, the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) and the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model, were evaluated against satellite retrievals of radiation fluxes in the present study. It was found that the CRCM simulated the TOA reflected flux well in the MRB for the summer of 1994, but large biases were found in the partition of absorbed solar radiation between the atmosphere and the earth's surface. The net surface solar radiation was found to be overestimated by about 15% in the CRCM. Evaluation of the preliminary output from the new version of CRCM shows substantial improvement. Evaluation of radiation fields from the GEM model shows good agreement under clear skies, but under cloudy skies, the TOA albedo simulated by the GEM model in the MRB was about 30% lower than observations for the summer of 1999.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leighton, Henry (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z9465.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s1797</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Remote Sensing.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac534fq561"><dcterms:title>Fe-TM-Zr alloys : from glass to big cube crystal</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dikeakos, Maria.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An extensive study of a-FexTM 1-xZr2 with TM = {V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu} was undertaken in order to gain insight into the glassy structure, the metastable "big-cube" structure of the intermediate crystallisation product, and the evolution process involved therein. The stability of the glassy state was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Generally higher temperatures and more negative enthalpies of crystallisation were observed for the glass system where Fe was substituted with {Co, Ni, Cu} than for the system where Fe was substituted with {V, Cr, Mn}. A proposed hypothetical crystallisation mechanism involved in the evolution of the metastable cF96 state (instead of the equilibrium tI12 state) was tested. Oxygen impurities present in the amorphous state were shown to be responsible for nucleating the cF96 big cube. Upon removal of the oxygen nucleation sites through hydrogenation of the glasses, the crystallisation proceeded directly to the equilibrium tetragonal structure bypassing the metastable phase. The validity of an assumed invariant structure in late transition-early transition metal (LT-ET) binary glasses was examined by means of Mossbauer spectroscopy. Variations in isomer shift (delta) and quadrupole splitting (Delta) upon TM substitution were consistent with variations in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (EF). An assumed constant structure for (4d ET)-(3d LT) glasses is indeed justified. Variations in atomic packing were followed by measuring Delta. Delta increased as the atomic number of the TM increased. For the a-Fe xCu1-xZr 2 series, a break in the concentration dependence of Delta at x ≈ 0.3 is observed which mirrors the change in crystallisation from cF96 to tI6. Furthermore, comparisons of the glassy, metastable cubic and equilibrium tetragonal Mossbauer spectral data show obvious similarities between the glass and big cube which strongly suggest the existence of a common local (short-range) order between the two</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Altounian, Zaven (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj82p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq561</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad791sh89f"><dcterms:title>Uncertain affections : representations of trust in the British sentimental novel of the eighteenth century</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bowen, Michael John.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines representations of trust in selected British sentimental novels of the eighteenth century. It focuses principally on the manner in which sentimental prose fiction reflects and participates in the shift from premodern to modern formations of trust. Commenting on the nature of modern trust, Anthony Giddens claims that, with the move to modernity, trust relations in the intimate sphere become increasingly dependent on emotional mutuality, while trust in institutions becomes increasingly impersonal and disengaged from assessments of moral character. My work explores this dual shift in three sentimental novels. It first analyzes Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740) and contends that Richardson denies the concept of honor its epistemological role in practical deliberations. The denial of the epistemology of honor uncouples the mechanism of personal trust from assessments of role and role performance and thus makes the trust in persons in the intimate sphere less dependent on institutional forms of trust. To replace honor's role in the formation of trust, Richardson proposes that the sentiments can provide reliable grounds for trust in the intimate sphere. However, he denies the sentiments a role in the formation of an encompassing social trust among strangers and mere acquaintances. The thesis proceeds to read Henry Fielding's Amelia (1751). In order to argue that Fielding envisioned divergent grounds for trust relations, it maintains that Fielding considers trust relations in the intimate sphere and trust relations in public life as based on the sentiments and fair distribution respectively. To conclude, the thesis investigates Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) to uncover the manner in which Goldsmith distinguishes personal trust in the intimate sphere from general system trust, which Goldsmith ultimately envisions as an ontological trust in providence.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hensley, David C.

C. crescentus possesses an unique cell cycle with a complex developmental program in that the bacterium asymmetrically divides to produce a replication competent stalked cell and replication incompetent swarmer cell. Previously, a chromosomal fragment was shown to support autonomous plasmid replication. In addition, sequence analysis of this autonomous replicating sequence (ARS) 500 by fragment, termed Cori, exhibited some shared features characteristic of a typical replication origin. However, as not all identified ARS elements are chromosomal replication origins, it was therefore shown by two-dimensional (2-D) DNA agarose gel electrophoresis analysis that chromosomal replication is bi-directional and originates within the Cori region (Chapter 2). Tracing of the leading strand path of nascent DNA within the Cori region not only supported the 2-D gel analysis results, but also indicated that replication initiates from within Cori (Chapter 3). Thus, it is confirmed that Cori is the chromosomal replication origin in C. crescentus and that replication proceeds bi-directionally. Nascent replicated DNA is methylated by the methyltransferase CcrM, but transcription of ccrM is indirectly dependent on synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate, a precursor for cell membrane phospholipid synthesis (Chapter 6). A feature unique to C. crescentus is the global response regulator CtrA that controls key events within the cell cycle such as chromosomal replication. CtrA represses replication in the swarmer cell by binding to five specific sites on Cori. In order to allow replication to initiate, CtrA is removed from the stalked cell by proteolytic degradation. Another interesting feature is that Cori resides within an unusual gene cluster.

In the first study, two different manipulations were used to examine whether faces automatically trigger holistic processing operations as measured by the composite effect. The results support a modular account of face perception. The second study introduces a novel rivalry phenomenon produced by overlapped upright tilted faces. The results indicate that this effect is dependent upon orientation with overlapped inverted faces being perceived as ambiguous in a majority of trials. The third study further examined the factors underlying this rivalry effect. It was found that contrast reversal did not influence the rivalry effect produced by overlapped upright faces and that overlapped houses did not produce rivalry. Results from both studies were taken as evidence that faces are more readily processed as Gestalts compared to other complex objects and therefore engage domain specific operations. The results also suggest that fast operations underlie perception of a face as a Gestalt. Finally, it was suggested that the rivalry effect produced by overlapped faces may illustrate informational encapsulation in face perception. In the fourth study, faces were used to investigate the relationship between attention and modular functions. Three separate experiments showed that faces and houses compete for attention. This finding suggests that the face perception module does not have its own dedicated attentional resources but rather shares a common pool with other visual processes. Results from one experiment also suggested an advantage for faces in the allocation of attention at very short presentation times. This advantage was postulated to arise from two interacting mechanisms that is, faces capture attention over other objects and faces are more automatically encoded than other objects. Together, these studies indicate that a modular conceptualization of face processing is both appropriate and useful. They also demonstrate the utility of faces for investigating cognitive mechanisms that mediate modular functions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chaudhuri, Avi (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd78p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wr909</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Face perception</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am613n0277"><dcterms:title>An analysis of the relationship between quality of work life and motivation for correctional services officers in the Montreal area /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bolduc, Richard R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between quality of work life and motivation of French-speaking Correctional Services Officers (CSOs) working in the Montreal area. Three hundred and forty-seven male and female CSOs (ranging from 19 to 58 years of age) working in four different provincial correctional establishments were assessed. Each participant completed an introductory questionnaire, Pelsma, Richard, Harrington, and Burry's (1989) French-translated 8-item Quality of Work Life Survey (QWL-F) and Blais, Briere, Lachance, Riddle, and Vallerand's (1993) French-translated 8-item Work Motivation Inventory (BWMI-F). Assessment of quality of work life and motivation for CSOs were analyzed with an emphasis on differences in gender and work status. Using different correlational analyses as well as multiple regressions, the findings from this inquiry indicated that motivation and quality of work life were positively correlated. Male and female CSOs reported to be more intrinsically motivated as they started their careers and became amotivated and in need of greater extrinsic rewards as they became older with greater work experience. Hence, younger and less experienced male and female CSOs would eventually become influenced by their older workmates. Female CSOs appeared to be more stressed and reported greater levels of amotivation than their male colleagues. However, female CSOs reported a greater ease in communicating their concerns and in consulting with internal and external resources.

The role of sparger wettability on bubble formation was examined using three rigid spargers exhibiting water contact angles of 0, 64 and &gt;90°. The wettability was varied by heating the sparger, and the contact angle was determined by the Washburn and modified Washburn methods. By measuring permeability, it was determined that heating had no effect on sparger pore structure. The results showed no detectable wettability effect on bubble formation over the practical operating range of column flotation. The lack of wettability effect may be attributed to the highly irregular morphology of the sparger surface. The bubble size, it was shown, can be predicted by using the concept of sparger equivalent pore diameter and active pore number, which are estimated by a back-calculation routine. Project two. Production of oil from oil sand deposits in northern Alberta involves open pit mining, mixing the ore with water, extraction of bitumen from the slurry by a flotation-related process (Hot Water Extraction Process), removal of water and solids from the froth formed (froth treatment process), and upgrading the heavy bitumen to liquid hydrocarbons. The froth treatment process to remove fine solids and water from the bitumen froth depends on the wettability of the solids. Fine solids were extracted from samples of bitumen froth using heptane. A mixture of heptane and toluene (diluent) was used to study fine solid wettability. The contact angle (sessile drop method) and partition of the fine solids among the aqueous, diluent and interphase regions were determined. The effect of diluent composition, sample drying, and surface washing was examined. The partition of the particles correlated well with their wettability, and the results helped interpret observations from plant practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J. A.

Such failure is caused by stable axial tearing that involves a substantial amount of plastic deformation, and is driven by the kinetic energy of the expanding gas. Various semiempirical relationships exist in the literature to predict the toughness required for resistance to the propagation of a dynamic ductile failure, but these tend to be ineffective when applied to higher strength grades of steel. The present finite-element model is composed of two main sub-models. The gas decompression algorithm is based on analytical expressions and calculates the gas pressure throughout the pipe as the ductile fracture propagates. The material-response algorithm determines the behaviour of the material under the changing loading conditions by simulating the material response. This work produced the first simulation in which the crack tip was not advanced 'artificially', but propagated or arrested in response to the entire system, i.e. the linepipe and the decompressing gas. For simulations in which the variables affecting the flow stress were altered, the rate of work hardening had the greatest influence on the crack tip propagation characteristics, while the states of stress and strain ahead of the propagating crack tip were shown to undergo a complex evolution during the failure process. On the basis of literature data for full-scale crack-arrest tests performed using X70 grade linepipe steel, the model was shown to be in good agreement with crack arrest/propagate observations and the crack velocity measurements, as well as effectively reproducing the burst pipe geometry. Finally, for higher strength grade linepipe steels, the model was able to match the results measured from the full-scale crack arrest test. The results from the simulations of this test demonstrated that, as in the actual test, the crack would arrest in the third segment, but this appeared to be heavily influenced by the material properties of the following segment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nemes, Jim A.

In the first part numerical simulations were conducted to study the flow and mixing behavior of two-dimensional laminar confined impinging streams. Reynolds numbers beyond which the flow becomes oscillatory and even random were determined for different geometric configurations. Simulations were performed for cases with jet Reynolds numbers in the stable regime to study the mixing characteristics of the system. Numerical simulations were also conducted to study fluid mixing in a novel two-dimensional in-line mixer utilizing multiple impinging stream inlets. Offsetting the top and bottom inlet jets is found effective in improving the quality of mixing due to the presence of intense mixing zones between the inlet jets. In the second part a study of turbulent flow and heat transfer in two-dimensional confined impinging streams was conducted. A new composite turbulence model is proposed and verified by comparing its predictions with available experimental impingement heat transfer data as well as the experimental velocity and temperature distributions in impinging streams obtained in this work. Better agreement between experimental and numerical results predicted by this new model is noted compared to those predicted by other low-Reynolds number kappa-epsilon turbulence models tested. The model was then used to perform a parametric study of the mixing characteristics of two-dimensional turbulent confined impinging streams. Finally, a numerical study of the gas-particle flow and drying in turbulent two-dimensional confined impinging streams was conducted. Continuous-phase conservation equations are written in the Eulerian frame while the particle equations are written in the Lagrangian frame. Two-way physical coupling between the continuous and particulate phases is taken into account in the governing conservation equations. Monte Carlo stochastic approach is used to model particle dispersion due to the turbulent fluctuations of the continuous-phase velocity. Effects of various operating parameters on the flow and drying behavior of the system are reported and discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mujumdar, A. S.
