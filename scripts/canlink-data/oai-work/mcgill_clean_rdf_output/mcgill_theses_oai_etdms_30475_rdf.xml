Carrot slices and french fry style sweet potatoes were blanched in a 700 W domestic microwave oven as well as in boiling water for different treatment times. Blanched and unblanched samples were packaged in retort pouches and frozen stored at $-$20$ sp circ$C, and evaluated for peroxidase activity, texture and color before and after blanching, and after 3.5 and/or 7 months frozen storage. Kinetics of peroxidase activity and texture softening due to blanching was described by semi-logarithmic models. All frozen products, except unblanched samples, were of good quality at the end of 7 months storage. Small quality differences were detected in the blanched frozen samples during storage; samples blanched for intermediate times were superior. Temperature distribution profiles were determined for model foods consisting of a starch gel with different concentrations of protein and fat, as well as commercial frozen and refrigerated prepared foods. Microwave heating of model foods showed considerable nonuniformity in temperature distribution and alarmingly low center temperatures. Prolonged lower power heating or holding after microwave heating did not always elevate center temperatures to safe levels. Addition of protein to the starch gel reduced temperature uniformity and heating rate, while added fat resulted in an opposite trend. For the commercial foods, center temperatures reached after heating according to manufacturer's instructions were below 70$ sp circ$C indicating some safety concerns. However, longer heating time at lower power levels improved the temperature uniformity as well as the quality and appearance of these foods.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ramaswamy, H. S.

Automated blood sampling systems increase the accuracy of this measurement, particularly for short-lived tracers such as oxygen-15, by reducing the sampling interval to a fraction of a second. They, however, require correction for tracer delay between the arterial puncture site and the external radiation detector (external delay), and for the tracer bolus distortion in the sampling catheter (external dispersion). We have evaluated and implemented the "Scanditronix" automated blood sampling system and measured its external delay and dispersion. PET studies of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism using simultaneous manual and automated blood sampling were analyzed and compared.

The neoplastic transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells induced spontaneously or by chemical carcinogens and oncogenes is consistently associated with the development of resistance to the mito-inhibitory effect of TGF-$ beta$, suggesting that such phenotype plays an essential role during the transformation of these cells. We have studied the development of this "TGF-$ beta$, resistant" phenotype in a clonal strain of early passage normal cultured rat liver epithelial cells whose proliferation is markedly inhibited by TGF-$ beta$. A continuous control culture of these cells results in a gradual but spontaneous development of TGF-$ beta$ resistance. When the same cells were exposed to step-wise increases of the TGF-$ beta$ concentration in the medium, spontaneous transformation occurred significantly earlier than that in the control cells. After the same number of cumulative population doublings, the TGF-$ beta$ treated cells were much more resistant to the mito-inhibitory effect of TGF-$ beta$ than the control cells, and they exhibited an enhanced constitutive expression of the c-myc mRNA. The results suggest that TGF-$ beta$ facilitates or "promotes" spontaneous transformation. The TGF-$ beta$ resistant cells also showed increased resistance to the cytotoxins Adriamycin and Melphalan. This drug resistance was accompanied by an increase in the MDR-1 mRNA level, the cellular content of the glutathione and the activity of glutathione-S-transferase, thus suggesting a close association between the development of the TGF-$ beta$ resistance and the multidrug resistant phenotypes.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139316g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc88t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am039k631b"><dcterms:title>The heat shock response of the rat embryo during organogenesis /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tseng, Caroline</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Little is known about the pathway leading from a stressful stimulus such as hyperthermia or cadmium to a malformation, and the possibility of the heat shock response being linked to this phenomenon prompted the studies in this thesis. In order to determine the relationship between the ability of heat or cadmium to induce a heat shock response and the ability of these stressors to induce abnormal embryogenesis, rat embryos were cultured during organogenesis and the steady-state mRNAs of two heat shock proteins were used as indicators of the stress response in these embryos. The extent of mRNA accumulation for each heat shock protein varied depending on the tissue examined. When embryos were cultured in the presence of cadmium chloride, hsp27 and hsp70 mRNAs took much longer to accumulate compared to those observed following heat shock. Thus, the time course of heat shock protein mRNA accumulation was quite different in embryos exposed to cadmium from those exposed to hyperthermia. In addition, the concentrations of hsp27 and hsp70 mRNA appears to be differentially regulated in both embryo and yolk sac tissues for embryos treated with heat or cadmium. In conclusion, mammalian embryos are able to mount a heat shock response through the accumulation of hsp27 and hsp70 mRNAs in response to hyperthermia or cadmium treatments. The extent of this response appears to correlate with the teratogenicity effects of hyperthermia but not with those of cadmium.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hales, B. F.

In this thesis I discuss the notion of autonomous and self-responsible individuality as a culturally constructed and culturally specific idea. Furthermore, I describe autonomy as only one of a complex of related features of the modern individual, including a withdrawn and objectifying stance toward the natural world, values and other human beings. In this thesis, I examine two seventeenth-century authors--Robert Burton and John Locke--each of whom represents a different conception of individuality. Burton emulates communal conceptions of identity characteristic of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, while Locke describes an essentially modern, analytical individuality based on the control and possession of an objectified "other". The theoretical framework for this analysis is derived from Michel Foucault and Timothy Reiss' description of the transition from the Renaissance to the seventeenth century as a transition between different epistemes or discourses. Throughout this thesis, I supplement this essentially structuralist approach with perspectives from Medieval, Renaissance and seventeenth-century cosmology, literary theory, political theory and epistemology.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kilgour, Maggie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv44z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zs01s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Individualism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Locke, John, 1632-1704 -- Views on individualism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Burton, Robert, 1577-1640 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asb3979488"><dcterms:title>A stereo auditory image-perception aid for the blind /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tantribeau, Patrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents the research to develop a technical aid for the blind to perceive images such as a face or a scenery.

In addition, a Time-Multiplexer circuit was built to support inputs from two finger-probes which are made by using two styluses of the graphics tablet. The system softwares were programmed to present the images as stereo auditory display. The aid was evaluated on six blind-from-birth subjects and ten blindfolded sighted subjects to determine how fast and accurately they could perceive different multi-gray level images, and how their performance changed with increased experience.

Five different connection specimens were constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading to determine their seismic responses. The specimens represent a series of horizontal connections between double-tee flanges or between a double-tee flange and lateral load resisting element in a typical roof of a precast concrete structure. The analytical study consisted of two parts: linear finite element analysis of the connection to determine the test specimen geometry and to define its boundary conditions, and non-linear finite element analysis, using the NONLACS program, to predict the complete responses of the connections subjected to monotonically increasing loads. The experimental results were compared with the predictions made using theoretical calculations, the CPCI design method and non-linear finite element analysis. It is noted that the CPCI design method gives conservative predictions for the ultimate strength of the connection reinforced with a bent deformed bar anchor and a 90$ sp circ$ hook, and the one with two deformed bars oriented at 45$ sp circ$ and headed studs, both welded to a steel plate. The predicted ultimate strength of the connection with a bent deformed bar anchor welded to a steel plate and one with two straight deformed bar, oriented at 90$ sp circ$ and welded to an embedded steel angle, are close to the experimental results. The ultimate strength of the connection wit the headed studs welded to a steel plate predicted by CPCI method is overestimated.

Differences in the quality of the stress and in the coping experience were explored. Findings indicate that occupational stress was present for volunteers. The major stressors common to all were issues of relationships with patients and the demands of the role. For volunteers who had had a cancer diagnosis a major stressor distinguishing them was the death of volunteer colleagues. Overall, volunteers utilized a range of coping resources offered by the organization and from within themselves. Key implications include the need to acknowledge not only the strengths of the program and volunteers but the sources of stress, particularly the illness of volunteer colleagues.

The thesis begins with a presentation of a general framework defining rights and their relationship to obligations. It then includes an assessment of whether or not animals, according to the general framework, can properly be called rights bearers. In order to do this, the questions of whether or not animals have value independent of their value to human beings and whether or not animals have interests are examined. Though the thesis concerns itself with animals it is not merely an examination of animal rights. In order to investigate fully the place of animals within our moral thought, many concepts which are central to ethics such as "rights", "equality", "value", and "affinity" are examined.

In the wild, diet overlap between feral goldfish (Carassius auratus) and native red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus v. viridescens) is high, leading to potential interspecific competition over food. In the laboratory, we manipulated densities of goldfish and red-spotted newts to test competition for benthic food organisms between these unrelated species. No intraspecific interference was noted for either goldfish or newts at any density. However, as density increased food resources were more rapidly depleted by both species, suggesting scramble competition. Foraging strategies of the species differed. Goldfish shoaled more and abandoned food patches before they were depleted, whereas newts were solitary and exhausted a food patch before moving on to new sites. Both species found more food patches when with heterospecifics than with conspecifics, suggesting interspecific information transfer. In addition, goldfish found more food patches than newts in all trials, indicating scramble competition occurred.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Whoriskey, Frederick G.

After a definition according to three approaches (traditional, geographical, quantitative), the provisions of the Rome Treaty on competition law (articles 85 and 86) are elaborated upon, to underline the reinforcement of the Commission's control powers since the entry into force of Council Regulation N$ sp circ$4064/89, in September 1990. The air transport industry has been chosen to illustrate the concept of a priori control of concentrations and its modalities of application in different economic policies. Jurisprudence and various regulations have promoted the application of EEC competition law to the air transport industry, and have contributed recently to the emergence of a common policy in this field. The Aerospatiale/de Havilland decision constitutes the first dismissal of a concentration notification, since the entry into force of the new provisions. It confirms the wide scope of the Commission's powers in the control of competition.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Haanappel, P. P. C.

The European Commission admitted the inevitable character of this trend towards concentrations among transporters but wished to control the issue, to prevent any infringement to the principles of competition as stated in the EEC Treaty. Initially elaborated by a consequent jurisprudence of the European Communities Court of Justice, this control led to the adoption in 1989, of a specific regulation on concentrations. Considered as an essential tool towards the realisation of the Community objectives, its implementing must nevertheless be combined with the imperatives of a common industrial policy and take into account the globalisation trend that is attached to this activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Haanappel, P.

Substitution of Mg$ sp{++}$ in the growth medium of CTC-resistant strains with Ca$ sp{++}$ and Sr$ sp{++}$ resulted in dramatic changes in growth and cell mass of cultures. Exposure of CTC-grown cells to EDTA did not result in cell lysis. SDS-PAGE of outer membrane proteins of resistant cells revealed loss of a protein band of molecular weight 73,500 D and the appearance of a 54,000 D protein band. Growth of cells resistant to CTC was hampered by subsequent exposure to penicillin G. Chelation of divalent cations from the outer membrane of sensitive cells leading to cell disruption is postulated as the primary mode of action of this antibiotic against P. aeruginosa.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ingram, Jordan M.

This thesis is concerned with an evaluation and enhancement of some aspects of recent co-located equal-order FVMs and CVFEMs. In particular, the goals of this thesis are the following: (1) formulation and computer implementation of a co-located equal-order FVM that facilitates the evaluation and enhancement tasks; (2) evaluation and enhancement of iterative sequential and coupled-equation solvers; and (3) comparative evaluation of a recently proposed mass-weighted skew upwind scheme (MAW) against five well-established schemes. The proposed equal-order co-located FVM is formulated for the prediction of steady, two-dimensional, incompressible, viscous fluid flow in planar rectangular domains. This FVM deals directly with the velocity components and pressure, or primitive variables. The rectangular domains are discretized using structured line-by-line rectilinear grids, and rectangular control volumes are constructed around each grid point. All dependent variables are co-located or stored at the same grid points, and interpolated on the same rectangular elements in an equal-order formulation. A computer program incorporating the proposed FVM has been developed and tested successfully. On the basis of an evaluation of some available iterative solvers, two improved algorithms are proposed in this work: (1) Enhanced Sequential Solution Algorithm (ESSA); and (2) Sequential Variable Adjustment (SEVA) algorithm. Test results obtained with these algorithms are very encouraging, particularly with ESSA. The comparative evaluation of the MAW scheme shows that its performance is comparable to the skew upwind difference scheme (SUDS) of Raithby (89).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baliga, B. R.

Wastewater characteristics such as suspended solids (SS), turbidity, iron content, transmittance at 254 nm, and dissolved organic carbon were monitored to assess their effect on UV disinfection. Fecal coliforms were used as indicators to measure disinfection performance. UV disinfection was capable of reducing the fecal coliform counts from typical values of 0.2-3 million CFU/100ml (depending on the process and season) to thousands, hundreds or tens per 100 ml, depending on the dose applied, the process used for phosphorus removal, and wastewater quality. High turbidity values yielded higher surviving microbial counts; disinfection effectiveness decreased by 10% for each NTU of turbidity increase. SS in the wastewater scattered the UV light, leading to dose underestimations and the illusion that higher SS would yield better disinfection effectiveness. A photoreactivation increase of 8.1 and 11.7 fold was observed for iron-treated and alum-treated effluents respectively. Dark repair increases were very different for iron-treated and alum-treated effluents; however, in terms of dark repaired fraction, both effluents had values within the same range. UV disinfection was not found to cause any additional toxicity in the wastewater.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehr, Ronald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx39b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j9322</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn40m"><dcterms:title>A high-order finite element method for Tokamak plasma equilibria /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Marrett, Sean, 1960-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A numerical method for the solution of the axisymmetric, free-boundary, Tokamak equilibrium problem is described.

Arbitrary coil and plasma current configurations can be specified. The formulation incorporates a nonlinear procedure for computing the coil currents required to place the plasma in a desired position. The solution to the nonlinear Grad-Shafranov equation is computed using a modified Newton's method. The inner-most system of sparse, linear equations is solved using a preconditioned, conjugate gradient algorithm. A computer program, PLEQUI (PLasma EQUIlibrium), was written in a portable FORTRAN dialect to implement the method. The method was tested using both fixed-boundary and free-boundary plasma problems. The program was validated by comparing the results to analytic solutions, by examining the flux plots, or by comparing the solution to the output of another finite-element code.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webb, Jon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hw63s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn40m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qj932"><dcterms:title>By self and violent hands : the "ideal" Lady Macbeth</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Arbuck, Ava</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the most perplexing figures in Shakespeare's tragedies is Lady Macbeth. In light of recent feminist studies, Lady Macbeth must be studied in the social and historical context of Shakespeare's own era. By comparing the situation of women at that time with the vast number of social constraints placed on them through state channels, we see these women emerging from the social ideal of the cloistered submissive wife despite the attempts of patriarchal politics to restrain their advances. Lady Macbeth's actions are often interpreted as those of a bloodthirsty woman overstepping her social position. But Lady Macbeth is a product of a perverse society which worships the warrior-hero and dictates the importance of being a man, "broody, bold, and resolute". Interestingly, contrary to many interpretations, Lady Macbeth never attempts to be anything but a submissive, devoted wife. She and her husband embody the paradoxes inherent in their culture.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Davison, Mary (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vc71x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qj932</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616.

The application of a new nondestructive testing technique known as impact-echo was examined. The technique is based on transient stress wave propagation for the detection of defects in concrete, as well as measuring the setting time, early age strength, and elastic properties. Impact-echo functions by a mechanical impact, where stress pulses are generated in the test subject. The stress pulses undergo multiple reflections between the top and bottom of concrete layers. The surface displacements are recorded and the frequency of the successive arrivals of the reflected pulses is determined. Thus, knowing the thickness of a given layer, together with the measured frequencies, P- and S-wave velocities can be calculated. If on the other hand, the thickness is unknown, the time-distance graph of the primary surface wave arrivals could be used to calculate the thickness. The position of the impact source relative to the receiver must be selected in such a way as to detect P- and S-waves at their maximum reflection amplitude. In this study, defects were detected using the reflected P-waves from their top surfaces. In addition, the change in elastic moduli of various types of concrete mixes was monitored for a 30-day period by measuring P- and S-wave velocities. The impact-echo elastic moduli were then compared with static and dynamic values obtained by standard methods in order to assess their accuracy.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773w95m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg76s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p5899"><dcterms:title>The thermal expansion coefficient of polypropylene and related composites /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Okada, Yoshio, 1928-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The variability of thermal expansion coefficients during the molding of plastics causes the development of frozen thermal stresses in the molded parts. Also, the distribution of thermal expansion coefficients of the material in the molded part plays an important role in controlling shrinkage and warpage. In turn, the distribution of linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTECs) depends on the distributions of crystallinity and orientation in the part. In the case of fibre reinforced polymers, the distributions of fibre concentration and orientation are also important. In this project, a model has been proposed for estimating the LTEC of fibre reinforced plastics as a function of crystallinity, matrix orientation, and fibre concentration and orientation. Also, extensive data have been obtained regarding the LTEC of polypropylene with and without fibre reinforcement. Extruded pellets and injection molded parts were considered.
