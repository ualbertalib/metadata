A prehensile pinch force apparatus was constructed to measure the pinch forces employed when holding a manipulandum between the thumb and index finger, and to determine how these forces changed as a function of the direction of force applied to the hand by a motor connected to the manipulandum and the surface texture of the manipulandum (i.e. plastic, suede, sandpaper). Sensorimotor function was assessed in twelve experimental subjects (patients) and fourteen normal control subjects using a number of tests, including pressure sensitivity, static and moving two-point discrimination, a hand function test, a timed object-recognition and material-recognition test, and a test of pinch strength. On the tests of sensibility and hand function, but not of pinch strength, the experimental group had deficits on the hand contralateral to the cerebral lesion. For all subjects who could perform the prehensile pinch force test (PPFT), pinch forces were modulated with the forces applied to the hand, although most of the experimental subjects did not adjust their pinch forces to the surface texture of the manipulandum. These findings indicate that the PPFT holds promise as an objective measure of hand function.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j669p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w247</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g622m"><dcterms:title>Traumametrics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lett, Ronald</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, measurement theory and the statistical evaluations of diagnostic test performance are applied to the measurement of injury severity. Relevant issues in traumatology, the rationale for measurement of injury severity and the importance of likelihood ratios (LRs) and Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses are discussed. An assessment of the definition, scaling mechanism, reliability and validity of 22 severity instruments is organized into a reference guide. Data sources for this thesis include the literature, the Vancouver General Hospital trauma registry and the Pennsylvania State University trauma registry. The LR and the area under ROC curves (A$ sb{ rm uc}$) are calculated from the best published evaluations of four triage instruments. The CRAMS, PHI, and RTI, which include anatomic information, are superior to the RTS, which contains only physiologic information. A paired ROC curve analysis of the RTS and the RTI demonstrates that the performance of the RTI is equivalent to the RTS when mortality is the outcome; however the performance gain of the RTI over the RTS is 35% when major trauma is the outcome evaluated. Explanations for differences in predictive validity are sought by evaluating scaling mechanisms, reliability and content validity.

Activated carbon (AC) treatment was studied for comparative purposes. Both biological AC treatment increased the recovery of chalcopyrite in a single mineral microflotation test, from approximately 5.5% to 14.4% and 7.2% respectively. However, major differences were observed between various samples when comparing the number and types of bubbles produced during frothing tests. As expected, the number of bubbles produced per given volume decreased following AC treatment, approaching that of tap water. However, after biological treatment, the number of bubbles was increased. It is suspected that the changes produced by biological treatment in the recycle water might produce organic matter more surface active than that initially found in the wastewater.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j38608109.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q347</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gt82k"><dcterms:title>"Peasant Concord" between the wars : an examination of the cultural wing of the Croatian Peasant Party with special reference to the 1920s</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of History</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sraka, Anthony M.

It consistently received between seventy and ninety per cent of the Croatian vote and it ranked as the largest party in Croatia, and the second largest in Yugoslavia. In 1925 Rudolf Herceg, a leading party ideologue, created the CPP's cultural wing: Peasant Concord (Seljacka Sloga): which worked to promote peasant culture as separate from and superior to that of modern industrial society elsewhere in Europe. Although the political aspects of the Croatian Peasant Party have been well-covered, its cultural wing has been comparatively neglected.

Surface disposal is costly and its potential harm to the environment is incalculable. Besides waste disposal paste backfill also produces a stronger fill resulting in less dilution, less cement consumption and less clean up costs. These savings can only be realized with an accurate implementation of the new technology. Presented is an overview of the current state of this emerging technology and the available equipment required for the preparation and transportation of paste backfill. It is hoped this work will provide the reader with a thorough grounding in paste backfill and enable him/her to understand that although large savings are possible the technology is still unproven within the context of the Canadian mining industry and further work is required before paste backfill becomes common practice. Economic analyses are also presented regarding the different applications of paste at either existing or new mineral developments. Results from strength tests carried out as part of paste backfill feasibility projects are presented and show the increase in uniaxial compressive strength associated with an increase in slurry concentration.

In this work it is shown that the Hamiltonian can be used as a Liapunov function. A reel rate law is devised that stabilizes the in-plane and out-of-plane librations at the same time, for two-body systems. However, since the resulting motion has some deficiencies, this reel rate law is not extended to multi-body systems. For overcoming these deficiencies, two new reel rate laws are proposed and their performances are examined through the energy dissipation approach together with the averaging method. The resulting motions with all the reel rate laws, including the one from Liapunov approach, are limit cycle oscillations. The reel rate laws obtained from the energy dissipation approach perform efficient retrievals with sufficiently small out-of-plane limit cycle amplitudes. These reel rate laws are extended to multi-body systems. For multi-body systems a station-keeping stage is added that brings the system to a final desired configuration. An analysis on the effects of different parameters and gains on the resulting motion has also been performed.

The LSAR estimation method, which is more accurate and robust than previous methods, minimizes the sensitivity to measurement noise by using rigid-body motion constraints, multiple data samples per estimate and sound numerical methods. Results of simulations and in vitro experiments demonstrate that the LSAR method provides better results than the popular Reuleaux and helical axis methods. Furthermore, the parameters obtained with the LSAR method accurately predict the trajectory of arbitrary points of the rigid-body, given their initial position and orientation. An in vivo experiment studying the location of the AOR of the human ankle joint using the LSAR method is presented. The results show that the LSAR method estimates are compatible with published experimental data.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js24m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r213r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
