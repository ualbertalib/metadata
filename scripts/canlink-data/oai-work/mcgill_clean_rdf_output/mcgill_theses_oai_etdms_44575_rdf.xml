Different type of substrates were used for the moving mold; copper, low  carbon steel, alumina coated steel, nickel coated steel, and zirconia coated steel.  Interfacial heat fluxes between the solidifying strip and the moving mold substrate  were calculated by the IHCP (Inverse Heat Conduction Problem) technique. The  temperature history of the solidifying strip was calculated using the Enthalpy FVM  (Finite Volume Method) associated with Scheil's model of solidification. The  influence of thermophysical and morphological properties of mold substrates, wetting  environment, casting speed, melt superheat, and grain refiner, on strip  microstructures and their cooling rates, were thoroughly  investigated. Maximum heat fluxes appeared about 0.1~0.2 seconds after  the moment of thermal contact. For a copper substrate, these reached up to 7 MW/m 2,  whereas those for a steel substrate were ~3 MW/m2. The rate of heat transfer  to coated substrates was significantly delayed and reduced because of the low  thermal conductivity of coating layers. Maximum cooling rates of aluminum and  magnesium strips reached about 200°C/s on copper and about 150°C/s  on steel. It was found that the major thermal resistance resided in an  interfacial layer separating the strip from the substrate. This interfacial layer  presumably corresponded to the shrinkage of solidified skin or the entrainment of a  thin air film resulting in numerous air pockets at the bottom surface of strips. Oil  spraying onto the mold surface changed the interfacial wettability and dramatically  improved the cast surface of the strips. The good quality of strip samples obtained  suggests the high potential for the direct casting of these alloys on single belt  casters.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483j83v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g8037</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vb79x"><dcterms:title>God's mobile mansions : Protestant church relocation and extension in Montreal, 1850-1914</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Trigger, Rosalyn</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Extensive church building programmes and the relocation of  existing churches were important features of Protestant congregational life in  industrializing cities across Britain and North America. In Montreal, building booms  in the 1860s, 70s, and 80s led many congregations to abandon their old churches in  the centre of the city and rebuild on a grander scale 'uptown', closer to the  residential neighbourhoods to which their wealthier members were moving. In the  early twentieth century, when a new phase of growth engulfed the city, many of the  same congregations again faced the dilemma of whether or not to move. Whereas the  earlier period was characterized by a strong evangelical consensus, the subsequent  period was associated with wider-ranging theological and social debates: the context  of decision-making had changed. For each period, I explore the impact of building decisions on  'domestic' ministries to church members and on the 'public' ministries that  congregations carried out in the environs of their churches and in working-class  neighbourhoods. In doing so, I draw on a variety of methodological approaches and on  local sources that have not previously been synthesized. A database containing  temporal and spatial information for every Protestant church built in Montreal  between 1760 and 1914 was also constructed for this project. Case studies of six  'uptown' congregations, and of a downtown neighbourhood that was a popular mission  field, are carried out. Investigation of documentary sources such as church minute  books and correspondence is complemented by cartographic and sociological analyses  of church membership using city directories, tax rolls, censuses, and the recently  completed Montreal l'Avenir du Passe historical geo-database. A systematic sampling  of local newspapers and denominational records brings to life the many  congregational controversies and dilemmas that spilled over into the public sphere  during a time of dramatic urban, social, and theological change. A range of external factors, both material and spiritual,  affected the choices that were made. I show how investment in religious edifices  during the original phase of church moves, as well as the heightened social  exclusivity that these moves generated, made it more challenging for the next  generation to adapt their religious institutions to the needs of the  twentieth-century city. Congregations simultaneously had to deal with a number of  ongoing tensions: the logic of institutional maintenance versus the logic of  mission, competition versus cooperation amongst Protestant institutions, and the  dynamic between capitalist materialism and Christianity. Unless these tensions were  skilfully negotiated by church leaders, they threatened to destroy either the  viability or the integrity of religious institutions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247ds62q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vb79x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Protestant church buildings -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Church history -- 19th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Church buildings -- Location -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p7648"><dcterms:title>First-principles study of transport properties of molecular devices : fullerene and carbon nanotube systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liu, Yi, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The discovery of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes has been very  significant to the field of nanotechnology by providing an abundance of stable,  highly symmetric, non-reactive, and relatively large molecules that can, in  principle, be manipulated one at a time. At the present stage, a theoretical effort  should be carried out in order to find and understand novel phenomena in  molecule-based nanostructures which could serve as a basis for fabricating useful  molecular devices. In this thesis we investigate from first-principles the transport  properties of molecular devices: fullerene and carbon nanotube  systems. We begin with charge transport in carbon nanotubes with oxygen,  and find that the interaction between oxygen molecules and carbon nanotubes  significantly modifies the electronic structure near the Fermi level for both zigzag  and armchair tubes. The subtle difference of the adsorption sites of oxygen and the  distance between oxygen and nanotubes can cause totally different results of their  transport properties. Then we investigate current flow from the point of view of  current density distribution in molecular devices, for current density gives local  information of nonequilibrium transport, thereby providing useful and vivid insight  to transport properties of molecular electronics. It has been found when an  intrinsic carbon nanotube is doped with either a boron or a nitrogen atoms through a  replacement of a carbon atom, the local physical properties around the impurity  atoms (boron or nitrogen) undergo a significant change, resulting in a dramatic  change of the local current distribution. It is suggested that there appears a  chiral current flow in the B- and N-doped armchair nanotubes near the impurity. As  for a gated C 60 molecular device, the current distribution and the total current  flow are both obviously affected by the gate voltage, which indicates the importance  of the gate voltage in such a molecular device. Finally, we discuss the contact effects on transport properties  of the molecular devices. We study the effects of the contact geometry as well as  the electrode material and find that different orientations of C 60 connected to  Au(111) leads can cause significant changes in the current-voltage (I-V)  characteristics of such C60 molecular devices. On the other hand, the electrode  material is crucial to obtain low resistance ohmic contacts. Our first-principles  calculations of transport suggest that Ti has higher affinity for carbide formation.  So the choice of proper electrode materials will play an important role in the  design of nanoscale devices.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sd238.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p7648</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab8515n88g"><dcterms:title>Boiotian black figure floral ware : a re-analysis of the Southern style with an introduction to floral groups from Halíartos</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Walker, Lauren L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Black Figure Floral Ware is an understudied style of pottery  which was produced in Boiotia and the nearby regions of Euboia and Phokis during the  fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E. Floral Style vases are painted with compositions  formed predominantly of palmettes and lotuses rendered in black gloss without the  incised details which are typically associated with Black Figure pottery. The corpus  of Boiotian Floral Ware is divided into two sub-styles: the Northern Style and the  Southern Style. The Northern Style is thought to have been produced in the area  North and West of the Kopais while the Southern Style was chiefly produced in the  Thespiai-Thebes and the Tanagra regions. To date our understanding of the  development of the Southern Style has been based on systematically excavated floral  evidence from Rhitsona (Ancient Mykalessos) and the Thespian Polyandrion and random  vases from the Skhimatari Museum. Previous research incorrectly identified Tanagra  as the primary source of Southern Floral Ware with little regard for Thebes as an  important producer. Newly discovered ceramic evidence from four Theban cemeteries  now indicates that Thebes was in fact a major producer of Floral Ware. The  excavations have brought to light new floral groups and have provided evidence which  indicates that vases previously identified as Tanagran or Euboian are more likely to  be Theban. This dissertation chronicles the morphological and  iconographical development of the Southern Floral Style according to the  systematically excavated floral vases from Rhitsona and the Thespian Polyandrion.  Rim and base profiles from the Thespian Polyandrion, Thebes and Haliartos are  classified and floral motifs from datable contexts are assigned to types. The  evidence indicates that it is the overall shape of the vase and the decorative  details within the compositions, rather than a specific rim or base type or  compositional layout that identifies regional differences, if any. Newly excavated  vases from Haliartos are presented not only to provide a contrast for the Southern  Style Floral Ware, particularly in terms of their shape, but also in order to  establish a bridge between this dissertation and any future studies of the Northern  Style Floral Ware.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h243d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515n88g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vases, Black-figured -- Greece -- Voiōtia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Voiōtia (Greece) -- Antiquities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vase-painting, Greek -- Greece -- Voiōtia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pottery, Greek -- Greece -- Voiōtia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vases, Greek -- Greece -- Voiōtia.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53ww30d"><dcterms:title>Mapping the gendered nature of inter-organizational relationships in girls' education : a case study of the Alliance - Uganda partnership</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Garrow, Stephanie S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The overall purpose of this study was to explore the  effectiveness of a feminist methodology in examining the inter-organizational  relationships (IORs) of a partnership for girls' education in Uganda. An in-depth  case study was carried out on the Alliance for Community Action on Female Education  - Uganda chapter (the Alliance). The Alliance was a multi-sector partnership between  international donors, the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES), and Ugandan  non-governmental (NGOs) and community based organizations (CBOs). Using a feminist approach to spatial mapping, interviews, focus  groups and collaborative research activities, the study explored the 'lived'  inter-organizational experiences of the Ugandan women and men involved in the  Alliance partnership. This choice in methodology responds to the belief that there  is limited attention placed on how inter-organizational relationships are examined  through the lens of gender, and that there is a need to challenge the male-dominated  policy discourse and literature around international cooperation and development.  The findings of the study yielded evidence of two main concepts: (1) the Alliance  Model---the components that make up the Alliance partnership; and (2) the Alliance  Approach---the pedagogies and processes through which the partnership is carried  out. These concepts articulate how participants understand the Alliance's IORs from  a gender perspective and how these IORs affect gender transformation in  education. The study also discusses the challenges implicit in using  feminist methodology to interrogate inter-organizational relationships through the  lens of gender. The findings of the study are therefore presented as a 'mapping' of  a new language on how we understand and talk about multi-sector partnerships through  the lens of gender. The study has important implications for the way development  partnerships in education are designed and managed. It recommends the use of  explicit gender analysis and frameworks to ensure that programs and partnerships  move beyond simply meeting 'practical' needs for girls and women and focus on  creating models and approaches that lead to transformative gender equality results  for girls' education.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nb684.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww30d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Feminism and education -- Uganda</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Education -- Uganda</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azp38wd19f"><dcterms:title>1979 : reading the tax-shelter boom in Canadian film history</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Urquhart, Peter</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>More certified-Canadian feature films were shot in Canada in  1979 than in any other year. The height of what has become known as the  "tax-shelter boom," 1979 stands as a remarkable moment in the history of  the Canadian cinema, with 70 features shot in a year in which Hollywood produced  only 99 films. The extant history of the Canadian cinema has largely ignored this  moment, and in this thesis I argue that the slim treatment of the period by critics  represents a "received wisdom," consistently repeated, but seldom  scrutinized, and that this received wisdom is representative of the culturally  nationalist impulse which has coloured the entire historiography of the Canadian  cinema. Because many of the films produced during the boom were in the style of  Hollywood genres, the "received wisdom" presents the entirety of the  tax-shelter boom as a cultural and industrial near-disaster for the Canadian cinema,  and this thesis, partly a revisionist history, explores not only those conclusions,  but also provides critical discussion of them. I begin by presenting the received wisdom, the existing account,  on the period. This is followed by a chapter which situates the tax-shelter boom in  a history of state intervention in the feature film industry. Following this, I  provide analysis of the contexts surrounding the tax-shelter boom, including  critical discussion of articles and reviews from the contemporaneous popular press,  and of the industry discourse. I then turn my attention to the texts themselves,  which the received wisdom more or less ignores, and provide three  thematically-organized chapters of textual analysis: the first organized around  readings of gender and genre in the films, the second on the prevalent theme of  "selling out," which is central to numerous films of the period, and a  third chapter which explores the place of Quebec in the films of the  period. The thesis concludes with an analysis of the material effects of  the government policies which led to the boom, and concludes that in this respect  too, the received account of the period---once again, as a failure---needs to be  reexamined.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n06m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wd19f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Motion picture industry -- Canada -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion picture industry -- Québec (Province) -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- Canada -- Plots, themes, etc.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237hs39p"><dcterms:title>Oligonucleotides applied in genomics, bioinformatics and development of molecular markers for rice and barley</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liu, Shaolin, 1968-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A genome sequence can be conceptualized as a 'book' written with  four nucleotide 'letters' in oligonucleotide (oligo) 'words'. These words can be  used in genomics, bioinformatics and the development of molecular markers. The  whole-genome sequence for rice (Oryza sativa L.) is almost finished and has been  assembled into pseudomolecules. For barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) expressed sequence  tags (ESTs) have been assembled into 21,981 tentative consensus sequences (TCs). The  availability of such sequence information provides opportunities to investigate  oligo usage within and between genomes. For the first of three studies reported in  this thesis, a C++ program was written to automatically design oligos that are  conserved between two sets of sequence information. In silico mapping between rice  coding sequences (CDS) and barley TCs indicated that oligos between 18 and 24 bp  provide good specificity and sensitivity (83% and 86%, respectively, for 20mers).  Conserved oligos used as PCR primers had a high (91%) success rate on barley lines.  Sequencing of PCR products revealed conservation in exon sequence, size and order  between barley and rice. Introns were not conserved in sequence but were relatively  stable in size. Map locations of eight new markers in barley revealed both genome  colinearity and rearrangements between barley and rice. The second study reported in  this thesis examined word frequency within the rice genome. A non-random landscape  composed of high-frequency and low-frequency zones was observed. Interestingly,  high-frequency words seemed to be rice specific while single-copy words were gene  specific and conserved across species. As in the first study, oligos of 12 bp or  less were not specific, and 18 bp seemed to be a critical length for the specificity  of oligos.

Our complexity,  and the cause of many genetic diseases such as cancer, is brought about by the  differential expression of that genetic material, in part due to shuffling and  movement of chromosomes within the cell nucleus. A major threat to the integrity of  the genome is the occurrence of a DNA double-strand break (DSB). These DSBs occur  frequently in every cell, and if repaired improperly or left unattended can lead to  genomic rearrangements and cell death. With the publication of the human genome  sequence, we were able to establish two systems to investigate the possibility that  DNA fragments can insert into breaks sites during DSB repair in human  cells. We find that both foreign and human genomic DNA can insert into  extrachromosomal and chromosomal DSBs. Genomic instability syndromes, like those  which result from deficiencies in repair proteins, still permit this DSB insertional  repair process, however the spectrum of source material provided can differ. The  deregulation of replication origins, such as the amplification of sequences flanking  viral integration sites, can lead to the spread and further gene amplification of  DNA by this insertion mechanism. Our demonstration that DSB insertional repair takes place in  human cells provides a mechanism for reshuffling genomic DNA, and acquiring new  sequences. We propose that a selective advantage is conferred upon a cell able to  insert DNA at a DSB, providing a complexity of gene content and interaction which  could explain the origins and evolutionary role of the vast majority of the human  genome.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h2424.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j1459</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rk79s"><dcterms:title>Nonparametric estimation with censored data : a discrete approach</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Liu, Xuecheng, 1963-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation principally addresses nonparametric maximal  likelihood (NPML) estimation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) given  multivariate (arbitrarily) censored data (herein abbreviated MCD). The CDF nonparametric maximal likelihood estimate (NPMLE) given  MCD has support on the union of all maximal intersections of the data. The CDF NPMLE  can be computed numerically using the clique matrix of the intersection graph of the  data; these NPMLEs can be nonunique in both a representational and a mixture sense  (see Peto 1973, Turnbull 1976, Gentleman &amp; Vandal 2001 and Gentleman &amp;  Vandal 2002). The fundamental methodology used in this dissertation consists  in applying graph theory to the intersection graph of censored data and discrete  mathematics to its linear algebraic representation. An optimal algorithm to  determine the maximal intersections of MCD is proposed. A full discussion of  measures of NPMLE mixture nonuniqueness and their computational implementations for  the measures is provided. The iterative convex minorant (ICM) algorithm to obtain  the NPMLE is extended to the case of MCD. The nonparametric likelihood maximization  given MCD is simplified via the use of a reduction tree. The EM/X Algorithm is  introduced to compute the NPMLE for large MCD set. Bounds on self-consistent  estimates of the CDF (a class to which the CDF NPMLE belongs) given MCD are used to  assess the degree of consistency of the CDF NPMLE. Constrained estimation and  likelihood intervals computation given univariate censored data are discussed. The  empirical likelihood method is also applied to construct CDF likelihood sets for  MCD. An unbiased and consistent estimate is proposed for MCD with fixed censoring  times.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj16z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rk79s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avm40xs07v"><dcterms:title>Coast Salish senses of place : dwelling, meaning, power, property and territory in the Coast Salish world</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thom, Brian David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study addresses the question of the nature of indigenous  people's connection to the land, and the implications of this for articulating these  connections in legal arenas where questions of Aboriginal title and land claims are  at issue.

In this theory of the 'senses of  place', the author emphasizes the relationships between meaning and power  experienced and embodied in place, and the social systems of property and territory  that forms indigenous land tenure systems. To explore this theoretical notion of  senses of place, the study develops a detailed ethnography of a Coast Salish  Aboriginal community on southeast Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.  Through this ethnography of dwelling, the ways in which places become richly imbued  with meanings and how they shape social organization and generate social action are  examined. Narratives with Coast Salish community members, set in a broad context of  discussing land claims, provide context for understanding senses of place imbued  with ancestors, myth, spirit, power, language, history, property, territory and  boundaries.

The resulting motoric deficits and histopathology reproduces several key  features of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no  known cure. The objective of the present thesis was to characterize the in vivo  neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA in dopamine pathways, and to examine the mechanisms  underlying dopamine cell death. Infusion of 6-OHDA into different dopamine pathways revealed  that the nigrostriatal projection was more vulnerable than the mesolimbic dopamine  pathway. In addition, a considerable portion of cell bodies was preserved despite  significant losses of dopamine markers in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic nerve  terminal regions. The partial sparing of cell bodies was enhanced by hypothermia  associated with surgical anesthesia. This neuroprotective effect was localized to a  specific subregion within the mesolimbic dopamine cell body area. The preservation  of dopamine cell bodies following 6-OHDA administration may have functional  significance since somatodendritic dopamine release has been demonstrated in this  brain area. The studies in Chapter 3 examined the contribution of two  proteases, calpain and caspase-3, in mediating the degeneration resulting from  6-OHDA administration. Calpain activation occurred early and remained elevated in  nigrostriatal cell body and terminal field subregions, whereas caspase-3 activation  was only transient. Adenoviral delivery of the calpain inhibitor, calpastatin,  completely prevented the elevation in calpain activity following 6-OHDA  administration. Moreover, calpastatin delivery significantly improved motor deficits  associated with nigrostriatal dysfunction. The behavioural protection was not,  however, accompanied by a sparing of nigrostriatal dopamine markers, but was  unexpectedly associated with a preservation of mesolimbic dopamine markers. These  findings suggest that calpain activation contributes to dopamine cell death, but  this effect may be brain region dependent. Collectively, our findings highlight differential vulnerability  amongst midbrain dopamine neurons, of possible relevance to Parkinson's disease. In  addition, our work suggests that calpains may represent a future therapeutic target  for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, present drawbacks associated with  this approach indicate that additional studies are necessary before such  neuroprotective compounds can be employed to treat Parkinson's  disease.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wd21g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x445j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Industrial.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ap5547r83m"><dcterms:title>Reflecting processes as practitioner education in Andersen and White through the lenses of Bakhtin and Vygotsky</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lysack, Michael David</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Adult learning models have emerged that help social work  students to make links between their lived experiences, narratives, and their  developing identity as practitioners. This educational methodology involves students  exploring and co-constructing their own personal and professional narratives through  dialogue, sharing them within a reflecting team format. Reflecting teams emerged out  of the work of family therapist Tom Andersen, and have been further developed for  practitioner education by narrative therapist, Michael White. A detailed description  of the learning model is provided, with an overview of the orienting principles and  some guidelines for application. The educational practice of reflecting processes is examined  through a conceptual framework drawing on the ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975)  and Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934). Bakhtin was a literary theorist, philosopher, and  teacher who was interested in language, literature and human consciousness, and was  fascinated with dialogue in relationship as a site of knowledge construction as well  as a model for understanding the dialogic nature of human consciousness. Vygotsky  was a psychologist, cultural theorist, and activist who conceptualized learning as a  social process that occurs in relationship. He also investigated language as a  psychological/cultural tool, and was curious about human consciousness as  "inner speech." Their writings act as a theoretical foundation for the  dissertation, providing a series of heuristic devices or lenses through which to  view reflecting processes: individual/social, self/other, outer word/inner speech,  language, monologue/dialogue, and authoritarian/internally persuasive  discourse. The dissertation includes an alternative to traditional academic  rhetorical style in the form of conversations between various writers. Drawing on  Bakhtin and Vygotsky, a dialogical genre is developed as an approach to engaging  with the texts of Andersen and White. In developing this methodology, the dialogic  form of inquiry is expressed in a conversation between Bakhtin, Vygotsky and a  student persona. This dialogic genre also occurs as an extended series of  conversations in the format of a reflecting process between Andersen, White,  Bakhtin, Vygotsky, and a student, Mishka. The dissertation concludes with an  overview of Bakhtin's exploration of moving from monologue to dialogue and from  authoritarian to internally persuasive discourse, and how this is accomplished by  means of the "penetrated word" and transformative discourse in the context  of relationship.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz04j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547r83m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dialogue analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Narrative therapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social workers -- Training of</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st02b"><dcterms:title>Caveolin-1 in synaptic signalling and neuronal plasticity : implications for Alzheimer's disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gaudreault, Sophie B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Increasing evidence indicates that cholesterol plays a central  role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Caveolin is a  cholesterol-binding membrane protein involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis  and signalling. The global working hypothesis of the present project was to  investigate on a possible role for caveolin in the pathophysiological events  underlying AD. More specifically, a first study was conducted to evaluate  potential changes in the amount of brain caveolin in autopsy-confirmed AD and  age-matched control subjects. Using rodents, the effect of age and apolipoprotein E  (ApoE) deficiency on caveolin levels was also examined. In a second study, caveolin  levels were investigated in an in vivo mouse paradigm of neuronal response to  damage, the entorhinal cortex lesion. Moreover, the effect of caveolin on  remodelling processes following neuronal lesion was examined in an in vitro model of  reactive neuronal plasticity. Given the important role of caveolin in signalling, a  third study was conducted to assess the potential functional interaction of caveolin  with phospholipase A2 (PLA2), an enzyme implicated in synaptic plasticity and  neurotransmission. The results indicated an up-regulation of caveolin in the brain  of AD patients, aged mice and apoE-deficient mice, that was potentially linked to  alterations of cholesterol distribution in the plasma membrane of brain cells.  Consistent with this idea, caveolin levels were increased during the neuronal  membrane remodelling period following entorhinal cortex lesion in mice. In vitro,  caveolin overexpression in neuron-like cells undergoing post-injury reactive  plasticity caused significant biochemical and morphological alterations. Finally, a  co-localisation and a functional interaction of caveolin with PLA2 was observed in  hippocampal neurons. This interaction dramatically inhibited PLA2 enzymatic activity  and consequently interfered with synaptic AMPA glutamate receptor binding  properties. These findings show that caveolin plays an important role in  reactive neuronal remodelling process associated with age or damage. Its increased  expression in brain cells, possibly ascribed to alterations in membrane cholesterol  homeostasis, could negatively interfere with PLA2 and AMPA glutamate receptor  functions during synaptic plasticity-related events. These findings are consistent  with the hypothesis that part of the pathophysiology underlying AD may be related to  cholesterol homeostasis, and indicate that caveolin may be an important and  previously unrecognised player in this process.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17ct345.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st02b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848r04h"><dcterms:title>Handwriting performance in preterm survivors compared to peers</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Feder, Katya Polena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>There are increasing numbers of preterm children of very low and  extremely low birth weights surviving due to advances in neonatal care. The majority  of these children attend mainstream classrooms and perform in the low average range  on cognitive measures compared to peers. However, outcome studies document a range  of subtle, clinically important impairments in their motor, visual-motor and visual  perceptual performance compared to peers. The impact of these impairments on a  complex, occupational task such as handwriting performance has never been  investigated in the preterm population using an objective measure, except through  parent or teacher questionnaires. The primary objective of this doctoral thesis was to  characterize and compare handwriting performance in preterm children (birth weight  of ≤1250 grams) attending Grade One, to typically developing peers matched by  age, gender and classroom. Standardized outcome measures were used to examine  handwriting performance, sensorimotor component skills and psychosocial factors.  Preterm survivors demonstrated significantly lower handwriting legibility and slower  speed scores compared to matched peers. Visual perception and motor accuracy were  identified as predictors of legibility; and in-hand manipulation (translation) and  finger identification were associated with handwriting speed in preterm children.  However, in typically developing children, legibility was associated with upper  extremity steadiness, visual motor control and in-hand manipulation (rotation); and  speed was associated with in-hand manipulation (translation) and upper limb speed  and dexterity. These findings have important implications for clinical practice in  guiding both evaluation approaches and intervention strategies. Clearly, preterm  survivors are at high risk for developing handwriting difficulties at school-age.  Increasing awareness may help with early identification and intervention with a view  towards minimizing the negative effects on self-esteem and academic achievement  often documented in children with handwriting difficulty.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b6538.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r04h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Human Development.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n1630"><dcterms:title>Philippe Jaccottet et la promenade : une poétique de l'entre-deux</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leblanc, Jérémie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this thesis is at once simple and complex. It  consists of explaining the modes of expression and the prevalent idioms of the  experience of la promenade, the contemplative experience of a leisurely stroll, in  the works and notebooks of Philippe Jaccottet. Far from focusing solely on the  dynamic aspect of walking, the aspect to which the majority of literary critics have  for so long limited themselves, it consists as well of defining the movement of la  promenade as a practice of l'entre-deux (the in-between), through the sensorial  dimensions of the work as well as through is writing practices. The objective of  this thesis is to focus on the passage from the experience of movement to the  experience of writing in the works of Jaccottet, in order to demonstrate that  walking, in the context of la promenade, is not only an extra-diagetic experience,  but that it possesses as well a diagetic status meant to be understood through the  use of a particular form. My analytical framework used here is founded on the hypothesis  that la promenade, at least in the works of Philippe Jaccottet, is in fact an issue  of the "in-between"; a problem which is first and foremost a way of  formulating a vision of the world which comes from a particular poetic sense of  measure, accuracy and balance. For Jaccottet, l'entre-deux denotes a way of  inhabiting the outside world, of seizing the contrasts and contradictions in the  tension between the known and the unknown, the near and the far, inside and outside,  visible and invisible. In this sense, l'entre-deux denotes being at once within  oneself and being in the world without, as if the poet himself wandered between two  extremes, between two opposite poles of thought and knowledge. In line with the procedures of traditional literary criticism,  this thesis thus attempts to define the development of the poetic subject, its  relation to the world, to writing and to language.

Interestingly, it is also expressed in  other regions of the developing central and peripheral nervous systems, and we  postulated that agrin is also a synaptogenic factor at the interneuronal synapse. To  address agrin's role at the interneuronal synapse, we focused on a  well-characterized peripheral interneuronal synapse in the superior cervical ganglia  (SCG) and made use of transgenic mice with targeted deletions of the agrin gene: the  z+ agrin-deficient and the agrin null (AGD-/-) animals. Synapses in the SCG are made  onto a homogenous population of postganglionic neurons, and synaptic transmission is  cholinergic, fast, excitatory and mediated by postsynaptic aggregates of neuronal  AChRs (nAChRs). We found that SCG neurons in culture express a type II  transmembrane and neural-specific isoform of agrin, and that agrin is highly  concentrated at interneuronal sympathetic synapses. We next tested agrin's  synaptogenic role at the interneuronal synapse and found that synaptic transmission  was defective in z+ agrin-deficient and AGD-/- SCG. Indeed, we demonstrated that  excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) in AGD-/- SCG were significantly smaller  than the ones recorded in the wild type SCG. Moreover, we noted that only a fraction  of the AGD-/- postganglionic neurons fired action potentials (AP) upon presynaptic  trunk stimulation. Consistent with the functional defect, we demonstrated that  synapses were reduced in number and poorly differentiated in both agrin-mutant  lines, and addback of recombinant z+ agrin rescued the synaptic phenotype in neural  agrin-deficient and AGD-/- SCG cultures. Finally, depolarization of the AGD-/-  cultured SCG neurons exacerbated the defect in postganglionic localization of the  neuronal AChR. Thus, agrin is an essential regulator of interneuronal synaptogenesis  in the peripheral nervous system, where it promotes the differentiation and  stabilization of neuronal synapses.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rh48m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc33n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hc67q"><dcterms:title>Impact of injury mediators on CNS glia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Neuroscience</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wosik, Karolina</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the  central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the infiltration of immune  cells into the brain, leading to myelin destruction and the demise of  oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelinating cells of the CNS. The mechanisms of tissue  destruction are still being elucidated. We have looked at the effects of two  putative injury mediators on resident CNS glia. Firstly, we investigated the  functional consequences of signaling via death receptors Fas, DR4 and DR5 and their  ligands Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing  factor (TRAIL) in astrocytes isolated from fetal CNS and in OLs from human adult  brain. We find astrocytes express these receptors but are resistant to apoptosis  upon their ligation due to the expression of FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP).  Receptor expression is however not silent as distinct signaling pathways are  activated as a result of receptor ligation. In OLs, we find receptor expression can  be induced upon upregulation of the stress induced protein p53, at which point OLs  become susceptible to FasL and TRAIL killing. In situ in MS lesions displaying  oligodendrogliopathy, we demonstrate that a high proportion of OLs are  immunopositive for p53, suggesting p53 may play a role in OL demise. Secondly, we  investigated the effects of the excitatory amino acid glutamate, acting through  ionotropic glutamate receptors, on human adult OLs. Based on animal models,  excitotoxicity has been proposed to play a role in OL destruction in MS. We find  human OLs are in fact resistant to excitotoxicity mediated by AMPA or kainate  receptors and this is in sharp contrast to their rodent counterparts. We propose  this resistance is due to the lack of expression of glutamate receptors on human OLs  both in vitro and in situ. These results indicate that glutamate is not directly  responsible for the killing of otherwise healthy OLs in MS.

According to the Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons Questionnaire  (ATDP), attitudes toward disability did not differ according to achievement level (p  = .099). However, females were significantly more accepting than males (p = .008).  In classes where the most severe disability was a mental handicap, children held  significantly more positive attitudes toward disability than those who had  classmates with learning, behavioral, or severe developmental disorders (p = .026).  Based on interview data, average- and high-achieving children shared similar  perceptions about their experiences in inclusive classes. Both groups frequently  noted that classmates with disabilities enjoyed similar activities as nondisabled  classmates yet exhibited more frequent inappropriate behavior. Interviewees most  often acknowledged as their first response that making new friends was a benefit for  children with special needs and that dealing with their disability was difficult.  Learning about disabilities was viewed as a benefit for nondisabled children while  feeling comfortable with their classmate with disabilities was seen as challenging.  When questioned about the ramifications of inclusion on their academics,  high-achievers were significantly more likely to report that they learned less (p =  .01). Results are discussed in light of sensitivity theories that would predict  high-achievers to be more accepting of disability because they are attuned to their  classmates with disabilities' needs, and theories suggesting that high-achieving  children whose academic needs are unmet may develop negative attitudes toward  children with disabilities.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736664984.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707958206</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children with disabilities.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children -- Attitudes.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579s726"><dcterms:title>In vivo study of the physiological role of acylation stimulating protein in mice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Xia, Zhunan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>ASP acts as a paracrine and autocrine signal to increase  triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes. ASP administration results in more rapid  postprandial lipid clearance. This present work consists of a series of experiments  on complement C3 knockout mice (therefore ASP deficient mice) in vivo. The aim of  this work is to understand the role of Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) in energy  regulation. Compared to wild type mice, ASP deficient mice have delayed  triglyceride and fatty acid clearance, decreased fat mass and body weight with  concurrent increases in food intake. Both male and female ASP deficient mice have  increased oxygen consumption, an indication of increased energy expenditure. This  effect was not dependent on the presence of leptin. On the other hand, the mechanism  of increased energy expenditure was different in male and female ASP deficient mice.  Female ASP deficient mice have increased movement while the male ASP deficient mice  were found to have increased uncoupling protein-3 expression in muscle. Fat load  tests in the male mice demonstrate ASP deficiency redirects absorbed energy from  storage in adipose tissues towards utilization in liver and muscle. Acute  administration of ASP normalizes this process. The results from these studies suggest that ASP is a key hormone  regulating lipid storage in adipocytes. Deficiency of ASP leads to energy  repartition, decreased energy storage and increased energy expenditure. In short,  ASP deficiency results in obesity resistance.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr45x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579s726</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag445cd63h"><dcterms:title>Comprehension and representation of algebra word problems in a second language</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Berdugo Oviedo, Gloria</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study was designed to examine students'  comprehension and problem representation when reading and solving algebra word  problems in their first language (L1: Spanish) and their second language (L2:  English). The main interest was to investigate the role of the L2 in performing the  task. It was hypothesized that difficulty in understanding and solving word problems  is a function of carrying out the task in the L2 and discourse factors inherent to  the specific type of text. The sample consisted of 31 grade 9 students who attended a  private bilingual school in a Colombian city. Students were asked to think aloud as  they solved four problems that dealt with the topics of ratio and percentage.  Problem presentation was counterbalanced with respect to topic, but the language of  presentation was kept fixed; i.e., the first set of ratio and percentage problems  were in English and the other set in Spanish. Students were allowed to use either  language when solving the problems. There was a short post-task semi-structured  interview. Students' think aloud protocols and answers to problems were  analyzed. The results support the role that language plays in performing  this type of task, although not in the way that it was initially predicted. The  results suggest that the language of instruction plays a more important role than  whether the task is performed in L1 or L2. Thus, the hypothesis that completing the  task would be more difficult in the L2 was not supported. The results suggest that  the difficulty with word problems resides in the mismatch between text  comprehension, the situation presented in the text and the mathematical  representation. The evidence is discussed within the framework of current  explanations for performance in word problems in the L1 as they apply to the  bilingual case, and theories of text comprehension. It is argued that current  explanations for performance in word problems in the L1 apply to the bilingual case,  but with the caution that the interaction between the content of the subject domain,  and the knowledge students have of the language of instruction and their first  language must be taken into account.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Donin, Janet (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b36r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cd63h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Spanish speakers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human information processing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Problem solving.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d12m"><dcterms:title>Channelling in non-experimental pharmacoepidemiologic research : its role in understanding confounding by indication</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bjerre, Lise M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When a new drug is introduced onto the market, patients treated  with it often tend to be sicker than those who are not. Once a drug has been  released onto the market, its safety and efficacy can usually only be assessed using  non-experimental studies. However, these methods cannot account for the differential  assignment of sicker patients to new drugs, which can make a new drug seem  detrimental or even dangerous, if these systematic differences are not accounted  for. This is a prototypical example of confounding by indication, which is often  viewed as an insurmountable problem in pharmacoepidemiologic research. Confounding  by indication consists of two components, namely channelling and the risk factor  effect. In this thesis, the index of apparent channelling (IAC) is  introduced as a novel tool for the measurement of the degree of channelling. The IAC  makes use of propensity scores to quantify the proportion of the variance in  treatment assignment that can be accounted for by documented patient  characteristics. However, the IAC can only account for channelling due to documented  factors. Thus, it is always possible that there be residual channelling due to  undocumented factors. Such residual channelling is of concern mostly to the extent  that it leads to confounding of the treatment effect. Consequently, the index of  residual channelling (IRC) is developed to estimate residual channelling and a novel  approach is proposed to assess the strength of the resulting confounding bias. This  model-based approach is based on estimating the interaction between treatment effect  and the expected strength of residual channeling on treatment assignments of  individual patients, measured by the discrepancy between their predicted treatment  and the treatment they actually received. The combination of the index of apparent channelling and the  model-based approach to residual channelling provides a practical approach to the  problem of assessing the impact of confounding by indication in non-experimental  studies in the post-marketing evaluation of the safety and efficacy of new drugs.  The application of these methods may enhance the validity of the conclusions drawn  in such studies.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Abrahamowicz, Michal (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kq88b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d12m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g563n"><dcterms:title>Finding meaning after a head injury : the experience of patients' mothers and wives during the early phase of recovery</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Van Neste-Kenny, Jocelyne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A head injury is an unexpected and potentially life-threatening  event that frequently results in physical, cognitive, and emotional changes in the  patient. As a result, a head injury affects the whole family, and mothers and wives  may be potentially at risk because they tend to assume the primary caregiving role  post-trauma. Current thinking is that a person's ability to restore a sense of  meaning in life is an important aspect of psychological adjustment following the  traumatic injury of a loved one. However, little is currently known about the  process of finding meaning during the early phase of recovery. The purpose of this  qualitative study was therefore to generate a theory about how mothers and wives  find meaning during the early phase of recovery following the head injury of their  loved one. Grounded theory methodology was used to explore the experience  of 5 mothers and 9 wives whose family member had suffered a moderate or severe head  injury. Participants were recruited from three major Level I Canadian trauma centres  using inclusion criteria and theoretical sampling to achieve theoretical  completeness. They were interviewed on two occasions: 1 to 5 weeks and again 6 to 8  weeks following their family member's head injury. Iterative analysis and constant  comparative methods were used throughout the study and the data revealed a process  of finding meaning embedded in three distinct phases: "Focusing on the here and  now", "Expanding perspective", and "Resuming life". The  process of finding meaning was characterized by an emerging fit between the  participants' perception of their current situation and their pre-trauma value and  belief system. This process helped participants to find a new way of thinking about  their world and to find a new order and sense of direction in their  lives. The findings of this study augment our theoretical understanding  of family members' psychological responses to traumatic events, and may be helpful  to guide nursing care of the whole family during the early phase of recovery  following a head injury.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pepler, Carolyn (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z580x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g563n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2v23vt87j"><dcterms:title>Analysis of human histone deacetylase 6 and its associated protein Ubl90</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bertos, Nicholas R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Among mammalian histone deacetylases (HDACs) identified so far,  HDAC6 is unique in that it possesses tandem deacetylase domains, as well as a  carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motif implicated in ubiquitin binding. HDAC6 has also  been demonstrated to deacetylate tubulin and thus potentially contribute to  regulation of cell motility. Although HDAC6 has been reported to interact with a  variety of nuclear factors, this enzyme is predominantly localized to the  cytoplasm. Here I show that the subcellular localization of human HDAC6 is  governed by additional elements not present in orthologues of this protein from  other species. Human HDAC6 contains a unique insertion of eight or ten repeats of a  Ser/Glu-containing tetradecapeptide sequence, here termed the SE14-repeat domain,  which is responsible for mediating the Leptomycin B-resistant cytoplasmic retention  of human HDAC6. Human HDAC6 also contains a second functional leucine-rich nuclear  export signal when compared to murine HDAC6, and a region near the amino terminus of  human HDAC6 is capable of mediating nuclear import. I have also identified a previously uncharacterized protein  containing a ubiquitin-like domain, here termed Ubl90, as a novel binding partner  for HDAC6. Interestingly, Ubl90 binds to the deacetylase domains of HDAC6, rather  than to the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motif previously implicated in ubiquitin  association. Ubl90 also interacts with several class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2 and  HDAC8), although more weakly than with HDAC6. When Ubl90 is overexpressed, it leads  to the redistribution of HDAC1 from a nuclear to a pancellular localization,  although this does not affect HDAC1-dependent transcriptional repression in a  transient transfection assay. Like HDAC6, Ubl90 is capable of repressing  Runx2-mediated transcriptional activation, and, when overexpressed, it leads to cell  cycle disturbances similar to those seen with HDAC6 overexpression. These results  suggest that Ubl90 and HDAC6 interact functionally, as well as  physically.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dhindsa, Rajinder S.

Yet large numbers of neurons die during the early stages of development and  later in life when neurodegenerative diseases set in or whenever the neurons are  subjected to trauma. The processes that control neuronal survival and death are not  fully understood. However, key regulators of these events include a family of  proteins called the neurotrophins. The neurotrophins are growth factors that control neuronal  development and maintenance in addition to survival. Neurotrophins interact with two  types of cell surface receptors, the Trk family of tyrosine kinases, and the p75  neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Roles for Trk receptors in neurotrophin-dependent  effects are well established but the functions of p75NTR have been less clear. So  far, three main functions have been determined. First, p75NTR positively or  negatively modulates Trk receptor signaling. Second, p75NTR autonomously activates  signaling cascades that, for the large part, regulate cellular apoptosis. Third,  p75NTR cooperates with receptors that respond to myelin-based growth inhibitory  signals. The signaling pathways used by p75NTR to mediate its effects are unclear,  but p75NTR activates the Akt and JNK pathways, modulates RhoA activity, and  interacts with several adaptor proteins. The discovery of the TNFR (Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor)  family of related receptors that are capable of regulating cell death suggested that  p75NTR might activate similar cellular responses. One well-studied effect is the  activation of the transcriptional complex, NF-kappaB. In the first part of this  dissertation, we compared p75NTR and TNF-R1-mediated NF-kappaB activation in a  variety of cell types and found that p75NTR directly activates NF-kappaB only under  conditions of cellular stress. Under normal growth conditions, p75NTR modulates  TNF-dependent NF-kappaB activation to ultimately increase the levels of active  NF-kappaB within the cell. This suggests that a significant physiological function  of p75NTR is to modulate cytokine receptor signaling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barker, Phil A.

She worked in collaboration with H. P. Daniel van Ginkel,  and together their planning proposals determined the direction of the future growth  of Montreal. At a time of rapid clearance and construction in the city core, and  when the Old City was at risk of total demolition, the van Ginkels were committed to  the development of a humane architectural environment. The van Ginkels understood  Modernism as a movement concerned with ethical, social and technical improvements  within society, not merely as a style for building and major  redevelopment. In this thesis, I argue that Lemco van Ginkel developed a unique  Modern urban aesthetic that is reflected in her planning work in Montreal. She  viewed the urban environment as a total fabric in which the disruption of one thread  affected the whole. Any changes made must be done with due respect for the totality  ensuring an end product that is a whole cloth, not a patchwork. The development of  her urban aesthetic can be properly understood only against the following backdrop:  her experience in Europe, working in the Atelier of Le Corbusier, and attending CIAM  in association with Team Ten; and, in the United States while teaching in the 1950s  at the University of Pennsylvania where she initiated an American chapter of CIAM  (Group for Architectural Investigation). Moreover, her design theory must be viewed  in light of her collaboration with her husband, H. P. Daniel van Ginkel (1920), a  member of the Dutch CIAM and a founding member of Team Ten during the 1950s. Lemco  van Ginkel's conception of a Modern urban aesthetic allowed her to assume an  essential role in the fundamental design of Montreal.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Boker, Hans (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk33r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs44g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>City planning -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Van Ginkel, H.
