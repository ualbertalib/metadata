The system is active, semi-automated and includes procedures to suggest to the dispatcher the best truck allocation with the aim of reaching a specified production objective. New heuristic dispatching procedures, namely Adjusted Travel Empty and Load Time, Adjusted Cycle Time, Adjusted Cycle and Waiting Times and Minimize Cycle Time have been developed in order to consider the achievement of objectives throughout the working shift. These procedures are tested and compared with the fundamental heuristic procedures; Locked-in, Maximize Truck Use, Maximize Shovel Use, Match Factor and Priority Number. The heuristic procedures do not attempt to optimize the decision but produce acceptable results most of the time. For the purpose of testing the new heuristic dispatching procedures a computer simulation program was designed. This program resembles as much as possible the real production process. An advance-clock approach was selected to allow insertion of procedures at any point in the haulage cycle. It was found that truck dispatching systems offer the potential for significant improvements in productivity. The new procedures are also able to consider production objectives. However each mine must evaluate each dispatching procedure independently before a definitive decision is made.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nz78w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb137</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, System Science.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Mining.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78td74b"><dcterms:title>The investigation of neurological diseases using NMR spectroscopy : studies on human cerebrospinal fluid, glioblastoma cells and model systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Commodari, Fernando</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>$ sp1$H NMR (1D and 2D) studies on human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are used to characterize normal CSF.

Almost all biblical laws, whether formulated in the imperative or in the third person, appear in singular or plural masculine form, and therefore present a major difficulty in terms of gender interpretation. The position of women in the legal covenant is thus rendered highly ambiguous. The tannaitic sages, Jewish biblical exegetes of the first post-Christian centuries, were acutely aware of the problem and wrote numerous midrashim which interpreted ambiguous terms of gender in the biblical legal corpus. They determined the extent to which the various gender references referred to women. These interpretations have been almost totally neglected in modern biblical and rabbinic scholarship, and are here collated and carefully analyzed for the first time. It is shown that though the sages operated within an ideological framework, their exegetical procedures played a major role in their legislation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rz28f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg48g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in rabbinical literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in the Bible</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Sex differences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women in Judaism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hebrew language -- Sex differences</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az029p6313"><dcterms:title>Nibelungen-Metamorphosen : die Geschichte eines Mythos</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martin, Bernhard R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has frequently been stated over the past 20 years that, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Nibelungenlied served to communicate and justify nationalist ideals in Germany. This criticism focused on the alienation of the epos from its original (medieval) context and on the reinterpretation of some of its key elements in order to suit that nationalist purpose. It accurately underlined that it was necessary to become aware of the historical distance between the Nibelungenlied and its modern interpreters, thereby ensuring an adequate understanding of its meaning. Although this view is justified in light of intellectual history, it does not fully explain the "nationalist" abuse of the epos. The goal of this thesis is to remedy this deficiency by using a theory of myth as a basis for the interpretation of the nationalist modifications introduced in the Nibelungen-epos. The analysis that is made within a myth-oriented framework reveals that the nationalist reception of the Nibelungenlied was not exclusively a reflex of germanophilic enthusiasm, but rather represented a subsequent adjustment of the epos to a new fundamental myth. During its period of reception, the epos underwent several modifications, each being the result of changes in the fundamental myths during the different historical periods. From a contemporary perspective, the historical parameters of this process are established by the medieval epos itself on the one hand, and J. Lodemann's 1986 adaptation of the Nibelungenlied, entitled Siegfried, on the other. Seen within the concept of "work on myth", the nationalist reception can be explained as just another element in a whole series of adjustments brought about in order to guarantee the continuing relevance of the Nibelungenlied.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d147t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p6313</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature, Germanic</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s405t"><dcterms:title>The eye of the guest : Icelandic nationalist discourse and the whaling issue</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anthropology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brydon, Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Icelandic government continues to campaign for regulated commercial whaling in its territorial water, and advocates the maintenance of this practice as part of what it terms the "rational management of the ocean ecosystem," despite international pressure for a termination of whale hunting. Support in Iceland for a pro-whaling policy is extremely high, and the debate about whaling has over the last twelve years become increasingly nationalistic in focus. This dissertation examines the whaling issue in the context of Icelandic nationalism and the rise of the Icelandic nation-state during the 19th century. It argues that the national self is constructed through discourses which articulate space and construct it as the locus for social action. Three spatialdiscourses relevant to the nation-state--as territory, property, and nature--are discussed in terms of their emergence in Europe during the 17th century, and their relation to the "institutional clusters" of capitalism, industrialism, surveillance, and control of the means of violence. Icelandic nationalist discourse celebrates three key symbols: a pure and ancient language, a pure and beautiful land, and the sagas, a body of medieval historical and heroic literature. The idea of independence is pivotal to political action, as well as a moral imperative for guiding individual behaviour and attitudes toward the survival of the nation. For Icelanders, all are forms of knowledge about the world which situate their identity in relation to other nations, and to their own past. The whaling issue and associated events arouse nationalist sentiments because they are seen to threaten the independence of the nation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763861j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s405t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Iceland -- Politics and government</dc:subject><dc:subject>Whaling -- Iceland</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n278t"><dcterms:title>The theory of Istiḥsān (juristic preference) in Islamic law</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yūsuf, Riḍwān Arẹmu</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Istihsan(juristic preference) deviates from and sometimes contradicts well-established general precepts of law. It calls for a considerable amount of personal judgment on the part of the jurist who applies it. In the early period of Islam, istihsan was identified with ra'y (personal opinion) which frequently lacked systematic guide-lines. Abu Hanifah (d. 150/767) does not consider istihsan as a merely arbitrary opinion. He believes that it is a procedure of setting aside an apparently strict ruling of analogy in the interest of fairness and justice. On the other hand, Shafi'i (d. 204/819) adopts a text-oriented approach; he believes that a Muslim jurist is guided, not by intuition, but by textual evidence (dalil). He therefore subscribes to qiyas (inference by analogy) and rejects istihsan. An Hanafi jurist, Sarakhsi (d. 490/1096) later wrote a chapter on the explanation of qiyas, istihsan and takhsis al-'illah (particularization of the cause) as a rebuttal to Shafi'i's criticism of istihsan. Ibn Taymiyah (d. 728/1327), and Hanbali jurist, not only agrees with the istihsan, but believes that it is in reality takhsis al-'illah. To this effect, he wrote a treatise on istihsan and called it Mas'alat al-Istihsan. This thesis studies the concept of istihsan as described by the above mentioned jurists, and some of their works on the subject are translated into English. The purpose of this thesis is to offer an historical study on juristic preference, its relationship with qiyas and takhsis al-'illah. This study attempts to add to our knowledge of istihsan and leads us to further and fuller analysis of why Shafi'i rejected it.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq19m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n278t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Islamic law</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A02870x57n"><dcterms:title>Canadian visual art magazines as cultural formations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Graduate Communications Program</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dubinsky, Lon</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explores the relationships between four exemplary Canadian art magazines and the art world they inform and in which they are situated. The principal claim is that the visual art world has become a textual community by virtue of the premium placed on the printed word and the ties that have developed among individuals, such as artists and curators, and organizations, such as the magazines, funding agencies and the academy. For theoretical direction the multidisciplinary study draws on communication theory, art history, the sociology of organizations and culture as well as management studies. Of principal importance are the media theories of Innis (1972, 1973) and the organizational formulations of DiMaggio (1985). Three types of investigation support the claims: (a) an historical account of the four magazines, which includes tracking the strategies the editors undertook, (b) a consideration of each periodical's rhetorical features and (c) a description of several networks in the art world which involve individuals and organizations. The study then considers the deliberate and unintended consequences of the visual art world becoming a textual community, some of which are liberating while others are disabling. The study concludes by suggesting how the research undertaken contributes to current debates about the analysis of communications and culture.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472z16s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x57n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canadian periodicals</dc:subject><dc:subject>Art and society -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Art -- Periodicals</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av118rg12m"><dcterms:title>Plant activation of different chemicals by tobacco and brassica cell cultures, using the plant cellmicrobe coincubation assay</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Castillo-Ruiz, Priscila</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this study, the ability of various chemicals to be biotransformed into mutagens by plant cells was investigated.

Temporal change in the number, size, and residential density of prehistoric and contact village sites of the Huron-Petun are used to delineate population change. It is revealed that Huron-Petun population grew dramatically during the fourteenth century, attaining a maximum size of approximately 30,000 in the middle of the fifteenth century. This growth appears to have been intrinsic (1.2% per annum) and is best explained by colonization of new lands and increased production and consumption of corn. Population stabilized during the fifteenth century primarily because of an increased burden of density-dependent diseases (tuberculosis) arising from life in large nucleated villages. Huron-Petun population remained at 30,000 until A.D. 1634; there is no archaeological evidence for protohistoric epidemics of European origin. The historic depopulation of the Huron-Petun country, resulting from catastrophic first encounters with European diseases between 1634 and 1640, is substantiated by archaeological data.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m339s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j047z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Huron Indians -- Antiquities</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tionontati Indians -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tionontati Indians -- Antiquities.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Huron Indians -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Indians of North America -- Ontario</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3f462715n"><dcterms:title>The Migori segment of the Archean Nyanza Greenstone Belt, Kenya : Geology, Geochemistry and economic mineral potential</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ichang'i, Daniel Werû</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The 80 x 20 km Migori segment of the Nyanza greenstone belt, Kenya, lies within the Archean Tanzanian Craton (2.8-2.5 Ga).

The standard 'poetical' categories have been overlooked in favour of an axiology of 'truth' and 'falsehood' that overshadows all discourse from the end of the 15th to the beginning of the 17th century. Abandoning the traditional avenues of poetics (appraisal, classification, definition), this thesis studies writing and human invention in their relation to the presence or evocation of a transcendental divinity. Christianity establishes a permanent break with both idolatrous paganism and iconoclastic Judaism so as to impose a new 'iconophile' relation to art: icons and poetical figures will be valued insofar as they constitute an evocation of the divine otherness and transcendence. Christianity encourages, within parameters rigourously established (by Tertullian, Augustine and Alain de Lille, among others) the writing of new texts dedicated to the enlightenment of faithfuls and of new Christians, as well as to the defense of faith against heresy and to the formation of clergymen. This thesis argues that medieval and many Renaissance narratives were written in this Christian perspective. In the beginning of the 16th century, the monarchy increasingly favoured the emancipation of a learned institution that would rival the ecclesiastical university, a learned institution that would also seek to redefine the foundations of Christian faith and, in so doing, provide the king with powerful ideological weapons. The narrative---be it historical or fabulous---was initially linked to the Christian tradition, which makes of all writing an evocation of divinity. But, progressively, the narrative started to take position against the temporal dominion of the Church in favour of a power at once monarchistic and Christian (such is for instance the perspective of Dante Alighieri). The scope of this thesis is thus twofold. On one hand, it argues that the 16th-century narrative cannot be apprehended within the parameters of our modern literary institution. That is, a text is never conceived as an imitation of reality possessing an independent status and constituting an end in itself, as will be established by the analysis of French narratives and paratextual commentaries from the 16th century (including the Illustrations de Gaule et singularites de Troyes by Jean Lemaire de Belges, the narratives of Rabelais, Helisenne de Crenne and Herberay des Essarts, and the epic poems of Ronsard and d'Aubigne). On the other hand, it studies the 'other,' historically predominant, cultural institution. In other words, it studies the absence of a 'literary' outlook as such (and therefore the absence of labelled genres such as 'the Novel', 'the Epic'), and the predominance of Christian thought in the establishment of a new secular (that is non ecclesiastical) cultural institution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g189g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g910</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French fiction -- 16th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1v53jz85j"><dcterms:title>The deep-sea record of rapid late pleistocene paleoclimate change and ice-sheet dynamics in Labrador sea sediments /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rashid, Harunur</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Thirty eight piston cores and numerous seismic profiles collected by two R/V Marion Dufresne and several CSS Hudson cruises were examined and cores from other cruises reinterpreted in the course of this study of Late Pleistocene ice-rafting events (Heinrich events) in the Labrador Sea. In the northwestern Labrador Sea, close to the margin of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet, Heinrich layers are unusually thick. Thicknesses of up to 4.8 m result from deposition from nepheloid-flows and low-density turbidity flows and from iceberg melting. Heinrich layers formed in three stages, explained by a proposed model that also attempts to explain ice-sheet dynamics, ice-stream behavior, and sediment transfer mechanisms from the ice-sheet to the deep sea. Nepheloid-flow deposits seem to result largely from fresh water buoyantly rising out of giant turbidity currents generated at the Hudson Strait outlet. High-resolution stratigraphic records of oxygen isotopes, concentration of total carbonate, coarse-fraction content, and magnetic susceptibility, and 70 new 14C-AMS dates establish the presence of eight Heinrich events, H0 to H6 in the northwest Labrador Sea, including a new event, termed H5a (between H5 and H6). This refined chronology shows that the recurrence intervals between Heinrich events are fairly evenly spaced, with an average of ~7 ka, as postulated by the binge and purge model for their origin. High-resolution oxygen isotope, concentration of total carbonate, and coarse-fraction content data suggest that both meltwater and iceberg supply increased during Heinrich events. This is the first time that increased meltwater supply by direct discharge from a major ice outlet during Heinrich events has been documented, because ice-proximal areas tend to be barren of foraminifera. The presence of H3 between 46° and ~63°N in the Labrador Sea, previously debated, has been proved. Thickness variations for H3 were compiled on an isopach map showing a maximum thickness of 4.8 m near Hudson Strait and thinning to 30 cm in the central Labrador Sea. H0 is present in upper Labrador slope cores, compared to other Heinrich layers which were found widely on the slope, rise, and in the basin. These findings suggest that during or prior to H0, the Hudson Strait ice-stream had retreated landward, so that glaciomarine sediments were delivered to the shelf and iceberg trajectories were following the course of the already established Labrador Current.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hesse, Reinhard (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Piper, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm09v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jz85j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Paleoecology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w642j"><dcterms:title>The role of a retinoic acid response element in setting the anterior border of Hoxd4 expression in the developing hindbrain /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nolte, Christof D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The proper regulation of Hox gene expression during development is crucial for normal patterning to occur along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Misexpression of Hox genes often results in homeotic transformations whereby structures located in anterior regions of the embryo resemble posterior-derived structures. In vertebrate embryos, treatment with retinoic acid (RA) during specific gestation times can anteriorize the borders of Hox gene expression resulting in homeotic transformations. RA exerts transcriptional control through nuclear receptors of the RXR and RAR families by binding DNA as a heterodimer at an RA response element (RARE). Previously, our laboratory characterized an RARE in the neural enhancer of the murine Hoxd4 gene that is strictly required for its activity (Zhang et al., 2000). Cloning and sequencing of the zebrafish Hoxd4 gene reveals that the sequence and spacing of this RARE is highly conserved as well as the sequences that flank it. Other RAREs have been identified in Hox genes that are required for their expression in the developing hindbrain. The sequence and, in some cases, the spacing of these Hox RAREs are different. These differences may affect the affinity of the RXR•RAR heterodimer that bind to them which in turn may determine where their anterior borders of expression are set in the hindbrain. In order to test this hypothesis we alter the spacing and sequence of the RARE in the Hoxd4 neural enhancer. Changes that increase the heterodimer affinity for the RARE do not anteriorize transgene expression, whereas changes that decrease heterodimer affinity posteriorized transgene expression. Thus, the setting of the Hox anterior borders of expression is not a simple function of heterodimer affinity for their cognate elements. Since the sequences that flank the Hoxd4 RARE are highly conserved, they may also play a role in neural expression of Hoxd4 by recruiting factors that cooperatively interact with the RXR•RAR hete</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Featherstone, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx52w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w642j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abn999830r"><dcterms:title>Said Halim Pasha : an Ottoman statesman and an Islamist thinker (1865-1921)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Şeyhun, Ahmet, 1958-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is a study of the political career and thought of Said Halim Pasha (1865--1921), a prominent Islamist thinker and eminent Ottoman statesman, set against the historical and ideological background of his time. The period covered in this study extends from the twilight of the Hamidian era to the end of the Ottoman Empire (1900--1922). During these two crucial decades, the Ottoman Empire, prior to its demise, went through an immense transformation. The establishment of the Constitutional regime in July 1908 allowed several ideological currents to circulate freely on the political scene and to compete in filling the vacuum created by the fall of the ancien regime. Among these ideologies, three rose to prominency: Westernism, Turkism, and Islamism. Said Halim Pasha, one of the best representatives of the Islamist school, made important contributions to the ideological debates which were raging. In his writings that appeared between 1910 and 1921, Said Halim Pasha advocated a thorough and radical Islamization of the Muslim world in order to halt its decline and to ensure its progress. With regard to his political career as Grand Vizir of the Ottoman Empire, Said Halim Pasha proved himself to be a mastermind of diplomacy. Until his political isolation and deprivation of power by the Turkist wing of the CUP Government, he kept at bay the aggressive imperialist Powers and frustrated their plans to partition the Ottoman Empire.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b0412.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999830r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Turkey -- Politics and government -- 1909-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turkey -- Politics and government -- 1878-1909.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mehmet Sait Halim Paşa, 1863-1921.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wk91c"><dcterms:title>Legal mobilization and policy change : the impact of legal mobilization on official minority-language education policy outside Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Riddell, Troy</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The doctoral thesis investigates the impact of legal mobilization and judicial decisions on official minority-language education (OMLE) policy outside Quebec using a model of judicial impact derived from New Institutionalism theory. The New Institutionalism (NI) model of judicial impact synthesizes the dominant approaches to judicial impact found in the US literature, which are reviewed in Chapter Two, and transcends them by placing them within a framework based on the New Institutionalism. The model, as developed in Chapter Three, proposes that certain factors will increase the probability of judicial decisions having a positive influence on policy, such as whether incentives are provided for implementation. The model argues that institutions---as structures and state actors---have important influences on these factors. Furthermore, the NI model recognizes that institutions play a partial and contingent role in the construction of policy preferences and discourse and in mediating the political process more generally over time. Chapter Four demonstrates that the NI model can be applied usefully to reinterpret existing accounts of how legal mobilization and judicial decisions impacted the struggle over school desegregation in the US---a case that provides a heuristic comparison to OMLE policy as it concerns the question of how and where minorities are educated. Chapters Five through Seven describe OMLE policy development in Canada from the latter 1970s until 2000, with case studies of Alberta and, to a lesser extent, Ontario and Saskatchewan. Chapter Eight reveals that legal mobilization by Francophone groups cannot be understood without reference to institutional factors, particularly the Charter of Rights and funding from the federal government. The policy impact of legal mobilization was influenced strongly by the Supreme Court's 1990 Mahe decision and by federal government funding to the provinces for OMLE policy development, while public opinion appeared to be a least a moderately constraining force on policy change. Chapter Eight further reveals that legal mobilization and judicial decisions helped Francophone groups gain access to the policy process and shaped the policy goals and discourse of actors within the process over time. Chapter Nine bolsters confidence in the conclusions generated in Chapter Eight by demonstrating how the explanations provided by the NI model, which emphasize the direct or mediating influence of institutional factors, are superior to explanations generated by a Critical Legal Studies (CLS) approach, a "systems" approach, a "dispute-centered" approach, and by Gerald Rosenberg's model. The thesis concludes by suggesting avenues for future research on judicial impact, particularly research that is focused on comparative institutionalism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Manfredi, Christopher (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s177p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wk91c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social change</dc:subject><dc:subject>Linguistic minorities -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Language policy -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education and state -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social institutions</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544br050"><dcterms:title>Contribution of Kv3 potassium channels to signal processing by electrosensory neurons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rashid, Asim J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Gamma-frequency burst discharge in pyramidal cells of the apteronotid electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) is necessary for signal processing. Bursting is dependent on an interaction between somatic and apical dendritic currents, in which spike broadening in the apical dendrite potentiates a somatic afterpotential that follows each rapid somatic spike. Somatic spike repolarization must be consistent in order for the afterpotential to be expressed soon after. The work presented in this thesis describes how the expression and differential subcellular distribution of two Kv3-type K+ channels in ELL pyramidal cells may contribute to this mechanism of burst discharge. I cloned a family of Kv3 channels from an apteronotid brain cDNA library and demonstrated that two of these channels, homologues of the mammalian subtypes Kv3.1 and Kv3.3, are expressed in ELL pyramidal cells. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the AptKv3.3 K+ channel is distributed throughout the dendrites of pyramidal cells while the AptKv3.1 channel is restricted in its expression to pyramidal cell somata, basilar dendrites and proximal apical dendrites. Heterologous expression of each channel in HEK 293 cells indicated that AptKv3.3 encodes a high-threshold inactivating K + current while AptKv3.1 encodes a high-threshold K+ current which does not display inactivation upon prolonged membrane depolarization. Based on these results as well as pharmacological analysis of native ELL pyramidal cells, I propose that AptKv3.3 mediates spike repolarization in the apical dendrite and inactivation of the channel during repetitive firing allows spike broadening. In contrast, AptKv3.1 likely contributes towards rapid and consistent spike repolarization in the cell soma. Therefore, the expression and differential distribution of these two Kv3 channels in ELL pyramidal cells may underlie the compartmental differences in spike repolarzation that is necessary for burst discharge. The extensive dendritic localization of AptKv3.3 observed in ELL pyramidal cells as well as in other hindbrain neurons has not previously been demonstrated for members of the Kv3 family of K+ channels. The differential localization of AptKv3.1. AptKv3.3 and possibly AptKv3.3 splice variants that I have identified presents an opportunity to examine the molecular mechanisms of Kv3 channel targeting in neurons. Preliminary data is presented which provides the foundation for future studies on channel targeting.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dunn, Robert J.

I argue that Jameson's 1838 Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Hubbard's 1908 A Woman's Way through Unknown Labrador, and Laurence's 1963 The Prophet's Camel Bell provide maps of the political, cultural, and physical features of the areas through which the women travelled, and of their own social and cultural positions. Their mapping is also done through more graphic media---including Hubbard's cartographic work, Hubbard's and Laurence's photographs, and Jameson's unpublished sketches---which reflect and complicate the written negotiations of gender and imperialism in which the three women engage. Because my aim is to reconcile theoretical contradictions, I examine in detail books that clearly dramatize colonialist or anti-imperialist approaches and considerations or exemplifications of issues of gender. Not surprisingly, the three writers draw very different maps of those subjects, as a function of their disparate geographical and historical contexts. This study reveals, however, that the maps themselves are drawn with similar tools, which include an anti-racist philosophy and an acute awareness of women's position in their own and the visited societies. Thus Jameson makes philosophical connections between mid-nineteenth-century feminist and anti-racist theoretical approaches; Hubbard provides insights into an early twentieth-century woman traveller's relationship to First Nations men who have both more and less power than she; and Laurence serves as a witness to and astute reporter on oppression of mid-twentieth century women by specific colonial and patriarchal forces.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cooke, Nathalie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp58f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935464z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Hubbard, Mina -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Travelers' writings, Canadian.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women travelers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Laurence, Margaret -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jameson, Mrs. (Anna), 1794-1860 -- Criticism and interpretation</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atx31qk36n"><dcterms:title>Re-evaluating vaginismus : an empirical investigation of diagnostic reliability, vaginal spasm, pain, and associated etiological correlates</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Reissing, Elke D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Vaginismus is a sexual dysfunction that has received insufficient empirical attention. The first chapter of this thesis consists of a critical review of the literature and demonstrates the overall paucity of research studies and their poor methodological quality. The second and third chapter are based on the results of an experimental study comparing 87 women, matched on age, relationship status, and parity and assigned to 3 groups, vaginismus, dyspareunia/vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS), and no pain. A structured interview evaluating pain with intercourse and history of gynecological problems as well as psychometric measures; evaluating sexual and physical abuse, sexual knowledge and schema, sexual functioning, relationship adjustment and psychological distress were administered. The reliability of vaginal muscle spasm as the main diagnostic criterion, differential diagnosis, and the role of pain were assessed via by 2 separate gynecological and, 2 separate physical therapist examination, 2 EMG evaluations, and a review of the interview data by 2 separate psychologists. Findings suggest that the spasm-based definition and resulting diagnostic reliability of vaginismus are not adequate. Both, women in the vaginismus and VVS groups exhibited higher levels of pelvic floor hypertonicity compared to women with no pain; however, women in the vaginismus group demonstrated the highest levels. Measures of pain did not distinguish between women with vaginismus and VVS. The only dependent measure clearly differentiating women with vaginismus was defensive and avoidant reactions during the physical exams. A re-conceptualization based on a multidimensional diagnostic framework including pelvic floor hypertonicity, avoidance and defensive reactions to vaginal penetration, and genital pain was suggested.

The method relies on a compact, robust, and easily synthesized integrated test core capable of emulating the function of external automatic test equipment. The core consists of a 2 x N memory whose contents are periodically circulated, a coarse analog filter, and a voltage comparator. One half of the circular memory is used to generate analog signals without the need for multi-bit digital-to-analog converters. The second half is used to generate extremely accurate DC levels, the latter being programmed using a clever software encoding technique that relies on some form of sigma-delta modulation. The DC levels, in combination with the comparator, enable multi-bit digitization using a progressive multiple conversion pass procedure. In order to accommodate broadband circuit phenomena, a delayed-clock sub-sampling mechanism is also employed, in which the digitizer sample clock is consistently delayed over multiple runs of the periodic test signal. One method of delaying the clock is to use a voltage-controlled delay line tuned by a delay-locked loop. The timing resolution of this approach is determined by the value of the consistent clock delay and not its period. A divide-and-conquer approach to the test of deeply embedded analog integrated circuits using the proposed test core is described. Multiple test configurations are presented that can span a wide range of phenomena to be tested both internally to the integrated circuit and externally through I/O interfaces. The applicability of these configurations to increasing test parallelism both at the core and die levels is investigated. Performance limits of the proposed test core are also derived by drawing a comparison to conventional circuits used for data-conversion applications. The same fundamental limitations on integrated circuit performance are shown to affect the test core electronics, although test-specific requirements, such as forcing periodicity and the reliance on software signal processing, help further enhance on-chip measurement accuracy and repeatability. Finally, several successful experimental prototypes that demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach are presented. The prototypes range from concept proving test core integrated circuits to ones containing multiple simultaneously operated test cores and completely embedded circuits under test. In total, several hundred different test cores have been demonstrated, which is further testimony to the practicality of the proposed techniques.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roberts, Gordon W.

CPs are defined as products formed by combining knowledge from two distinct domains, for example, digital cameras, which combine knowledge from digital products and cameras. The three research questions addressed in the dissertation are: (1) how is knowledge combined from two distinct domains of a CP, (2) how are CPs categorized vis-a-vis their two components, and (3) what brands, among those associated with one of the two domains, are preferred in CPs? The thesis here is that CPs can be construed as conceptual combinations---that is, a combination of two concepts, wherein one concept (the "modifier") modifies the knowledge associated with the other (the "header"). Employing the literature in psycholinguistics, two combinatorial processes---namely, property mapping and relation linking---were identified for combining knowledge in CPs. These processes lead to modifications in knowledge associated with the header of a CP (e.g., knowledge about cameras is modified in digital cameras). The extent of these modifications is measured by the proposed construct of modification centrality. As per this construct, modifications in features critical to the function of a header (i.e., central modifications) are perceived as more significant than those in non-critical features (i.e., non-central modifications). Three experimental studies investigated the above research questions. These studies used 16 novel CPs that were created by combining two dissimilar concepts. Study 1 showed that subjects readily combined knowledge from two dissimilar domains, using property mapping or relation linking. In addition, the representation of these CPs varied along their modification centrality, even though the dissimilarity between the two combining domains was held constant. Study 2 showed that the categorization of CPs was contingent upon their similarity to the modifier and header categories. Study 3 showed that both modification centrality and the combinatorial process influenced the categorization and brand preferences in CPs. While CPs with non-central modifications (e.g., disposable cameras) were categorized as headers (i.e., cameras), and header-associated brands were preferred, those with central modifications (e.g., digital cameras) were categorized as both (i.e., digital product and camera), and the modifier brands (i.e., digital brands) gained equity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Dube, Laurette (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k73b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv36c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Brand name products.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Advertising -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consumers -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>New products.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac821gm525"><dcterms:title>Agency and communion as fundamental dimensions of social adaptation and emotional adjustment</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fournier, Marc Alan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has been argued that agency and communion define the fundamental dimensions of human existence. Agency represents strivings for expansion and elevation that surface as efforts to pursue social dominance. Communion represents strivings for contact and congregation that surface as efforts to preserve social bonds. From an evolutionary perspective, agency and communion define the problems of group living to which our ancestors were historically required to adapt. From a dyadic-interactional perspective, agency and communion organize the domain of behavior that individuals in contemporary societies are presently able to demonstrate. The purpose of this research was to explore the agentic and communal dimensions underlying social adaptation and emotional adjustment; this objective was pursued through the use of event-contingent recording procedures that require respondents to report upon their behavior in significant social interactions over extended time intervals. I first propose that emotional adjustment is optimized through mitigation processes that balance the expression of agency and communion in everyday behavior. Findings indicated that a balance within agency and within communion---achieved through moderate levels of agentic and communal expression---predicted optimal emotional adjustment. I then propose that the dark aspects of agency and communion---the human propensities to quarrel and submit---are equally relevant to social adaptation. In this regard, I argue that these propensities represent social rank strategies through which individuals grapple with and defend themselves against feelings of threat and inferiority. Consistent with an evolutionary perspective upon social competition, individuals tended to quarrel when threatened by subordinates and to submit when threatened by superiors. Consistent with an evolutionary perspective upon defeat and depression, individuals who typically felt more inferior tended to quarrel more frequently with subordina</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moskowitz, D.

Where some have claimed that Berlin cannot justify his commitment to liberalism given his ideas about moral pluralism---that his views are subjective---I argue that he can justify his commitment to liberalism, and avoid the problems of relativism. The departing point of my study is that unlike many, I do not think it is necessary to explicate Berlin's opinions about history, nationalism, or similar ideas---that what he says about pluralism is logically distinct from his other views. My argument has two basic parts. In the first I argue that Berlin's conception of pluralism is best understood as a response to monism, and not necessarily as a position which stands alone. As I argue, Berlin's commitment to liberalism depends less upon direct links between liberalism and pluralism, than a critique of monism which shows how vis-a-vis the corruption of positive liberty, monism leads to authoritarianism. The second part of my argument revolves around the idea that pluralism and relativism are distinct ideas, as seen in their treatment of the idea of incommensurability. Pluralism, I argue, unlike relativism, allows for comparative judgments to be made between values and cultures, because of certain assumptions it holds regarding human nature. Thus the charge that Berlin is a relativist is incorrect, in so far as it fails to consider the theoretical differences between pluralism and relativism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patten, Alan (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w6443.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b012</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Berlin, Isaiah, Sir</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pluralism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m828g"><dcterms:title>A community and its forests : evaluating public participation in resource management decisions, Slocan Valley, British Columbia</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bardati, Darren Robert</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research addresses the question of effective public participation in resource management decisions within the context of resource-based communities. Despite advances in mechanisms for enabling public input, over the past 30 years, public participation remains problematic. Rather than promoting genuine communication and strengthening relationships between government, resource industries and communities, public participation often becomes an exercise in frustration that increases the adversarial nature of public policy decision-making. Evaluations of public participation have been undertaken across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines, with much emphasis placed on criteria relating to the process and outcome dimensions. The majority of approaches intend to provide universally applicable structures for public participation regardless of the socio-economic, cultural, institutional, or political context within which the process takes place. The purpose of this research was to determine whether consideration of contextual factors can enhance the effectiveness of public participation evaluation. Drawing on the experience of the Commission on Resources and Environment (CORE) process in the Slocan Valley, British Columbia, an in-depth analysis of the pre-process (antecedents), process, and post-process (outcomes) phases of the CORE consultations was performed. The qualitative research involved analysis of case-related documents relating to resource use history, community actors, record of public participation, as well as the application of a multi-criteria evaluation framework to the CORE process. The research revealed the iterative connections between antecedents, process and outcomes. A number of contextual factors placed significant constraints on the effectiveness of the public participation exercise. Intra-community factors included the polarization of interests and a legacy of distrust. These antecedent problems were exacerbated after-the process.

Typically, mtDNA is present as only one genotype in a cell, a state known as homoplasmy. In rare circumstances, two or more mtDNA sequence variants can be present in a cell, a state known as heteroplasmy, and these sequence variants can segregate during mitosis and meiosis. In this thesis, I have investigated the basis for a novel tissue-specific segregation of mtDNA in a heteroplasmic mouse model that had been previously constructed from two inbred strains (NZB/BinJ and BALB/c mtDNA). In these mice, four tissues showed directional selection for an mtDNA genotype: in the liver and kidney for the NZB mtDNA genotype; and in the spleen and blood for the BALB mtDNA genotype. I investigated the mechanism responsible for selection of NZB mtDNA, focusing on the liver which showed the strongest effect. In this tissue, selection for the NZB mtDNA genotype is constant with time, independent of allele frequency and does not appear to be mediated through an advantage of respiratory chain function or replication rate of mtDNA. To identify the genetic basis for this mtDNA selection, I set up an intersubspecific intercross and used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to map three QTL in F2 mice that are strong gene effects in the liver, kidney, and spleen. These QTLs, Smdq-1 (liver), Smdq-2 (kidney), and Smdq-3 (kidney &amp; spleen) (s&amp;barbelow;egregation of m&amp;barbelow;itochondrial D&amp;barbelow;NA Q&amp;barbelow;TL-#) map to chromosome 5, 2, and 6 respectively. Smdq-1 was a dominant QTL in the liver that mapped to a 2 LOD support interval of approximately 1 cM and accounted for 34% of the variation in the trait. To reduce the interval size of Smdq-1 and confirm the map position, BALB chromosome 5 interval-specific congenic mice lines are being generated across a 20 cM interval.
