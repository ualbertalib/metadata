It was desired to establish whether potassium diazomethionate was completely analogous in behavior to other aliphatic diazo compounds such as diazomethane and diazoacetic ester as has been suggested in the literature. If this were the case, a ready method of synthesis would be available for a large number of interesting disulphonated aliphatic compounds which had not previously been prepared. A secondary object was to determine whether potassium diazomethionate could be used as an intermediate in a simple and practicable synthesis for monosubstituted hydrazines. Great interest has recently developed in the search for a practicable industrial process for the manufacture of hydrazine, since this substance is in great demand as a propellant and synthetic fuel for defence purposes. It was already known from the work of von Pechmann and Manck (89) that hydrazine sulphate could be prepared from potassium diazomethionate in two synthetic steps and it was requested by the Defence Research Board that a study be undertaken to determine whether such a process would be economically feasible. Hence, the object of the research was modified along these lines.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ross, J.

This effect may be considerable even for the most phlegmatic individuals. Moreover, almost everyone objects to unnecessary noises. In recent years there has arisen a very insistent demand for quieter electrical apparatus. This applies particularly to household apparatus such as refrigerator motors, vacuum sweepers and the like. Practically noiseless motors are also required for various drives ( refrigerating plants, circulation pumps of hot water systems, big ventilating systems for rooms, organ bellows etc. ) in non industrial plants such as storerooms, business houses, hotels, hospitals, churches, theatres etc&gt; where all noise should be suppressed. It must also be noted that the stage has been reached where it is taken for granted that the products of the better known manufacturers will give entirely satisfactory performance, and often, the deciding factor between various makes is only the quietness with which the equipment operates. However,noise and vibration are not merely annoyances which may affect the sale of a product or lower the efficiency of a worker. They are often evidences of defects in design and manufacture which seriously affect the life of the equipment and, in many cases, the safety of the user.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schippel, W.

Its measurement was to examine the validity of the theory. The limits of this validity were similar to those imposed on the theory by other gaseous properities, which lead to the concept of the "ideal gas". As to the conductivity, the behaviour of the majority of naturally occuring gases approximated closely that of the "ideal gas" under normal conditions, i.e. at moderate or room temperatures and a pressure range up to atmospheric pressure. Serious deviations from experimental data occured, however, when it was attempted to apply the theory to gases at higher temperatures and pressures.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

According to these theories, the rate of diffusion is governed in large measure by the shape of the polymer chain which, however, need not be the same in different solvents. Evidence for a change of shape in different solvents is obtained indirectly from experiments on viscosity, osmotic pressure, sedimentation velocity, and streaming birefringence, while direct evidence is provided by measurements of light scattering. Experimental studies on the diffusion of high polymers should therefore be of interest from two points of view, (i) to provide data by which to examine the validity of existing theories, and (ii) to obtain additional information about the extent to which a polymer may alter its configuration in different solvents.

However no large scale production of polymers of butadienes was attempted until World War I, when the Germans manufactured over 2300 tons of polydimethylbutadiene. Until then the natural sources of rubber yielded adequate supplies for world needs. Some research was continued in the field of synthetic rubber andby 1939 the Germans, and later the Western Allies, were able to produce large quantities of synthetic elastomers (the name given to high polymers that possess rubber-like properties). A copolymer of butadiene and styrene, called Buna-S or GR-S, wasconsidered to be the best general purpose synthetic elastomer and this copolymer is produced on a large scale on this continent. Much research has been done on this material but the pure polymers, such as polybutadiene and polyisoprene, have not been investigated as thoroughly since they have failed to show promising properties. As copolymers have the extra variable of compositional heterogeneity, it is thought that the study of pure polymers may lead to an easier and better understanding of the problems involved in obtaining elastomers of the desired properties.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.

The following theory of metallic conductivity was first developed by Riecke, Drude, Lorentz and others: Consider a metal containing N electrons per unit volume and suppose that each electron can move freely for a mean time 2 tau, after which it suffers a collision and its momentum is destroyed. (tau is "time of relaxation”).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Opechowski, W.

Several new problems are introduced when the structure and mechanism of rain showers are studied using radar as a research tool. These problems necessitate the modification of existing theory on rain showers. Radar echoes from showers, associated with a cold front, produce a bright line on the radar screen at a height which corresponds to the freezing level of the shower.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.

From the increase in mass of these drops it was concluded that (1) every collision with a cloud droplet led to coalescence, and (2) Langmuir's (1948) theory of collision was valid. To adapt this theory to the non-terminal velocities encountered in the experiment, equations describing the free fall of drops through air were formulated and solved. The present thesis also describes in detail methods of determining the density and droplet size distribution of the clouds. A related problem involving both accretion and heat transfer is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.

Bathing the plates in a very weak solution of chromic acid before development materially reduced the background of alpha tracks from the spontaneous disintegration of uranium and of fog due to the proton beam. A concentration of 0.13 mgms. of CrO3 per ml. of water inhibited development of the proton and alpha tracks, but left the fission tracks quite dense. Fission tracks in these plates appeared similar to those in equivalent plates exposed to thermal neutrons from the Chalk River pile. Detailed examination of a sample section of one of the former plates showed a density of 50 fissions per cm2, whose median total range was 23 microns, agreeing with published results for slow neutron fission. A rough estimate of the fission cross-section of uranium to protons of 2.0 x 10^-24 cm was obtained, appearing to be too great by a factor of about four. The main cause of this error was believed to be due to inaccuracy in measuring the density of the proton beam.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

The main problems of this thesis are the extent to which young people leave their home community, the occupations they enter, and the influences which affect these decisions. Choice of occupation represents one of the two main decisions made by a person in his lifetime. This decision does much to determine the individual's life; the type of work he does and the remuneration he receives influences his home, his clothes, his leisure time, and in many cases, even the length of his life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hall, O.
