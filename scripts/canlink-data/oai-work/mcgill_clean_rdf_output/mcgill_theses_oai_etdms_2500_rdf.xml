The Fabian Society has often claimed it greatly influenced the struggle to establish a working-class political party prior to the inauguration of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) in 1900. Yet, many of the Fabians' contemporaries disagreed. This thesis challenges any assertion that the Fabian Society greatly influenced the LRC. Through a study of the Fabian Society's early history, beliefs and attitudes it is clear that the Fabians were more likely to be very negative towards any rank and file movements. The Fabians had little faith in the "average sensual man". Even their Manifesto "To Your Tents Oh Israel" cannot, in the final analysis, be viewed as concrete proof that the Fabian Society placed great hope in the working man and in his struggle for labour representation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lewis, Brian (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g721j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m8985</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Labor movement -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fabian Society (Great Britain) -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avq27zq735"><dcterms:title>Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde, and audiences of aestheticism</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>MacLeod, Kirsten.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>By examining the process of production and reception of the works of Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde, this thesis explores the ways in which both conceptions of audience and actual audiences shaped these works.

Confronted, however, with actual readers who did not always meet the "aesthetic" criteria (even if they were supporters), they were forced to rethink their conceptions of audience. Pater's and Wilde's developing understandings of audience can be traced in their works, as they experiment with style and genre in an attempt to communicate effectively with their readers. Although at base Pater and Wilde advocated a similar "aesthetic" philosophy, their distinct conceptions of audience played a significant role in determining the nature of their particular versions of aestheticism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Trehearne, Brian (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s701r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq735</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pater, Walter, 1839-1894 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aestheticism (Literature)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arn3013536"><dcterms:title>Fortress Europe or spillover? : immigration politics and policy at the European level</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Luedtke, Adam.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although the evolution of a unified Europe has been unsteady, the immigration policies of member states have nonetheless become increasingly harmonized in recent years. This harmonization has not been without its controversies, however, and is characterized by two inter-linked political disputes that have shaped the progress achieved thus far. The first dispute area is the exclusion of Europe's legally-resident third country nationals (TCNs) from the privileges of intra-EU free movement, contrary to the inclusionist arguments of the European Commission and Parliament. The second dispute area is the political struggle between advocates of intergovernmental decision-making structures, which are not subject to EU law or institutional control, and the advocates of full (supranational) EU competence over policy. Two hypotheses are contrasted to examine these disputes: (1) the "Fortress Europe" hypothesis, which foresees the continuation of exclusionism and intergovernmentalism; and (2) the "spillover" hypothesis, which predicts the inclusion of TCNs through the EU's central institutions eventually winning full competence over policy. It is concluded that although exclusionism continues to hold the upper hand, recent victories for supranationalism have confirmed the optimism of the spillover hypothesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Black, Jerome (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g50v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3013536</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Aliens -- European Union countries.</dc:subject><dc:subject>European Union countries -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sm60t"><dcterms:title>Ondaatje and canons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of English</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lipert, Peter.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most inquiries into the nature of literary value have focused on how the academy shapes literary taste and determines the reputation of individual authors. This thesis examines how ideas of literary canon can impact a writer at the creative level. Michael Ondaatje's interest in the cultural significance of authorship makes him ideal for this topic of study. The first essay discusses how Ondaatje's repeated quotation of his own texts can be viewed as a metafictional commentary on the anxieties of literary innovation. It shows how the idea of literary influence and the author's relationship to the canon can be embodied as a formal and thematic characteristic of the literary text. The second essay shows how Ondaatje responds to traditional conceptions of the English-Canadian canon as an editor of a national anthology of short fiction. Early national anthologists beginning with E. H. Dewart in his Selections from Canadian Poets (1864) consolidated a set of evaluative criteria that reflected aspects of nineteenth-century English-Canadian nationalism. This essay examines two national anthologies that represent an alternative to this tradition. John Simpson's The Canadian Forget Me Not for MDCCCXXXVII (1837) is a representation of popular nineteenth-century bourgeois literary taste that predates this legitimating rhetoric. Michael Ondaatje's From Ink Lake (1990) renders an ironic commentary on this hundred-year-old legacy of canon formation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lecker, Robert (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77ss072.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm60t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ondaatje, Michael, 1943- -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canon (Literature)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adz010s30z"><dcterms:title>The denial of neonatal pain : a Wittgensteinian investigation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Philosophy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leclerc, Anne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This essay presents a Wittgensteinian analysis of the rationales, beliefs, and contributing factors that supported the denial of neonatal pain until the late 80's. It provides an historical review of the denial of neonatal pain and describes the main events leading to its recognition. It explores the link between enduring erroneous conceptions and scientific assumptions about the nature of pain, and the denial of neonatal pain. Wittgenstein's work on the origin of pain-language in the natural tendency of human beings to exhibit pain-behaviour and to react to the pain manifestation of others by engaging in meaningful activities provides the background for this investigation of neonatal pain. The lack of training in pain assessment techniques and the unique pain manifestation of sick and premature infants is considered. The impact of Neonatology's driving concepts and the overreaching scientifical approach of medicine is also discussed. Finally, it is recognized that individual, scientific, and sociopolitical forces have influenced neonatal pain research and clinical practice. The essay concludes with a reflection on the consequence of privileging the biological function over the experiential dimension of life for sick infants presently in the N.I.C.U but also for the quality of their long-lasting memories.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Elliott, Carl (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f349c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010s30z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pain in newborn infants.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neonatal intensive care -- Moral and ethical aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afj236423b"><dcterms:title>The law of servants and the servants of the law : judicial regulation of labour relations in Montreal, 1830-1845</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pilarczyk, Ian C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Labour relations in Montreal during the years 1830 to 1845 were characterized by flux. The encroachment of expanding industrialization brought with it new social phenomena and pressures, new technology, and a fundamental restructuring of employment relationships. Master-servant relations still contained elements of the deeply stratified and paternalistic labour relationships ingrained in the cultural and social fabric of earlier eras, but increasingly began to exhibit the rudiments of purely contractual relationships which would come to define the modern industrial era. Courts came to play an increasingly important role in resolving labour disputes between parties. While historically the law favored the strict contractual and socio-economic interests of masters, courts began to enforce the reciprocal duties owed by masters to their servants. Servants were accorded greater access to the courts to protect their interests, with the knowledge that they had recourse to extra-judicial means of protest if the law was not sufficiently responsive.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Van Praach, Shauna (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn70f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236423b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Master and servant -- Québec (Province) -- History.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak930c0461"><dcterms:title>Psychological dimensions of access to justice : an empirical study and typology of disputing styles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Paquin, Julie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Many factors have been hypothesized to account for the fact that certain disputes become legal claims while others fail to escalate.

This thesis is based on an empirical study exploring the existence of such disputing styles in the context of landlord-tenant relationships. Accounts of reallife disputes were gathered through interviews with tenants having recently faced problems with their landlords; four personality tests were also administered to the participants. In this thesis, qualitative descriptions of 37 individual cases are used in order to build a typology of disputing styles.

However, there is not always a crystal clarity behind the terminological distinctions and legal issues. The resolution of various legal issues in separatist conflicts is often a complex matter. For instance, it is not possible to respond fully to separatism without understanding the implications of various underlying institutions and what appear frequently to be conflicting rights. (What is self-determination and how does it relate to separatism? What is the difference between an indigenous people and a minority? What is the difference between secession and partition?) This paper seeks to understand these institutions and rights as a means to providing a response to the particular issues raised in the context of separatism in Northern Ireland. As Northern Ireland also represents a territory born out of what is termed 'partition' it is hoped that this paper will reveal any significance between this form of separation and other forms such as, for example, 'secession'.

Chapters III and IV describe the Crown/Indian relationship and suggest how officials might estimate Crown obligations. The thesis concludes that the doctrine is legislative and that its function is to extend juridical protection to otherwise inadequately regulated relationships of social or economic importance. Rules developed to govern the trustee/beneficiary relationship are adapted and applied to useful relationships to prevent victimization through the use of inherent opportunities for exploitation. Acceptance by Indians of representative decision-making is critical to stable reconciliation of Indian and non-Indian interests.

These reorganisations are a consequence of extracellular and intracellular signals that converge in the nucleus to alter gene expression and thus give rise to cells with entirely novel properties. The mechanisms governing the regulation of gene expression in a given cell type during embryonic development are still ill-defined. In order to understand more how the cardiac genetic programme is governed, we undertook to clone the rat cDNA of theGATA-6 transcription factor. The GATA family of transcription factors encodes zinc-finger DNA binding proteins that recognise the consensus WGATAR sequence that constitutesa regulatory region for numerous genes. In the haematopoiesis system, GATA-1, -2 and -3 have an expression restricted to subsets of heamotopoietic cells and they all have unique, essential non-redundant roles in the differentiation and survival of these lineages. Interestingly, our laboratory and others have characterised a fourth member of the vertebrate GATA family, GATA-4, whose expression is highly enriched in the developing myocardium. Furthermore, GATA-4 expression is essential for cardiogenesis as tested in an in vitro system of cardiac differentiation or by gene-targeted mutation in the mouse. Here we describe the cloning of the rat GATA-6 cDNA and describe that GATA-6 is also highly enriched in the myocardium both at the RNA and the protein levels implying that a cardiac GATA subfamily may, during cardiogenesis, play analogous roles to the haematopoietic GATA subfamily. The characterisation of the GATA-6 protein revealed that it binds to consensus GATA sites with high affinity and that the GATA-6 gene encodes for a transcriptional activator with properties very similar to those of GATA-4.

Chronic and acute desipramine exacerbated these deficits, whereas chronic and acute fluoxetine ameliorated the performance. Drug resistant impairments in the water maze could be attributable to hippocampal aberrations resulting from glucocorticoid neurotoxicity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rochford, Joseph (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gj596.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn9998796</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Behavioral.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5q47rq91k"><dcterms:title>High-pressure vibrational spectroscopic studies : (i) group 14 tetraphenyl compounds: (ii) hydrogen-bonded species</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Warner, Stephanie D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of high external pressures on the vibrational spectra of two different types of compounds have been investigated. The high pressures were achieved with the aid of a diamond-anvil cell. The tetraphenyl group 14 compounds, Ph4M CM = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb), were examined between ambient pressure and 40 kbar (~40,000 atm). The four compounds displayed similar behaviour as the pressure was increased and a structural transition at ~15 kbar most probably associated with rotation of the phenyl ring was identified in each case. The pressure dependences of selected vibrational modes were obtained. The second series examined consisted of two 1:1 molar base:acid hydrogen-bonded compounds; 4-nitropyridine N-oxide-4-nitrobenzoic acid (C5H 4N2O3·C7H5NO 4) and 4-nitropyridine N-oxide-4-nitrophenol (C5H4N 2O3·C6H5NO3). Attempts were made to assign vibrations directly influenced by the formation of the hydrogen bond. Wavenumber versus pressure plots were used to determine dnu/dP values. A structural transition was observed at ~12 kbar and is most probably due to a ring rotation about the hydrogen bond. The crystal structure of 4-nitropyridine N-oxide·4-nitrobenzoic acid was also obtained (P21/n, Z = 4).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Butler, Ian S.

As many other secreted enzymes, it is synthesized as a precursor, prorenin, that is cleaved by a processing enzyme during its migration through the cell sorting and secretion pathways. The prosegment plays an important role in the folding, the secretion and the inhibition if renin. A prediction of the three-dimensional structure of this zymogen has been derived from those of other aspartyl proteinases but recent findings have raised some doubts about the validity of this model. The best solution would be to crystallize the human prorenin but problems have been found with bacterial, yeast and mammalian expression systems. This study reports the expression of human prorenin in baculovirus infected arthropod cells and the optimization of this system. Up to 8 mg/L of recombinant human prorenin is produced by High-FiveTM cells. Comparison with prorenin produced by GH4 cells demonstrates that they have similar enzymatic activities and that they are recognized by the same antibody. However, the glycosylation of the recombinant prorenin produced in insect cells is different as it migrates at a lower molecular weight on a SDS-PAGE and it is not retained by an anion exchange column. By taking advantage of these different properties of the recombinant enzyme, a method for a large scale purification of prorenin has been designed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reudelhuber, Timothy L.

In evaluating the pricing efficiency of the markets, this research used two approaches: an analysis of market and an analysis using econometric models, focusing on price information structure accuracy and rapidity. The weekly data series of corn and soybean meal price are from selected cities in Canada and the US cover the crop years of 1990--1996. The accuracy is addressed by applying Faminow's model for testing the pricing systems and Houck's model for testing price transmission symmetry. The results showed that the Quebec corn market is accurate based on the evidence of (i) a relatively unconcentrated market structure; (ii) evidence of an FOB pricing system; and (iii) symmetric price adjustments. Even though the soybean meal market is also based on an FOB pricing system, it is not accurate because the price adjustments are asymmetric and its market structure is highly concentrated. The rapidity is addressed by applying Vector Error Correction (VEC) models in three ways: (i) by investigating the cointegration relationships, (ii) by assessing the strength of the relationships, and (iii) by measuring dynamic price response. The results showed that the strength of the relationships and the speed of Quebec corn price adjustment in response to external shocks are less than those found in Ontario and Southeastern US markets, while soybean meal is comparable to those markets. Thus, by means of an assessment of market structure, marketing margin, price information transmission accuracy and rapidity, this research concludes that the corn market in Quebec is relatively pricing efficient while the soybean meal market is not.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Goldsmith, Peter (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Coffin, H.

Our limited understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemia reperfusion injury has been a major impediment in developing interventions to prevent or minimize this injury in order to reduce patient morbidity associated with major reconstructive procedures. There has been profound interest in the role played by the gaseous free radical nitric oxide in ischemia reperfusion injury in cerebral, myocardial and intestinal tissue. The role of this molecule has not been clearly identified in ischemia reperfusion injured surgical flaps. It has been shown that skin exhibits less of a response to salvage strategies than does skeletal muscle. The objectives of this thesis were to characterize and compare the flow dynamics in reperfused skin and skeletal muscle flaps and to explore the role played by nitric oxide in attenuation of ischemia reperfusion injury in these flaps. In a series of three complementary experiments it was shown that (1) the effect of ischemia reperfusion injury on flow patterns varies significantly between flap skin and skeletal muscle. In flap skeletal muscle, an early hyperemic phase during reperfusion maintains a significant blood flow to all regions including the area of the flap that is destined for necrosis. In flap skin however, there is a marked decrease in flow rates. (2) Ischemia, reperfusion injury causes a significant decrease in the function and availability of constitutive nitric oxide synthase enzymes and (3) infusion of a nitric oxide donor during reperfusion significantly attenuates tissue injury.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kerrigan, Carolyn L.

First, I introduce a general overview on the nature of real proteins. Then I address the thermodynamics of proteins and how one can model it. After that I introduce a microscopic model for proteins and I discuss the reasons for its construction. After a thorough theoretical investigation of this model I make several predictions for its thermodynamic and dynamic behavior. I then introduce a dynamics for protein folding, including a master equation approach for the description of protein kinetics. Using the protein thermodynamics introduced earlier I implement some extensive Monte-Carlo computer calculation to elucidate the non Arrhenius modes in the protein folding. A mesoscopic model of the hierarchically constrained dynamics will be introduced after that to account for the observed behavior. Finally, I investigate an abstract but exactly solvable model which could serve as a cornerstone for the dream of protein designers---an ultimately fast folding protein.

Similarly, an 18-mer, also complementary to a sequence near the beginning of the 5'LTR region of HIV-1 genomic mRNA containing a terminal 3'3'-L-alpha-dC-5 '5' unit was synthesized. Binding studies demonstrated that the duplex formed showed minimal destabilization. Inhibition studies done in the presence of this modified oligonucleotide showed that the amount of (-) strong stop DNA synthesized was decreased in comparison to when the inhibition studies where done in the presence of an unmodified AON. However, due to the presence of two 5'-hydroxyl groups, this modified oligonucleotide did not serve as a substrate for the priming reaction.
