This circuit proved to be a powerful technique in the study of vibration damping, and some of its parameters were combined in a universal curve.  One viscoelastic material was chosen for most efficient application to a ventilation-duct model. At one anti-node the velocity-amplitude was reduced by 78.9%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Howes, F.

The failure of the accumulation of organic materials, except under conditions not favourable for decomposition, is ample evidence for the turnover of elemental substances.

The effects of pregnancy in cows and exercise and diet in rats were also studied. In another study the effects of gonadal hormones, administered to immature fowl, on the levels of serum hexosamine, protein, glucuronic acid, sugar and calcium were investigated. Hydrolysis of serum with a polystyrene resin gave higher estimates of hexosamine content than hydrolysis or serum with 4 N hydrochloric acid and subsequent chromatography. A reliable estimate of the glucuronic acid content ofserum could not be obtained by a direct determination, but a relatively reliable estimate may be obtained after resin hydrolysis of serum and purification of hydrolyzate by passing it through cationic and anionic exchange resin columns.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Anastassiadis, P.

This essential organization, therefore, seems to depend more on central mediating factors within the organism than on immediate sensory controls. A logical inference from this is that there is a developmental growth in the level of behavioral complexity of which the individual is capable, i.e., that the ability to organize increasingly complicated response sequences becomes more manifest with age.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rabinovitch, M.

The state's view of Indians as inadequate housekeepers and inattentive mothers reinforced efforts to alter the way of life on reserves.

Like changes have been indicated by other workers investigating both Gram-positive and Gram-negative chloramphenicol-resistant organisms. The additional observations of increased cross resistance to other antibiotics such as penicillin implies a possible non-specific mechanism of resistance such as an impermeability barrier in the cell.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stevenson, J.

The starting point when trying to determine the band structure of a crystalline material is to employ one or another type of approximation to obtain the general form of the structure of energy bands. This general form usually contains certain parameters whose theoretical calculation is difficult or prohibitive. Thus we resort to experiments to determine the values of these parameters and consequently the exact band structure. To establish the validity of an approximation we have to show that the model based on this approximation can explain the physical properties of the material.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wallace, P.

Any study that did or will reveal some of the unknowns of this phenomenon in grassland will be a step in the direction that will ultimately permit the attainment of the ideal pasture plant community. However, presently, until more is known, especially on the value of competition as it occurs in hay end pasture swards, any attempt to come forth with recommendations on the compounding of forage mixtures may be rather vain, because these will be only temporary.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Steppler, H.

Infection on two of these lower leaves increases the concentration of radioactivity in them, especially around lesions, but has no marked and consistent effect on the concentration in other organs. Infection on the presentation leaf reduces photosynthesis and export of C14 to other parts. Heat girdling of petioles of healthy and infected leaves show that in both cases, C14 export takes place through phloem and its import through xylem. Radioactivity in detached leaves exposed to C14O2 , either in light or in darkness, is uniformly distributed in healthy leaves, but accumulates around lesions in diseased ones. Starch has similar distribution. Pathological increase in transpiration and metabolic activity are probably responsible for the altered cl4 distribution in diseased leaves.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pelletier, R.

In Frankreich sind die Helden der Romane Balzacs fast ausnahmslos Geschopfe der kraftstrotzenden, geldgierigen Epoche, in der die Bürger zur politischen Führung gelangten. Flaubert schildert mit viel Verachtung die Menschen seiner Zeit, Hugo mit mehr Verstandnis und Gefühl für die Entrechteten. Zola malt mit der Geschichte der Rougon-Macquart die Geschicke seiner Zeit und ihrer Menschen. Sein pessimistischer Realismus ist lunchsetzt von Mitleid mit den Armen - und von Hoffnung.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Reiss, H.

On the other hand, it seems preferable to choose one model and explore its possibilities thoroughly before discarding it in the hope that there may be a common denominator to all carcinogenic processes. This thesis will attempt to show that by the use of a well-established experimental model, but by adding newer techniques, new and valuable information can be obtained. The two-stage production of papillomata in the skin of mice was chosen for several reasons. Training in this subject under experienced guidance is available in a favourable university environment. The basic experimental technique has been well established, and much information on it is available.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ritchie, A.

The geodesic equations contain the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, field variables which effectively take the place of the force of classical theory. The question arises, whether these equations can properly be called equations of motion, if the Christoffel symbols are singular at the location of the particle; for this is the case with the only solution of the field equations in empty space which is static, has spherical symmetry, and which goes over into the flat metric at infinity, i.e. the Schwartzschild solution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morris, T.
