There follows a comparison of the motivations for Frege's  "Cumulative Type Theory" and for Russell's Type Theory and of the basic  arithmetical definitions in each. Quine's New Foundations and, in particular,  extensions of Jensen's modification, NFU, are introduced and consistency results are  discussed. Finally, an interpretation is given in an NFU framework of a modified  form of the Grundgesetze theory. It is shown that an "Axiom of Counting"  necessary for arithmetic in NFU is needed in an analogous way for arithmetic in our  interpretation; it is further demonstrated that from the statement of this axiom in  NFU, the appropriate analogue is provable for our interpretation. The development of  arithmetic in an NFU framework is seen essentially to be that intended by Frege in  the Grundgesetze.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w37637424.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf30k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akw52j8601"><dcterms:title>Touch magnifying instrument applied to minimally invasive surgery</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yao, Hsin-Yun, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The MicroTactus is an instrument designed to detect signals  arising from the interaction of a tip with soft or hard objects and to magnify them  for haptic and auditory reproduction.

Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 13808 is a bacterium known to degrade plasticizers. The  first steps of the biodegradation mechanism consist of esterase-mediated hydrolyses.  The present study focused on characterizing the esterase produced by R. rhodochrous  and defining its impact on the rate of hydrolysis of different di-ester  plasticizers. By means of esterase activity and growth studies, it was  possible to determine that the esterase produced by R. rhodochrous was constitutive  and bound to the cell membrane. Treatment with a non-ionic surfactant, Triton X-100,  caused solubilization of the enzyme. The esterase exhibited high stability,  retaining activity for more than 48 hours, even after separation from the cell.  Esterase activity was highest at 30°C but observed at temperatures as low as  4°C. The comparison of the rates of hydrolysis of different esters  showed that the solubility of the substrate had an important impact, with the less  soluble compounds generally having lower rates. However, steric hindrance also  appeared to play an important role in the determination of the rate of hydrolysis.  The most common plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, had the slowest rate of  hydrolysis. Therefore, given the increasing and widespread use of DEHP and other  di-ester plasticizers, such plasticizers will continue to accumulate in the  environment. This growing pool of plasticizers will undergo slow biodegradation,  resulting in the increasing production of toxic metabolites.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q9526.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm81n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Chemical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax920fx43c"><dcterms:title>High-order solution of radio propagation problems using the multi-level fast multipole algorithm</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rawat, Vineet</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Wireless network planning requires accurate, site-specific urban  and indoor radio propagation models. Traditionally, such models have been developed  using approximate asymptotic methods. This thesis examines rigorous solution methods  for radio propagation in electrically large environments. The high-order locally corrected Nystrom (LCN) method is applied  to the combined field integral equation (CFIE) for scattering from perfect  electrical conductors (PEC) in two dimensions. The direct solution of the resulting  linear system of equations requires O(N2) time per iteration of an iterative solver.  Application of the multi-level fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) reduces iteration  time to O(Nlog N). The MLFMA employs an approximation however, and the error  introduced must be controlled via the selection of appropriate  parameters. An implementation of the LCN method and MLFMA is tested using  various electrically large scattering bodies. The solution of a simple urban radio  propagation problem is then examined and the feasibility of its rigorous solution is  demonstrated.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xx82p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fx43c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rx244"><dcterms:title>Water demand management in the Caribbean : a case study of Barbados</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khawam, Walid</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Water demand management attempts to balance the supply of and  demand for water by controlling the competing water demands. It realizes the change  by influencing peoples' behavior with respect to water use. Water demand management  (WDM) is necessary in water scarce regions like Barbados. The Government of Barbados  has recognized the need for WDM as demonstrated by the implementation of measures  such as universal metering and water pricing. This research looks at the impact of water pricing and metering  on residential water use in Barbados. Econometric demand models of residential water  use are developed to assess the potential of pricing policies to conserve water.  Price elasticities between -0.18 and -0.93 were obtained suggesting that pricing  policies can be used to reduce and control residential water consumption in  Barbados. The results of the models are then used to investigate the impact of  different rate structures on water use and revenue generation. It is predicted that  a 26% decrease in water demand and a 52% increase in revenue collected from water  bills would be achieved if the 1997 proposed water rate increase is implemented. In  addition, results indicate that water production decreased by 12% from 1997 to 2000,  coinciding with the implementation of the Universal Metering Program. However,  per-capita consumption has been on the rise in recent years suggesting that metering  must be accompanied by a substantial increase in price to encourage water  conservation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq277.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx244</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Sanitary and Municipal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahx11xf82f"><dcterms:title>Modeling and evaluation of a hierarchical ring interconnect for system-on-chip multiprocessing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kuo, Benjamin S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis proposes a software model for a multiprocessor  system, which is targeted for SoC implementation.

The system uses an  alternative memory architecture to reduce logic complexity, as well as a different  deadlock prevention scheme to reflect changes in memory architecture. The software  model is implemented in the SystemC modeling language, which allows high-level  behavior modeling to reduce both the development time and the simulation time.

These techniques were used to determine the effect of the  superplastic forming on texture, grain boundary character distribution (GBCD), grain  size, residual stress and microstructure at different stages of the deformation of  specimens deformed in tension. Results indicate that a microstructure is transformed  mainly by the grain boundary sliding process that is responsible for rapid  randomization of texture. There is also much evidence for crystallographic slip  occurring in conjunction with grain boundary sliding. Accommodation of superplastic  flow is linked to increased dislocations density in the lattice. At a threshold  level, the dislocation density reaches certain saturation level and the nucleation  of voids starts. At this threshold strain, the deformation mechanism is altered and  superplastic flow proceeds, however, cavities continue to be produced and coalesce  due to the grain boundary sliding process. A precipitate free zone is observed  during deformation. This zone is more plastic and presents an orientational  difference when compared to the grain interior. It is theorized that this  precipitate free zone aids in the accommodation of GBS and plays a role in the  cavitation process. The Kernel average misorientation function of OIM was used to  indicate the level of strain within the grains to explain the formation of  cavities.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wj92f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736665085</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9k41zf091"><dcterms:title>Thermal oxidation of fine aluminum powders in carbon dioxide gas</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Brandstadt, Katrina L.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thermal oxidation of fine aluminum (Al) powders in carbon  dioxide (CO2) gas was investigated for the purpose of metal-based propulsion fuel  development.

Studies of polysemy are few in number and contradictory. Some  find differences between polysemy and homonymy (Frazier &amp; Rayner, 1990); others  find similarities (Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001). Here, polysemous words independently  rated to have low, moderate, or high semantic overlap of their distinct meanings,  were studied using the methods of Klein &amp; Murphy. Participants judged the  sensicality of phrases consisting of a modifier and a polysemous word as a function  of a cooperating, conflicting, or neutral context. Low and moderate-overlap words  elicited slower judgments than high-overlap words, and were facilitated by a  cooperating context. In contrast, high-overlap words were uniformly fast and did not  differ as function of context. Thus, low- and moderate-overlap polysemous words  behave similarly to homonyms, whereas high-overlap words do not. This is taken as  support for a lexical ambiguity continuum delimited by homonymy and polysemy,  without precise boundaries between the two.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c294.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cd73r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Experimental.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085k71f"><dcterms:title>Le language romanesque de Raymond Queneau : l'exemple du Chiendent</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rouette, Annik</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation concerns the multilingual structure found in  the fictitious works of French writer Raymond Queneau (1903-1976) by examining the  different languages of genres that occur in this author's first novel, Le Chiendent  (1933).

The fieldnotes of anthropologist  Regina Flannery, completed in the 1930's, serve to orient this research, and provide  a starting point for discussion. As northern communities continue to adapt in the face of social  and economic changes, cultural categories such as tradition have concurrently  undergone reevaluation. It is argued here that the meanings of tradition have become  more complex as Cree women adjust to their changing environment. It is demonstrated that tradition is used as a narrative tool in  descriptions of the past, and a means by which women can discuss change and the  future of their community. In addition, tradition currently occupies a significant  symbolic space in women's individual cultural identities, and is incorporated in  daily life in various ways. Furthermore, tradition has also become an important  component of Cree political discourse. Finally, it is apparent that tradition  remains a contested category among women themselves, and dissent exists as to the  future transmission of traditional practices, language and values. From this analysis, tradition emerges as a nuanced term that has  a number of conceptual modalities. It is suggested that a more comprehensive grasp  of complex concepts such as tradition is made possible through the prioritization of  personal narratives, and the exploration of the ways in which individuals utilize,  comprehend and expand on cultural categories.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v3656.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h5016</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cree women -- James Bay Region</dc:subject><dc:subject>Autobiographical memory -- Social aspects</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cree Indians -- James Bay Region -- Ethnic identity</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atm70mv74v"><dcterms:title>Poetics of distraction : Ozaki Midori's writings on film</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of East Asian Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gibb, Adrienne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The cinematic experience in Taisho Japan was a defining part of  a spectrum of modernity's experiences associated with daily urban life.

A class of models are found which simultaneously allow  for radius stabilization by utilizing a bulk scalar field with a potential in the  bulk and on the branes. The coupled radion-scalar field system is analyzed from the  five-dimensional point of view and is seen to consistently reduce to a  four-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-like cosmology. An analysis of the  constraints imposed during inflation fixes the radion mass and we speculate on the  possibility that the new physics at work here may be distinguishable from typical  four-dimensional models.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g43g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j155j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nv16k"><dcterms:title>Investigating the effects of climate change and sea level rise on the coastal processes of the Beaufort Sea, Yukon Territory</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Turner, Jennifer, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>High latitude areas have been identified in most GCMs as regions  where global warming will appear earliest and be the greatest. Since much of  Canada's north is underlain by permafrost, a warming of 3-5°C could cause  widespread erosion and thermokarst. The Arctic coastal zone is particularly  vulnerable, as it lies at the interface between terrestrial systems dominated by  permafrost, and marine systems dominated by sea ice and wave action. This study aims  at understanding some mechanisms of arctic coastal erosion, such as thermoerosional  niches and block failure. The final goal of this research is to identify the areas  of Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, which are likely to experience the greatest  magnitude of change in the near future. This information is then coupled with a  climate change scenario in order to predict future coastal erosion in the  area.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf52m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv16k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sea level -- Beaufort Sea.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Climatic changes -- Yukon -- Herschel Island.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beaufort Sea Coast (Yukon)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rk866"><dcterms:title>Fate of B-complex vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract of dairy cows</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Santschi, Debora</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three experiments were conducted to characterize the fate of  B-vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract of dairy cows. Experiment 1 was undertaken  to verify if differences among published studies could be explained by methods of  collection and preparation of ruminal fluid, using four ruminally cannulated  non-lactating Holstein cows. Acidification of fresh ruminal fluid, causing the lysis  of bacterial cells, yielded higher B-vitamin concentrations than differential  centrifugation, while the method of collection used did not have an important  impact. Results suggested that most of the vitamins are present in the bacterial  fractions, and that only limited amounts are present in the surrounding fluid.  Experiment 2 looked at the vitamin concentrations in ruminal bacterial fractions and  particle-free fluid as influenced by diet composition. Six lactating ruminally  cannulated Holstein cows were used in a cross-over design, and the diets were  formulated to have forage to concentrate ratios of 60:40 (high-forage) and 40:60  (low-forage). B-vitamins were present mainly in the bacterial fractions of the  rumen, with greater effects of the forage to concentrate ratio on vitamin  concentrations in the bacteria associated to the solid fraction than on those  present in the liquid portion of the rumen. These results strongly suggested that  ruminal B-vitamin synthesis is influenced by the forage to concentrate ratio.  Experiment 3 investigated the fate of supplementary B-vitamins, using four cows  equipped with cannulae in the rumen, the proximal duodenum and the distal ileum.  Extensive losses of dietary supplements appeared prior to the duodenum for all  vitamins, but intestinal disappearance rates of most vitamins were increased by  supplementation.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17ct51t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rk866</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Feeding and feeds.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vitamin B in animal nutrition.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq811kk16v"><dcterms:title>Dataflow analysis of the [pi]-calculus</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sanjabi, Sam B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Static analysis [NNH99] is technique used to compute information  about the run-time behaviour of a program prior to execution. Traditionally, it has  been used in the context of optimizing compilers, but it has recently been applied  to more formalized languages in order to develop provable policies that can be used  to verify the security of networks. Best results are naturally achieved with the  most precise information flow techniques, though complex systems impose feasibility  constraints. Accuracy of results, particularly with respect to relative cost of  computation is thus an important quality. This thesis presents a series of dataflow analyses of the  pi-calculus, an extensively studied concurrent language that has been used to model  and verify security protocols. Some of the presented analyses are equivalent to  previous work done in the field, but the framework in which the analysis is done is  new in that it immediately suggests an iterative implementation. There are also analyses presented that improve on existing  approaches in two ways. First, by fully treating the sequentiality of potential  actions in a protocol, thereby improving the accuracy of previous approaches.  Second, by considering the potential environment that a process could be running in,  the computed results are correct independent of any context that the analyzed  process may be in parallel composition with.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x08t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk16v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732d9595"><dcterms:title>Disruption of LDL receptor-like gene function in Caenorhabditis elegans</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Oviedo Landaverde, Irene</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>dsc-4(qm182), a mutation that suppresses the lengthened  defecation cycle of clk-1 also suppresses the delay in germline development. dsc-4  encodes a putative orthologue of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a  protein essential for the assembly and secretion of apo-B-containing low density  lipoproteins (LDL). The effect of dsc-4 on clk-1(qm30), coupled to studies of apoB  homologues in worms led to a model suggesting the possibility of using C. elegans in  the study of LDL-like lipoprotein particles. The impact of the level of lipoproteins  is particularly evident in the germline developmental rate of the  worms. We report here a further elucidation of clk-1 mutants in the  study of the biology of LDL-like particles. In particular, we investigated the  effect of targeting LDL receptor-like genes by RNA interference (RNAi) on the egg  laying rate of clk-1(qm30). We find positive modulating effects by disruption of  these putative LDL receptors. In confirmation of our model of lipoprotein metabolism  in clk-1 mutants, we find that disruption of these putative LDL receptors produces  strikingly different effects in wild-type, clk-1(qm30) or clk-1(qm30); dsc-4(qm182)  animals. In addition, we report unexpected effects of various clk-1  alleles on the phenotypes of animals in which lrp-1 and rme-2 are disrupted.  Specifically, we observe an allele specific amelioration of the phenotypes  associated with disruption of these genes (abnormal molting and sterility,  respectively). We discuss the possible significance of these findings.

One of the most important stressors is biological invasion---the  introduction of exotic species, which can contribute to the loss of native species.  The effects of an introduced species are correlated with its abundance and typically  vary across ecosystems, suggesting that its impact on native species is mediated by  its environment, i.e. the physical habitat and the recipient community. However,  there are few studies that explore the effects of environment on the interactions  between exotic and native species.

Two transglutaminase isoforms, tissue  transglutaminase (tTG) and factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), are expressed in skeletal tissues.  Tissue transglutaminase has been previously localized in bone to osteoblasts, the  osteoid layer and the pericellular matrix of osteocytes. Factor XIIIa has been  localized to mineralizing chondrocytes, however, its expression in osteoblasts has  not been reported yet. In order to understand the role of transglutaminases in hard  tissue formation, we have investigated tTG and FXIIIa expression and activity during  osteoblast differentiation and mineralization using the well-characterized MC3T3-E1  preosteoblast cell line. We show that tTG and FXIIIa are expressed at all time  points examined in the cell cultures, and that their expression and activity does  not appear to be significantly changed by the differentiation or mineralization  state of the cells. We show that tTG localizes homogeneously throughout the cells  and the extracellular matrix, whereas FXIIIa distribution is polarized to one side  of the cells at earlier time points, but becomes incorporated into the matrix  produced by differentiating cells in mature cultures. These expression profiles  suggest a dual role, initially in cell adhesion and attachment and, later, in  protein assembly, where the transglutaminases likely stabilize the matrix and assist  in the formation of an extracellular matrix competent for subsequent mineralization.  The identification and characterization of two transglutaminase isoforms in  osteoblasts suggest a potentially overlapping roles for these two enzymes in the  MC3T3-E1 cell culture system.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm58c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk15s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161672g"><dcterms:title>Identification of proteins interacting with the N-termini of USP2 deubiquitinating enzyme isoforms</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lee, Kyung-Joo, 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ubiquitin system is a major cytosolic and nuclear pathway of  proteolysis in all eukaryotic cells. In this pathway, ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid  peptide, is covalently ligated to protein substrates by a series of enzymes; E1, E2  and E3. The ubiquitin-attached proteins are commonly targeted for destruction by the  26S proteasome but the ubiquitination may also direct other cellular functions such  as endocytosis, leading to proteolysis in the lysosome. Interestingly, a large  family of genes encoding deubiquitinating enzymes (UBP; ubiquitin specific  processing protease and UCH; ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase) has recently been  identified from different organisms. These enzymes are found to remove ubiquitin  from covalent attachments to itself or other proteins in order to regenerate free  ubiquitin or to counteract the effects of ubiquitinating enzymes by removing the  polyubiquitin chain from the conjugated protein substrate. Dr. Wing's laboratory has  recently identified USP2a and USP2b, two germ cell specific UBP isoforms that share  a common core region but divergent N-termini. These termini target the USP2b and  USP2a to different subcellular locations and also influence substrate  specificity. To identify substrates or interacting proteins that may serve to  localize these enzymes, a bacterial two-hybrid assay was performed using a mouse  testis cDNA library and the N-termini of the enzymes as baits. Kpna6, an isoform of  Karyopherin alpha (also known as importin alpha) and  SKD3, the suppressor of K + transport  defect protein were found to be possible interacting proteins of USP2a  and USP2b respectively.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m4748.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161672g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kn711"><dcterms:title>Molecular interactions of bacterial outer membrane proteins</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Jean-Nicolas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Transport of iron-siderophores and vitamin B12 across the outer  membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria requires energy from the proton motive force  delivered by the TonB/ExbB/ExbD complex.

However, other sites on OM  receptors have been proposed to participate in interactions with TonB. To identify  novel sites of interactions with TonB, we selected TonB-binding peptides from a  random library of peptides displayed on phages. Fifteen peptides displayed sequence  similarities to known TonB-dependent OM receptors. Of the fifteen, eight were mapped  to regions of FhuA, FepA and FecA for which crystal structures are available. DNA  sequences for selected peptides were fused to malE and displayed at the N-terminus  of the E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP) for further characterization. Surface  plasmon resonance experiments revealed that when the peptides were monovalently  displayed on MBP, they retained TonB-binding activity thereby permitting assessments  of their binding characteristics. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that only  FhuA-mapping peptides could disrupt TonB-FhuA interactions, indicating that TonB  selectively binds to multiple regions distinct for each OM receptor.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602122c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn711</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505110b"><dcterms:title>Three-dimensional visualization and quantification of residual non-aqueous phase liquids using x-ray computed tomography</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Goldstein, Lucas</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>If spilled in significant quantities, non-aqueous phase liquids  (NAPLs), such as gasoline, coal tar, and chlorinated solvents, will migrate downward  through the subsurface.

These 'trapped' NAPL globules and pools  may partition into the groundwater and/or vapor phases, and serve as ongoing sources  of contamination (i.e. source zones).
