With secondary alkyl tosyl esters, replacement of the tosyl group by iodine takes place to a much smaller extent under the same experimentalconditions, namely, at room temperature.4. Interaction of sodium iodide and the tosyl esters of alk-aryl secondary alcohols, for example, benzhydrol, proceeds abnormally. In the case ofbenzhydrol, the reaction product is dibenzhydryl ether.5.

Measurements previously carried out in this laboratory with this end in viewhave dealt with the isothermals of water and other vapours on cellulose (1, 2, 3, 4), with the densities (5), the alkali adsorption (6, 7), the heatconductivity (8), the dielectric constant (9, 10), the rates of adsorption (11) and the heats of wetting and water vapour adsorption (12) of suchsystems.

The writer has attempted to present the technique of preparing opaque minerals for microscopical study and to discussthe methods used in their identification. It was thought advisable to give a brief history of the development of this subject and an outline of itsmore important applications, so that a perspective view of the position of mineralography within the geological sciences may be obtained.A few brief notes on the telluride minerals are given in chapter IV.

Stark effect in the spectrum of DQ has been observed under high dispersion in the spectral range 6500 - 5700 A at a field strength of 69 Kv/cm.2. Measurements of the Stark effect are reported for 173 lines of which 79 are classified Fulcher band lines, the remainder being as yetunclassified.3. The wave-lengths of the unclassified lines have been determined with an accuracy In most cases of better than 0.1 A.4. The Stark effect is of the same order of magnitude and of the same general nature as in H2. Most of the lines exhibit small simple displacements.In a number of cases two components are observed in each polarization.5. The theory of the Stark effect is discussed, and compared qualitatively with the experimental results.6. Partial agreement is found with the results of the only former observer whose investigation under low dispersion was restricted to the classifiedFulcher bands in this region.7. The Stark effect data for the unclassified lines should be of some value for their classification.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

That it is necessary for normal plant growth and wellbeing is evident from the chlorosis which develops in plants grown in soils ornutrient solutions deficient in iron. Although the iron is not present in the pigment itself, that it must be in some way related to it physiologicallywas emphasized by Moore (1), who assigned to iron some function in the photosynthesis of chlorophyll.
