It determines his social and economic status, his associates, his leisure activities, hie entire mode or life. Discrepancy between the kind of job a person has and the kind of job he would like to have, tends to lead to job dissatisfaction and frequent shifting of jobs which may seriously affect personality and emotional adjustment. Since occupational aspirations are salient factors in job satisfaction, and thereby in the total adjustment of the individual, studies of the level of aspiration of job applicants have important implications for vocational guidance. Knowledge of an individual’s vocational hopes and expections, as well as an assessment of his vocational potentialities, may point out the way in which he can best be assisted in finding the job which most adequately meets his qualifications, his interests and his needs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alexander, F.

Since the debate on these issues is far from being over, no definite conclusions were reached. It was found nevertheless that most economists have come to recognize special circumstances in the case of developing economies. As a consequence, they have come to believe that the role of trade as an agent of development should be considered in the light of the particular situations of individual countries, rather than attempting to apply given principles or policies to all situations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Loutfi, M.

Hemorrhage into the follicles. III. Formation of corpora lutea. They maintained that conclusive demonstration of the presence of this substance, which they termed prolan, demanded the production of reactions II and/or III. [...] However this substance is found in body fluids and tissues only in the presence of living chorionic tissue, as during normal pregnancy in women or when pathological chorionic tissue is present. Evidence has since been presented to show that it originates from chorionic cells and not from the anterior pituitary, hence the designation, chorionic gonadotrophic hormone first suggested by Hamburger and which has been generally adopted. Moreover it has not been found possible to separate this substance into “A” and “B” fractions by methods which have been used in separating anterior pituitary extracts into follicle stimulating and luteinizing fractions.

Surplus acetylcholine is the extra acetylcholine that accumulates in the presence of choline and an anticholinesterase. Surplus acetylcholine formed rapidly when eserine was the anticholinesterase, but slowly when neostigmine or ambenonium was used. Chronically decentralized ganglia synthesized no surplus acetylcholine. These experiments suggested that surplus acetylcholine was stored presynaptically and the results were discussed in relation to the location of acetylcholinesterase. Surplus acetylcholine was labelled by perfusing resting ganglia with eserine-3H-choline-Locke. Subsequent stimulation of the preganglionic nerve failed to release radioactivity although unlabelled acetylcholine was released. These experiments suggested that surplus acetylcholine did not mix with releasable transmitter. Perfusion with high-K+ or acetylcholine or carbachol injections effectively released surplus acetylcholine, but the released acetylcholine did not augment the ganglion-stimulant effect of carbachol.

Patterns of radioactive p32 uptake in vivo showed canine gastric mucosal vascular volume to be double, and perfusion rate to be half, that of the jejunum or ileum. Thoracotomy and laparotomy together, caused a doubling of jejunal (but not of gastric or ileal) mucosal vascular volume and perfusion, lasting four to six weeks. Concomitant vagotomy shortened this response to less than three weeks. There was no evidence of diminished perfusion in these chronic studies with or without vagotomy. The vascular responses coincide with reports of increased epithelial cell survival after laparotomy.

The classical school of political economy never gave the problem a thought; to it the study of economic development was synonymous with the study of all economics itself. However, after Karl Marx there arose a completely new way of approaching this subject: phenomena were now always studied in relation to a static model, from which all element of time was removed. This method of economic analysis was so highly developed and has become so ingrained in the minds of most economists that it now becomes necessary to ask why we should study economic change. An odd state of affairs, indeed! Although Schumpeter re-introduced the subject of economic development in 1911 with the publication of his “Theory of Economic Development” in German, the study of long-run trends has never again become the fashion, economists having recently devoted themselves either to furthering the study of static analysis or to examining the short-run problems of the business cycle. The need for a well-rounded theory of economic development is still great. This thesis attempts to make some contribution by evaluating the work of four outstanding theorists of change: Smith, Ricardo, Marx, and Schumpeter. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Keirstead, B.

The islet alteration is associated with decreased glucose tolerance and inadequate serum insulin levels. Thus, this spontaneous model in an easily available laboratory animal may be of use for studying prediabetes and diabetes mellitus. Investigations carried out in young and aging male animals with or without this pancreatic islet alteration suggest that in aging animals a change of carbohydrate metabolism develops that leads to functional deficiencies of the islets.

Warren’s Dictionary of Psychology defines anxiety as “an emotional attitude or sentiment concerning the future, characterized by an unpleasant mingling of dread and hope”. MacKinnon (1944) writes that anxiety occupies the intermediate position in the series of prospective emotions made up of confidence, hope, anxiety, despondency and despair. Mowrer (1939) defines anxiety as anticipation of painfully intense stimulation. Masserman (1944) sees anxiety as “a diffuse, pervading apprehensiveness without specific or clearly recognized (conscious) reality referents”. Billings (1939) regards it as “a feeling of uneasiness and an unpleasant expectancy of something about to happen without a certainty of its coming to pass”. According to Kubie (1941), anxiety is “a protective anticipatory signal for the outbreak of the startle state”. For Young (1943) the term anxiety designates a persistent state in which there is a foreboding of evil”. In all of the foregoing definitions there is one common element. This is denoted by the words: concerning the future, prospective emotion, anticipation, apprehensiveness, expectancy and foreboding. In each case anxiety is seen as an uneasy feesling about what is to come. This idea is fundamental to a definition of anxiety and on this point there is general agreement.

This move in enlisting all the research personnel in a collaborative and systematic study in which each research group was assigned a particular phase of the problem marked a beginning of a real progress in the improvement of blood preservation and the treatment of shock.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Denstedt, O.

The extent of dissociation depended on the nature of the solvent composition. Catalases dissociated at a low protein concentration. Soret band intensity of the heme proteins studied remained unaffected in presence of uni-univalent ionic solutes but diminished with bi-univalent and non-ionic solutes and high pH. Fluorescence emission spectra of catalases showed an increase in relative fluorescence intensity and a red shift in the emission maximum with the bi-univalent solutes and non-ionic solutes. Fluorescence emission spectra of catalases were affected by pH. Both types of solutes and high pH affected the enzymic and antigenic activities of bovine liver catalase. The extent of renaturation under conditions of solvent perturbation, temperature and pH depended on the degree of denaturation. The properties of bovine liver catalase under charge modification using succinylation, acetylation, carbamidomethylation and reductive cleavage have been studied. Bovine liver and equine erythrocyte catalases were more resistant to dissociation, than equine liver catalase. Avian hemoglobins were more resistant to dissociation than mammalian hemoglobins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saha, A.

The sedimentation constants of both calf-thymus (11% and 19% pure) hybrids and mouse-tumor (28% pure) hybrid in sucrose gradients were approximately 4S. The hybrids melted at 73 – 76 °c (in 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01M MgCl2 , 0.1M NaCl). In Cs2SO4 density gradients the hybrids banded at a buoyant density of 1.52 gm cm^-3, and were purified 2 -fold by separation of native DNA contaminant (1.46 gm cm^-3). The isolation of DNA-tRNA hybrid, by an extension of these techniques, would allow studies on pure tRNA cistrons.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fraser, M.

Of special interest is the characterization of the Normal distribution. In this thesis, characterizations of the Normal distribution through different considerations are treated in great detail. Chapter II is concerned with the characterization of the Normal distribution by using specified or unspecified distributions of suitable statistics. Chapter III deals mainly with the property of independence of suitable statistics, such as linear statistics, linear and quadratic statistics, linear and polynomial statistics, by which the Normal distribution is characterized. Chapter IV gives some generalizations of some results in Chapter III by replacing the property of independence by a weaker condition of regression such as constant regression and polynomial regression. Finally, Chapter V discusses the characterization of the Normal distribution through linear structural relations and through properties of sample estimators. Other characterizations which do not fall into the preceding categories are mentioned at the end of Chapter V.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mathai, A.

References to this belief may be found in the literature of the classical ages. Indeed, one of the principle symptoms of mental disorder, melancholia, derives its name from the Greek word ,”melagkholia”, which means “black” (melas) “bile” (khole). In the fourth century B.C. Hippocrates expressed the belief that bile was the cause of madness. A sudden flux of bile to the brain was thought to bring on unpleasant dreams and feelings of anxiety; a superabundance of black bile caused melancholia. Aristotle (384 - 322 B.C.) formulated a similar hypothesis. He believed that the soul was unable to function without warmth. Black bile was merely the carrier of heat and cold; moderate coldness led to vertigo, apprehensiveness, or a state of being stunned. Coldness led to cowardice and stupidity, warmth caused gaiety and free joy, while great heat was associated with amorous desires and cleverness. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thomson, D.

Measurements of cathode polarization, in a Haring cell of small capacity, proved unsuitable for microanalysis of gelatin in the cathode film during copper electrodeposition, even with closely controlled experimental conditions, owing to depletion of the gelatin content of the electrolyte on continued deposition. The substitution of SO cycle alternating current for direct current in the same cell showed that electrode polarization measurements gave promise of eventually providing the required analysis, preliminary trials only being completed. The results of these investigations, while throwing light on the importance of gelatin depletion, served to confirm Gauvin’s hypothesis for the mechanism of the action of gelatin, that the colloid, being adsorbed on part of the active cathode area, would cause an increase in current density and therefore in cathode polarization. The attainment of a steady and reproducible cathode polarization value seemed unlikely because of the depletion of the electrolyte.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.

Avec les données du radar (λ=10 cm), on détermina la valeur relative du facteur de réflectivité Z pour un volume de l'atmosphère situé à environ 5,000 pieds au-dessus des pluviométres dont le nombre varia entre 4 et 7 selon l'orage. En supposant une relation de la forme Z=AR^1.6, on calcula l'intensité de la pluie R pour une valeur de référence Z1 en comparant pour chaque orage la pluie estimée à celle observée. L'écart entre ces valeurs équivaut à 6 dB en Z et signifie que l'utilisation, pour tous les orages, d'une relation moyenne permet d'évaluer la quantité de pluie entre 65% et 154%. L'utilisation de la relation appropriée pour un orage donné peramet de mesurer entre 80% et 125% de la quantité de pluie qui tombe à un endroit quell-conque tandis que la valeur estimée pour l'intensité R est telle que 50% des mesures indiquent un écart inférieur à 20% et 90% sont précises à plus de 50%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gunn, K.
