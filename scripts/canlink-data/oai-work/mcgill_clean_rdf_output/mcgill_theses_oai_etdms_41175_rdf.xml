Nuclear charge dispersion curves were constructed at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 85 MeV. The general behaviour is similar to that observed by previous workers. With increasing proton energy the curves broaden and the most probable charge approaches the line of beta-stability. These phenomena are qualitatively explained in terms of neutron evaporation.

Whereas before the war, literary discourse keeps on upholding, in a dogmatic way, the superiority of French culture and literature, the next period is characterized, on the contrary, by a reassessment of this postulate. The historical circumstances justify the setting up of exceptional institutional conditions. Some French writers and critics, in exile in North America, partake, to varying degrees, in the French Canadian literary scene. The backing of these intellectuals is not unrelated to the process of modernization and autonomization undertaken at that time by the major sectors of the Quebecer literary apparatus. A conflict of interest in the publishing sector as well as ideological differences spark a controversy between Robert Carbonneau and some members of the Comite National des Ecrivains. This "quarrel", to quote Charbonneau, is an unprecedented example of direct confrontation between Quebecer and French literary agents. On this occasion, Robert Charbonneau redefines French Canadian literature outside of France's sphere of influence, France being a country whose status he wishes to limit to that of just one foreign reference among many. This desire for autonomy can also be found in literary texts which, using means available to them, bear witness to an appreciable decline of the French literature. But whereas literary discourse attempts to resist annexation to French literature, the literary apparatus is subject, upon the Liberation, to a material and symbolic domination by the French authorities, a domination it cannot fight. In this respect, the conditions of literary production in the fifties are paradoxical since the text, while voicing its rejection of the French institution and its French Canadian identity, continues to receive its ultimate consecration from France.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698826m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc954</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>French-Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>French literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A3x816n279"><dcterms:title>Ninth-grade high school students' coping and adaptation : a counselling perspective on responses to stresses of everyday living</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schamborzki, Ingeburg Ursula.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study describes and analyzes within the cognitive-phenomenological theory of psychological stress developed by Lazarus and his colleagues the coping strategies used by 95 9th-grade adolescents in specific stressful events in their daily lives.

Results of the study indicate the most frequently reported hassles and uplifts are consistent with the age and developmental level of this sample. The concerns are primarily frequent, chronic minor events associated with activities of daily living. Hassles and uplifts were positively correlated with each other, as well as with symptomatology and coping strategies. Coping strategies were positively related to symptomatology. Female adolescents reported higher levels of uplifts intensity, more coping strategies, and higher levels of symptomatology than male adolescents. Although significantly fewer coping strategies were reported over time, both problem-solving and emotion-regulating strategies were used in the majority of stressful events. Significant differences in levels of symptomatology appeared as a function of the language-group to which subjects belonged. While further investigation of adolescents' coping behaviors is warranted, the results of this study identified the need for stress management education for adolescents as well as for teachers, counsellors, and other professionals who work with them.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wj99c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816n279</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>High school students -- Attitudes -- Research.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Stress in children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6q182k940"><dcterms:title>Theology and modernity : a study in the thought of Langdon Gilkey</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Walsh, Brian J., 1953-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Langdon Gilkey's theological method distinguishes three stages of the theological enterprise, namely, prolegomenon, constructive theology and theology of culture. In this dissertation we employ this threefold division as an organizing principle for the exposition and evaluation of Gilkey's thought. We propose further, however, that the whole project is best understood if seen primarily in terms of the third stage. Consequently the dissertation focuses on Gilkey's theology of culture and interprets his prolegomenon and constructive theology in terms of their foundational relevance to his theology of modernity in decline. Interpreted in this way the project as a whole displays a coherent interrelatedness. That coherence also means, however, that ambiguity and weak arguments in both the prolegomenon and constructive theology are reflected in the theology of culture. These deficiencies notwithstanding, Gilkey's theology of culture provides us with an analysis and diagnosis of modernity that plumbs to the religious depths of that culture. Such analysis is necessary for all cultures but especially for cultures in decline.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f908.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k940</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Gilkey, Langdon Brown, 1919- -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tq13d"><dcterms:title>Sōma re-examined : a study of the church as the body of Christ in the Pauline corpus with emphasis on the relationship between Christ's personal body and the church as body</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1987</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yorke, Gosnell L.

Embedded in much of the discussion is the implicit assumption that s oma Christou as ecclesiological language does point to Christ's once crucified but now risen body in some direct way. This thesis examines that basic assumption in the light of the 18 ecclesiological references to soma found in the Pauline corpus. We argue that such an assumption is implausible and we conclude that it is simply the human body (any human body) which acts as a metaphorical signifier for the church; further, that Christ's personal body, crucified and risen, becomes relevant only in a larger Christological and soteriological sense.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g462.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq13d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sōma (Greek word)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Church</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arf55z862b"><dcterms:title>Clonal development in myeloproliferative disorders</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shihab-El-Deen, Awatef</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We assessed clonal development and extent of progression of hemopoietic malignancies (dysmyelopoietic syndrome (DMPS) and acute myelogenous leukemia) by examining in vitro growth patterns of their normal and leukemic progenitors. Additional phenotypic and cytogenetic analysis of an in vitro human myeloid leukemia model (HL-60) and its variant sublines were performed. These were aimed at determining cytogenetic abnormalities associated with phenotypic changes which accompany the derivation of these variant sublines. Our findings indicate that in vitro bone marrow cultures can be used clinically to rule out preleukemia, and that quantitations of bone marrow culture (CFU-C) can determine the potential for the development of acute leukemia in the DMPS patients. Acute leukemia developed in 48% of DMPS patients with a median transformation of 10 months. In acute leukemia, there was a preferential growth of normal karyotype in the in vitro cultures even among the phenotypically specified "blast" colonies. Analysis of HL-60 variant sublines demonstrated the development of specific chromosomal abnormalities (1q+, iso8q, iso17q) in two cell lines (clones resistant to chemical induction) in association with loss of differentiation. These specific chromosomal abnormalities are known to be associated with tumor progression. The development of 1q+ abnormality was associated with loss of myeloperoxidase reaction and persistence of primary granules in that specific variant. A group of variant subclones was also associated with loss of differentiation, cytogenetically however, they demonstrated a revert to near diploid near normal karyotypes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g8304.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z862b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afb4949256"><dcterms:title>The metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids by vascular tissue /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Funk, Colin D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Blood vessels convert arachidonic acid to prostacyclin (PGI(,2)), which is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or their hydroperoxy metabolites can cause a reduction in PGI(,2) production. Therefore, in the present study, the metabolism of PUFA and their effects on PGI(,2) production have been investigated. Linoleic acid is converted by aorta to hydroperoxy metabolites, which are either dehydrated to oxo compounds, reduced to monohydroxy products, or converted to epoxyhydroxy-octadecenoic acids. The latter are then hydrolyzed to trihydroxy metabolites by aortic epoxide hydrolases. Aorta also converts eicosatrienoic acid to similar products, which are formed via 12-hydroperoxy-8,10-heptadecadienoic acid. GC-MS analysis indicated that the major oxygenated PUFA metabolite formed by rat and bovine blood vessels was 6-oxoprostaglandin-F(,1(alpha)). Substantial amounts of free and esterified monohydroxy and trihydroxy metabolites of linoleic acid were detected, especially in rat and rabbit aortae. Reduction of glutathione peroxidase activity by administration of a selenium-deficient diet had no significant effect on the formation of any of the above products. The presence of esterified monohydroxy and trihydroxy PUFA metabolites in aortic lipids indicates that their esterified hydroperoxy precursors are present. An excess of these products could inhibit PGI(,2) synthesis and contribute to the onset of atherosclerosis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d726q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb4949256</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A05741s529"><dcterms:title>Memory for spacial location and frequency of occurrence after frontal or temporal lobectomy in man</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Smith, Mary Louise.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In Part I, recall of spatial location was studied in an incidental-learning situation, where patients with unilateral brain lesions, the amnesic patient, H.

The adaptive control strategy is based on the linear quadratic regulator that places the closed loop poles such that an infinite stage quadratic cost function is minimized. The plant parameters are identified recursively using a projection algorithm. First, we study the effect of the model over-parametrization. For this purpose, we introduce an algorithm to generate the controller parameters recursively. This asymptotic reformulation is shown to overcome situations in which the pole-zero cancellation is a limit point of the identification algorithm. We also show that the algorithm will generate a unique control sequence that converges asymptotically to the solution of the Diophantine (pole assignment) equation. Next, we study the stability of the proposed adaptive scheme in both deterministic and stochastic cases. We show that the global stability of the resulting adaptive scheme is obtained with no implicit assumptions about parameter convergence or the nature of the external input. Then the global convergence of the adaptive algorithm is obtained if the external input is "persistently exciting". By convergence we mean that the adaptive control will converge to the optimal control of the system. The performance of the adaptive algorithm in the presence of deterministic disturbances is also considered, where we show that the adaptive controller performs relatively well if the model order is high enough to include a description of the disturbances.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r42x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf54d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adaptive control systems -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discrete-time systems.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Linear time invariant systems.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af7623d40s"><dcterms:title>Adsorption of bilirubin of polymer sorbents</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Henning, D.

The adsorption of bilirubin by the pendants on the Merrifield resin was minimal while PVP and cholestyramine adsorbed some bilirubin. However, the best adsorbents were the immobilized amino acids on a water swellable polyamide resin. A systematic study of the effect of the changes in the amino acid composition of the pendant, both in type and number, on the adsorption by the polyamide resins indicates that the change density, contributed by the R groups of the amino acids in the pendant, is the major factor in the adsorption process. However, some adsorption also occurs at the (alpha)-amino groups. Effects due to the conformation of the peptide chains are also indicated. Of the resins studied, those with peptide pendants containing arginine or lysine form the most efficient adsorbents for bilirubin in aqueous buffer solution. Studies of the adsorption of bilirubin from bilirubin solutions containing bovine serum albumin as well as studies of desorption of bilirubin from the resins by bovine serum albumin indicates that some resins containing arginine in the pendants can successfully compete with albumin. Stoichiometric binding constants obtained for the polyamide resins by the method of Klotz are of the order of 1 x 10('3) M('-1) to 86 x 10('3) M('-1). These binding constants are lower than that of the reported values for the first binding site of bilirubin on albumin by a factor of 10('1) to 10('4) and lower by a factor of 10 to 10('3) than the values reported for the second binding site.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jc15j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d40s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Bilirubin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adsorption.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pr073"><dcterms:title>Synthesis and physical properties of styrene-vinylpyridinium ionomers of various architectures</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gauthier, Sylvie, 1955-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Styrene-4-vinylpyridinium ionomers of different architectures, random and ABA blocks, were synthesized and their thermal and dynamic mechanical properties investigated. The Tg's of the random ionomers were found to increase regularly with increasing ion content, at a rate of about 3.5(DEGREES)C per mole % of ions. In contrast with other ionomeric systems studied before, however, these materials showed only one peak in their tan delta curves, associated with the Tg of the matrix. The absence of a second, high temperature peak suggests the absence of clusters in these vinylpyridinium ionomers, at least at temperatures above their Tg. The storage modulus curves were in agreement with this conclusion. An elaborate polymerization line was constructed for the production of the block copolymers by living anionic polymerization; a basic design was modified considerably and two new units were completely designed in this laboratory. Only one Tg, associated with the Tg of the polystyrene phase, was observed in DSC measurements for the resulting ionomers. The glass transition of the ionic domains was detected in dynamic mechanical measurements as a shoulder on the low temperature side of the polystyrene transition. This unexpected low value for the Tg of the ionic domains was attributed to plasticization by water.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m731k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pr073</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ionomers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers -- Thermal properties.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers -- Mechanical properties.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655h44d"><dcterms:title>Electrochemical preconcentration and separation for elemental analysis using an inductively coupled plasma for atomic emission spectrometry with a direct sample insertion device</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Habib, Magdi Maurice.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The application of controlled potential electrolysis for the elemental analysis by the inductively coupled plasma for atomic emission spectrometry using a direct sample insertion device will be described.

The former rate is controlled by the "boundary conditions" defined by the physical system, while the latter rate depends on the chemical and physical properties of the combustible mixture. The fractional increase (xi) in the area of the post-shock "stream tube", evaluated over a chemical kinetic distance equal to the cell length, has been identified as a parameter which satisfactorily characterizes the competition between these two rate processes. For (xi) less than about 20%, the chemical processes survive the gasdynamic expansion and self-sustained propagation is possible. However, under these "supercritical" conditions, the wave propagates with a velocity deficit which appears to be a universal and theoretically predictable function of (xi). For (xi) greater than 20%, the shock/reaction zone coupling breaks down, resulting in failure of the wave. The "critical" conditions for the propagation of detonation waves subjects to a wide range of expansion inducing mechanisms, including viscous boundary layers, compressible boundary gases and yielding walls, are all found to be consistent with the 20% criterion. However, the criterion becomes inapplicable as the cell size approaches the characteristic transverse dimension of the geometry. In the case of direct initiation or transmission of detonation from one geometry to another, the critical conditions are shown to be linked to the requirement for the diverging wave to exceed some minimum radius of curvature. Such radius is geometry dependent and satisfies the stream tube criterion. The role of the "initial conditions" in this type of problem is to guarantee survival of the wave until it achieves the minimum radius for which shock/reaction zone coupling, and hence self-substance, are possible.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr15s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx80q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Combustion gases.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gas dynamics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Detonation waves.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A12579t005"><dcterms:title>Queues and packet multiplexing networks</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shalmon, Michael S.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis has to do with certain fundamental queues that are well established as models for delay in simple packet-switching concentrators and networks. We first revisit the single server queue with Poisson arrivals and general independent service times. We then work out a complete delay analysis for a traffic concentrating tandem network of queues with deterministic service and batch Poisson sources connected to every node; this is the most comprehensive analysis available for a network which is not of Jackson type. We also show how to (partially) extend the analysis to a concentrating tree network, and to an arrival process somewhat more general that batch Poisson. The two parts of the thesis have a close methodological relationship. Our contribution in both cases is to rederive certain known results, and to produce a variety of new ones, using techniques that are essentially qualitative. Our particular view of the stochastic processes in question is guided by a very special queue discipline, namely Last Come First Served preemptive resume; by identifying certain structural features of the sample paths, one can read, almost without calculation, a host of statistics of common interest. The LCFS preemptive resume discipline also enables us: (i) to strengthen the connection between the single server queue with general independent service times and interarrival times, and the fluctuation theory of random walks; (ii) to strengthen the connection between the queue with Poisson arrivals and branching processes.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf74n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t005</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Packet switching (Data transmission)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Queuing theory.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1z40kt59z"><dcterms:title>Revivalism in central Canadian Wesleyan Methodism, 1824-1860</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Samms, Robert Oswald Anthony.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three significant theories have been advanced to explain the development of 19th century Canadian Church history: frontierism, metropolitanism and the church-sect typology. Consequently, the conclusion is that revivalism in Central Canada began to decline with the disappearance of the frontier from about 1820 or with the emergence of a complex society. For example, S. D. Clark suggested that the British Methodist organization had a profound influence on the Canadian Wesleyan Methodists, thereby resulting in the development of a sophisticated Methodist organization in Central Canada after 1832 and the decline of revivals. No detailed studies of revivalism in Central Canada have been made for the period from 1830 to 1860. By studying the Wesleyan Methodist Church during the period delineated, this thesis demonstrates that the revival movement in Central Canada survived until at least 1860. Its success was determined more by Methodist preaching, programmes and doctrine than by any external factors.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773w401.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kt59z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>United Church of Canada -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Revivals -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Methodist Church (Canada)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2227mq56p"><dcterms:title>Parton picture of soft pp and p̄p reactions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1985</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>L'Heureux, Pierre</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>We study a model for inclusive central particle production in pp and pp reactions based on parton model concepts and lowest-order QCD.

Agreement with experimental data is found to be good. This first model is then embedded (providing energy dependence) in a two-component eikonal model used to study elastic diffraction and unifying parton model and impact parameter formulations. We discuss the inclusion of a real part for the elastic amplitude, the removal of multiple diffraction zeros and the behavior of this second model up to the multi-TeV energy range (the Froissart bound is not saturated).

Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were an extension of that work using simultaneous synthesized vowels. They investigated (a) the effects of using vowels with gliding F(,0)s, and (b) the effects of using crossing versus parallel glides. The results indicated that perceptual separation was better when the mixture contained gliding vowels than when it contained steady state ones. In addition, it was found that the separation effect was even stronger when the glides were crossing as compared to being parallel. Experiment 4 investigated the role of formant peaks in vowel identification by employing a vowel mixed with a simultaneous pulse train masker. It was found that the vowel was better identified when the masker was a gliding pulse train as compared to a steady state one. In Experiments 5, 6, and 7 mixtures of unfiltered and filtered (high- and low-pass) pulse trains were used with steady state and gliding F(,0)s and different F(,0) separations. The results indicated that increased F(,0) differences and the use of glides facilitate the perceptual separation of simultaneous sounds. The superior effect of the crossing glides can be explained in terms of the common frequency modulation of the harmonics in each subset (component of the mixture) and the subsequent decorrelation of the harmonics in the two subsets. The type of filtering used had no apparent effect indicating that separation was possible for high-pass filtered pulse trains, probably based on periodicity (timing) information. These findings were discussed in terms of mechanisms of processing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd144.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc384</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Vowels.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Auditory perception.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795850x"><dcterms:title>The skill pool effects : the implications of individual differences and producer-scrounger roles in feral pigeons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1984</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Giraldeau, Luc-Alain.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When different foraging specialists in a homospecific group have the option of joining each other's food discoveries, a skill pool may be established.

Urban pigeons show marked individual variation in daily feeding site use patterns and food preferences. Two aviary experiments on a captive flock of C. livia show that pigeons also have the second prerequisite of skill pools, exchangeable producer-scrounger roles. Different individuals adopt producer or scrounger roles depending on patch type and flock composition when given four different food discovery tasks. Scrounging increases an individual's tendency to associate with producers, while simultaneously inhibiting observational learning of the food finding technique.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r436.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795850x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Pigeons -- Behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pigeons -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning in animals.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
