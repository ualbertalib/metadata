Within 2 research studies, 3 questions were addressed. A study of 98 midlife men and women pursued (1) the relationship between generative concerns and 4 indicators of adjustment, positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and work satisfaction, and (2) the role of agency and communion as predictors of generative concerns, with attention to sex differences in these predictive roles. A study of 75 largely pre-midlife women and men provided a conceptual replication of the results of the first study, while also addressing a third question: (3) the role of age effects in the experience of generativity. Together, these studies provided evidence of a relationship between generative concerns and 2 adjustment variables, positive affect and work satisfaction. Evidence in favor of an additive model, in which agency and communion served as independent predictors of generative concerns, was also obtained. As well, there was modest evidence of sex differences, such that agency variables were more significant predictors of generativity for women and communion variables were more significant predictors for men. No evidence of an age effect in predicting generative concerns was found; in fact, all of the findings appear to be applicable to a pre-midlife sample as well as a midlife one. However, some interesting trends for age interactions were found. The research points to an association between generativity and adjustment. It also provides moderate support for an additive model predicting generative concerns with agency and communion. The importance of attending to possible sex differences in this predictive relationship is also illustrated.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zuroff, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440v02x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g898s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adulthood -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7p88cj143"><dcterms:title>Melting and crystallization in poly(b-hydroxyalkanoate) blends</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pearce, Robert, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Crystallization and melting are investigated in blends involving bacterial poly($ beta$-hydroxyalkanoates), PHA's.

The ratio of nucleation constants for the two regimes, K$ rm sb g sp{III}$/K$ rm sb g sp{II}$, is found to deviate from the theoretical value of 2.0 in the blend system. Equilibrium melting points are measured for the isotactic component and are found to be depressed by the atactic component. The Nishi-Wang equation is used to obtain an interaction parameter, $ chi sb{12}.$ Multiple melting of isotactic PHB is reported and analyzed. It is shown that a melt/recrystallization process is operative and a model is proposed to explain the melting behaviour in terms of recrystallization and annealing effects. Crystallization kinetics of bacterial PHV are analyzed using the Lauritzen-Hoffman model. Crystallization is shown to occur in regime II.

The focus of this work is on a CVFEM for the prediction of multidimensional radiation heat transfer in participating media, and the amalgamation of this method with available CVFEMs, and their extensions, for conduction and convection heat transfer. In the proposed CVFEM, the calculation domain is divided into two-node linear, three-node triangular, and four-node tetrahedral finite elements in one, two, and three dimensions, respectively. Each element is further subdivided in such a way that upon assembly of all elements, complete control volumes are formed about each node in the calculation domain. To account for the directional nature of radiation heat transfer, a spherical envelope, surrounding each node in the calculation domain, is discretized into adjacent non-overlapping solid angles. Two different schemes for the interpolation of dependent variables in the approximation of the convective fluxes, across control-volume surfaces, are investigated. The intensity of radiation in any given direction is interpolated within each element using a scheme based on a particular solution of the one-dimensional radiative transfer equation (RTE). Appropriate conservation laws are imposed on the control volumes associated with the nodes. The resulting sets of integral conservation equations are then approximated by algebraic discretization equations, using the previously-mentioned interpolation functions. These nonlinear, coupled, algebraic equations are solved by a sequential solution procedure which incorporates Picard iterations. The suggested method has been implemented into computer programs, and used to solve several test problems. These include convection-diffusion problems, radiation heat transfer problems, and combined conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer problems, in one, two, and three dimensions. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed CVFEM to accurately solve the mathematical model used in this thesis. The proposed CVFEM has been applied successfully to radiation heat transfer in homogeneous gray media bounded by gray-diffuse walls. However, the gray and the above-mentioned isotropic conditions can be relaxed using a band model and anisotropic phase-functions. This is suggested as a possible extension of the CVFEM put forward in this thesis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baliga, B. R.

Using a monoclonal antibody (designated MAb 1A1) raised against purified neonatal rat astrocytes, I have characterized some of the in vitro functional and biochemical properties of a potentially novel cell surface molecule. By indirect immunofluorescence, the antibody labels subpopulations of astrocytes (flat type-1 astrocytes and Bergmann glia) and cells derived from the mesenchyme (leptomeninges and fibroblasts). The latter showed 1A1$ sp{+}$ immunoreactivity only when grown to confluency. Cell-cell contact and extracellular matrix molecules were found to play a role in the regulation of 1A1 antigen expression on leptomeninges. 1A1 Fab fragments inhibited the binding of neuron to astrocyte and astrocyte to astrocyte, but not of neuron to neuron in an in vitro adhesion assay, thus indicating that this surface antigen may function as a cell adhesion molecule on astrocytes. Addition of Fab fragments of MAb 1A1 also reduced leptomeningeal cell adhesion. Further functional antibody perturbation experiments indicated that this surface molecule mediates neurite outgrowth on astrocytes and neuronal migration on Bergmann glia via a heterophilic-binding mechanism. Both immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical analysis showed the timing of 1A1 antigen expression in postnatal rat cerebellum to coincide with the developmental period of granule cell migration along Bergmann glia. On SDS-PAGE, the immunopurified 1A1 surface molecule migrated as a single molecular weight band of $ approx$135 kd and appeared to be poorly glycosylated. Based on its unique cell-type distribution, functional properties and biochemical analysis, this 135 kd glycoprotein is likely to be distinct from other known cell adhesion molecules expressed on astrocytes.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>David, S.

The physiological role of ANF was investigated by generating transgenic mice (designated MT/ANF) that overexpress ANF in the circulation as well as at several ectopic sites, most notably in the pituitary and adrenal glands. Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in MT/ANF mice, but was not accompanied by any changes in heart rate, hematocrit, body weight, water or food intake, urine output, or sodium or potassium excretion. The decreased blood pressure of transgenic mice therefore appears to be independent of the effects of ANF to elicit natriuresis and diuresis. Rather, the hypotensive phenotype was associated with a suppression of adrenocortical function, as evidenced by decreased circulating aldosterone and corticosterone levels, reduced adrenal steroidogenic enzyme expression, and atrophy of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal insufficiency was also reflected in an elevated urinary sodium to potassium excretion ratio. Decreased adrenocortical activity did not result from pituitary effects of ANF, as plasma adrenocorticotropin and pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA levels were increased in transgenic animals. The circulating renin-angiotensin system and hypothalamic vasopressin expression remained unchanged in transgenic mice. These findings support the conclusion that decreased adrenocortical activity in MT/ANF mice is the result of a direct effect of ANF on the adrenal gland. Therefore, these transgenic animals constitute a model for primary adrenal insufficiency associated with hypotension, and demonstrate a novel manner in which ANF can participate in the chronic regulation of blood pressure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Drouin, Jacques (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n0099.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t07f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6h440v04g"><dcterms:title>Economic policy and the transition from authoritarian rule in the Philippines : an examination of the privatization of government corporations</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mendoza, Roger Lee</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This is a study about the political economy of redemocratization in less developed countries (LDCs).

It does so by adopting an expanded version of theories of rent-seeking to explain choices and implementation of privatization policies. The study challenges most works on privatization which primarily attribute slow progress to economic constraints. Instead, it argues that reformist pressures and implementation barriers obtain from explicit calculations of material and political gain by rent-seeking groups. Private and state-based rentiers significantly determine the substantive content as well as the timing and direction of policy reforms, when they are politically valued by fledgling and beleaguered democratic regimes. But rentierism also multiplies under a democratic regime that seeks to end the economic excesses of one-man rule by re-establishing the primacy of business enterprise. The study suggests that the greater challenge to LDCs is to widen public access to state resources and enhance competitive prowess.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sabeth, Filippo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s38s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v04g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Privatization -- Philippines</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philippines -- Economic policy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar781wh52j"><dcterms:title>Krebs Schreiben : Krebserkrankungen in der deutschsprachigen Literatur der siebziger und achtziger Jahre</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moamai, Marion.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the 1960's, cancer became one of the dominating diseases of our time and this has, in the last two decades, been increasingly reflected in German literature.

First, a brief outline of the literary and social context attempts to answer questions concerning the production and reception of this 'cancer literature'. The following thematic analysis examines the role of cancer as a signifier. It shows that endo- and exogenic conceptions of the disease are present, and that mood changes of the afflicted person determine the meanings that are attributed to it. The ways cancer affects the social and bodily identity and different aspects of treatment are analyzed next. Finally, a chapter is devoted to the aesthetics of cancer, examining the metaphors used to describe the disease and the rhetorical means to represent the anxiety that accompanies it.

Addition of iron decreases DAS and affects eutectic silicon particle size as nucleation and growth of silicon crystals takes place on the $ beta$-AlFeSi platelets, thus minimizing isothermal dendrite arm coarsening at the eutectic temperature. Increase of iron also increases the size and volume percent of the iron bearing intermetallics. In the absence of manganese, the iron intermetallics crystallize in the $ beta$-phase, at all cooling rates ranging from 0.1 to 20$ sp circ$C/s when cast from a normal casting temperature of 750$ sp circ$C. In the presence of manganese, the iron intermetallic crystallizes in $ alpha$-phase at low cooling rates and in both the $ alpha$- and $ beta$-phases at high cooling rates. This reverse crystallization behaviour is explained based on the segregation effect displayed by the phase diagram. When the melt is superheated to a high temperature (about 200 to 300 degrees above the liquidus temperature), the iron intermetallic crystallizes in the $ alpha$-phase at high cooling rates. This behaviour is attributed to the fact that $ gamma$-alumina which forms at low melt temperatures ($ le$750$ sp circ$C) acts as a nucleus for crystallization of $ beta$-phase. When the melt is superheated to a high temperature ($ ge$850$ sp circ$C), the $ gamma$-alumina transforms to $ alpha$-alumina. The $ alpha$-alumina is found to be a poor nucleus for the $ beta$-phase crystallization, and as a result the $ alpha$-phase forms. The importance of nucleation and growth undercooling for the crystallization of iron intermetallics is highlighted. Investigation of the dissolution behaviour of the iron intermetallics on non-equilibrium heat treatment indicates that the $ beta$-phase platelets dissolve slowly through concurrent fragmentation and then dissolution at the plate tips. Addition of manganese hinders the dissolution of iron intermetallics. The amount of liquid phase formed during non-equilibrium heat treatment increases dramatically once a critical temperature is exceeded. This critical temperature is estimated to be 520 and 515$ sp circ$C for samples initially solidified at 10 and 15$ sp circ$C/s respectively. The 0.15% Fe alloy exhibits the highest tensile strength and percent elongation compared to 1.0% Fe and 1.0% Fe + 0.5% Mn alloys under as-cast and equilibrium heat treated conditions. However, under non-equilibrium heat treatment conditions, ie., 30 degrees above the T4 equilibrium solution temperature, the strength properties of 1.0% Fe alloy exceed, or at least equal, that of the equilibrium heat treated 0.15% Fe alloy. An attempt is made to correlate the iron intermetallics present in the microstructure and mechanical properties with the associated fracture mode in this alloy.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gruzleski, J.

During the last 10 years, the use of microcomputer-based environmental control systems has become commonplace. However, to take full advantage of this computerization of the control process, it is not enough only to program the control functions that are performed by normal analog equipment. New and better control strategies must be developed. Recent advances in computer technology have made possible the development of expert systems; a branch of artificial intelligence. One of the advantages of developing such a system is that it provides a reasoning tool which approaches the level of proficiency human experts exhibit in that field. The application of new control methods using expert systems has been extensively demonstrated for greenhouse environments. However, the application of expert systems for the control of vegetable storage is still to be investigated. In the first phase of this project, the development and implementation of a sophisticated control software, using a conventional algorithm-based programming language, were achieved. Throughout the three years of experimentation in an industrial potato storage, the software proved to be appropriate for the control of storage environmental parameters (temperature and relative humidity). During the second phase, the application of an expert system for the on-line control of potato storage was explored. The development of a rule-based expert system, that could replace the conventional algorithm-based control routines was achieved.

Carbohydrate restriction induced maternal metabolic adaptations that were proportional to the severity of the glucose restriction. Placental growth and composition as well as mammary gland composition were not affected by dietary glucose restriction, whereas fetal growth and development and milk composition were significantly impaired when glucose was limited in the maternal diet. This suggests that the effects of dietary glucose on the fetus and on milk composition were not mediated by changes in placenta and mammary gland DNA, protein or glycogen concentrations. Complete dietary glucose restriction significantly depressed fetal liver, lung and heart glycogen concentrations; repletion of the maternal diets with 12 and 24% glucose restored cardiac glycogen to normal but not fetal lung glycogen and liver glycogen. Pups born to dams fed a glucose-free diet failed to survive longer than 24 h postpartum and that was associated with the low levels of tissue glycogen at birth in these pups. At birth, lung and liver glycogen concentration of pups of the 12 and 24% glucose diets was similar to pups of the control diet despite the fact that these reserves were depressed in utero; and these pups efficiently corrected the transient hypoglycemia observed following parturition. The effects of glucose restriction on fetal liver glycogen were not reflected by similar changes in fetal plasma insulin, glucagon and glucose levels or in glycogen synthase and phosphorylase activities.

The onset of the response of lung tissue resistance and elastance demonstrated a different time course than airway resistance. This was interpreted in terms of the sequential delivery of the drug first through the pulmonary and then the bronchial circulations. The time course of respiratory mechanical parameters among various alveolar capsules revealed two patterns of inhomogeneity development. The first one was random whereas the second one was progressive with dose. A mathematical derivation elucidated the negative tissue resistance frequently obtained at high levels of constriction. The time courses of respiratory resistance and elastance during bronchoconstriction were transient and scaled with dose.

All of the above mentioned methodologies for planning and operation involve simulation programs which require the solution of numerous sets of simultaneous linear equations, Ax = b, whose coefficient matrices are in general very large and sparse. The main part of the computational effort involved in these algorithms is dedicated to solving such systems of linear equations. This thesis investigates the properties of the coefficient matrix A that arises in power system analysis, as well as the application of more efficient alternative solution techniques for Ax = b which exploit these special properties. In particular, in this thesis, pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods have been applied and extensively tested for the first time to the solution of systems of linear equations arising in many power system operations and planning tasks. In this vein, first, it is theoretically proven that some important power network coefficient matrices are positive definite and comply with the requirements for the convergence of the PCG method. The PCG algorithm is then applied to the Fast Decoupled load flow and to the DC load flow. Its performance is numerically compared with a Frontal band-width direct solver (Frontal solver) as well as with a Sparspak solver (B5) with minimum degree ordering. The experimental results are based on a wide spectrum of power networks up to 5000 buses and about 10000 lines for two different types of networks: grid-type networks and star-type networks. These results demonstrate that the PCG method is clearly superior to direct solvers for certain types of large power networks. The performance of the PCG solver within other load flow algorithms is also numerically investigated. A detailed investigation into the eigenvalue clustering effect of alternative pre-conditioners which utilize the intrinsic properties of power networks is also presented. In addition, the effect of their eigenvalue clusterings on the convergence of the PCG algorithm is analyzed and compared with that of the classical incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioner. Furthermore, the usefulness of the PCG solvers is investigated for complex or indefinite power network matrices. A modified PCG method was applied to the IEEE test networks as well as to large synthetically generated networks (up to 6500 buses and 13000 lines) for the solution of systems of equations Y x = b, where Y is the complex admittance matrix. Comparison with direct solvers is provided. Finally, a new technique is developed to synthetically generate realistic data sets which characterize power networks of arbitrary size and complexity. While these networks are randomly generated, the software allows the user to specify the system dimension, type of network, connectivity configurations and other network characteristics. This software was developed to overcome the difficulties associated with the collection of network data, especially for large scale systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Galiana, F. D.

Traditionally used by men, irony is gradually becoming more widespread in women's writing, which in itself is an interesting reversal: more often "objects" of irony, women now reverse the rules of the game and become ironizing "subjects". The first part of the thesis investigates explicit irony; that is, irony which is duly identified and already decoded for the reader; for example, the author might emphasize an ironic fate or destiny for her characters, or might invest a character with an attitude, a smile, or remarks that are ironic. Explicit irony most often appears in works published during the first decade of our corpus; use of this form of irony constitutes a critical initial phase in women's writing because it enabled women authors to learn about the resources of irony and employ them in their work. Explicit irony, therefore, operates within the text and requires minimal competence in the reader for its decoding; the decoding of the text will play a central role in implicit irony, which will be focus of part two of the thesis. Implicit irony manifests itself in the text in three principal forms: rhetorical, structural, and chromosomic. Rhetorical irony emerges from knowledge of the language and requires the reader to identify occurrences of antiphrases, innuendoes, metaphors, and other types of word-games in the text; structural irony depends upon the inner-workings of the text and demands an aptitude for discerning instances of parody, structural paradox, or intertextuality; that form of irony which we have named chromosomic requires a specific decoding that is effected in function of the author's feminine gender. Following part two, which highlights the reader's role in the process of interpreting irony, the third and final part reveals the principal targets of irony in these women's writings. This tableau of "victims" completes our study by identifying the types of persons, institutions, or ideas that provoke the criticism of women writers. Such a broad range of types, comprising the clergy, education, the family, and foreigners, among others, tends to point toward a common denominator: Power. The authors scrutinize power relationships in all their forms; inspired by their "collective destiny", that persists, even today, in excluding them from positions of decision-making, women now propose a different vision of the world. Irony in the feminine permits an original reading of their struggle and their demands.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chapdelaine, Annick (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732db47k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r67d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Irony in literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women novelists, French-Canadian -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>French-Canadian fiction -- History and criticism</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px57h"><dcterms:title>Neuromodulatory effects of cholecystokinin on supraoptic neurons</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jarvis, Cathryn R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is co-localized within oxytocin- and vasopressin-secreting magnocellular neurons in supraoptic, paraventricular, and accessory nuclei of the hypothalamus. These magnocellular nuclei are also prominent binding sites for CCK. Although the site of action remains to be determined, intracerebroventricular injection of CCK promotes a rise in plasma vasopressin. The present study evaluates the effect of CCK on the function of rat supraoptic magnocellular neurosecretory neurons. Extracellular recordings in vivo demonstrate that locally applied CCK excites both oxytocin- and vasopressin-secreting neurons. Intracellular recordings in superfused hypothalamic explants, reveal that CCK depolarizes a majority of magnocellular neurons. This response persists after synaptic blockade, indicating a direct activation of postsynaptic CCK receptors. Pharmacological tests identify the presence of CCK-B receptors. Voltage clamp analyses reveal that CCK evokes an inward current, accompanied by an increase in membrane conductance. E$ sb{ rm CCK}$ approximates $-$15 mV, suggesting activation of a non-selective cationic conductance. Activation of this conductance may also modulate the expression of other intrinsic currents. In perfused hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal explants, CCK was found to evoke the secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin from the neurointermediate lobe, through an action at the supraoptic nucleus. These results suggest that CCK may function as an excitatory neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bourque, Charles W.

The comprehensive hospital discharge database of the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services was used to derive daily counts of hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses, and for certain non-respiratory illnesses not expected to be related to air pollution levels. The reliability of this database was assessed by reviewing 1,270 hospital discharges. Routinely monitored independent variables, derived from various government databases, included temperature, relative humidity, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, coefficient of haze, and measures of particulate pollution, several of which were recorded only every sixth day. To permit a daily time series analysis, levels for the missing 5 days were modelled using meteorologic and other pollutant variables. To control for confounding by season, the dependent and independent time series were detrended using a weighted 19-day moving average linear filter. To control for confounding by day-of-week cycles, the dependent series were pre-filtered with day-of-week indicator variables. For the July to August periods, statistically significant relationships were shown for all respiratory admissions to 8-hour maximal average ozone levels 4 days prior to the admission day, relationships which were however confounded by temperature of the same lag day. After controlling for temperature, admissions for asthma, and for respiratory illnesses other than asthma, were significantly associated with particulate levels 2 to 4 days prior to the admission day for the warm but not the cold periods. Stronger associations were found using a filter which did not remove month-to-month temporal trends. A significant correlation of non respiratory admissions to particulate levels on the day of admission was confounded by temperature and relative humidity. These results suggest that particulate air pollution, possibly acidic, during photochemically active periods is related to respiratory morbidity in Montreal. The effects shown, at levels mostly below current ambient air quality standards in North America, are relevant to public health, since hospital admissions are likely to reflect more frequent episodes of less serious illness.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Becklake, Margaret R.

Compared to the first order solutions and the inconsistent second order solutions, the second order solutions of the present study provide better predictions of the numerical simulation results. (ii) Granular shear flows within narrow gaps and unbounded fields are studied by a molecular dynamics type discrete element simulation method. The effects of inelasticity and mean solids fraction on the distributions of granular temperatures, solids fractions and number densities of particle centers, and local mean velocities are examined. The slip velocities of bounded shear flows are calculated and the results are compared with the predictions of existing theories. (iii) Granular self-diffusion is investigated through both a kinetic theory and numerical simulation approaches by employing the time correlation function expression to determine the diffusion coefficient. The theoretical predictions agree very well with the simulation results for smooth particles at low concentrations, but at high concentrations the kinetic theory diffusion coefficients are lower than those determined in the computer simulations. The surface friction effect is examined numerically, and it is found that rough particles are less diffusive than smooth ones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Savage, S. B.

In open chested dogs lung elastance (E$ sb{ rm L}$) increased and lung resistance (R$ sb{ rm L}$) changed little with decreases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of the ventilatory circuit. The dominance of plastoelastic lung tissue properties at low lung volumes was used to interpret the lack of change in R$ sb{ rm L}$. Computed tomography demonstrated that pleural effusion (PE) created atelectasis in dependent caudal lung regions which contributed to the overall lung volume loss. PE produced a decrease in only lung vertical height while chest wall dimensions changed both vertically and horizontally. E$ sb{ rm L}$ and R$ sb{ rm L}$ increased while elastance and resistance of the chest wall were little affected by these shape and density changes. In close-chested, anesthetised, paralysed, ventilated humans a decrease in PEEP below normal FRC caused an increase in R$ sb{ rm L}$, E$ sb{ rm L}$ and both chest wall elastance and resistance. Median sternotomy caused E$ sb{ rm L}$ to increase with increasing PEEP while the negative volume dependence of R$ sb{ rm L}$ remained. Most of the difference between open-chested and closed-chested E$ sb{ rm L}$ was presumably due to lung collapse in the open-chested state.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bates, J. H. T.

During the course of this work, a general three-dimensional parabolic heat flow model was developed for casters of arbitrarily shaped mould using a body-fitted coordinate transformation technique. The heat flow model was specifically applied to a beam blank caster as well as to an industrial slab caster of regular rectangular cross section, so as to analyze solidification within casters. Furthermore, a fully coupled turbulent flow and solidification model was developed to describe the turbulent transport processes in the upper part of a steel slab caster as well as to evaluate the process variables affecting the casting. Solidification modelling was carried out using a fixed grid enthalpy method while the mushy zone was modelled based on a Darcy-porosity approach. A modified low-Reynolds number version of the $ kappa$-$ epsilon$ model of turbulence was employed to calculate eddy viscosity within the liquid and mushy regions. A control volume based on finite difference method was used to solve the transport equations, wherein a SIMPLER algorithm was adopted to resolve the velocity-pressure coupling in the momentum equations. In order to verify the turbulent flow model, a water modelling study was performed for fluid flow in the mould region of a slab caster. Reasonable agreement was obtained between the mathematical model's predictions, and water modelling experiments. Macrosegregation of carbon in a steel billet caster was also modelled based on a continuum formulation, in which the conservation equations are derived in terms of mixture dependent variables. The effect of turbulence on the transport of solute in the liquid and mushy regions was taken into account using the $ kappa$-$ epsilon$ model adopted in this work. Various parametric studies have been preformed on different casting systems, and their effects on temperature distributions and velocity fields within the strand, solidification profiles, and trajectories of inclusions were predicted. Typical predicted results of the models have been compared against the experimental measurements on operating casters reported in the literature and relatively good agreement was obtained.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Guthrie, R.

Of the techniques being evaluated for joining ceramics, brazing has been found to be the simplest and most promising method of fabricating both ceramic/ceramic and ceramic/metal joints. A key factor in ceramic brazing is wetting of the ceramic by the filler metal. This study deals with the application of brazing for the fabrication of $ rm Si sb3N sb4/Si sb3N sb4$ and $ rm Si sb3N sb4/Mo$ joints using Ni-Cr-Si brazing alloys based on AWS BNi-5 (Ni-18Cr-19Si atom%). Thermodynamic calculations were performed to predict wetting at $ rm Si sb3N sb4$/Ni-Cr-Si alloys interfaces. By using some simplifying assumptions and suitable scaling of the reaction, the model predicted that Ni-Cr-Si alloys with Ni/Cr = 3.5 and X$ sb{ rm Si}$ $&lt;$ 0.25 would react chemically with and wet $ rm Si sb3N sb4$. Good agreement was found between the theoretical calculations and experimental results. Brazing experiments were carried out to study the joinability of $ rm Si sb3N sb4$ with various Ni-Cr-Si filler metals which had already shown good wetting characteristics on $ rm Si sb3N sb4$. The $ rm Si sb3N sb4/Si sb3N sb4$ joints formed with a 10 atom% Si brazing alloy exhibited the highest strength ($ approx$120 MPa) which was mainly due to the presence of a CrN reaction layer at the ceramic/filler metal interface. The high temperature four-point bend strengths of $ rm Si sb3N sb4/Si sb3N sb4$ joints were markedly higher than the room temperature values. A high strength of about 220 MPa was achieved when the joints were tested at 900$ sp circ$C. From the results of the $ rm Si sb3N sb4/Mo$ joining experiments it was found that the joint quality and microstructure were strongly influenced by the composition of the filler metal and such brazing variables as time and temperature. Of all the $ rm Si sb3N sb4$/Mo joints, those made with the S10 brazing alloy at 1300$ sp circ$C for 1 min. exhibited the highest strength of 55 MPa. Finally, in all the cases, the shear strength of all the joints was found to be lower than their four-point bend values.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Drew, R. A. L.

This research quantifies the impact of activity decentralization on road infrastructure requirements by super district and facility type. The Supply Demand Linkage Model or 'SDLM', for a case study, relates the independent variable demand in passenger trips to the dependent variable the mean of traffic density in vehicles per kilometre. It is an aggregate travel demand model developed using a quasi experimental approach. This is accomplished through: (1) Extensive cross sectional analyses. (2) Calibration and validation of a travel demand model (EMME/2) requiring a large data base. (3) Variations in trip demand are implemented, using EMME/2, and the corresponding traffic densities are computed by super district and facility type. (4) Multivariate analyses relating supply-demand measures were implemented and produced the SDLM models which replace the trip assignment stage of travel demand models and compliments UTMS models at the sketch planning level. (5) Sensitivity analysis testing SDLM reliability against the EMME/2. (6) Application of the SDLM models through forecasting scenarios of employment and population to obtain the "Impact of employment decentralization in metropolitan road networks". The multivariate analyses showed that variations in demand could explain 99.61% of the variations in traffic density at a 95% confidence level. And the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the SDLM results are within 5% of actual values. The SDLM models may not be transportable but the established procedure is expected to be transportable. The impact analyses has quantified the changes in travel pattern resulting from activity dispersion. This simplified procedure, transforms the SDLM models into a powerful tool.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rice, R. G.
