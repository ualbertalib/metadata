The Gray horizontal engine is of the 4 Cycle single acting type and has a single cylinder. It is fitted with a reciprocating fuel pump, which forces the gasoline into the ordinary type or jet carburettor. The pump action is determined by a shaft governor, which has a range of from 200 to 400 R.P.M's., but is very erratic at the lower speeds. When the speed rises above that for which the governor is set, the exhaust valve is held open, and the automatic inlet valve remains closed and by a system of levers, the pump is prevented from delivering its charge.

We shall approach the problem of suggestion first on most familiar and commonplace ground, and, at the risk of being called a borrower, adopt Adams' method of searching the dictionary.

Investigation showed many interesting and unusual features in the morphology of the insect and so the entire anatomy was chosen as the subject for this thesis.  The field is a wide one, and it has not been found possible to follow out all points in full detail in the time available, with only preserved material with which to work. If there appears to be a hesitancy and uncertainty in describing certain structures, it must be borne in mind that the body of this insect is only 2.5 m.m. long, so that the individual organs and sclerites are in most cases extremely minute,  rendering the work of dissection very delicate and trying.  The writer hopes to follow up those points which have only been lightly touched upon, extending the field of investigation to related species, with the object of producing a more complete and valuable piece of work.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Willey, A. &amp; Ruttan, R.
