Much emphasis, probably too much, has been placed upon the unnatural childhood enforced by the Puritan way of life. In the years of colonial dependence, Calvin's theory of the persistence of the Original Sin was widely accepted in New England. According to this doctrine, children who died young, unless they were in a state of especial grace, were most certainly doomed. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacMillan, C.

Bordeaux et Bazin, par exemple, avaient présenté le type traditionnel de la famille, et Bourget avait plaidé pour le maintien de la famille traditionnelle. Depuis la guerre, on s'est préoccupé de la famille, non plus pour savoir ce qu'elle devrait être, mais simplement comme un objet d'analyse: on veut savoir ce qu'elle est: en quoi est-elle différente de la famille du siècle dernier? quelle demeure son influence sur l'enfant, l'adolescent? que fait-elle de l'individu? quelles sont les relations des individus entre eux à l'intérieur du groupe familial? Bien des auteurs contemporains ont essayé de répondre à ces questions, d'où les oeuvres de Maurois, J Chardonne, J. de Lacretelle, Duhamel, Jean Cocteau, Julian Green, de François Mauriac pour n'en citer que quelques-uns.

The latter also studied the rocks of the Forillon intensively, and, using Logan's work as a basis, worked out in great detail the section of the limestones, both lithologically and paleontologically. It might have been expected that the section thus developed would serve for much or all of the Gaspe Peninsula. However, research during the last decade upon Devonian rocks immediately to the west has shown that there are wide variations in the lithology and thickness of the subdivisions of the Devonian rocks in the greater Gaspe region, and it has been obvious for several years, that a revaluation of Logan's and Clarke's sections must be made before the stratigraphy of neigbouring parts of Gaspe could be elucidated.

It is my aim, in the following chapters, to discuss the political theories which Byron held and to estimate the influence they had on Europe. To present a proper background, it has been necessary to paint a sketchy account of eighteenth-century Europe and a slightly more detailed one of Europe between the outbreak of the French Revolution and Byron's departure for Italy in 1816. In doing this, not only have the historical events been given, but those ideas which were formulating in the minds of the English witers, philosophers, and politicians of the Revolutionary period have also been incorporated. The main body of this study, however, is concerned with the political beliefs of Byron, and here I have turned almost exclusively to the pages of Byron's poetry and letters.

These ideas in fact illustrate the essential meanings of money, credit and value in the world today. By reference to them questions relating to the reform of money and of banking acquire a special significance. When Port Royal was captured (1710) and Nova scotia ceded to Great Britain (1713) the garrison stationed there obtained its military supplies from New England by discounting sterling bills in Boston. In this way the money of New England became familiar to the first British inhabitants of Nova Scotia. The principal coins in circulation in New England were not English coins, but a hodge-podge of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian silver, the most important of which was the "Spanish dollar", - a coin which was in almost universal circulation throughout the western world.

In the course of world history, some periods can be found when the whole economy was conducted along barter lines, that being when goods are directly exchanged against other goods. But this system was found to be highly inconvenient, and the difficulty of measuring how many sheep were worth a cow, or how many pigs were worth a horse, often proved to be insuperable. The result was naturally that trade was harmed to a great extent. Eventually some particular form of goods which happened to be universally in demand came to be regarded as a standard of value and a medium of exchange. At first this medium of exchange differed from one country to another, and it may have been sea-shells, slaves, leather, cattle or any other object which was much appreciated. But it was found in due course that to be able to fulfil its role as a medium of exchange the object chosen should have some specific qualities, it should have a stable value, it should be homogeneous, easily divisible into parts, unalterable and should be easy to manipulate. The ideal was to find some object which had a high value and a small volume. Gold and silver, and to a lesser degree some other metals, appeared to have all these qualities, and as such they gradually came to be looked upon as the standard mediums of exchange.

The use of formic acid as an ozonization solvent has been developed, and its characteristics in this capacity demonstrated by experiments on organic compounds of known structure. For the first time direct chemical evidence has been demonstrated for the presence of a carbonyl group in the solubilization of lignin by aqueous bisulphites. A study of various lignins has produced evidence to show that the carbonyl group is associated with an hydroxyl group and that the presence of both these groups is necessary for the formation of lignin sulphonic acids.

Thus it includes the study of the physical properties of matter in its various forms, and the physical aspects of the interactions of matter, namely chemical statics and kinetics, corresponding to the statics and dynamics of physics. [...] Chemical statics and kinetics have developed to a considerable degree especially in recent years. Chemical statics or thermodynamics, being more susceptible of theoretical treatment has reached a much more satisfactory state than chemical kinetics, so that by making a few measurements and calculations we can now predict the equilibrium state of a reaction. The theory of the kinetics of reaction on the other hand is not in such a satisfactory condition, and we cannot yet predict even approximately the rate of a given reaction. [...] Thus it is evident that further knowledge of the mechanism of these reactions is highly desirable, from the point of view of both the physical chemist and the organic chemist. This knowledge is important to the physical chemist because of the obvious relation of the mechanism to the kinetics of reaction, and to the organic chemist because it appears that the whole question of the stability of organic compounds is merely one of the value of the unimolecular rate constant. It was with the purpose of increasing our knowledge of this field, that the present investigations were undertaken. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Steacie, E.

[...] Pyrroles seldom form salts with acids, and methiodides are practically unknown. Since dipyrroles form salts with one equivalent of acid, at least one of the nitrogen atoms must be different, hence one of the characteristic pyrrole linkages has disappeared. [...] Hydrogen atoms undergo a tautomeric shift is pyrroles, in that the usual reagents give derivatives of either possible form, i.e. HN02 gives ß-nitroso derivatives only, even with pyrrole itself; and acylating agents usually attack the carbon alpha to the nitrogen atom. The Grignard reagent should show the presence of two active hydrogen atoms, but the use of this reagent as a method for determining structure in pyrrole series is known to be unreliable. [...] From the examples cited, it seems evident that like any substance of the type HA pyrroles should add to the conjugated system of a second reactant. When there is nothing else present for the pyrrole to combine with, it should add to itself for it contains the necessary conjugated system. Since pyrroles can be kept unchanged for long periods of time, this tendency cannot be very great. [...] STEREOCHEMISTRY OF LINALOOL: For a long time it has been known that optically active straight chain secondary alcohols can be converted into optically active secondary halides. [...] More recently however Hughes, Ingold, and Masterman (3) have prepared halides of straight chain aliphatic secondary carbinols such as methylhexylcarbinol under a variety of conditions such as saturation with the dry gaseous hydrogen halides and treatment with thionyl halides. They found that there was always some racemization, for the activity of their halides varied with the method of conversion. The amounts of racemization varied from 50% to as little as 3%. [...] In order to avoid this complex type so bound up with possible free radical formation, an investigation was made of the simple optically active tertiary alcohols. As there were no methods for resolving them, natural substances had to be considered. Linalool seemed to be well adapted to this work as it was readily available in an optically active form and could be reduced to the simplest type of optically active tertiary-carbinol possible [...] l-linalool was first reduced to a saturated compound before conversion into its halide derivative. Complete reduction was possible in glacial acetic acid using Adams platinum catalyst. Several other methods were tried, but this was the only one which gave the desired result.

In view of this situation the use of rabbits as pilot animals for farm ruminants is suggested. A trial, comparing the digestive powers of steers and rabbits on pasture grass, is reported. The results show that in general rabbits do not digest the grass to the same extent as steers, the greatest difference showing in the crude fibre fraction. Nevertheless because of their uniform response in digestibility of pasture herbage and the ease with which they can be handled and fed in relatively large numbers, rabbits have certain merits which would justify their use as pilots for steers in nutritional studies of pasture herbage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crampton, E.

"What has a woman to do with dates?" she wrote in her Autobiography. "I mean to have none of them"(l). Her father, Robert MacOwen, "Anglice Owenson", an actor and director, well-known in Dublin theatrical circles of his time, was one of the MacOwens of Connaught. Her mother was Miss Jane Hill, "pious and prudent", daughter of a respectable burgess of the ancient city of Shrewsbury(2). Sydney seems to have been a precocious child, blessed with many talents. In 1788, under the name of the "Infant Prodigy" she appeared with her actor father in Castlebar, Sligo, and Athlone theatres and, according to all accounts, she played her small part very well. The death of her mother while they were still quite young left the two little girls, Sydney and Olivia, to their father's care, and, gay, careless and improvident, though he was, Robert Owenson proved an excellent father. He placed his two daughters in a good school and went without some of the necessities of life in order that they might have the best music teachers obtainable. Sydney made excellent use of her opportunities. She practised diligently at her music, piano, vocal, and harp; she studied to make herself perfect in French and read widely in every subject, even the science of the day.
