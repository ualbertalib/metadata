Each novel is distinguished by an interesting plot, truthful characterization, and natural dialogue. By a skilful combination of these elements she gave her writings a dramatic quality which tempts a reader to consider them as promising material for adaptation to the theatre. In each story a definite pattern may be pointed out in the development of the action. The pattern followed is that of a comedy which follows a natural order of beginning, middle, and end.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Files, H.

For analysis an idealized plate current-grid bias characteristic is used. The transient response of a 6 mc/sec. circuit to a 700 kc/sec. input was measured. Definite values of Gm and Eco can be obtained from measured Ip - Eg curves which give correlation between calculated and experimental transient response.

With the availability of radioactive isotopes, the problem was considerably simplified. In fact, if a steroidal hormone is made radioactive, it becomes a simple matter to determine its distribution in tissues and therefore much easier to obtain extracts indicative of its metabolic pathway.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Heard, R.

The theory is then extended to the case of wide beams separated by a finite distance. A special case of this theory is then considered, that of a wide pencil of two superimposed streams and the variation of signal amplification that may occur under suitable conditions is studied, as a function of beam width. The results indicate considerable discrepancies between the two theories in cases of narrow beams. As the width increases, however, the two cases tend asymptotically to a common value.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Woonton, G.

Au travers de l'application stricte des règles de preuve et des procédures pénalesaux témoins souffrant d'une déficience intellectuelle, le système de justice pénale perpétue parfois les inégalités et la discrimination à leur endroit. La capacité à témoigner et la crédibilité de cette catégorie bien particulière de témoins sont souvent contestées. Ces contestations sont le résultat d'une réaction inappropriée face à la différence, cette différence donnant lieu à la fausse impression que les personnes souffrant d'une déficience intellectuelle ne font pas des témoins fiables dans un tribunal. Utilisant la théorie de l'invalidité critique du handicap, qui conçoit le handicap comme le résultat du processus interactionnel entre une personne ayant une déficience et son environnement, ce texte soutient que la capacité à témoigner et la fiabilité d'un témoignage ne sont pas inhérents à la personne ayant une déficience. L'environnement, qui inclut notamment les règles de preuve et de procédure, joue également un rôle en rendant un témoin incompétent ou peu fiable. En tant que tel, il est ici soutenu qu'une possible réponse face à la différence réside en la modification de l'environnement afin de permettre au témoin de donner un témoignage efficace. Cette thèse identifie les dispositions spécifiques aux règles de preuve et de procédure pénale au Zimbabwe, en Afrique du Sud, au Botswana et en Namibie, qui perpétuent les inégalités et les discriminations au sein même du système judiciaire, restreignant ainsi l'accès à la justice. Le premier chapitre commence par explorer l'intersection entre le genre et le handicap au travers du prisme de la théorie critique sur l'incapacité. Il traite également de l'utilité d'une approche fondée sur les droits de la personne dans les affaires pénales. Le deuxième chapitre analyse dans quelle mesure les évaluations judiciaires visant à juger de la capacité d'un individu à témoigner reconnaissent adéquatement la capacité juridique du témoin souffrant d'une déficience intellectuelle. Le troisième chapitre traite quant à lui des méthodes pouvant aider les témoins souffrant d'une déficience intellectuelle à témoigner de manière efficace. Enfin, le quatrième chapitre traite des leçons que le Zimbabwe pourrait en tirer.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>This thesis examines the capacity to testify and access justice of witnesses with intellectual disabilities who have been sexually assaulted, focusing on the situation in Zimbabwe.  Witnesses with intellectual disabilities are undoubtedly different from other witnesses. Their ability to communicate verbally may not match that of other witnesses, and their behavior in the witness stand cannot be interpreted in the same way as that of other witnesses. Through the rigid application of rules of criminal evidence and procedure to witnesses with intellectual disabilities, the criminal justice system sometimes perpetuates inequality and discrimination. The testimonial competence and credibility of witnesses with intellectual disabilities are often challenged. This is a result of an inappropriate response to difference whereby difference gives rise to the misconception that persons with intellectual disabilities do not make reliable witnesses in court. Using critical disability theory's understanding of disability as resulting from the interactional process between a person with impairment and the environment, it is contended that incompetence to act as a witness and the reliability of a witness are not inherent in the individual with impairment. The environment, which includes the rules of evidence and procedure, also plays a part in making a witness incompetent or unreliable. As such, it is contended that one response to difference consists in the modification of the environment to enable the witness to give effective testimony.  This thesis identifies specific provisions in the rules of evidence and criminal procedure in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia which perpetuate inequality and discrimination in the justice system, thereby hindering access to justice.  Chapter one begins by exploring Critical Disability Theory and the intersection of gender and disability. It also discusses the utility of a human rights approach in criminal cases. Chapter two analyzes whether judicial assessments of testimonial competence adequately recognize the legal capacity of witnesses with intellectual disabilities. Chapter three addresses methods through which witnesses with intellectual disabilities may be accommodated to give effective testimony. Chapter four concludes by discussing the lessons that may be taken away for Zimbabwe. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Colleen Sheppard (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397c53j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x713w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Sciences - Law</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
