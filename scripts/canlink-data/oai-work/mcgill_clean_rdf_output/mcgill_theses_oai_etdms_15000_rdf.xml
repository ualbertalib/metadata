In this thesis, we study the changes the author made to both style and content at different stages of the writing of "Jeannot-la-Corneille", one of the recits making up Cet ete qui chantait. The latter is one of Roy's least studied books. Our analysis of the modifications the author made to the content and style of her texts allows us to understand the reasons behind these changes and gives us as well a sense of Gabrielle Roy's creative work. Admired for the apparent ease with which she writes, the author reworks her text tirelessly in order to achieve the desired effects: precision, accuracy and musicality. Adjectives, adverbs, nouns, all parts of speech are subject to change in this quest to improve descriptions and, in so doing, deliver more effectively a message of hope.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655k959.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bx833</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909-1983.

To locate my analysis of postcolonial works, I survey Orientalist productions of the Muslim woman by European travelers and certain Muslim reformists. I read these repressive constructions of the Muslim woman through the lens of postcolonial critique. While postcolonial discourses about Muslim women are frequently framed as a "corrective" to Orientalist accounts, they are often limited by a commitment to teleological conceptions of development. This is especially true of the discourse of "Islamic Feminism" in the works of Margot Badran and miriam cooke. Examining Badran's and cooke's conceptions of feminism and religiosity, I highlight the ways in which it re-inscribes particular Orientalist assumptions, and remains bound by its adherence to secular-liberal values, and teleological conceptions of modernity. These biases carry serious implications for future scholarship about Muslim women within the Western Academy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zr95d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj010</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Orientalism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Muslim women.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Postcolonialism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bm90s"><dcterms:title>Analysis of messages in adolescent girls' magazines : CosmoGirl vs. CosmoGirls</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chaparro, Lara I., 1977-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, I explore and critique the content of the fashion teen magazine CosmoGirl.

Drawing upon previous studies, and linking my findings to established theories, I analyze the possible relationship between the publication's content and the influence this media genre has on the social development of young women. My research findings show that CosmoGirl's portrayal of femininity is stereotypical, patriarchal and unrealistic and that such representation perpetuates negative and destructive feelings in young women.

Evaluation of the intervention in one community assessed changes in diet and health status in a random sample of households (n=47). Process indicators were also examined. Results from dietary assessments indicated increased (110%) provitamin A carotenoid intake; increased frequency of consumption of local banana (53%), giant swamp taro (475%), and local vegetables (130%); and increased diversity from LF.

The xenoantigen alpha-Gal has a highly analogous carbohydrate structure to the human blood group antigens, and both require memory B cell activation for antibody production. We hypothesize that B cells, reactive to the alpha-Gal xenoantigen and B blood group antigen, require the presence of fully activated T cells in order to survive and proliferate in vitro, contrary to the traditional theory that humoral response to carbohydrate antigens is a T cell-independent process. When we compared the capacity of B cells to proliferate, we observed that activated T cells were necessary for B cell proliferation even in the presence of carbohydrate-derived antigens. A relevant question was also to investigate the role of a specific class of T cells: the CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, in the activation of alpha-Gal and B blood group-reactive B cells. The iNKT cells have the specificity of being reactive to glycolipids and are capable of producing both T helper 1 and T helper 2 cytokine responses. We therefore wanted to determine the role of the iNKT cells as mediators of a T helper 2-type response when B cells were exposed to a glycolipid antigen expressing the alpha-Gal epitope or the human B blood group antigen. We observed that, if the interaction between B cells and iNKT cells is blocked, neither B cell proliferation nor antibody production occurs. These results suggest therefore the importance of the iNKT cell category of T helper cells in the response to alpha-Gal and ABO-blood group glycolipids.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d345p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30px31n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Swine.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transplantation, Heterologous.</dc:subject><dc:subject>ABO Blood-Group System -- immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood Group Incompatibility -- immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az316q508z"><dcterms:title>Use of special health care services by infants born extremely prematurely in the province of Quebec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Luu, Thuy-Mai.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>To compare health care use from neonatal discharge to 18 months corrected age of two groups of extremely preterm children (&lt; 26 vs. 26-29 weeks of gestation), we used a province-wide database containing neonatal and follow-up data on 254 infants (77% of survivors) born at &lt; 29 weeks of gestation and cared for at 3/6 neonatal units in Quebec in 2003-2004. Neonatal data were abstracted from medical records by trained personnel. At 18 months corrected age, neurodevelopmental status was assessed by psychologists and paediatricians. Data on health care use were collected from charts and parent interviews. Descriptive statistics are provided and logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate perinatal and social determinants of re-hospitalization and frequent use of health services resources. Results show that 57% of infants born at &lt; 26 weeks (n=49) and 49% of those born at 26-29 weeks (n=205) were re-hospitalized, mostly for respiratory illness. Both groups used a significant amount of health resources: 61% vs. 59%, respectively, received physical or occupational therapy, 29% vs. 17%, respectively, required long-term rehabilitation, 38% vs. 28%, respectively, used prescribed medication, and 59% vs. 33%, respectively, required home medical equipment (home oxygen, apnea monitors, orthopaedic devices and visual aids). Risk of re-hospitalization was associated with severe brain injury, use of an apnea monitor, and older age at neonatal discharge. Multiple birth, severe brain injury, suspected neonatal sepsis, and single-parent household were independently associated with the risk of using health care services above average. These results highlight the importance of resource allocation to preterm infants for medical and rehabilitation services after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mj919.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q508z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Child Health Services -- utilization -- Quebec.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infant, Premature -- Quebec.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Child Development -- Quebec.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Developmental Disabilities -- epidemiology -- Quebec.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Infant -- Quebec.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94ht15j"><dcterms:title>Cutout Manager : a stand-alone software system to calculate output factors for arbitrarily shaped electron beams using Monte Carlo simulation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Last, Jürgen.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In external electron beam therapy arbitrarily shaped inserts (cutouts) are used to define the contours of the irradiated field.

Most cells proliferate normally under these conditions. The methionine dependent tumorigenic human melanoma cell line MeWo-LC1 was derived from the methionine independent non-tumorigenic line MeWo. The MeWo-LC1 cell line has been shown to have a cellular phenotype similar to that of cells from patients with the cblC inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, with decreased synthesis of cobalamin coenzymes and decreased activity of the cobalamin dependent enzymes methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Inability of cblC cells to complement the defect in cobalamin metabolism in MeWo-LC1 suggested that the defect was caused by decreased activity of the MMACHC gene product. However, no potentially disease causing mutations could be detected in the coding sequence of MMACHC in MeWo-LC1. No MMACHC expression could be detected in MeWo-LC1, and there was virtually complete methylation of a CpG island at the 5' end of the MMACHC gene in MeWo-LC1, consistent with inactivation of the gene by methylation; the CpG island was partially methylated in MeWo and only lightly methylated in control fibroblasts. Transfection of MeWo-LC1 with wild type MMACHC with a constitutive promoter resulted in correction of the defect in cobalamin metabolism and restoration of the ability of cells to grow in medium containing homocysteine. We conclude that epigenetic inactivation of the MMACHC gene is responsible for methionine dependence in MeWo-LC1.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zf623.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cm162</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Methionine -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carrier Proteins -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Molecular Chaperones -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neoplasms -- genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epigenesis, Genetic.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vitamin B 12 -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq524js33w"><dcterms:title>Fluorescence-based reporter substrate for monitoring RNA editing in Trypanosomatid pathogens</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moshiri, Houta.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Mitochondrial gene expression in trypanosomatid pathogens requires extensive post transcriptional modification called RNA editing. This unique molecular mechanism, catalyzed by a multiprotein complex (the editosome), generates translatable transcripts for essential components of parasite respiratory complex. How editosome proteins are assembled and perform RNA editing is not fully understood. Moreover, previous studies have shown that editosome proteins are essential for parasite survival, which makes editosome as a suitable target for drug discovery. Currently, researchers use radio-labeled based assays to monitor RNA editing process. However, these assays are not suitable for high throughput screening of editosome inhibitors, have low detection limits, and cannot monitor RNA editing in real time. Therefore, to develop a sensitive high throughput RNA editing assay, we have designed a sensitive hammerhead ribozyme-based fluorescence assay. Ribozyme structure was remodeled by adding or removing uridylate in its conserved catalytic core to make an inactive ribozyme. In the presence of the editosome, inactive ribozyme is edited to an active ribozyme. Consequently, hammerhead ribozyme activity can be measured by cleaving its fluorescently labeled substrate. We have shown that higher sensitivity is achieved using fluorescent based assay than conventional radio-labeled assay. Moreover, we can use this assay for rapid identification and characterization of the editosome inhibitors against RNA editing activities in trypanosomatids.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920g1303.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js33w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fluorescence spectroscopy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>RNA editing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Trypanosoma brucei -- Molecular genetics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fluorescent probes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>African trypanosomiasis.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7m01bq07m"><dcterms:title>Isolation and characterization of SOS5 in a novel screen for plasma membrane to cell wall adhesion genes in Arabidopsis thaliana</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McFarlane, Heather Elizabeth, 1983-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Although dynamic interactions between plant cells and their environment require adhesion between the cell wall (CW) and the plasma membrane (PM), few plant adhesion molecules have been identified.

The first is an overview of algebraic-geometric techniques for integrable systems in which the AKS theorem is proven. Under certain conditions, this theorem asserts the commutatvity and (potential) non-triviality of the Hamiltonian flow of Ad*-invariant functions once they're restricted to subalgebras. This theorem is applied to the case of coadjoint orbits on loop algebras, identifying the flow with a spectral curve and a line bundle via the Lax equation. These results play an important role in the discussion of [HaHu], wherein we consider three levels of spaces, each possessing a linear family of Poisson spaces. It is shown that there exist Poisson mappings between these levels. We consider the two cases where the underlying Riemann surface is an elliptic curve, as well as its degeneration to a Riemann sphere with two points identified (the trigonometric case).

An improvement across all three doses of MPH on motor, cognitive and behavioural measures was observed. The improvement is significant at low doses of MPH and an increase of dose up to 0.8 mg/kg/day does not lead to further improvement of the speed of simple motor task, but might be beneficial to specific cognitive tasks.

The ERRs have been shown to actively modulate estrogenic responses, to play an essential role in pregnancy, and are implicated in breast cancer prognosis. My results show that ED acts as an antagonist of the ERRalpha confirming preliminary results obtained by our group. Studies of cellular responses demonstrate that ED has strong anti-mitogenic properties. ED inhibited the growth of both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner but did not have any effects on the proliferation of the non-cancerous immortalized epithelial breast MCF-10A cells. The finding that ED inhibits proliferation of both ER negative and ER positive breast cancer cells, and regulate ERR transcriptional activity may have important ramifications in breast cancer therapy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80j006z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b6926</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Receptors, Estrogen -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Breast Neoplasms -- metabolism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pregnancy -- blood.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Estrenes -- analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin -- analysis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Receptors, Estrogen -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Estrogen Receptor alpha -- metabolism.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8336h511r"><dcterms:title>Neuropsychological test battery for adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder : feasibility study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Keller, Amanda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a relatively common psychiatric disorder affecting 5-10% of child and 4% of the adult population. The disorder involves both behavioural problems and cognitive deficits, which are believed to be associated with neurological differences seen in this population. There has been increasing interest in understanding the cognitive deficits and neurological basis associated with ADHD. Neuropsychological examinations are an affordable tool, which can be used to improve our understanding of the cognitive deficits associated with the disorder and aid in clinical care. Currently, there is no standardized neuropsychological assessment that can be used in this population. In order to assist in developing a sound, predominately computerized test battery, which would assess deficits commonly seen in adults with ADHD, a neuropsychological project was piloted to examine recruitment and test utility. The majority of the tests were computerized and had population norms. The test battery was piloted on 8 patients on and off medication, and 4 patients completed the test battery twice off medication to examine potential practice effects. A discussion of feasibility and utility of the neuropsychological test battery for adults with ADHD ensues.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h3002.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h511r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity -- diagnosis.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neuropsychological Tests.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adult.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514np82z"><dcterms:title>The APEX-SZ experiment : observations of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kennedy, James, 1983-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (SZE) is a secondary distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum produced by galaxy clusters that allows for measurements of intra-cluster gas properties. Current experiments are using large arrays of multiplexed transition-edge sensor bolometers to achieve the sensitivities required for SZE cluster surveys and targeted cluster SZE observations. This thesis describes the APEX-SZ experiment, the first instrument to produce scientific results from observations with such an array. The scientific motivation for the APEX-SZ experiment is discussed, followed by a description of the APEX-SZ experiment and frequency domain multiplexing technologies. We have developed a custom data reduction pipeline for the experiment which uses a variety of filters, both in the temporal and spatial domain to produce 1' resolution maps of the SZE at 150GHz. The results of data analysis for the Bullet cluster (lE0657-56) and Abell 2204 (A2204) are presented. Both clusters are assumed to be isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium, allowing a fit to an isothermal beta-model and subsequent mass fraction estimates. The maximum likelihood parameters and constant likelihood 68% confidence intervals are estimated using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to sample the beta-model parameter space. We measure cluster gas mass fractions with r 2500 to be 0.140 +/- 0.035 and 0.058 +/- 0.035 for the Bullet cluster and A2204 respectively. The Bullet gas mass fraction is consistent with previous results from X-ray analysis. The gas mass fraction for A2204 does not agree well with other A2204 observations, however the large scatter in the gas mass fractions determined from previous X-ray and SZE analyses indicates that a more complex density model may be appropriate for this cluster.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p381x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514np82z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cosmic background radiation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bolometer.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Galaxies -- Clusters -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Galaxies -- Clusters.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amc87pv119"><dcterms:title>Snow study at Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments : variability of snow fall velocity, density and shape</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Jung, EunSil.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this work, snow data, collected at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) site during the winter of 2005/06 as part of the Canadian CALIPSO/CloudSat Validation Project (C3VP) were analyzed with various goals in mind: 1) investigate the effects of surface temperature and system depth on the snow fall velocity and particle size distribution, 2) find the variables that control the relationships between snow fall velocity and size (control variables), 3) retrieve the coefficient and the exponent in the power-law mass-size relations used in snow reflectivity, 4) estimate vertical air motion and 5) describe the shape of snowflakes that can be used in polarimetric studies of snow. It also includes considerable calibration work on the Hydrometeor Velocity and Shape Detector (HVSD); as well as sensitivity testing for radar calibration and Mie-scattering effect on snow density. Snow events were classified into several categories according to the radar echo vertical extent (H), surface and echo top temperatures (T s, Tt), to find their effects on snow fall velocity and particle size distribution. Several case studies, including situations of strong turbulence, were also examined. Simple and multiple correlation analyses between control variables and parameters of the power-law size-velocity relationship were carried out for 13 snow cases having a high R2 between their mean snowflakes fall velocity and the v-D fitted curve, in order to find the control variables of power-law v-D relations. Those cases were all characterized by single layered precipitation with different echo depth, surface and echo top temperatures. Results show that the exponent "b" in v-D power-law relationship has little effect on the variability of snow fall velocity; all control variables (T s, Tt, H) correlate much better to the coefficient "a" than to the exponent "b", leading to a snow fall velocity that can be simulated with a varying coefficient "a" and a fixed exponent "b" (v=aD0.15) with good accuracy. Coefficient "a" and exponent "b" for a generic snow v-D relationship were also examined. The results indicate that coefficient "a" of generic snow represents the most frequent coefficient "a" during the events, while the exponent "b" does not show any representative. Retrieval of the coefficient "a" and exponent "b" in a power-law mass-size relation, which eventually affects the snow reflectivity, was conducted by minimizing the root mean square (RMS) of differences in reflectivity between Vertically pointing McGill X-band Radar (VertiX) and HVSD. Minima of reflectivity differences lay on a diagonal direction of a diagram of the coefficient "a" (x-axis) versus exponent "b" (y-axis). It is shown that as the system deepens, the slope gets less steep. In addition, coefficient and exponent for this mass-size relation change with time, and snow density derived from several combined snow events does not explain the average snow density of the period. A method to retrieve vertical air motion with good accuracy using VertiX and HVSD is suggested. Several snow shape parameters and relations between the area ratio (Ar) and size of snowflakes (Ar-D relation) are investigated with snow dimensions defined in various ways. These Ar-D relations will be used as a guideline in snow density models.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qt37v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pv119</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Snowflakes -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Snow -- Ontario.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (Canada)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2514np837"><dcterms:title>Epidemiology and correlates of acquisition and clearance of ASC-US cytological abnormalities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lau, Susie Kit Sze.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Papanicolaou Smear is a screening test which detects premalignant lesions of the uterine cervix.

This diagnosis is now known as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and still little is known about its natural history. This paper analyzes the results of a longitudinal study incorporating repeated regular measurements of viral and cytological endpoints as well as lifestyle and behavioural aspects, to understand the natural history of an ASC-US Pap smear and identify determinants of ASC-US acquisition and clearance. Overall, the median duration of ASC-US is short, and is dependent on the definition of clearance since most lesions regress to normal. The factors most predictive of ASC-US acquisition but not clearance relate to HPV infection.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2677021c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514np837</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Precancerous Conditions -- pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vaginal Smears.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Uterine Cervical Neoplasms -- epidemiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Papillomavirus Infections -- complications.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Longitudinal Studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- epidemiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ak0698c160"><dcterms:title>Coping and psychological distress among head and neck cancer patients</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Dentistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Elani, Hawazin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objectives: To identify correlates of psychological distress and to investigate how coping skills, anxiety and depression are related in a group of head and neck cancer patients 6-12 months after their diagnosis.

Migraine has a global prevalence of 10%, and it is a disorder with elevated direct and indirect costs, the later mostly derived from its association with mood and anxiety disorders. Specifically, the reported prevalence of migraine in the BD population ranges from 24.8% to 39.8%, rates that are considerable higher than those found in the general population. Objective: To explore the prevalence and clinical characteristics of BD patients with and without migraine (Study 1), and to examine the psychiatric comorbidity in patients suffering from migraine (Study 2). Methods: 323 BD patients were studied, using SADS-L and SCID as diagnostic interviews, and ill-Migraine questionnaire to assess the presence of migraine. Statistical analyses were conducted using parametric analysis and the development of log-linear models. Additionally, 102 migraine patients were interviewed using SADS-L, and the descriptive characteristics of the sample were analyzed. Results: For Study 1, we found that 24.5% of BD patients suffer from migraine, and it is significantly associated with BD 2, suicidal behaviour, and a variety of anxiety disorders. As well, over 70% of migraine patients showed a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, mainly within the spheres of mood and anxiety disorders; specifically, the prevalence of BD among migraine patients was 12.7%. Conclusions: Our study highlights the high prevalence of migraine among BD patients, and the elevated prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity among migraine sufferers. The study of this comorbidity will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie both disorders and provide a better framework for the developing of molecular techniques to further analyze the molecular physiopathology of Bipolar Disorder.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d346z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515r82f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Migraine Disorders -- epidemiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Comorbidity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bipolar Disorder -- epidemiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- epidemiology</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
