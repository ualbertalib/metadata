Early personal experiences with differences in which they were  sensitized to social injustices were the most important contributor to their  multicultural awareness development. This factor appeared to lay the foundation for  an ongoing personal initiative to develop multicultural awareness in which they  maximized what they could learn from their culturally diverse clients, work  environments, coursework, supervision, and mentoring opportunities. Their personal  initiative also inspired them to persevere despite the difficult emotions and  conflict inherent in this developmental process.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jk88g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149q38r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cross-cultural counseling.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cultural awareness.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apv63g070j"><dcterms:title>The implementation of configurable technologies : negotiations between global principles and local contexts</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pozzebon, Marlei</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This investigation focuses on configurable technologies, a term  which refers to technologies that are highly parameterizable and are built from a  range of components to meet the very specific requirements of a particular  organization. They cannot be seen independently of their representations through  external intermediaries who "speak" for the technology by providing  images, descriptions, demonstrations, policies, templates and "solutions".  I use the term technology-configuring mediation to refer to the process  characterized by a socially constructed relationship between clients and  consultants, where visions of how the technology should operate are negotiated.  Configurable tools are well illustrated by ERP projects and represent an important  trend in IS, drawing its popularity from the hope of benefiting from increased  economies of scale and access to cumulative knowledge supposedly  "embedded" into these technological artifacts. From a critical interpretive perspective that combines ideas  from structuration theory, social shaping views of technology and critical discourse  analysis, this dissertation is based on an empirical investigation that spanned one  year and is primarily organized in three papers. The first paper investigates the  use of structuration theory in the IS field, asking: How can we successfully apply  structuration theory in IS empirical research? Paper 1 contributes to the  advancement of interpretive research methods by describing, analyzing and  illustrating the ways IS scholars have used Giddens' theory in their research. In  addition, it presents a repertoire of research strategies that may help overcome  barriers to the empirical application of structurationist theory by dealing with  three core elements: time, context and duality of technology. The second paper discusses the rhetorical closure that often  dominates discourses about IT, arguing that configurable technologies are social  constructions and, to different degrees, are always open to change. Taking ERP  projects as a typical illustration of configurable IT, Paper 2 describes a  multilevel framework that identifies occasions for ERP package negotiation and  change at three levels---segment, organization and individual---thereby breaking  down the rhetorical closure that seems to dominate public debate. Paper 2 draws on  structurationist and political streams of thinking about technology to set out a  theoretical framework that contributes to advancing our knowledge of configurable IS  phenomena. The third paper addresses the question: How does the mediation  process influence the negotiation between global principles and local contexts  during the implementation of configurable IS, and how does such a negotiation  influence the success of the implemented technology? Paper 3 provides a new  understanding of configurable technology implementation. The structuring of a new  configuration is seen as a mediation process where knowledge and power dependencies  are created and recreated over time by consultants and clients, the entire process  being bordered by internal and external constraints. Paper 3 recognizes different  patterns of mediation and explains how these patterns affect the negotiation of  global principles and local contexts as well as the project results. The study ends  by identifying a collection of mediating strategies that are likely to improve the  implementation of configurable IS.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Pinsonneault, Alain (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w044p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g070j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Electronic data processing consultants.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Information consultants.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Management information systems</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adaptive computing systems</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st055"><dcterms:title>Partnerships in sector-wide programming in education in Tanzania : narratives of experience</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Clarke-Okah, Willie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Partnership, the pre-eminent buzzword of the last two decades,  is still very much the mantra in development cooperation discourse, at least in the  North, as we begin the new millennium. This posthoc retrospective study is an  insider's account of personal experience in participating and observing the  development of Tanzania's Education Sector Development Program over a one-year  period in 1998--1999. The study interrogates the workings of Donor-Government  partnerships within this setting in an attempt to unravel the realities on the  ground in their relationships and how the power asymmetry between these principal  actors and their concomitant behaviour served to subvert the effectiveness and  sustainability of the partnership. This study in development anthropology is scaffolded by the  epistemic orientation of postmodern theories. The approaches adopted for  constructing and telling the stories that are narrated are borrowed from the  interpretive anthropology of Clifford Geertz and the postmodern anthropology of  James Clifford. Looking back and recollecting and reconstructing events required the  generation of enabling memories, for which the memory-work method was adapted and  used. The study reveals that the hegemonic rituals that characterized  development interventions in Tanzania bordered more on patronage than on  partnership. Partnership was very much valued in principle by all parties but when  the chips were down, it seemed ownership and trust, two key concepts undergirding  partnership, were casualties in the complex dance of cooperation that the contending  parties engaged in. They dealt with each other politely but suspicion and mistrust  were mutual at the level of Donor-Government and in situ Centre-Periphery  relationships. A modest proposal is advanced for understanding the broader  context of a Donor-Government relationship; it attempts to relate operational and  policy horizontality to include a more vertical consultative process involving civil  society at large, particularly affected communities, NGOs and the private sector as  a means of engendering a more effective and sustainable partnership between donors  and recipient1 countries. 1The normative perspective in particular on North-South  relations rejects recipient as an appropriate descriptive term for a developing  country receiving aid. For them, it connotes a superiority complex embedded in a  language of welfarism. Throughout this thesis, I use recipient simply to convey a  brutal reality: development assistance involves an element of charity and in the  North-South relationship, generally, one party gives and the other receives , with  the giver in a much stronger position to lay down conditions for the aid being  offered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mitchell, Claudia (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wd22r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st055</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economic assistance -- Tanzania</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Tanzania</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c20n"><dcterms:title>Interfacial thermodynamics of liquid crystals : applications to capillary instabilities</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cheong, Ae-Gyeong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Most current applications and uses of liquid crystalline  materials involve surfaces and interfaces. Prominent examples are high performance  carbonaceous mesophase fibers, liquid crystal polymer fibers, and  thermoplastic/liquid crystal polymer in-situ composites. Fundamental surface science  and engineering principles are needed to optimize and design fibers and composites  derived from liquid crystalline precursors. Currently non-equilibrium liquid crystal  surface phenomena are not well understood. Force balance equations describing static  and dynamical interfacial phenomena are available but have not been adequately used  to describe the mechanics of fiber and film microstructures. This thesis explores the mechanics and stability of nematic  liquid crystalline fibers embedded in inviscid and viscous matrices. A new  theoretical framework for liquid crystal surface mechanics is formulated and used to  model pattern formation and instability driven processes in fibers and fibrillar  composites and blends. The liquid crystal Herring's formula and Laplace equation are  derived and the role of liquid crystallinity is elucidated. In order to  systematically analyze the role of the fundamental processes, linear stability  analyses of capillary instabilities in nematic liquid crystalline fibers are  performed by formulating and solving the governing nemato-capillary equations. An  essential characteristic of liquid crystals, in contrast to isotropic liquids, is  their mechanical anisotropy. Thus, the main parameters affecting the capillary  instabilities are the isotropic and anisotropic surface tensions, the anisotropic  viscosities, the bulk orientational elasticity, the isotropic viscosity of the  matrix, and the surface bending modulus. Two asymptotic regimes are investigated:  (a) the thin-fiber regime characterized by homogeneous bulk orientation and storage  of surface elasticity, and (b) the thick-fiber regime characterized by bulk  orientation distortions without surface elastic storage. Novel capillary instability  mechanisms and symmetries of the instability modes for a nematic fiber embedded in a  matrix are characterized. The predicted ability of capillary instabilities in  nematic fibers to produce surface structures of well-defined symmetry and length  scales, as well as chiral microstructures, is an important result that augments the  pathways for targeted pattern formation. Deviations from classical Rayleigh  capillary instabilities are identified and quantified in terms of liquid crystalline  order.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rey, Alejandro D.

In spite of effective therapy emerging daily from medical research, non-compliance  appears at disappointing rates. Over the past 25 years, the gap is widening between  what we could achieve with available and emerging health care and what we are  currently achieving. This lack of compliance with proven therapy thwarts health  outcomes and adds to the growing health care costs. In Canada, direct and indirect  costs resulting from non-compliance with therapies amount to 7 to 9 billion dollars  per year (Coambes, Jensen, Hao Her, Ferguson, Jarry, Wong, &amp; Abrahamsohn, 1995;  Coambs, 1997; Tamblyn &amp; Perreault., 1997). Many stakeholders play a role in the complex compliance  equation. The physician plays a key role. Supporting physician maintenance of  competence are continuing health educators. Together, the physicians and educators  seek to employ the latest evidence in their practices to enhance compliance.  Explicating the thinking that guides their medical and educational practices helps  researchers and educators to understand problems in current approaches to  compliance. It is argued that prior knowledge is the basis for learning  (Limon &amp; Mason, 2002). Understanding current knowledge and behavior of a learner  establishes the baseline to build effective educational activities that will impact  targeted outcomes. Further, education designed by using learner's prior knowledge is  the scaffold for future learning (Alexander, 1996). This survey research examines the thinking and behavior of a  randomized sample of Canadian physicians and networking sample of educators.  Quantitative and qualitative analysis of participant thinking and interventions  reveal different perspectives and mental models that guide their clinical and  educational decisions. The findings reveal important differences with current  clinical recommendations. The study identifies important variables that explain the  differences and lack of progress in this area. Directions for future education and research are forwarded. The  recommendations, based in theories of change and cognition, offer important insights  and opportunities to make advances toward enhancing current rates of  compliance.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Saroyan, Alenoush (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515n922.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698798n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Patient education.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patient compliance.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qc644"><dcterms:title>"Liebes-Töten" : zur Objektwerdung der Frau im Roman der Frühromantik : Novalisʹ Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Friedrich HÜlderlins Hyperion, Friedrich Schlegels Lucinde</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>ger</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of German Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pnevmonidou, Elena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The aim of this comparative study of Novalis' Heinrich von  Ofterdingen , Holderlin's Hyperion, and Schlegel's Lucinde is to develop a  comprehensive overview of the role of woman in conceptions of male subjectivity in  Early German Romanticism. The reading of the novels developed here examines the  Early Romantic poetics with a specific view to the conceptualizations of woman  contained therein. The Early Romantic 'Project' consists in the rewriting of the  subject and the world in the medium of poetry. Tanscendental poetry, the fragment,  allegory, and irony are intended to invoke the presence of an absence, that is the  absolute. In the concrete praxis in the novels, these concepts of Early Romantic  poetics imply conceptualizations of woman. They articulate a specific approach in  the encounter of the male subject with the female object. At the center of Romantic  poetics lies the encounter with woman. The unique situatedness of the romantic  subject is, indeed, crystallized in this encounter. Early Romanticism is situated between Kant and Hegel. The  post-Kantian subject experiences a crisis of legitimation. Lacking an unmediated  access to the object, it is fragmented and threatened. Early Romanticism, however,  also prefigures Hegel, inasmuch as the crisis does not consist in the loss of the  object, but rather in the encounter of two subjects. The three novels are juxtaposed  here because this position between the loss of the object and the crisis of the  encounter with the other as subject leads to a paradoxical conceptualization of  woman as an uncanny object of desire. In all three novels, the constitution of the  male subject and the possibility of poetry depend on the encounter with woman.  However, the possibility of woman emerging, indeed, as subject represents an extreme  threat. As a consequence, the constitution of the male poetic subject requires the  simultaneous assimilation of femininity and the shielding against woman. Hence, the  three novels are love stories that narrate the death of woman. However, woman is  fundamentally uncanny because even the presence of the dead woman represents a  threat. The constitution of the male subject and novel unfolds, therefore, in three  stages; the encounter with woman, the assimilation of femininity and death of woman,  and the removal of any traces of that death.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peters, Paul (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr818.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc644</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Novalis, 1772-1801.

The ability of spherical micelles to  solubilize (incorporate) 2-nitrodiphenylamine, a model hydrophobic but polar dye  molecule, is investigated. The solubilization capacity of the micelles is evaluated  as a function of the dye concentration, and the results are explained by treating  solubilization as an adsorption process. The location of the incorporated molecules  within the micelle is also examined, and the interfacial region of the micelle is  identified as the solubilization site. Vesicles prepared from  polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) in dioxane/water mixtures undergo fusion (and  therefore increase in size) as the water content in the solvent mixture increases.  The kinetics of this process is followed, and the evaluated relaxation times range  between 10 and 700 s, depending on the solvent composition, the amount of water  added, the polymer concentration, and the poly(acrylic acid) block length. In  addition, the preparation of vesicles with tunable sizes is examined. Additives  (such as NaCl, HCl, and NaOH), as well as the solvent composition (ternary mixtures  of water/dioxane/THF) are used to vary the diameter of vesicles prepared from the  same copolymer. The effect of poly(acrylic acid) block length on vesicles size is  also determined. Finally, polystyrene- b-poly(acrylic acid) vesicles are used as  model carriers for the anti-tumor drug, doxorubicin hydrochloride. A pH-induced,  active loading method is applied to concentrate the drug into the aqueous cavity of  the vesicles.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eisenberg, Adi (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343s69n.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w045z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ath83kz854"><dcterms:title>L'autoportrait dans la correspondance de Sartre et de Beauvoir</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Potvin, Carole, 1964-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis analyses the self-portrait visible in the  correspondence exchanged between Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir during the  Second World War.

We examine the two principal figures that emerge from the  letters of each writer. Sartre appears as both an intellectual and an imperialist;  Beauvoir appears as a earthy woman who is also respectful of Sartre. The thesis is divided in two sections: "Le monologue"  and "Le dialogue". In fact, we have discovered that some of the figures,  the intellectual and the earthy woman, emerge in a context where the letter writer  reacts infrequently to the discourse of the addressee. That is why this section is  entitled "Le monologue". In contrast, other figures, the imperialist and  the respectful woman, appear in a context where both letter writers react to the  image that the addressee projects of himself. That is why this section is named  "Le dialogue". In addition, each figure presents a dark side. Therefore,  we have studied each of them firstly "in the sun" and secondly "in  the shadows".

We provide four models to  examine the outcomes of the non-cooperative network formation game where agents  engage in two activities: forming links and producing output. We show that when a  link between two agents allows only the forming agent to enjoy the output of the  other, a society always admits a stable network. Furthermore, this network almost  always has a center-periphery structure. Such societies consist of two types of  agents, centers that are directly connected by every other agent and peripheries to  whom no agent connects. We also find that centers produce more output and typically  have lower payoff than peripheries. When a link allows both agents to enjoy the  output of each other, a society does not always admit a stable network. In societies  where agents enjoy the outputs of those that are also indirectly linked, stable  networks can take much richer forms. In this setup stable networks include the  center-periphery networks as well as the wheel and star networks. If agents can  adjust the efficiency of their links, then every society admits a stable network  which always has a center-periphery structure. Our results for all four models show that the level of  production in non-empty stable networks is less than the amount that will maximize  the total benefits in the society.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Greenberg, Joseph (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Bala, Venkatesh (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182k61f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50ts15s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social networks</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4f16c338d"><dcterms:title>The Lysosomal trafficking of prosaposin /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lefrançois, Stephane</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prosaposin is a 65 kDa glycoprotein that can either be targeted  to the lysosomal compartment or further glycosylated to a 70 kDa form and secreted  from the cell. In the lysosome, prosaposin is cleaved into four individual proteins  known as saposins A, B, C and D that function as activators of sphingolipid  degradation. Most soluble lysosomal proteins use the mannose 6-phophate receptor to  traffic to the lysosome. However, several proteins including prosaposin have been  shown not to use this mechanism. Since prosaposin binds several types of  sphingolipids and that lipids are involved in the trafficking of proteins to various  cellular destinations, we tested the hypothesis that these lipids mediate the  trafficking of prosaposin to the lysosomes. Using inhibitors of sphingolipid  synthesis in conjunction with mutagenic analysis and dominant negative competition  with chimeric constructs, we demonstrated that the D functional domain of prosaposin  interacts with sphingomyelin and that the carboxy-terminal region of prosaposin  binds a sorting receptor. We also demonstrated that prosaposin binds to sortilin, a  recently identified lysosomal sorting receptor. In conclusion, our research unfolded  a novel mechanism of lysosomal transport involving a protein-lipid interaction and  the sorting receptor sortilin.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morales, Carlos Ramon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n06j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c338d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903043g"><dcterms:title>Signal processing by vestibular nuclei neurons : dissociating sensory, motor, and cognitive influences</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roy, Jefferson Edward</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The vestibular sensory apparatus and associated vestibular  nuclei are generally thought to encode angular head velocity during our daily  activities. However, in addition to direct inputs from vestibular afferents, the  vestibular nuclei receive substantial projections from cortical, cerebellar, and  other brainstem structures. Given this diversity of inputs we asked: how are the  responses of vestibular nuclei neurons to head velocity modified by these additional  inputs during naturally occurring behaviours? Here we have focused on three specific  classes of neurons in the vestibular nuclei: (1) vestibular-only (VO) neurons which  are thought to mediate, at least in part, the vestibulocollic reflex (VCR); (2)  position-vestibular-pause (PVP) neurons which mediate the vestibuloocular reflex  (VOR), and; (3) eye-head (EH) neurons, which are thought to mediate pursuit eye  movements. We first characterized neuronal responses to passive rotation in  the head-restrained condition, and then released the head to record the discharges  of the same neurons during self-generated head movements. VCR interneurons (VO  neurons) faithfully transmitted head velocity signals during passive head motion,  but their responses were greatly attenuated during all behaviours during which the  monkey's behavioral goal was to move its head relative to the body. Moreover, the  attenuation occurs only when neck proprioceptive inputs match those predicted by the  neck motor command. We propose that the sensory-motor matching is meditated by  interconnections with the cerebellum. Our findings indicate that the VCR is  suppressed during active head movements, but remains responsive to unexpected head  perturbations. In contrast, VOR interneurons (PVP neurons) faithfully transmitted  head velocity signals when the animal stabilized its gaze, regardless of whether the  head motion was actively or passively generated; their responses were attenuated  only when the monkey's behavioral goal was to redirect its axis of gaze relative to  space. We propose that efference copies of oculomotor/gaze commands are responsible  for the behaviourally dependent modulation of PVP neurons (and by extension the VOR)  during gaze redirection. Finally, the activity of EH neurons was recorded during  head-restrained smooth pursuit and eye-head gaze pursuit. EH neurons were not  influenced by error terms and their activity was best described by an eye  movement-based model. In addition, during gaze pursuit EH neurons were found to  encode gaze and head movement-related signals. Furthermore, neuron responses could  be predicted by their head movement sensitivity during passive whole-body rotation  in the dark and gaze movement sensitivity during smooth pursuit, regardless of the  stimulation condition. We propose that EH neuron responses reflect the summation of  head movement information from the vestibular afferents and gaze
movement information from the floccular lobe. We have shown that the vestibular system,
at least at the level of the vestibular nuc1ei, does not simply encode head-in-space motion, rather the processing of head movement information is dependant on the monkey's

ainsi que d'autres structures du tronc cérébral. Étant donné cette variété, nous avons posé
la question: comment, lors de comportements naturels, les réponses de neurones dans les
noyaux vestibulaires sont-elles modifiées par ces projections? Nos recherches ont porté sur
trois types de neurones: 1) les neurones purement vestibulaires (VO) qui génèrent le réflexe
vestibulocollique (VCR); 2) les neurones position vestibulaire pause (PVP) qui génèrent le
réflexe vestibulooculaire (VOR); et 3) les neurones oeil-tête (EH) qui génèrent les mouvements de poursuite oculaire.
Nous avons d'abord caractérisé l'activité de chaque neurone enregistré dans des conditions où la tête était immobilisée (HI), puis dans des conditions où la tête était libre de
bouger naturellement (HL). Les neurones VO encodaient précisément les mouvements de
la tête lors de mouvements passifs (HI), mais leurs réponses étaient profondément atténuées
lors de tout comportement volontaire où l'animal bougeait sa tête sur son corps. De plus,
une telle atténuation n'était observée que lorsque l'activation des fibres proprioceptives du
cou était prévisible en fonction du programme moteur allant au cou. Nous proposons que
ces interactions sensori-motrices sont générées par le cervelet. Nos études indiquent ainsi
que le VeR est supprimé lors de mouvements actifs de la tête, mais qu'il reste cependant accessible pour des perturbations inattendues à la tête. Contrairement aux neurones
va, les neurones PVP encodaient précisément les mouvements de la tête lorsque l'animal
stabilisait son axe visuel, et ce peu importe si ces mouvements étaient générés de façon
active ou passive; les réponses de ces neurones n'étaient atténuées que lorsque l'objectif
de l'animal était de réorienter son axe visuel. Nous proposons qu'une copie du programme
moteur servant à réorienter les yeux / axes visuels est utilisée afin de supprimer l'activité
des neurones PVP (et par conséquent du VOR) dans ces conditions. Finalement, nous
avons enregistré l'activité de neurones EH lors de mouvements de poursuite impliquant
ou non la tête. L'activité des neurones EH n'était pas reliée aux erreurs commises et était adéquatement décrite par un modèle basé entièrement sur le mouvement des yeux. De
plus, lors de mouvements de poursuite oeil-tête, les neurones EH encodaient des signaux
reliés aux mouvements de l'axe visuel et de la tête. L'activité de ces neurones pouvait être
prédite en tout temps par leur réponse aux mouvements de la tête lors des rotations passive
et par leur réponse aux mouvements de l'axe visuel lors de mouvements de poursuite oeiltête. Nous proposons que l'activité des neurons EH reflète la combinaison d'informations
sur les mouvements de la tête provenant des nerfs vestibulaires et d'informations sur les
mouvements de l'axe visuel provenant des lobules flocculaires.
Nous avons démontré que le système vestibulaire, du moins au niveau des noyaux
vestibulaires, ne fait pas qu'encoder les mouvements de la tête dans l'espace, mais qu'il
traite cette information différemment selon l'objectif comportemental de l'animal. </dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Cullen, Kathleen E.

The  effects of deposition and post-annealing parameters on film properties were  investigated. It was found that film thickness decreases near the discharge center,  possibly due to the preferential ion bombardment of the film during deposition.  Superconducting films with the high Tc 2223 phase could be obtained after a heat  treatment as short as 60 min. A structural transition from the semiconducting phase  to the low T c 2212 phase took place in the film during the preannealing in O 2 (20  min). During the subsequent annealing in air (40 min), a gradual structural  transition from the 2212 phase to 2223 phase occurred when the annealing temperature  and duration were increased. The resulting films showed Tc ~ 107 K and Jc  exceeding 8 x 103 A/cm2 at 79 K. For all stages of the transition, the phases  revealed in the temperature characteristics of electrical resistance and magnetic  susceptibility are consistent with those identified in the XRD spectra of the film.  Heat treatments of shorter duration or at lower temperatures resulted in films with  mixed 2212 and 2223 phases, in which a superconducting percolation path could still  be established at temperatures as high as 100 K. The evolution of film compositions  with annealing time suggested that Pb is a precursor of the chemical reactions  behind the accelerated formation of the 2223 phase. The photoresponse of PbBiSrCaCuO film was investigated at  temperatures below, around, and beyond Tc. Consistency was found between  photoresponse and temperature derivative of film resistivity near Tc, suggesting  that the photoresponse is bolometric in origin. Other bolometric signatures include  the long recovery time and linear dependence of photoresponse with supplied current.  Below Tc, a fast response appeared when the power density of optical excitation  exceeded a certain threshold. The effect of bias temperature on transient structure,  magnitude, and time delay of the fast response showed that this response is also  bolometric. A bolometric model was developed using the solutions of the problem of  linear heat flow in a solid bounded by a pair of parallel planes. The photoresponses  predicted by this model were in good agreement with those obtained experimentally.  Beyond T c, it was found that a nonbolometric photoresponse coexists with the  bolometric counterpart in electrically biased films. These components superimpose  linearly and can be extracted from the responses measured with forward and reverse  bias currents. The nonbolometric component also manifested itself as the response of  electrically unbiased films. Its behavior was consistent with prediction of a model  based on the Seebeck effect. In this model the film was depicted as a number of  parallel layers having different thermopowers and forming a tilt angle to the  substrate surface. Such a structure can be seen as the equivalent of a number of  thermocouples connected in series along the length of the film. Upon thermal heating  of the film, the temperature gradient in the individual thermocouples results in  Seebeck voltages that add up to the transverse nonbolometric  voltage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shih, I.

In the second analysis, 8% of the variance in  children's PA behaviour was at the between-school level. MLM analyses did not  identify significant main effects of either 'high PE' or 'sports playing fields' for  physical activity outcomes. However, significant cross-level interactions were  identified, such that overweight boys who attended high PE schools and/or schools  equipped with sports playing fields reported higher levels of PA and were less  likely to be inactive than overweight boys attending schools that did not offer  these opportunities. In the third analysis, there was substantial variation in PA  opportunities between schools. Higher opportunity for PA at school was associated  with role modeling of PA by school principals (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.46); high  interest in links to the municipality (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.18, 3,21); fewer  barriers related to cost and human r These findings illustrate the central role of the school  environment in influencing children's activity levels, and provide direction to  program and policy makers interested in enhancing opportunities for PA available to  children at school, and in helping children maintain active lifestyles.

Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the  central causal agent of cervical cancer. Vaccines were developed, and are currently  being tested in phase II/III trials. The host immune response is type-specific, and  likely not all oncogenic types will be targeted by vaccine formulations. A  theoretical concern is that infection with less prevalent oncogenic HPV types may  replace the disease prevented by a vaccine against the most common oncogenic HPVs.  This underscores the importance of having a better understanding of the epidemiology  of infections with multiple HPV types, in terms of their dynamics and risk factors.  The objectives of this project were to: (1) describe the occurrence of HPV  coinfections; (2) determine whether prior HPV infections are associated with  acquisition and clearance of other HPV types, and; (3) identify predictors of HPV  coinfection. Methodology. In a prospective cohort of 2075 Brazilian women,  cervical specimens were collected for cytology and HPV DNA detection. Information on  potential risk factors was obtained by interview at baseline, and at return visits.  Follow-up visits were scheduled every 4 months in the first year and every 6 months  thereafter. Results. The prevalence of HPV coinfection was 7.6% among all  women, and 21% among HPV-positive women. HPV coinfection was less common among  cytologically normal women, and peaked among women with lower grade cytological  abnormalities. Both prevalence and incidence of HPV coinfection decreased markedly  with increasing age. HPV infection at enrolment was associated with a higher risk of  infection with any other HPV type. The adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence  intervals (95% CI) of acquisition of any HPV type were: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5--3.2) for  oncogenic types excluding HPV 16 and 18 detected at enrolment, and 2.6 (95% CI:  1.7--4.2) for HPV 16 or 18 detected at enrolment. Predictors of HPV coinfection  included younger age, higher number of sexual partners, a history of condyloma, and  younger age at first sexual intercourse. Conclusion. HPV coinfections were relatively common, especially  among younger women. Prior HPV infections increased the risk of subsequent  infections with other types. These results may have implications for vaccine  development and public health decisions about vaccination programs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franco, Eduardo L.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is now  believed to be the central cause of cervical cancer. However, most of the  epidemiological evidence has come from retrospective, case-control studies, which do  not provide information on the dynamics of a cumulative or persistent HPV  infection. Objectives. (1) To measure the risk of incident neoplastic  cervical lesions over time related to prior cumulative and persistent HPV  infections. (2) To evaluate the influence of HPV viral burden on lesion risk  longitudinally. (3) To estimate the progression rates and sojourn time for precursor  squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and how they relate to HPV infection  status. Design and methods. In 1993, the Ludwig-McGill study team began  a large longitudinal study of the natural history of HPV infection and cervical  neoplasia in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Follow-up involved repeated measurements  on individual subjects over time. 2462 women were enrolled into the study and were  seen every 4 months in the first year (0, 4, 8 and 12 months), and twice yearly  thereafter for a period of up to eight years. In addition to obtaining risk factor  information via questionnaire, cervical specimens were taken for Pap cytology and  HPV testing at every visit. Statistical analyses entailed: (1) using different  modalities for defining HPV persistence by type and intensity; (2) using modeling  approaches that take into account the repeated measurements of HPV and SIL over time  within individuals; (3) analyzing changes in transition states between different  cervical lesion grades and the rate of progression from one state to the  next. Rationale. A longitudinal, repeated measurement cohort  investigation, such as this one, permits an accurate and unbiased assessment of the  relationship between cumulative HPV exposure and lesion incidence. An elevated  relationship between persistent HPV infections and SIL incidence supports the  proposal for the application of type-specific molecular HPV DNA testing as a  screening tool for the detection of cervical neoplasia. Better understanding of the  natural history of disease can help in developing effective and efficient public  health programs in prevention for cervical cancer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Franco, Eduardo L.

Since previous findings  demonstrated a neuroprotective role of the stress-inducible Hsp70 in an in vitro  model of the neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  (Bruening et al., 1999), the objectives of this research was to study the endogenous  heat shock response of motor neurons exposed to various stresses and to determine if  known pharmacological inducers of HSPs can enhance the stress response of these  cells. Neither heat shock nor glutamate excitotoxicity induced Hsp70 in motor  neurons. In primary spinal cord cultures, expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase  (SOD-1) with mutations responsible for familial ALS also failed to result in Hsp70  induction, nor was Hsp70 expressed in spinal motor neurons of mutant SOD-1 (mSOD)  transgenic mice or patients with sporadic or familial ALS. The lack of a strong heat  shock response was associated with an inability to activate the main stress-sensing  transcription factor, heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1). Overexpression of an  activated form of HSF1, but not wildtype HSF1, in cultured motor neurons resulted in  significant protection from mutant SOD-1 toxicity, which was accompanied by  increased expression of Hsp70, Hsp40, and to a lesser degree, Hsp25. The effects of  two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sodium salicylate, shown in cell lines to  increase HSF1 binding to promoters of HSP genes (Jurivich et al., 1992), and  niflumic acid, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, on the heat shock response of motor  neurons were assessed. Both drugs lowered the temperature threshold for induction of  Hsp70 in glia and non-neuronal cells, but not in motor neurons. Concomitantly,  neither drug prevented mSOD-mediated motor neuron death.

It exists as an  alphabeta heterodimer for which several isoforms have been described. During its  reaction cycle, the sodium pump extrudes three Na+ ions from the cell in exchange  for two extracellular K+ ions using the energy of hydrolysis of one ATP molecule.  The electrochemical sodium gradient generated provides the driving force for  secondary solute transport. Structure/function analysis of the catalytic subunit,  alpha, provides strong evidence for interactions between the actuator domain which  comprises the cytoplasmic N-terminus and the M2--M3 loop, and the M4--M5 loop  containing the ATP binding and phosphorylation sites. This thesis describes two  major aspects of Na,K-ATPase structure and function. First, the role of the unique  N-terminus of the ubiquitous al isoform of the rat Na,K-ATPase in E1/E2  conformational transitions is investigated as this region extends beyond that of the  well-characterized and related SERCA pump for which high resolution structures have  been obtained. Furthermore, the N-terminus is the region of greatest primary  sequence diversity among the otherwise homologous alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3  isoforms. The results provide strong evidence for a self-regulatory domain within  the N-terminus that modulates conformational transitions via novel intramolecular  interactions within the N-terminus and between the N-terminus and regions within the  cytoplasmic M2--M3 and M4--M5 loops. Another aspect of this thesis concerns a  comparative study of the isoform-specific ligand affinity differences. For this  study, the alpha2 and alpha3 isoforms were compared with the ubiquitous alpha1  isoform. The results demonstrate that alpha3-specific ligand affinities can be  explained by its distinct reactivities with alkali cations, as well as by  differences in the rates of partial reactions.

However, neither of these two perspectives addresses the notion that  individuals could differ in the chronic accessibility of a given social identity.  The present research explored this hypothesis. By adapting Higgins and colleagues'  (1982) methodology for studying the chronic accessibility of personality traits,  three studies were conducted to determine if there are differences in chronicity of  female (Experiments 1 and 3) and anglophone (Experiment 2) social identities.

In addition, the relative cryoprotective effects of whey protein  concentrate, whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, flaxseed meal and flaxseed  protein were assessed in surimi during storage. Raw surimi was prepared by repeatedly washing Alaska pollock  flesh with chilled water. The product was either slowly frozen or underwent rapid  freezing using liquid air; in either case it was then subjected to frozen storage at  -20°C for 24 months. Protein structural changes were monitored using sodium  dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native-PAGE, Fourier  transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy, and  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR/ATR spectroscopy showed that during preparation of surimi  the alpha-helix content increased with increased number of washing cycles. DSC  results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to a higher temperature  during surimi preparation. All electrophoresis, FTIR/ATR spectroscopy and DSC  results revealed a loss of myofibrillar proteins from surimi after three washing  cycles, suggesting that three washing cycles were adequate to prepare  surimi. Native-PAGE showed no major changes in surimi after 24 months  storage at -20°C. SDS-PAGE showed relatively minor changes in protein  subunit structure with some loss of the myosin light chains (MLC); myosin heavy  chain (MHC), actin and tropomyosin were found to be relatively stable. FTIR/ATR  spectroscopy indicated a significant decrease in alpha-helix relative to beta-sheet  structure in surimi after 2 years of storage at -20°C. The loss of  alpha-helical content was more significant in slowly frozen surimi compared to  rapid-frozen surimi samples. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition  of actin to lower temperatures during frozen storage of surimi. Changes in the ratio of alpha-helix to beta-sheet structures  suggested that flaxseed protein was the most effective cryoprotectant, followed by  whey protein isolate and soy protein isolate, for maintaining protein structure  stability during frozen storage.

After 15 days storage at 4°C, the SDS-PAGE  results showed that flaxseed protein was the only cryoprotectant that prevented the  degradation of myosin heavy chain, actin and myosin light chains.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alli, I.

Relational threat was measured when couple members' value similarity beliefs were  disconfirmed or when couple members reported beliefs of value dissimilarity.  Gender-specific compensatory mechanisms, reflective of relational self-construal,  were examined in association with relational well being. Study 1 was a controlled  laboratory experiment with dating couples that examined disconfirmation of perceived  value similarity. Study 2 examined naturally occurring variance of married couples'  beliefs about value similarity in the context of pregnancy and amniocentesis  testing. Results revealed that dating and married couples did assume similarity  about their personal values in moral contexts that reflected relational  significance. Results supported that assumptions about value similarity were  protective for couple members. Beliefs about value similarity that were disconfirmed  by experimentally controlled feedback as well as perceived value dissimilarity in a  naturally occurring context both posed relational threat for dating couples and  pregnant women, respectively. Gender-specific compensatory mechanisms were evoked  and were associated with overall relational well being when romantic intimates  considered personal value dissimilarity. Women demonstrated pro-relational  behaviors, consistent with their relational self-construal, such that they shifted  their personal values and brought their values in closer alignment with their  partners' values while, additionally, increasing their ratings of partners' positive  attributes. Dating men, consistent with their less relational self-construal, did  not alter their personal values and instead increased their ratings of their  partners' positive attributes, which accounted for increased relational  satisfaction. Married men who considered value dissimilarity with their pregnant  partners did not experience relational threat but demonstrated pro-relational  behaviors such that they shifted their personal values and brought their values in  closer alignment with their partners' values while increasing their ratings of  partners' positive attributes. The studies provide expanded knowledge for the  growing field of close relationship literature. Results were also discussed in the  context of pregnancy, social support, and the utilization of amniocentesis  tests.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lydon, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr83t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666500z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Couples -- Psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Man-woman relationships -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Values -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6682x449n"><dcterms:title>Regulating hox cofactors function via subcellular localization and transcriptional activity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Huang, He, 1972-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>HOX proteins are evolutionarily conserved homeodomain  (HD)-containing transcription factors that mediate environmental signal cues and  specify regional identities. PBC (including EXD in Drosophila and PBX in  vertebrates) and MEIS/PREP proteins are two families of transcription factors within  the broader three-amino-acid-loop-extension (TALE) class of homeoproteins. They form  cooperative DNA-binding complexes with HOX proteins and have been shown to assist  HOX functional specificity and participate in HOX-mediated transcriptional  regulation. The function of HOX cofactors is regulated at multiple levels.  The availability of PBC proteins is controlled via differential subcellular  localization which is partially directed by MEIS. However, cytoplasmic anchoring  factors could also contribute to PBX subcellular localization. Part of this thesis  project is devoted to identifying such factors. A cytoplasmic retention factor,  non-muscle myosin II heavy chain B (NMHCB) has been uncovered as a PBX-interacting  protein via a yeast two-hybrid screen. The NMHCB fragment induces cytoplasmic  retention of PBX and EXD in both mammalian cells and Drosophila S2 cells. In  addition, the subcellular distribution of EXD is deregulated in Drosophila bearing a  mutated zipper gene, a homolog of mammalian NMHCB. These results reveal a conserved  mechanism that promotes the cytoplasmic localization of PBX and EXD. Nuclear PBX and MEIS form cooperative complexes with subsets of  HOX proteins. In this project, we further study the transcriptional activity of  MEIS-PBX-HOX heterotrimers and try to dissect the role of the third partner in the  complex. We show that MEIS1 is recruited to the Hoxb1 auto-regulatory element (ARE),  a known PBX-HOX target, in conjugation with RA-induced Hoxb1 transcriptional  activation in P19 cells. We map TSA- and protein kinase A (PKA)-responsive  transactivation domains to the C-termini of MEIS1 proteins. We propose that cell  signaling modulates the transcriptional activity of MEIS and MEIS-PBX-HOX complexes  through this region. In addition, the DNA binding of MEIS and protein-protein  interaction between MEIS and PBX both contribute to the activity. Moreover, the  C-terminal regions appear to confer functional differences among MEIS/PREP family  proteins.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Featherstone, Mark (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k545g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x449n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A79407x818"><dcterms:title>Awakening the [delta]ormant receptor : interactions between [mu] and [delta] opioid receptors in vitro and in vivo</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Morinville, Anne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Opioid drugs acting at the mu opioid receptor (muOR), such as  morphine, represent the most commonly prescribed analgesics for the clinical  management of moderate to severe pain. However, the clinical use of muOR agonists is  limited by the occurrence of undesirable effects such as respiratory depression and  the tendency to produce tolerance and/or dependence with repeated administration.  delta opioid receptor (deltaOR) activation produces antinociception with reportedly  less deleterious effects when compared to muOR activation. However, animal studies  have revealed that deltaOR-mediated antinociceptive effects are modest compared to  muOR-elicited ones. Thus, we studied the regulation of deltaOR trafficking in the  rodent central nervous system with the intention of modifying the density of this  receptor at the cell surface and thereby improve deltaOR agonist potency.  Stimulation with morphine for 48 hours produced increased deltaOR cell surface  density both in vitro in primary cortical neurons in culture and in vivo in neurons  within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of rodents. This enhanced deltaOR cell  surface density was a trafficking event and was not due to an overall increase in  deltaOR expression. In vivo, the increased deltaOR cell surface density was  accompanied with enhanced antinociceptive potency of intrathecally administered muOR  agonists and augmented internalization of a fluorescent deltaOR agonist in the  dorsal horn. This effect was observed following pretreatment with various muOR  agonists and was abolished in muOR knock-out mice, demonstrating that activation of  muOR was critical for enhanced targeting of deltaOR to neuronal plasma membranes and  the observed increased antinociceptive responses. These changes in deltaOR function  and subcellular localization were not associated with the development of tolerance  to muOR agonists and were reversed 48 hours after the cessation of treatment with  morphine.

Two  components, one proactive and one reactive, have been shown to contribute to  balance. However, the way in which these elements are utilized for the control  process is not clear. Athletic training, particularly in sports which require  well-defined controlled movements, positively impacts the control of posture. Few  studies have addressed the contribution of dance training on postural control and  these results were inconclusive. Thus, the present goal was to contrast dancer and  non-dancer strategies for the maintenance of upright balance. This study assessed  postural control during multi-directional voluntary (leg lifts) and involuntary  (surface tilts) weight shifting. Eleven classical ballet dancers and nine matched  athletic non-dancers were recruited. Each participant performed five blocks of fast  leg lifts in ten directions and maintained stance during five blocks of surface  tilting (10° at 53°/s) in eight directions. A six-camera VICON 512  imaging system was used to determine 3-D body movement (120 Hz). To establish muscle  activation patterns, EMG from four right leg muscle pairs was recorded at 1080 Hz.  Simultaneously, two AMTI force plates measured ground reaction forces (1080 Hz).  Group differences were evaluated by analysis of variance and principal component  analysis. These experiments showed that control system redundancy is reduced through  the recruitment of specific postural strategies that are selected based on the task  goal. Limb unloading, voluntary or unexpected, requires control of the total body  center of mass. During voluntary leg lifts, dancers and non-dancers achieve this  goal differently. Dancers maintain vertical trunk alignment whereas non-dancers use  changes in trunk orientation to generate movement and control COM displacement. In  contrast, surface tilting produced stereo</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fung, Joyce (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b57q.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967420s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Recreation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awh246s56b"><dcterms:title>Three essays on international business</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Terra, Paulo Renato Soares</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is presented in the form of three essays on  International Business studies. The purpose of the dissertation is to address the  interdependence between the macroeconomy and finance at three levels of analysis:  the conceptual level, the economic policy level, and the corporate policy level.  Each essay addresses one of these levels. The empirical focus is on developing  countries in general---and Latin America in particular---because in recent history  these countries have experienced large economic fluctuations and major regime  shifts. The introduction surveys the literature on the relationship between the  financial sector and economic growth. The first essay synthesizes the literature  concerning the benefits, risks, and costs of financial liberalization in developing  countries and presents illustrative data on its recent implementation and outcomes.  The second essay investigates the causal relationships between real activity,  inflation, and financial assets' returns in seven major Latin American economies  (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela) over the period  1976--1999, using vector autoregression analysis to explore the puzzling negative  relationship observed elsewhere between real stock returns and inflation. The third  essay investigates whether macroeconomic factors are as important as traditional  firm-specific and country-specific factors as determinants of capital structure for  a sample of firms from the seven Latin American countries mentioned above in the  period 1986--2000 using panel data analysis. Empirical comparisons are drawn with  industrial economies: the G-7 economies in the second essay and a subset of United  States firms in the third. The final chapter presents the conclusions of this  dissertation. The main finding is that differences between advanced and emerging  economies in the relationship among economic variables do not seem as clear-cut as  often assumed by academicians, policy</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Jorgensen, Jan Jelmert (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440s91d.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s56b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>International business enterprises.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Macroeconomics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
