The purpose of the research was to develop a method of valuation to showcase the high "profit", in economic terms, that harvested country food provides. Wildlife harvesting in Inuit communities represents a traditional way of life which is threatened by the increasing expansion of wage employment, industrial development and the availability of store bought food. However, rather than having a marginalizing effect, these changes make subsistence hunting an essential economic activity. This thesis develops a method to measure the harvest of country food through a dollar value standard thus quantifying the real economic benefits of Inuit subsistence. The value of harvested food can then be compared economically to store bought food. This comparison shows that subsistence hunting provides Inuit with a relatively inexpensive food source, equivalent to $6 million of income ``in kind'' per community in the Baffin Region. In this era of store bought food and wage employment, Inuit communities remain economically and socially integrated through subsistence hunting. Without harvesting, northern communities would be culturally and nutritionally poorer than at any time in the past.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wenzel, George (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw51b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z295g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Inuit -- Hunting -- Nunavut -- Foxe Basin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Subsistence economy -- Nunavut -- Foxe Basin.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hunting -- Cost effectiveness.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foxe Basin (Nunavut) -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n08t"><dcterms:title>Edition du Mystère de sainte Barbe en deux journées BN Yf 1652 et 1651</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Longtin, Mario.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis consists in editing, side by side, two printed texts of Le Mystere de sainte Barbe en deux journees.

While our understanding of decision making has moved towards examining these environments, how does this knowledge apply to instruction in these contexts? Specific reasoning strategies identified by Patel are useful in assessing medical instruction. Rasmussen's guidelines and Patel's protocol analytic methods are applied in this thesis to assess two time-pressured environments of a local hospital. In the medical and surgical intensive care unit, resident physician instruction and patient care co-occur withing the context of problem solving and decision making. Differences between the two environments include a flattened hierarchy of communication, information exchange, and decision making content. Trainees approximated the proportion of directed reasoning strategies used by supervisors. Results are attributed to differences in knowledge-based solution strategy use, and medical domain structure. Implications for design of more guided apprenticeship programs is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Patel, Vilma L.

It was hypothesized that if infants did discriminate between the two languages, they would demonstrate a preference for their mother tongue. The responses of ten one- to four-day-old full-term infants were recorded by measuring their sucking rate while presenting lullabies. The infants were randomly and evenly divided into two groups. The first group heard four presentations of the mother tongue version followed by four presentations of the foreign language version. The second group heard the foreign language version of a lullaby followed by the same lullaby sung in the infant's mother tongue. A 5-second interval of silence was spaced between lullabies. The lullaby chose was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. It was performed by a classically trained soprano, in English, French, and Italian, and Russian. Russian was chosen as the foreign language and English, French, and Italian covered the mother tongues for all infants in the study. Results revealed that infants were not able to detect a difference between the mother tongue version of the lullaby as opposed to the foreign language version. However, the results of the present study may be attributed to an insufficient sample size and to the ineffectiveness of the methodology employed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wapnick, Joel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz56v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977x03d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Newborn infants -- Psychology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Am900nw59k"><dcterms:title>Early Zarathushtrianism and early Buddhism : a comparative study of religious innovation as an occasion for social reform</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Khanbaghi, Aptin A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a comparative study between two reforming movements emanating from the Aryan (Indo-Iranian) tradition: Early Zarathushtrianism and Early Buddhism. Although this thesis establishes the common origin of Zarathushtrianism and Buddhism, the principal purpose of this research is to demonstrate the social commitment of the two movements. Zarathyshtra and the Buddha are discerned in this discussion as reformers struggling against the religious institutions (worshipped gods and observed rites) and the social system of their time as the latter represented exclusively the aspirations of the dominating knightly or priestly classes. This treatise is primarily interested in the social message conveyed by Zarathushtra's and the Buddha's "religious" discourses. It aims to establish their statements as one supporting the emancipation of the classes who secured the economic prosperity of their society. Finally, as regards the outline of this thesis, the first two sections are preliminary chapters dedicated to separate studies of Zarathushtrianism and Buddhism. They pave the way for the comparative study between the two Aryan movements recorded in the last chapter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hayes, Richard P.

Throughout this evolution, ideologies of "innocence" and "experience" are articulated over the child in varying ways, defining the child as Nature, original sin, salvation, etc. The parent-child relation is analyzed according to the determining components of narcissism, the Oedipal wish and the incest taboo. The taboo's role in social organization is studied to determine how it has evolved in a consumerist society. Evolution of child imagery begins with manifestations of the incest theme in mythology and literature. The Romantic child is then contrasted to the Victorian child, revealing a "subversive echo" to child innocence. Power structures directed at controlling the child are reinforced in the modern and post-industrial families, the media and consumerism. Finally, the child in advertising is profiled within a mainly poststructuralist and psychoanalytic framework.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levin, Charles (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c33p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pj332</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Children in advertising.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A765373062"><dcterms:title>Prevalence of exercise-induced oxyhemoglobin desaturation and the effect of posture in healthy untrained young subjects</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gendron, Robert, 1967-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Exercise-induced hypoxemia is a common observation in endurance-trained athletes.

It will be argued that a private system was thought to respond best to Mexico's economic, social, political and cultural conditions. The president's personal interest in this industry together with his power to do his will strongly influenced his decision to encourage a commercial system. There were other factors that accelerated this process: the structure of the radio industry, which was (and still is) characterized by its commercial tone and the fact that it was highly monopolized and centralized; the government's encouragement of private investment in communications-related ventures; the president's belief that commercial television would best promote the consumption of domestic goods; the relation of reciprocal cooperation established early between the government and the private broadcasters, which turned out to be highly convenient for both sides; and the broadcasters' successful lobbying to establish commercial television. The roles of the government, private initiative and society in the development of media are also studied.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Szanto, George (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r976c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p234b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Executive power -- Mexico -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Privatization -- Mexico -- History.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alemán, Miguel, 1905-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Television broadcasting -- Mexico -- Ownership.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5m60qv00t"><dcterms:title>Sympathovagal influences on heart rate and blood pressure variability in highly trained endurance athletes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gagnon, Marie-Claude.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The evidence for an increase in resting vagal tone to explain the lower heart rate of endurance athletes remains controversial. This study used spectral analysis of heart rate (HRV) and blood pressure (BPV) variability to examine the vagal and sympathovagal influences on the sinus node in 12 endurance-trained athletes (A) and 10 age and sex-matched control subjects (C) (age: 26(1.2) yrs; VO2max: A: 68.2(2.1) vs C: 41.4(2.0) ml/kg/min; p $&lt;$ 0.05). Continuous ECG and BP recordings were obtained during supine rest, sitting, controlled respiration (12 breaths/min), standing, exercise at heart rates of 100 and 130 beats/min, and after 5 and 15 minutes of seated recovery. No differences were observed between A and C in the vagal or high frequency (HF) components (48.0(4.0) vs 44.2(6.9) nu), in the low frequency (LF) components (55.8(6.9) vs 52.0(4.0) nu), or in the LF/HF ratios (1.72(0.4) vs 1.22(0.2)) of the HRV spectral components at rest or other experimental conditions, despite the lower resting heart rates of the A (53.1(1.8) vs 65.1(2.1) beats/min; p $&lt;$ 0.05). Standing and exercise decreased the HF components and increased the LF/HF ratios similarily in both the A and C, controlled respiration induced similar rises in the HF component of HRV. Despite a significantly higher systolic BP in athletes, no difference was observed between A and C in the HF or LF components of either systolic or diastolic BPV. Exercise induced an increase in the HF component of BPV which was associated with the rise in breathing frequency. These results indicate a similar sinoatrial sympathovagal balance in A and C suggesting that training-induced bradycardia could result from an adaptation in the intrinsic sinoatrial properties. Also, endurance training does not appear to influence the beat-to-beat BPV.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perrault, Helene (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tr34c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qv00t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sympathomimetic agents.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Heart beat.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exercise -- Physiological aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blood pressure.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apz50gz14p"><dcterms:title>Peer mediation : conflict resolution or problem management?</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fulton, Diane.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study is to describe and provide a critical review of a program called peer mediation currently adapted by a Montreal Area Anglophone School Board or MAASB.

Any notion of literary meaning must ultimately rest upon a concept of meaning that explains, or attempts to explain, how communication is possible. This, in turn, leads down the dark path into human psychology and the relationships of our minds to the world around us. This thesis will attempt to explore various viewpoints about the connections between thought, language, and literature and to argue that these connections necessitate more attention than has been paid to them by literary theorists.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Livingston, Paisley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p534.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v29b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Literature -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Criticism -- Psychological aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw9505241j"><dcterms:title>Etude du blason corporel chez Paul-Marie Lapointe</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beausoleil, Jean-Marc.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that the "blason corporel" is a useful tool for understanding Paul-Marie Lapointe's poetry. Lapointe himself recognises that the variations of the "blason" that we can find in his poems are not the result of formal experimentation, but of a vision of the universe. The "poete quebecois" is seeking the unchanging: the human body and its place in the cosmos are two of the things that do not change, and thus, they are an important part of Lapointe's poetry. In our introduction, we define the "blason corporel" as it emerged in France, during the Renaissance. We use the concept of the eternal return, as developed by Neitzsche, to try and understand how the same vision of the universe can perpetuate itself through the centuries. In our first chapter, we study the presence of the "blason" in Bouche rouge. In our second chapter, we examine the presence of the "blasons" in all of Lapointe's works. To do so, we use the rhetoric of figures, which enables us to evaluate the effect of the presence of the "blason" on the form. We come to the conclusion that the "blason" are structured by an accumulation of metaphors. This figure, the metaphor, abolishes all limits ("un decloisonnement") which brings us, in our conclusion, to concepts related to psychoanalysis and the study of myths.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Everett, Jane (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956h902.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505241j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lapointe, Paul-Marie -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body, Human, in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1j92g9424"><dcterms:title>Zirconium and hafnium separation from chloride solutions by organophosphorous compounds</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Vianna da Silva, A.

Hafnium is extracted as its thiocyanate complex using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). There are environmental consequences of this system that were acceptable when the process was developed but should become a serious problem as legislation becomes more stringent. These problems are primarily the high aqueous solubility of MIBK and the potential for toxic gas generation. This work has tested four organophosphorous reagents to separate zirconium from hafnium without the need of thiocyanate, avoiding toxic gas formation. The extractants and diluent have very low aqueous solubility, removing effluents control problems. We see these features as representing a "zero waste" process. Additional advantages over MIBK process are lower vapor pressure and higher flash point (lower fire risk). This work presents the lab-scale experimental results using mainly two reagents designated by Cytec Canada Ltd as Cyanex 923 and Cyanex 925. The key feature of this work is replacement of MIBK and thiocyanate with one of a family of organophosphorous extractants that were unavailable in the 1950's at the start of the MIBK process. This work shows they can be efficiently applied to hafnium/zirconium separation in aqueous chloride solution, with minimum adjustments of the present industrial practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Distin, Philip A.

The system receives six hours of 8-channel EEGs and classifies the background EEG as one of seven abnormality levels. A total of 188, six-hour EEGs were visually interpreted by a neurologist and used as training examples. Spectral band activity was computed; artifacts were rejected using a median filter with a hard-limiter. Quantitative variables reflecting amplitude, symmetry, Front/Back differentiation and time variability were then extracted based on the study of Pasupathy (1994). Relationships between quantitative measures and the neurologist's assessment of amplitude, symmetry and Front/Back differentiation were established. A two-layer neural network having the measures of EEG variability as input was created for variability evaluation. A single-layer network was constructed to give the integrative interpretation of EEG abnormality based on the neurologist's assessment of the four features. Suitable knowledge base and inference engine were also constructed. Performance was tested using the rotation method of error estimation. 45% of testing instances were classified the same as the neurologist's interpretation. 46% were classified with an error of one abnormality level. Possible improvement and the clinical future of the system are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gotman, Jean (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs93r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z739m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806190t"><dcterms:title>Switching activity in CMOS digital circuits</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Shenoy, Sandeep P. (Sandeep Pundalika)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In (48, 47) a pattern-independent method to estimate the switching activity of a CMOS circuit was presented. The technique relies on the use of abstract waveforms, described down to the level of individual transitions, which are propagated through the circuit. In order to improve the switching activity estimate so obtained, case analysis is undertaken on nodes with large fanout. The objective of this thesis is to develop and implement a method to further improve upon the switching activity estimate through consideration of reconvergent fanout regions in the circuit. The idea is to impose functional consistency upon the waveforms at the nodes of a subset of the circuit to obtain an exact count of the number of transitions and potentially the exact waveforms which give rise to that. The result is the same as if an exact simulation was performed, but the novelty here is in the technique. An exact simulation would have exponential complexity as all possible waveforms on the PIs to the sub-circuit would have to be enumerated. Branch and bound techniques are used here instead to execute a progressively limited analysis which avoids exponential complexity. Furthermore heuristics are used to speed up the algorithm. In addition a simple greedy algorithm has been developed and implemented to identify the sub-circuits where application of the above described technique would have the best results. The greedy algorithm represents only a preliminary step, and further work needs to be done on a more comprehensive circuit partitioning technique.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rumin, Nicholas C.

Impregnation and pulping experiments were performed while varying several pulping parameters. Experiments were analyzed in terms of yield, lignin content, percent screen rejects, and strength properties. The goal was to determine optimum pulping conditions that would improve chemical impregnation. Impregnation is a function of percent screen rejects: well impregnated chips have fewer rejects. Cooking temperature and cooking time were held constant in all experiments at 170$ sp circ$C and 30 minutes, respectively. The liquor pH was adjusted to 7.9 and a liquor-to-wood ratio of 6:1 was used. Presteaming pressure was held constant at 138 kPa and soaking temperature was maintained isothermal at 90$ sp circ$C. Process variables which can influence the chemical penetration were investigated. These are: wood chip thickness, pre-treatment agents, compression ratio, partial crushing of wood chips, and also pre-steaming and evacuation prior to chemical treatment as a possible method of entrapped air removal. Additional process parameters investigated were the concentration of pulping chemicals and dosage of AQ catalyst. The advantages provided by the use of thinner wood chips, caustic pretreatment and high compression prex-impregnation were confirmed for improving chemical impregnation. The addition of SAQ catalyst to the CMP pulping process produced pulps of unusually high screened yield for given lignin content. Improvements were also observed in strength properties compared to the control cook where no SAQ was used.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kubes, G. J.

The interconnect uses a clustered window geometry in which optoelectronic device windows are grouped together about the axis of each microchannel. A Gaussian beam propagation analysis is used to analyze the trade-off between window size, window density, transistor count per smart pixel, and lenslet f-number for three cases of window clustering. The results of this analysis shows that by using this approach, a window density of 4,000 windows/cm$ sp2$ is obtained for a window size of 30 microns and a device plane separation of 25mm. To justify the feasibility of this design, an optical power model is developed to determine the nominal power requirements of a 32 x 32 smart pixel array as a function of window size. The power requirements are obtained assuming a CMOS inverter-amplifier and dual-rail MQW SEED devices as the receiver stage of the smart pixel. An analysis of the tolerance to misalignment is also provided to show that the clustered design is significantly more robust than single window relays.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Plant, D. V.

In recent years, surfactants have been proposed as agents which can lower the interfacial tension between immiscible liquids and lead to the extraction of oil. The interaction between the oil phase within a porous medium and a penetrating surfactant gives rise to interesting fluid flow problems associated with moving interfaces. Whether or not the interface between the oil phase and the surfactant migrates either as a "front" or degenerates into "fingering" will depend on a variety of factors including the grain size and pore size distribution of the fine grain soil, the soil-surfactant-oil surface chemistry, the viscosity of the oil and the pressures that are associated with the injected surfactant. The objective of this research is to gain some understanding through experimental simulations, of how some of these factors influence the surfactant migration through a porous medium and to examine the influence of the particle size, size distribution and viscosity of the oil on the development of the various interface mechanisms. This objective was achieved by the design and fabrication of a laboratory model representing a highly idealized single well in situ injection scenario associated with an oil-saturated stratum of fine thickness. The results of the test program give a realistic perspective of the equivalent field situation, along with encouraging NAPL removal levels of 90% after only one pore volume of surfactant injection in a case of a completely oil-saturated particulate medium.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Selvadurai, A.

Free cell cultures of Gluconobacter oxydans performing a bioconversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone in a non-growth medium were supplied with oxygen solely from the oxygen carriers. The production of DHA by the culture was used as a bioprobe to evaluate the oxygen transfer capabilities of the oxygen carriers. Models of the reactor system were developed to describe the kinetic and mass transfer phenomena taking place. It was found that the oxygen carriers could supply a cell culture of 0.2 g$ sb{ rm cell}$/L with oxygen quickly enough such that a mass transfer limitation was not encountered. This indicated that at a minimum, the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, k$ sb{ rm L}$a, was equal to or greater than a value of 3 min$ sp{-1}$. This minimum value is comparable to the upper scale of performance from conventional sparging and mixing. Comparable performance was observed when using either of the two oxygen carriers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Neufeld, R. J.
