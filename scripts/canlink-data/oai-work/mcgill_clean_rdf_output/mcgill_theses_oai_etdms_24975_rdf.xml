The type of movement exhibited by trophozoites of E. histolytica have been characterized and the forces produced by a pseudopodium during penetration have been measured. A 'monopodial' form of E. histolytica has been described. This form comprising less than 1% of a normal amoebic population in culture, was found to increase in numbers in the presence of bile and also under conditions of fluctuating temperature. Iron was found to be a necessary requirement for amoebic growth, having a direct effect on the growth rate of E. histolytica irrespective of the source of the iron (ferric or ferrous). The three strains of E. histolytica investigated exhibited different responses which correlated with their respective virulence.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f181q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv76n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sarcodina</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amoebida</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amoeboid movement</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3At722h9538"><dcterms:title>An economy dominated by a public good : Egypt and the Nile over 5000 years</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rizk, Nabila El-Hamawi.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis comprises the first systematic application of the theory of public goods to the study of the economics of Egypt during the 5000 years of its history. That history has provided an unparalleled experiment under quasi laboratory conditions. From the period of great coincidence that introduced agricultural technology in the Nile Valley, to the present day, that river with its system of irrigation has been an essentially indivisible instrument of production, a public good that has almost always dominated the economy. Over the ages, the country has been controlled by various rulers representing a number of very different civilizations: Pharaohs, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks and British. Each new conquest influenced Egypt in its own way and introduced an element of foreign culture. Despite the diversity of these external influences, the qualities of timelessnes and changelessness have never ceased to mark the Egyptian scene. There has been a unique continuity in basic institutions and in the form and functions of government. In examining the economic history of Egypt, marked as it is by this same continuity, the present thesis proves to constitute a confirmation of the theory of public goods.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf413.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h9538</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nile River.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Egypt -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Av405s994x"><dcterms:title>The determination of surface deformations by holographic-electro-optical processing /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rezai, K.

The experimental work utilizes a newly developed method referred to as the "holographic-electro-optical" technique that employs a specially designed microcomputer unit. The experimental procedure and the microcomputer organization are fully described. The application of this technique is illustrated by the evaluation of strain field and thickness changes at a large number of points on both sides of a commercial newsprint paper sample subjected to uniaxial loads. Furthermore, a new quantity called the "volumetric mass density" is introduced for this material for the first time that is experimentally evaluated and correlated to the obtained strain field. In the conclusion of this thesis general remarks concerning the holographic-electro-optical technique are given and the obtained results for the newsprint sample and future research are indicated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q2136.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405s994x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Surfaces (Technology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Deformations (Mechanics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Holographic interferometry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electrooptics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719n069"><dcterms:title>A single-strand DNA binding endo-exonuclease of Neurospora crass /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chow, Terry Yui-Kwong</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Employing successive chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and on single-strand (ss) DNA-cellulose, a new form of Neurospora endo-exonuclease has been isolated, a Mg('2+)-dependent ss-DNA-binding endo-exonuclease. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from extracts of mitochondria, vesicles, and the "25,000 xg pellet" (a mixture of mitochondria and small vesicles) indicated by the appearance of single protein bands on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and the same specific activity (14,000 U/mg) for enzyme from all three sources. The apparent native molecular weight for the endo-exonuclease from vesicles and the 25,000 xg pellet was 80K, but for the enzyme from mitochondria it was 116-130K. The mobility of the mitochondrial endo-exonuclease on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels was also found to be higher, 0.65 as compared to 0.17 for the vesicle endo-exonuclease. This higher mobility was shown to be due to the presence of phosphomonoester groups associated with the protein. The electrophoresis of the enzyme from the three sources on SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed that the enzyme is a "complex" of polypeptides of which 49K, 33K, and 12 - 14K polypeptides were common to all three preparations. The enzymatic properties of the ss-DNA-binding endo-exonuclease from the three sources are identical showing, for the first time, the presence of the same enzyme in two different types of subcellular organelles. The enzyme releases initially large 5'-p-terminated oligonucleotides from ss-DNA in a non-processive manner and di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides from double strand (ds) DNA in strictly processive manner. The endo- and exonuclease activities showed differential Mg('2+) requirements, inhibitions by NaCl and effects of pH and ethidium bromide. The inactivation of both activities by ethoxyformic anhydride was inhibited by ss-DNA, but not by ds-DNA. The presence of the protease inhibitor, PMSF, during extraction prevented the recovery of ss-DNA-binding endo-exonuclease, indicating the presence of a more intact form of enzyme in vivo. Treatment of an inactive precursor protein with a PMSF-sensitive protease of Neurospora, Bz-TYR-Nanase, resulted in the formation of the ss-DNA-binding endo-exonuclease. Proteolytic conversions of ss-DNA-binding endo-exonuclease to other various forms of sugar-non-specific nucleases which have been characterized previously were confirmed. The relatedness of these nucleases to ss-DNA-binding endo-exonuclease and precursor was demonstrated by preparing antiserum in rabbit using ss-DNA-binding enzyme and testing for immunological cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity was also seen with a commercial preparation of Neurospora endonuclease and a yeast mitochondria nuclease, but none was seen with pancreatic DNase I or Micrococcal nuclease.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731461t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n069</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5t34sk19w"><dcterms:title>Diderot et Galiani : études d'une amitié philosophique</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French Language and Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Clift, Rosena.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The year 1759 saw the arrival in Paris of the abbe Galiani as secretary to the Neapolitan Embassy. His initial feelings of disappointment diminished as he was welcomed in the most important salons of Paris, where he met the principal Encyclopedistes, including Diderot. This thesis is a thorough study of the intellectual and human association between Diderot and Galiani: the circumstances of their encounters, especially between 1760 and 1769 when Galiani was forced to return to Naples; their mutual friends, and the areas of common interest which attracted these two encyclopaedic minds, such as literature, especially the theatre, the arts and Antiquity, science, economics, politics and philosophy. Along with a systematic analysis of these fields of mutual interest, the aspects of Galiani's personality which attracted Diderot to him have been studied. Particular emphasis is placed on what Diderot learned from Galiani, especially in economics and politics, and the role Galiani played in the crystallization of Diderot's thought. This is all the more significant in that the Diderot-Galiani friendship was consolidated at a critical point in the development of the philosopher's thought.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d42k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk19w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Diderot, Denis, 1713-1784.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Galiani, Ferdinando, 1728-1787.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajm214p74r"><dcterms:title>Studies on the tonin-angiotensin II system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schiffrin, Ernesto Luis.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>('125)I-tonin injected intravenously to rats dissappeared from plasma with a bi-exponential decline. The label accumulated in the liver, adrenal glands, spleen and kidney. In renal hypertensive rats no important changes in tissue dispostion were found, but the apparent volume of distribution of ('125)I-tonin was reduced. ('125)I-PMS-tonin, a modified protein which does not bind to the tonin-inhibitor in plasma, had a significantly different disposition, accumulating in the kidneys, while much less was found in the adrenal glands. When unlabeled tonin was co-injected with ('125)I-tonin, survival of tonin radioactivity in the circulation was prolonged and liver, spleen and adrenal uptake significantly reduced. Co-injection with trypsin produced similar effects, but associated with important hemodynamic changes which might explain the findings. Taken together, these facts suggest that tissue uptake of the tonin-inhibitor complex may be mediated by recognition sites specific for the complex. Radioautography after injection of ('125)I-tonin to rats showed greater accumulation in the adrenal glomerulosa and reticularis. The grains seemed to associate with adrenal cells and not with endothelial cells lining the sinusoids. In the liver the radioautographic reaction was found to concentrate in Kupffer cells. In the kidney grains predominated in the lumenal pole of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. A pressor effect of tonin, absent in normal rats or rabbits, was found in bilaterally nephrectomized animals. No important change in vascular reactivity or in the inhibitory power of plasma could be detected. The response was produced by generation of angiotensin II in plasma. A role of substrate levels in the modulation of tonin activity in vivo even in the presence of the tonin inhibitor was suggested. The infusion of tonin into conscious seemingly unstressed rats produced an increase in plasma aldosterone and corticosterone, and a decrease in plasma renin activity. Plasma angiotensin II concentration was not different from controls, but the plasma renin/angiotensin II ratio was decreased. Plasma electrolytes were unchanged. The angiotensin III antagonist blocked the response of the adrenal. Of angiotensin II antagonists, sar('1)ala('8)angiotensin II was ineffective and sar('1)thr('8)angiotensin II blocked the effect partially. No significant response could be found in sodium depleted rats. The plasma aldosterone concentration in these rats, however, presented a wide dispersion of values. No adrenal response was seen in chronically hypophysectomized rats. Tonin stimulated aldosterone biosynthesis by isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells only in the presence of plasma, when large amounts of angiotensin II were generated in the incubate. These results suggest that tonin does not act in vivo directly on adrenal cells. The lack of effect in hypophysectomized rats indicates that the response may be mediated by a pituitary peptide, unless this finding is caused by the reduction of the concentration of substrate in plasma and tissues observed in this experimental situation. The elevated blood pressure of one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rabbits was reduced when active immunization against tonin was successful. Together with previous evidence, this suggests an involvement of the tonin-angiotensin II system in this form of experimental hypertension.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x2035.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p74r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p780n"><dcterms:title>Utopies et pédagogie dans la littérature du dix-septième siècle</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of French Language and Literature</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Schneider, Jean-Daniel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Le silence est a peu pres total, dans la litterature franciase du dix-septieme siecle, sur tout ce qui touche a la pedagogie, mais ce silence merite d'etre scrute et explique.

of algebra. The first phase involved interviews with ten seventh graders (12 and 13 years of age) to uncover some of their pre-algebraic notions on equations and equation solving. Six of these novice subjects were kept on for the second phase: a two-month teaching experiment on equation solving which emphasized the symmetric procedure of performing the same operation on both sides. The pretest and two posttest interviews of the second phase included both equation-solving and equivalent-equations tasks. The third phase involved interviews with nine more-experienced algebra students from grades eight to eleven, to investigate their equation-solving procedures, errors, and methods of determining the equivalence of equation-pairs. Their approaches were compared with those of the novices on the same tasks. The study uncovered two distinct paths followed in the learning of equation solving: one by those already predisposed toward inversing; the other by those with a predisposition toward using surface operations. The latter group was more receptive to the procedure taught during the teaching experiment. A relationship was found to exist between subjects' view of the literal term in equations and their preferred equation-solving method. Novices with an inversing preference applied learned principles to equivalence tasks, but not to equation solving. More-expert subjects relied on inversing for both. Theoretical implications of these findings concern: the processes used in the early stages of learning a new domain, the modeling of the procedures used to determine equivalence, the relationship between errors and structural knowledge, and the representation of word problems by equations. Finally, the characterization of an arithmetic approach and an algebraic approach to the learning of equation solving is used to suggest a basis for a theory of algebra learning.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j90s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k79n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Algebra -- Study and teaching -- Research.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Problem solving in children -- Case studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
