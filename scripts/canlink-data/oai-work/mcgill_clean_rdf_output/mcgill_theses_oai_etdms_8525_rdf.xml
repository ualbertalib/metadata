It aims to supply the facts underlying the present important and pressing problems of provincial finance by denoting the historical background and constitutional restrictions bearing on the subject, the difficulties and inadequacies of the present situation, and proposed lines of reform. The subject wss suggested by a perusal of Dr. Solomon Vineberg's thesis on "Provincial and Local Taxation in Canada", which, written in 1912, before the significant changes caused by the war had been effected, is out-dated as a source for understanding the situation of to-day. His subject has been broadened out into finance rather than the narrower field of taxation, and municipal finance has been relegated to the background.

Towards the close of the 6th century, the conversion of the English to Christianity was begun by Roman missionaries. A century later it was the dominant religion in all the English kingdoms. Although the youngest of the Christian churches, the English Church had the most religious zeal, in addition to warmth and depth of religious sentiment. This was shown in the pilgrimages, the works of Christian Charity, and in the rich gifts to the Church. Kings and queens are known to have erected convents and monasteries, and after renouncing their crowns, to have given themselves, up to prayer and meditation. The missionaries also, did great work among the sti11 pagan tribes on the continent. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Graff, W. &amp; Latham, G.

No enabling amendment to the constitution ot Canada - such as was necessary to that of the United States of America - was required; for, pursuant to the provisions of the British North America Act,l867, the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament extends to "the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation". Money raised by an income tax is unquestionably money raised by a "mode or system of taxation". [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kemp, H. &amp; Hemmeon, J.

In this twentieth century the point of view has changed considerably, and many go so far as to consider the marriage ceremony important only as a legal formality. It can be said that a great body of public opinion no longer considers the marris.ge tie unbreakable when reason dictates the expediency of breaking it. The years of transition saw a great interest being taken in this subject, and much war being waged about it. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tait, W. &amp; Files, H.

Nevertheless, despite the age-old recognition of the relationship between headtrauma and certain forms of epilepsy, and despite the untold investigations into the treatment of this unfortunate sequela, amazingly little progress has been made in an understanding of the underlying cause and the basic principles of therapy. Adapting the definition of Lennox and Cobb (1928) as applied to the entire field of convulsive seizures, we may limit ourselves to a discussion of "a syndrome characterized by the sudden appearance of paroxysms, of which convulsive movements or loss of consciousness or both, are a principal element", but which, in the class of convulsions under discussion are associated with definite and demonstrable injury of the brain and its envelopes, due to violence.
