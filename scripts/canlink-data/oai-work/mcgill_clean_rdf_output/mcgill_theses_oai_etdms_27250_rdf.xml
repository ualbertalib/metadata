Adults performed at ceiling levels for all three conditions. No infant age differences were observed. However, there was some evidence that infants benefitted from the presence of redundant acoustic cues (FC $&gt;$ BCCN, but FC $ le$ VDN). Infants performed significantly better with the VDN stimuli indicating that final release burst information is more salient to infants than vowel duration differences for this /bid/-/bit/ contrast. This result differs from findings of prior research on adult and infant perception of such contrasts which showed a prominent use of the preceding vowel duration cue.

The present thesis sought to investigate further the use of anaphoric reference in this family using detailed, discourse-oriented analyses. Oral narratives were elicited from eight mature-language users, four language-impaired and four unimpaired. Discourse analysis was accomplished using procedures taken from normal acquisitional studies in which both the form (pronominal or nominal) and the function served by each form (switching or maintaining reference) are considered. The analysis revealed some differences between the language-impaired and unimpaired subjects in their use of pronominals in their narratives. However, three of the four language-impaired subjects used the same nominal-pronominal reference tracking strategies as their unimpaired relatives. The implications of these findings for the general ability of the language-impaired subjects to use pronouns anaphorically as well as future research directions are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Crago, Martha B.

The "thickness" of the cyclic interval graph captures the notion of overlap between live ranges of variables relative to each particular point of time in the program execution. It is effective in capturing the regular periodic nature of loop-carried dependent live ranges found in loops. As most scientific code spend a lot of time executing loop structures, it is most crucial to perform well when register allocating for it. A good spilling algorithm and a close to optimal coloring algorithm is invaluable in minimizing the cost that may be incurred while performing register allocation for loop structures. Minimization of spill code often greatly increases the performance of the code. Our proposed spilling and coloring scheme is very well suited to these loop structures, and could be used to reap maximum benefit when used in tandem with loop scheduling algorithms (NG93, Nin93). A collection of real program loops are used to test the effectiveness of our approach.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gao, Guang R.

The analysis of real producer prices indicates that there are more countries that exhibited a statistically significant decrease in real producer prices than a significant increase. Moreover, nominal protection coefficient analysis shows that African crop exporters, on average, received a small proportion (50 to 60 percent) of border prices. Using pooled cross-section and time series data, a partial adjustment model was then specified to estimate agricultural export and food output response. The results show that aggregate agricultural export and food supply responses to output prices in tropical Africa are both positive and significant but inelastic. The price elasticity for the export crop output in Tropical Africa is 0.02 in the short run and 0.04 in the long run, and for the food crop output 0.05 in the short-run and 0.07 in the long-run. The responsiveness of agriculture varies, however, across the main agro-climatic regions in tropical Africa. The estimated coefficient of the price variable and price elasticity estimates regions reveal that producers in the Eastern and Southern Africa, and Western Africa regions were responsive to price incentives, while producers in the semi-arid Sudano Sahel and Central Africa regions were not. The trend variable, as proxy of technology, is positive and significant in most regions, suggesting that the provision of non-price factors along with favourable price incentives, could be very effective in raising agricultural production in these regions.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n461s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988m26j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Agriculture and state -- Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural prices -- Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Exports -- Africa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Agricultural prices -- Government policy -- Africa.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mn425"><dcterms:title>The relationship of physical mobility, social integration, and social satisfaction to older unmarried persons' well-being /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Nursing</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fox, Mary T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explored the relationship of physical mobility; social integration with children, siblings, other relatives, and close friends; and social satisfaction with friend and family relations to the well-being of unmarried Canadians age 75 and older. This study also explored the relationship between each of four social integration measures and physical mobility in potentiating well-being. To take into account any possible effects of demographics the following were included in a multiple regression analysis with the major study variables; age, gender, marital status and living arrangements. A correlational cross-sectional design, using a subsample of 754 unmarried persons living in the community was selected from an archived data set, Statistics Canada's 1985 General Social Survey. No significant interactions were identified between social integration and physical mobility. The results lend support to the importance of physical mobility and the quality of relationships to the older person's well-being. Physical mobility, satisfaction with friendships, being older, and satisfaction with family relations were identified as constituting the best set of variables most strongly related to well-being. Together they accounted for 40% of the variance (p $&lt;$.01). Physical mobility was more strongly related to the well-being of men age 75 to 79 than that of any other gender-age group. Practice and research implications are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gooding, B. A.

We consequently attempt to bridge these two approaches by defining a family of generalized luminosity fields which depends on both spatial resolution and luminosity intensity. From analysis of 3, 2, and 1-dimensional catalogues, we find that in 3d the galaxy luminosity field exhibits two signatures of multifractal behavior: multiscaling and divergent statistical moments. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that the statislics governing this multifractal behaviour are determined by the parameters (the degree of multifractalily of the field) and C$ sb{1,1}$ (the codimension of the mean luminosity) which we estimate as 1.2 $ pm$ 0.4 and 1.28 $ pm$ 0.06 respectively. We consequently suggest that the non-linear mechanisms responsible for the formation of galaxies may be of multifractal origin. As many of the analyses were performed on projected fields a theoretical framework for multifractal projections is also developed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lovejoy, S.

These community based workers are usually volunteers who receive basic training in health education, antenatal/delivery/postnatal care, and treatment of simple common illnesses. They represent a referral link between the community and professional health services. Female CHWs (FCHWs) are able to access vulnerable populations such as women and children and are often also are involved in midwifery. This thesis evaluates the Community Health Worker (CHW) program using both quantitative and qualitative methods. An initial literature review attempts to ascertain the current quality of evidence provided by published studies of CHW effectiveness to date (Medline 1983-1994). A quantitative study, undertaken by this author in 1990 in Afghan refugee villages in Pakistan, evaluates CHW effectiveness in health promotion using two knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) questionnaires (N = 600). The results of this study are then discussed and interpreted with additional qualitative and secondary data collected in the same study area in 1994. Determinants of female community health worker (FCHW) effectiveness are examined by looking more closely at the relationship between the female CHW and both the community and the local health system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Moore, T.

This thesis studies the nature of these relationships and the manner in which they contribute to the development of a musical career. The dichotomy between the artistic concerns of the musician and the economic interests of the industry that informs many popular music studies is re-oriented in light of the economic interests that are inherent in the musician's pursuit of a musical livelihood. The importance of commercial success in the maintenance of a musical living is explored in the case study of Men Without Hats, a Montreal based pop band that has maintained a fifteen year career despite a lack of commercial success over the past decade. This study suggests that the maintenance of a musical career over an extended period of time is a consequence of the types of relationships that are cultivated by the musician over the course of his/her career.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k633w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r400</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Men without Hats (Musical group)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music trade</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7w62f965v"><dcterms:title>Optimization and fabrication of a widened x-branch optical demultiplexer in glass</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Babin, Loïc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis, a widened X-branch optical waveguide by K$ sp+$-Na$ sp+$ ion-exchange in glass, to be used as a single mode-optical wavelength division demultiplexer (WDM) at the wavelengths 1.31$ mu$m is designed, fabricated, and tested. The widened X-branch is a channel guide structure. To carry out the design, the effective-index method (EIM) together with the 2D-beam propagation method (FD-BPM), are employed. In order to get an accurate model for the lateral effective index in the channel guide, in the EIM, the diffusion process related to the ion-exchange is numerically simulated using an explicit 3D finite difference scheme. Experimentally, extinction ratios about $-$20 dB are obtained for TM mode devices, and in reasonably good agreement with the design predictions. These results are discussed and possible improvements to the present work are pointed out.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yip, Gar Lam (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj85m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f965v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8p58pf18v"><dcterms:title>The effect of Plagiorchis elegans cercariae on the vertical distribution of Aedes aegypti larvae /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gilchrist, Ian G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effect of Plagiorchis elegans cercariae on the vertical distribution of second, third, and fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti in the water column was studied in the laboratory. Under daytime conditions and in the absence of the parasite, larvae divided their time between the top and bottom of the water column. At night larvae spent the majority of their time at rest at the top of the column. In the presence of P. elegans cercariae larvae spent more time at rest at the surface under daytime conditions but increased their active time at the bottom under nighttime conditions. The presence of cercariae elicited escape and grooming responses and tended to reduce and fragment feeding activity.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rau, M. E.

Photon-energy spectra for fields ranging from 2 x 2 cm$ sp2$ to 20 x 20 cm$ sp2$ in size were generated and the primary and scatter spectra were analyzed separately. The generated x-ray spectra were used in the calculation of the percent depth dose (PDD) distributions for flattened and unflattened 10 MV x-ray beams in a water phantom at a source-surface distance of 100 cm for the various field sizes. The agreement between calculated and measured depth doses is excellent. Measurements of the dose in the build-up region show that the depth of dose maximum (d$ sb{max}$) increases with increasing field size for fields up to 5 x 5 cm$ sp2$ for both the flattened and unflattened beams. As the field size is increased beyond 5 x 5 cm$ sp2,$ d$ sb{max}$ decreases with increasing field size for the flattened x-ray beam while remaining nearly constant for the unflattened beam. Additionally, the surface dose of the flattened beam is found to approach that of the unflattened beam for large field sizes. Calculations show that the decrease in d$ sb{max}$ as the field size is increased above 5 x 5 cm$ sp2,$ and the rapid increase in the surface dose for the flattened x-ray beam with increasing field size, are due to the degradation of the flattened-beam parameters caused by low-energy photons produced in the flattening filter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorsak, E.

En effet, la definition du contrat qui est implicitement admise par le droit positif--contrairement a ce que cette theorie preconise--semble comprendre une exigence relative a l'equivalence des prestations. Il faut, par consequent, rechercher un fondement theorique susceptible de justifier cette conception du contrat. En reprenant les idees developpees par Hegel, il apparait que le concept de contrat repose non seulement sur la liberte, mais aussi sur l'egalite abstraite existant entre les hommes. Le regime du contrat doit donc etre deduit de ces deux postulats. L'analyse classique n'a pas su tirer toutes les consequences de l'identite de la personnalite juridique des contractants. Pour etre coherentes, les regles du droit des contrats doivent en effet preserver cette egalite en exigeant que le rapport d'egalite qui existe de facon abstraite entre les causes des obligations contractuelles se materialise a travers la valeur de leurs objets. A defaut de quoi, le droit positif permet la violation du droit du contractant, et donc de sa liberte fondamentale. Cette analyse du contrat explique les diverses tentatives des droits positifs francais et etrangers pour lutter contre l'inegalite contractuelle, que ce soit au moyen des regles du droit des contrats, ou de regles specifiquement edictees pour une categorie de contractants comme les consommateurs.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Benson, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064714j.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch953</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w106g"><dcterms:title>Modeling and simulation of morphological phenomena in discotic mesophases subjected to extensional flows</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1994</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Singh, Arvinder Pal</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In the first part of the present study, a phenomenological theory describing the microstructure of discotic mesophases under the influence of extensional flows is developed. The theory is then used to develop the governing equations for the uniaxial extensional flow of uniaxial discotic mesophases, which is the main type of flow encountered in the spinnline of the fiber-spinning manufacturing process. The driving forces for flow-induced morphological phenomena are identified. The unit sphere description is used to discuss and classify the analytical and numerical results. Parametric studies are performed using the alignment Deborah number, the nematic potential, and different initial microstructural conditions. The average orientation of the mesophase fluid is found to lie anywhere in a plane perpendicular to the extension direction, which agrees with existing experimental observations. In the second part of this thesis, the theory is generalized to describe the microstructure of discotic mesophases in various types of extensional flows. A comprehensive flow classification based on the orienting strength and aligning strength of various industrially relevant flows is given. In the last part of the thesis, the theory is extended to model flow-induced biaxiality in uniaxial discotic liquid crystals subjected to uniaxial extensional flows.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rey, A.
