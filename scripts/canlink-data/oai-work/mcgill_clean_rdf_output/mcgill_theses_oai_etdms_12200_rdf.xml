In response to the insuing demand for geological maps the Geological Survey of Canada has undertaken to systematically map the region on a 1 mile to 1 inch scale. In 1950 and 1951 the writer carried out this work east of Goldfields by mapping Forget Lake and Nevins Lake map-areas ( Blake 14, 15 ). The main interest of these areas at present is in their nearness to the scene of active prospecting and development and in the continuation of the now-famous St. Louis fault they contain. The present work includes the results of the field investigations and subsequent laboratory studies. The Forget Lake and Nevins Lake map-areas lie between longitudes 107°45’ and 108°15’, and latitude 106°45’ and the north shore of Lake Athabasca. They have a combined width of l7½- miles and extend northward from the lake shore for a distance of about 22 miles to within 17 miles of the Northwest Territories. Thus, the area under study is nearly square and approximately 390 square miles in extent. The mining town of Goldfields, situated on the north shore of Lake Athabasca, is nine miles west of the southwest corner of the area. The Indian settlement of Fond du Lac, the next closest community, is situated, as the name indicates, at the end of the lake twenty miles east of the area.

Great accuracy in the initial calibration of the radar is necessary to avoid increase of error in the corrected rain intensities with depth into the rain shower. A radar calibration error of plus or minus 15% in rain intensity, or approximately 1 db in power level, is amplified by attenuation corrections, until at a depth into the shower equivalent to 100 mm hr^-1 miles, the rain intensity determination may be in error by a factor of 2. The effect of calibration error increases rapidly with decreasing wavelength in the range 10 - 3 cm. For accuracy in attenuation correction comparable with the experimental accuracy possible with non-attenuating radars, wavelengths greater than about 7 cm should be used.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, J.

The study of the lignin products from these and other chlorination processes suffered from the presence of the carbohydrate fraction and from the pressure of the industrial point of view. Moreover, the conditions employed in industry were not necessarily the most advantageous for fundamental lignin studies, so that many lignin products were often highly chlorinated and badly degraded. This circumstance led to the abandonment of chlorination as a means of studying lignin structure. Some years ago, it was found possible to isolate most of the lignin from wood in a state that was only slightly chemically changed. The product, periodate lignin, was a light brown powder retaining the original morphological detail of the wood and differing from most other isolated lignins in retaining the original insolubility of lignin in organic solvents, while still behaving as lignin in situ towards a standard bisulfite cook. The availability of this material meant that fundamental studies could now be performed without the complication of the carbohydrate fraction. The effect of chlorine under alkaline conditions was then investigated on periodate lignin and it was shown that minimum oxidation and chlorination occurred at about pH 12.

The investigation was carried out in conjunction with field work done in May and June of the same years in a search for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Dermacentroxenus rickettsi (Walbach)) and tularaeoeia (Pasteurella tularensis (McCoy and Chapin)), in the two species of ticks, Dermacentor variabilis (Say) and Dermacentor andersoni Stiles, which occur in south-eastern and south-western Saskatchewan respectively. The survey disclosed that Richardson’s ground squirrel harboured many ectoparasites other than fleas; upon examination, these proved to be ticks, mites and lice. A search of the literature failed to reveal a comprehensive paper on the ectoparasites of C. r. richardsonii. Thus, it was decided that a study should be made. The following pages are a result of this work. A parasitological survey of the genus Citellus was made in Manitoba by McLeod in 1933. This entailed collecting and identifying ecto- and endo-parasites. Five species of ectoparasites were identified: Dermacentor venustus, Liponyssus occidentalis, Liponyssus montanus, Ceratophyllus bruneri, Linognathoides montanus.

This tends to mask the higher growth rate and possibly higher nutrient requirements of the initial four week period. Current research indicates that growth rate and efficiency of feed utilization can be improved by increasing the protein content and otherwise providing better nutritional balance of the ration. This raises the question of the adequacy of presently recommended vitamin allowances under the conditions of higher growth rate and feed efficiency now possible. The influence of parental nutrition on the vitamin content of the egg, hatchability and growth of chicks fed deficient diets has been observed repeatedly. Little evidence has been advanced, however, to demonstrate that these differences in egg reserves can affect the growth of chicks fed rations of the recommended vitamin content. It is the purpose of this study to investigate the vitamin requirements of the chick during the initial month of life and to determine if they may be modified by more rapid rate of growth and different vitamin reserves in the newly-hatched chick.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nikolaiczuk, N.

Various methods of solving this problem have been developed, Many methods are dependent on farmer interest for their success, in others a small allowance is made for crop loss and inconvenience caused by the presence of tests on the farm. Some local problems are studied by technical men, other studies are dependent on the accuracy of the farmer co-operator. The Experimental Farms Service of the Federal Department of Agriculture has conducted experiments dealing with local problems through Illustration Stations; the Agricultural Colleges through local tests, and the farmers themselves have organized into Crop Improvement and other Associations in attempts to solve some of their own problems. All of these methods serve a useful purpose, particularly where they are close to a centralized station with its available technical staff and certain crop and other tests of short duration may be laid down and managed by trained personnel.

Considerable change in public welfare principles, in Canada, United States, Great Britain and other western democracies, bas taken place during the last two decades. This transition has been away from the palliative type of public welfare which developed after the passing of the Elizabethan Poor Law and toward the ameliorative type of public welfare programmes which arose in these countries out of the 1930 depression. In Canada and the United States casework and social services have been incorporated in some public assistance programmes. In European countries the programmes were established earlier than in Canada and have created protection in many areas through social insurance. The trend there has been toward providing more social security through material assistance such as adequate housing, through public housing projects, and government sponsored medical facilities.

A study of the insect was initiated in the spring of 1950, in Newfoundland, by the Division of Forest Biology, Dominion Department of Agriculture. The object of the study was to determine what factors influence the rise and fall of looper populations. Unfortunately, the outbreak had reached its peak when the study was started. In 1951 populations had fallen to an endemic level, resulting in rather meagre information on many aspects of the investigation. Biological and population studies of the hemlock looper and associated insects were carried out by the writer and an assistant at a summer field station established near Lake St. George, St. George’s District, Newfoundland. The station was used from May to September in 1950 and 1951. Studies on the external morphology of all developmental stages of the species were made at the Dominion Entomological Laboratory, Fredericton, N. B.

Birch, once considered as little better than a weed tree, is now in great demand as the source of an increasingly popular and useful hardwood. This intensive utilization of birch wood could have revitalized the old hardwood industries of the east and might even have encouraged the establishment of new ones had not the source of raw material been drastically reduced by an insidious malady now generally known as birch ‘dieback’. Fullerton (1952) sums up the past, present, and future status of birch from the industrialists’ viewpoint in these words:- “A fact to be reckoned with is that birch wood has never been so much in favour or demand, for either industrial or decorative purposes, as at present. Once used mostly as fuel for home fires it now ... ranks among the high class woods of the world. Present demand for birch is for use in manufacture of flooring, interior house finish, doors, board lumber, veneer and plywood, furniture, tool handles, implements and body parts, and in recent years airplane frames. The shortages are not imaginary or artificial.

Because root rot diseases are very variable in their symptom expression, they are frequently overlooked as the abnormal condition is often attributed to drought, wind, frost or other causes. For these reasons it is difficult to estimate the damage caused exclusively by root rots. It is generally agreed that the fungus Helminthosporium sativum P.K. &amp; B. is of prime importance in the root rot complex affecting barley and wheat. By plating tests of seed samples of barley and wheat grown in representative areas of Canada, Greaney (1944) showed that the most important pathogen present was H. sativum. Oswald (1950) in California found the four primary pathogenic fungi attacking barley and wheat, in their order of apparent economic importance, to be Helminthosporium sativum, Fusarium roseum f. cerealis, Ophiobolus graminis and Fusarium nivale. Simard and Ludwig (1946) found that, in the years 1942 and 1943, 65 per cent of the Quebec grown barley seed samples examined by them carried H. sativum. The significance or Helminthosporium sativum in the barley and wheat growing areas is indicated by estimates of the damage caused by this fungus.

The lowlands were the first lands in Quebec to be settled, and they have become the most densely populated, as well as being the most productive agricultural region in the province.· The Richelieu River, flowing north from Lake Champlain, and almost parallel to the St. Lawrence, crosses the Montreal Plain, a section of the lowlands, and for most of its length the river valley may be regarded today as a cross-section of this part of Quebec. The land on either aide of the river is, then, very flat, and the Richelieu Valley is not an obvious physical unit. In order to delimit the area to be studied, the land included within the drainage system of the Richelieu in Quebec was delineated and this line was adopted as the boundary. A few minor changes were made, and these are considered in the following paragraphs.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Summers, W.

A practical application of this property has been the use of bacteriophage for the identification or phage typing of certain strains of a given species.  Fisk (1942) introduced a method of phage typing of staphylococci which has been successfully used for tracing sources of infection in epidemic outbreaks of staphylococcal enterotoxin food-poisoning and of staphylococcal infections of the skin in babies in maternity hospitals.  Although this method is relatively simple and rapid, many strains of staphyloccoi are resistant to the action of the available phages and the absolute specificity of the phage types is questionable.  The purpose of this work is to investigate the growth and multiplication requirements and the stability of the staphylococcus bacteriophages now available, and to use anti-bacteriophage sera (prepared by immunizing rabbits with selected phage strains) as a means for recognition of specificity.  If the phages could be divided into a few representative groups, it is hoped that by a careful selection of these phages, a simpler method of phage typing applicable in every laboratory may be developed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kalz, G.

On rencontre ici, à son moment le plus sublime, le travail d’un grand talent. Grâce au don de Hugo de décrire les choses longtemps disparues de la manière la plus éclatante, grâce à son immense imagination créatrice, on se sent, dès les premières lignes du roman, dans le Paris de 1482 - dans son atmosphère, parmi ses habitants. Mais quand, après avoir lu le dernier mot, on ferma le livre et revient à 1952, on peut se demander: ces descriptions sont-elles vraiment historiques?- ces personnages qui pensent et agissent dans le vieux Paris, sont-ils vraiment du moyen âge? Cette thèse est une étude du. moyen âge dans “Notre-Dame de Paris”; le but est de montrer que Victor Hugo a créé un décor authentique, un tableau original et puissant, une vision hallucinante du vieux Paris et de sa grandiose cathédrale, mais qu’il n’a pas réussi dans ce cadre magnifique à mettre en scène des êtres qui, par leurs idées et leurs sentiments, évoquent leurs prototypes de 1482: l’intrigue mince, les personnages factices et conventionnels évoquent beaucoup plus des romantiques du XIXe siècle que des âmes du XVe siècle.

The action of this hormone was shown to be exerted on the fully developed mammary gland, causing the induction and maintenance of lactation (Nelson, 1936). This role of the hormone has even been of economic interest since prolactin for a time was used in Britian to prevent the decline in the spring in milk production of cows. More recently, there have been reports that prolactin may have other effects in the body besides its function in lactation. It is thought to induce the secretion of hormones from the corpus luteum; but here again, only when the gland is fully developed and ready to function. In 1947 when the present problem was undertaken, almost nothing was known about the behavior of the hormone in the animal body. Questions such as “where does it go, and what does it do?” could not have been answered. The search for answers to questions like this are a proper responsibility of modern endocrinology. As tools for investigations of this nature, radioactive isotopes are proving indispensible, because use of them allows study of the behavior of the hormones in minute doses, and these potent biological entities exert widespread effects when present in almost infinitisimal amounts.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Leblond, C.

For this reason the General Introduction will be limited to a brief description of the most common methods used in the past for the study of the intestinal absorption of carbohydrates, and following this to a consideration of the evidence quoted by Verzar in support of a phosphorylative mechanism of absorption. The plausibility of the phosphorylation theory has gained for it wider acceptance than the proof advanced would seem to warrant, and subsequent researches have been greatly influenced by this concept.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quastel, J.

The early investigators were interested in the effects of bacterial action and consequently were led to investigate the effect of sterilization of both the experimental animals and the dietary substrate.  Pasteur, although he never attempted to do so himself, once declared to the Academy of Science that he hoped to see a research worker attempt to rear an animal under strictly aseptic conditions.  Much of the nutritional literature is concerned with a continuation of this argument.  Even today, such eminent workers as Wigglesworth (93), Mansour (63) (64), and Koch (57) (580 (59) are unwilling to define the role played by bacteria in nutrition.  Bacteria, regardless of their role, fall into two main categories: those contained in the food; and those living in the mycetomes, which in some cases communicate with the gut.  The subject is important because of the fact that bacteria may be capable of fixing free nitrogen or of converting one type of amino acid to another.  For very precise work, undoubtedly bacterial action is an important factor.  However, in some cases, it is possible to neglect the question of the action of bacteria on the food.  In the natural state, the food is certainly contaminated with bacteria, and under normal conditions, there is no such things as asepsis. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Stanley, J.

The first method seemed to be the most desirable since quinoline from coal-tar is an inexpensive material and potassium permanganate costs less than hydrogen peroxide. Previous publications dealing with this oxidation give low and inconsistent yields. Therefore, it was of interest to improve the method of oxidation of quinoline with potassium permanganate.

It is shown that the activity is, in reality, complex and arises from (1) C134 (32 min) formed from the K nuclei and (2) I128 127 (25 min) formed by neutron capture in I127. This is the first example of a strong activity so formed in the McGill cyclotron by capture of the numerous neutrons known to be released in all targets at high energies. In the fall of 1950, D. E. Tilley, J. D. Keys and W. S. Boyle, all members of the McGill Radiation Laboratory, bombarded, in the McGill cyclotron, crystals of iodine and iodine salts with protons of various energies. In newly bombarded crystals (i.e. before any separation of the elements was attempted) they noticed, among other things, an activity of half-life approximately 30 minutes. This particular activity appeared most markedly when the bombarding protons had energies from 30 to 50 Mev. The purpose of the work reported here is to identify this 30 minute activity. Iodine, atomic number 53, has only one stable isotope, I127. Some of the present published knowledge(l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) about the active iodine isotopes, and about the isotopes of xenon (atomic number 54) and other nearby elements, is summarized in Figure 1. The chart shows the relative abundances of the stable isotopes [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

Maurice Maeterlinck naquit en 1862 dans la villa familiale d‘Oostacker, près de Gand. Le paysage belge lui fournit la scène pour Les Sept Princesses: une terre noire de marais, avec des chênes et des saules, des châteaux sombres sur des voûtes, et des canaux sinueux où flottent des cygnes. Le milieu mélancolique de Gand l’inclinait vers le fatalisme de ses premiers ouvrages. Il cherchait toujours la solitude; il aimait beaucoup le silence. Même les sports qu’il choisissait le menèrent d`être seu1: en été, il faisait de longues promenades en barque sur les sombres canaux, il fuyait en bicyclette au bord des grandes prairies solitaires; en hiver, il patinait. Il resta paysan toute sa vie. Il reçut son éducation au Collège des Jésuites aux bords de la Lys. Il détestait les Jésuites; leur enseignement religieux terrifiait son imagination de petit garçon sensible. La peur de l’enfer, qu’ils lui enseignaient laissa indélébile une marque sur sa vie, et sur son être. “On ne devrait pas avoir le droit,” disait-il, “de déformer ainsi de futurs hommes.” (l) Pour faire plaisir à ses parents, il devint avocat, mais son inaptitude à la profession juridique était bien apparente.

The object of this thesis is to explain the deviations of the curves for floodway No. 4, employing detailed hydraulic tests and investigations. First part of the investigations consisted of the following: a) Measurements and plot of free surface profile. b) Measurements of pressure on the downstream face of the spillway. c) Measurements of the flow velocity along streamlines and throughout the nappe. During all above measurements and investigations, the upstream river bottom topography of the model was left unchanged. A converging of streamlines and angularity of flow was found to be existing, as represented on page 34. This observation as well as other data of investigations necessitated certain changes in the topography of the upstream river bottom.
