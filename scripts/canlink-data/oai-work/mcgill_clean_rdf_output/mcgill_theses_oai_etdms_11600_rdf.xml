(SN2 mechanism) In acetone-water, “S” dimerizes at a rate independent of “S” concentration. With increasing water concentration, a simultaneous increase in E and rate occurs. At low temperatures dimerization is the main reaction with some hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of the SH+ ion in a variety of acids in excess shows inhibition by both H+ and Cl-. Mechanisms are proposed for the reactions studied. Deacidification of RDX-B has been found possible by heating the solid in the systems nitrobenzene-water and TNT-water. Deacidification is also possible by heating RDX-B dry or in water slurry above 1200C. The acidity in RDX-B is not due to HNO3 or Ac2O, and only partly due to HOAc. The acidic component is mainly some compound, as yet undetermined, which readily hydrolyses to give N20, CO2, and other products of non-acidic character.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.

In view of the inadequacy of classical organo-analytical methods, physico-chendcal methods have assumed paramount importance. These methods· include data from the ultra-centrifuge, osmotic pressures, viscosity, lowering of freezing points, etc. Of these, lowering of freezing point can not be used for molecular weights above 5000, at which point the order of magnitude of the effect becomes so small as to make its use impracticable. The ultra-centrifuge is lindted in use on account of the large initial expense of the apparatus. The viscosity method, as a result of its extreme simplicity, has been used extensively in industry. However, the inherent uncertainty as to the interpretation of the results limits its value very strictly.

In practice, it has been found necessary to stop the reaction af'ter 80% conversion of the monomers. owing to formation of insoluble gel at higher conversions. Hence, recovery of unreaoted monomers from the reaction system is an economic necessity, representing a considerable proportion of the plant equipment and operation encountered in commercial production of the polymer. In both the styrene and the butadiene recovery systems insoluble, so-called, popcorn polymers are for.med which differ from the previously known polymers of' these compounds whose properties have been extensively investigated (1).[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.

The energy is transferred from the boron atom by collisions between the atoms of the two elements. In an arc the concentration of the dampening eleffient depends upon the volatility of the compound form1in which it is used, and the reduction caused therefor varies from compound to compound. This is not so for the spark. The addition of a third element with a line of just shorter wavelength than both the boron and the dampening line and which is excited at the voltage beine used, lessens the dampening effect.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Foster, J.

One of the avenues of approach was that of high temperature, vapor-phase catalysis. By this means, the production of olefins, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, and the carrying out of a variety of other types of organic reactions has been accomplished. It has believed that this type of reaction might be a fruitful source of both butadiene and styrene, the chief components of the particular synthetic rubber favored by the Government in its program.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.

It seemed most likely that these properties would be obtained in a nitrated polymeric compound. The polyamides of succinic, malic, and tartaric acids were prepared, and the products of their nitration were investigated. It was found that a satisfactory succinic acid - ethylene diamine polymer could be prepared, and could easily be nitrated. The product, though possessive of detonating qualities, was not adequately stable for use as a military explosive. DiffiCulties were encountered in the preparation of satisfactory polymers from maliC and tartaric acids with ethylene diamine, due to the presence of the substituent hydroxy groups. However, an interesting and original study of the relative behaviour of these compounds was made.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Nicholls, R.

For each set of conditions, three curves have been obtained on the basis of ammonia consumed, formaldehyde consumed and material precipitated with mercuric chloride. At o0 c. the three rate curves tend to approximate one another in a large excess of runmonia but are widelg separated in excess formaldehyde. The reverse is true at 35 c. The reaction is characterized by a high initial rate of formation of hexamine, this rapid rate being maintained to a lower yield of hexamine the more dilute the solution. Ihe existence of a stable by-product in excess formaldehyde is indicated by the variation in final yields of hexamine, when these are calculated on the basis of formaldehyde consumed, ammonia consumed, or material precipitated by mercuric chloride.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.

An upper limit to the initial rate exists at extremely high molar ratios.
