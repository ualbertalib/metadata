Many of the scientific ideas which underlie a great field of his poetic imagery, and much of the Elizabethan Medicine to which he constantly referred, have now been forgotten.

The difference in length of the lower extremities, even though otherwise normal, produces a limp and a pelvic obliquity with a compensatory scoliosis of the spine. We can dismiss the problem of a discrepancy in the upper limbs as there is no functional disability from a pure difference in length.

Entre cette date et celle de sa mort, il écrivit vingt-six contes et romans. Candide fut publié en 1759, alors que Voltaire, à soixante-quatre ans, avait conquis une réputation universelle et une influence considérable, grâce à ses oeuvres littéraires et à sa prodigieuse correspondance. Candide est une des missives lancées de Ferney, destinée à combattre l'optimisme vague des disciples de Leibnitz et à ridiculiser Rousseau et sa thèse que l'homme est foncièrement bon et la civilisation mauvaise.

Sols of cellulose particles in distilled water were prepared and partially fractionated by centrifuging. Extinction angle measurements, with an estimated experimental error of +/- 1°, were made on these sols. The particle length distribution of one of the sols was determined from electron microscope measurements. An extinction angle vs. velocity gradient curve was calculated, for this distribution, using the Peterlin and Stuart theory for the orientation of rigid ellipsoids in conjunction with the Sadron theory for polydisperse systems. This curve fits the experimentally determined extinction angle data within the limits of experimental error.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mason, S.G.

More recently, attempts have been made to establish "critical levels" of the mineral elements necessary for normal crop growth in various organs of the plants themselves. Both of these procedures have met with some degree of success, but much work remains to be done in standardizing the methods, particularly those of the latter group, against field performance.
