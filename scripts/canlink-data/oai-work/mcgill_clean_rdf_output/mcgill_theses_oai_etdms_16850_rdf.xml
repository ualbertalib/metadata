Some of the critics who feel that Vaughan completely fulfills the requirements in the definition of a mystic (which may vary with different critics) or who assume Vaughan is a mystic and, without “proving” his mysticism, discuss his poetry as being “mystical,” are listed below.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Malloch, A.

Most investigators of mediated generalization (see Osgood, 1953, for review} infer that same "generalizing" or "mediating" process links the two stimuli, and hence a response conditioned to one of them tends to become "linked" to the other by this process. A special case of mediated generalization occurs when the stimuli are words or symbols which are semantically related to one another.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambert, W.

This increase in importance is considered by many as due to the widespread use of insecticides which have killed the predators that previously kept mites under control. It has created a need for specific acaricides of relatively low toxicity to insects. Many such have appeared on the market. Some have been adequately tested, many have not.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tq598.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741w315</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject/><dc:subject>Entomology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
