Pseudomonas fragi CRDA 323 and Aspergillus niger CBS 131.52 were considered to be good lipase producers, whereas, those from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 795 and Rhizopus oryzae ATCC 34612 as weak ones; all four microorganisms produced maximal amount of extracellular lipases by batch fermentation after three-four days of incubation in a continuously stirred tank reactor. The lipases were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and characterized with respect to pH, kinetic parameters and molecular size. The lipases from P. fragi and P. putida were optimal at pH 8.5 and 8.0, respectively, whereas those from A. niger and R. oryzae were optimal at pH 7.5. The A. niger lipase had the lowest V$ sb{max}$ value $ rm(0.51 times 10 sp3 U min sp{-1});$ R. oryzae the highest $ rm (1.86 times 10 sp3 U min sp{-1}).$ The K$ sb{m}$ values for P. fragi, P. putida, A. niger and R. oryzae lipases were 0.70, 1.18, 0.97 and 0.98 mg ml$ sp{-1},$ respectively.

The study of animal models of spinal cord injury, especially the chronic spinal cat, has shown that monoaminergic drugs can modulate locomotion and spinal reflexes. Clonidine, a noradrenergic agonist, and cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, have each been associated with improved walking in SCI subjects. Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently prescribed for spasticity in SCI patients, but its effects on walking have not been quantified. The objective of this doctoral project was to compare the effects of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen on walking in incomplete SCI subjects. Subjects were evaluated on a motorized treadmill. Severely disabled subjects required harness support for their evaluations. The treadmill and harness system are described in detail, and their potential uses in the evaluation and rehabilitation of gait are discussed. A repeated single-subject design was employed for the twelve subjects. The greatest effects were found in the the subjects with greater severity of disability. Cyproheptadine was associated with greatly reduced need for assistance, increases in maximum treadmill speed (MTS) and reduced clonus, among other improvements in walking patterns. Clonidine was associated with increases in MTS, and a generally more upright posture, among other improvements in walking patterns. Baclofen was not associated with changes in walking, although two subjects showed small improvements following washout of baclofen. Among subjects with less severe motor disability, drug effects were less marked. Following washout of cyproheptadine or clonidine, subjects frequently retained walking improvements such as increases in MTS and reduced need for assistance that had first been evident in the drug periods.

Combinations of urea and TSP or KCl might improve N and P use efficiency primarily through pH changes. Mixtures of urea, TSP and KCl, either compacted or blended, were studied as to NH$ sb3$ volatilization, denitrification and P transformation in soils, and N and P use efficiency in crops. Soils studied included a Ste. Rosalie clay (Humic Gleysol), an Ormstown silty clay loam (Humic Gleysol), a Chicot sandy clay loam (Grey Browm Luvisol), a St. Bernard loam (Melanic Brunisol) and an Upland loamy sand (Humo Ferric Podzol). Triple superphosphate or KCl reduced urease activity and delayed urea hydrolysis primarily through acidification. Ammonia volatilization decreased when urea was surface-applied with TSP or KCl. The depressive effect of TSP on NH$ sb3$ volatilization was reduced and the KCl effect was increased in the soil with high exchangeable acidity. Phytotoxicity from banded urea, NO$ sb2 sp-$ accumulation and denitrification declined with added TSP. Urea hydrolysis caused a rise in pH and dissolution of organic matter in soils, and as a result, Mehlich (3) and water extractable P increased when urea were banded with TSP. Corn yield and N and P use efficiency were improved with application of mixtures of TSP and urea as compared with urea or TSP alone. Compacted mixtures of urea and TSP or KCl were superior to blended mixtures, possible because of the intimate association of fertilizer dissolution products. Compacted mixtures of urea and TSP or KCl hold promise for improved agricultural productions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacKenzie, A. F.

My focus is the libertine poems of Donne, Suckling, Carew, Lovelace, and Rochester. I situate the lyrics in a period of historical change, an age of epistemological and ontological questioning. Libertine lyrics concern inconstancy on various levels, from the sexual to the ontological, and they explore the problems of freedom, human nature, identity, and individualism. I argue that the libertine's inconstant selfhood is a creative "solution" to a historical dilemma. This conception of inconstant selfhood is also a response to courtly prescriptions of the behavior of poets and courtiers, a way of claiming an authoritative voice and individualistic freedom. My examination of seventeenth-century libertine lyrics shows that, as part of a transitional age, the poems manifest a contradictory character and they reveal an ideological inconsistency. However, in the final analysis, the imaginative answer to the period's problem of mutability and displacement that libertine lyrics offer turns out to be unsatisfactory. In tracing the development of seventeenth-century libertine lyrics, I suggest that the poems constitute an experimental and transitional development in the lyric tradition of male confessional desire.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lieblein, Leanore (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53wx31w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf84g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Libertines in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Self in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht32z"><dcterms:title>Formation and stability of Sm2Fe17 carbides</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mao, Ou.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Phase formation and transformation in mechanically alloyed iron-rich Sm-Fe-C is the principal subject of this thesis. Ternary Sm-Fe-C is a complicated system. The strategy was therefore to start with a binary system. A series of mechanically alloyed R$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$ powders were investigated for a better understanding of both the Sm-Fe alloy system in general and the Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$ compound in particular. The objective was to learn (1) what is the steady-state in the mechanically alloyed R$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17},$ and (2) how the 2-17 structure is formed from the mechanically alloyed precursors. Phase formation and transformation in the mechanically alloyed Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$C$ sb{x}$ with various carbon contents was then studied. The objective in this case was to learn (1) how the 2-17 structure with interstitial carbon is formed, (2) what is the maximum C content in the 2-17 structure, the critical content $x sb{c},$ and (3) what phase(s) is (are) formed with $x&gt;x sb{c}.$ Phase transformation from Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$C$ sb{x}$ to Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{14}$C was the second subject for study. As required by this study, the grain refinement process was investigated first. The objective was to prepare the nanocrystalline Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$C$ sb{x}$ with various grain sizes. Emphasis was on the ball milling of Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$/graphite mixture in the hope of forming a nano-scale mixing of Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$ and graphite by ball milling. Solid-solid reaction between the Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$ and graphite leading to the formation of nanocrystalline Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$C$ sb{x}$ was then studied. The phase transformation from Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$ was carried out with nanocrystalline Sm$ sb2$Fe$ sb{17}$C$ sb{x}$ samples. Samples prepared by other methods were also studied. The objective was to learn (1) what the transformation product is and (2) what the kinetics of the phase transformation and its grain size dependence are.

Towards this end, the elaboration of a new heterobicyclic structure, imidazo-oxazaphosphorine such as 56, is reported. This unstable intermediate led to the highly diastereoselective synthesis of simple phosphite triesters upon reaction with various alcohols. Two new types of sterically hindered chiral oxazaphosphorinanes 135 and 146 were then synthesized from cholesterol and camphor respectively. These structures, derived from $ gamma$-aminoalcohols possessing a tertiary alcohol function, could be isolated and characterized. They revealed very reactive in acidic conditions and led to rearrangements. Finally, oxazaphosphorinane 188 derived from 1,2-O-isopropylidene-D-xylofuranose, was synthesized and characterized. The introduction of a participating group adjacent to the leaving phosphorothioate group led to the fast release of the phosphorothioate moiety. This new chiral auxiliary was successfully used as a precursor in the diastereoselective synthesis of a T-T phosphorothioate dimer, in a diastereomeric ratio of 28.5:1.* ftn*Please refer to dissertation for diagrams.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Just, G.
