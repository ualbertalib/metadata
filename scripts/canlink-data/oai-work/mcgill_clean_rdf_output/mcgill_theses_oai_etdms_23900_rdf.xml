It was determined that newly synthesized LPS I (the prominent LPS species under the conditions employed) initially enters an LPS fraction which can be released from the cell wall along with periplasmic material. This is followed by rapid entry of the newly synthesized LPS into a loosely bound LPS fraction (released from the cell wall by washing with NaCl) before final insertion into the outer membrane. The inhibition of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol was observed to have little or no effect on the rate of translocation of newly synthesized LPS. In contrast, both the respiratory inhibitor NaCN (10 mM) and the proton ionophore 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS, 30 (mu)M), if added during the chase period, resulted in an immediate and complete inhibition of further LPS translocation. The results suggest an independence of the LPS transloction process from continued protein synthesis, but a requirement for an energy source. It was observed that newly synthesized LPS sedimented to a lower density position than previously formed LPS on sucrose density gradients, and displayed a faster migration rate during electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyarylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). This indicated compositional differences between the two LPS populations. Extended electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE separated both newly synthesized and previously formed LPS I into a number of distinct radiolabelled peaks and shoulders, indicating compositional microheterogeneity within each species. The fate of added radiolabelled galactose was also investigated. A one minute pulse with {('14)C} galactose resulted in a preferential labelling of components associated with the cell wall such that 57.3% of the total w</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r868g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz515</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Marine bacteria.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Translocation (Genetics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Endotoxins.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Af4752h491"><dcterms:title>A study of microbial spoilage of beef stored at chill temperatures /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Farber, Jeffrey Mark.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Initial experiments were conducted to determine the microbial development in blocks of ground beef. In the top layers of the meat, Pseudomonas spp. predominated. Attempts were made, as well, to measure the microenvironmental changes occurring in ground beef using pH, oxygen, and redox potential micro-electrodes. Some of the extrinsic (relative humidity, O(,2)), as well as intrinsic factors (pH, redox potential, ions, nutrients) affecting microbial development in aerobically stored meats, were examined. The decrease in glucose levels observed during the aerobic storage of longissimus dorsi (l. dorsi) muscle at 4(DEGREES)C, was accompanied by an increase in the activity of glucose dehydrogenase, and by the appearance of gluconate and 2-ketogluconate on the meat surface. The attachment of various meat spoilage organisms to l. dorsi muscle was studied. Generally, the pseudomonads attached in higher numbers than the other bacteria, but possessed lower attachment strengths. Investigations on the attachment of two competing organisms to l. dorsi muscle demonstrated that limited competition occurs between the organisms. A model of the microbial ecology of aerobically stored fresh beef was developed, based on existing evidence. Various chemicals were added to minced or whole meat to evaluate their effectiveness as food preservatives. As a single compound, potassium sorbate appeared to have the greatest potential as a meat preservative. Meats &gt; into solutions of 5.0% potassium sorbate for 1 min had their shelf-life substantially increased as compared with control samples &gt; into water.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh18h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752h491</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cold storage.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meat -- Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Food -- Preservation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Beef -- Storage.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mc691"><dcterms:title>Algorithms and data structures for the implimentation of a relational database system</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Orenstein, J.

The theory which is developed on the principles of probabilistic micromechanics, introduces from the onset spatial and temporal scales relevant in the dynamic analysis. A general formulation of the microdynamics of a three-dimensional solid is given in terms of an abstract dynamical system; the analysis is then specialized to the kinematic subspace of the general state space, whereby the former is found to possess the topological structure of a Hilbertian-Sobolev space. The abstract dynamical system in the microdynamics theory is developed explicitly for the wave propagation in a semi-infinite bar of a polycrystalline solid with an arbitrary cross-section. The microstructure of the solid is taken to consist of cubic grains with random physical properties. The existence of an internal and a macroscopic time is postulated, which permits the formulation of the evolution of the wave motion first in a one-dimensional solid by means of a four parametric Markovian operator having a semi-group property. This model of the cubic solid structure is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to a "generalized wave equation" of the continuum theory. A more general model of the wavefront evolution for a three-dimensional solid is then given in terms of a super-martingale (parametrized by the macrotime) on a generalized random field. It is shown that numerical results for the wave propagation in a discrete solid in accordance with the new microdynamics theory can be obtained by the application of the Monte-Carlo simulation method. A comparison of these results with known classical and random continuum theories is given.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv13z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv12p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Solids -- Dynamics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n412v"><dcterms:title>A theoretical study of tunneling states in metallic glasses : structural models and superconductivity</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lewis, Laurent J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Various aspects of the tunneling states problem in metallic glasses are examined. As a first step, a computer model based on the analogy between local environments in crystalline and amorphous states is developed and used to generate and relax structures for two specific materials, namely Ni(,80)P(,20) and Cu(,33)Zr(,67). The model is found to give a physically realistic picture of the systems examined, in particular by properly accounting for short-range order effects. The structures are then analyzed in terms of single-atom tunneling taking place between two metastable minimum-energy positions. The probability of occurence of such "two-level systems" (TLS's) is shown to be strongly correlated with the degree of relaxation and thus with the density of the system. Further, they are seen to be associated with voids in the structure which disappear upon relaxation, suggesting an analogy with the physical process of annealing metallic glasses below their glass transition temperatures. It is therefore concluded that a reduction of the various low-temperature anomalies in these materials should result from the annealing process. As a verification, the change in superconducting transition temperature T(,c) due to the presence of TLS's is evaluated. In leading to a non-negligible enhancement effect, our model is indeed found to provide a reasonable estimate of the observed drop in T(,c), thus corroborating our hypothesis of a reduction of the TLS density of states upon thermal relaxation.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zb90n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n412v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Tunneling (Physics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Superconductivity.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metallic glasses.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6w924c54g"><dcterms:title>Production of nitrous oxide by nitrification and the effect of acetylene on nitrifying bacteria</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Hynes, Russell K.

A fairly classical construction scheme, in which the objects of the new category are defined as "formal limits" of diagrams of the given one, is carried out in two specific examples. In the case of the exact completion (')C of a finitely complete category C, we look at "formal coequalizers" of equivalence spans of C, which end up being the quotients (in (')C) of the corresponding equivalence relation. The objects of (')C are hence objects of C together with an equivalence span, and its morphisms are equivalence classes of "compatible" morphisms of C. Thus constructed, (')C is an exact category whose structure is studied in detail in Chapter I, as well as the universal property it satisfies. The second example is the category pro-C of pro-objects, or "formal cofiltered limits" of C. Its objects are cofiltered diagrams of C, but can be characterized in various ways. The known properties of pro-C are summarized, extended and used to lift to pro-C some regularity and exactness properties of C (Chapters II &amp; III). The category of finite sets is an interesting example: its category of pro-objects is equivalent to the category of Stone spaces which is not exact, but whose exact completion in the sense of {9} is the category of compact Hausdorff spaces.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nm24n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wd48w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Categories (Mathematics)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adb78tc81j"><dcterms:title>New techniques in the analysis of geophysical data modelled as a multichannel autoregressive random process</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tyraskis, Panagiotis A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Geophysical measurements can often be described in terms of multichannel, autoregressive data models from which one can directly derive measures of the harmonic composition of the underlying geophysical process and its inherent self-predictability. We explore methods for and uses of multichannel autoregressive data modelling in a geophysical context. Autoregressive data modelling using the least-squares linear prediction method is generalized to multichannel time series. A recursive algorithm is obtained for the formation of the system of multichannel normal equations which determine the least-squares solution of the multichannel linear prediction problem. Solution of these multichannel normal equations is accomplished by the Cholesky factorization method. The corresponding multichannel Maximum Entropy spectra derived from these least-squares estimates of the autoregressive model parameters are compared to that obtained using those parameters estimated by a multichannel generalization of Burg's algorithm. Numerical experiments have shown that the multichannel spectra obtained using the least-squares method provides for more accurate frequency determination for truncated sinusoids in the presence of additive white noise.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n36b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc81j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stochastic processes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geophysics -- Mathematical models.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50ts358"><dcterms:title>The synthesis and characterization of organometallic polysulfanes and polyselenanes of titanium (IV), zirconium (IV), and hafnium (IV) /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McCall, James M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The complexes Cp(,2)M(SH)(,2), where M = Ti and Zr, have been prepared and treated with S(,8) and &gt;N-S(,x)-NN = benzimidazolyl, phthalimidyl and x = 1, 2, to give the metallacyclohexasulfanes Cp(,2)MS(,5).
