Thus, several pieces of works such as D'apres Rembrandt, D'apres Greco, D'apres Durer gave birth to L'OEuvre au noir, Anna soror..., Un homme obscur and Une belle matinee. Denier du reve was rewritten twenty years later. The collection of short stories Nouvelles orientales underwent numerous changes during the course of more than fifty years. The "double" theme marks the different narratives of this work and the revised phenomena contributes to the emergence in all its elements. Therefore, all through this thesis, we will show the events which reveals the presence of the "double" such as a story within a story (mise en abyme) and flashbacks that are present in the narration, the theme of remembrance, the different microcosms contained in the macrocosms, but also the opposing split personalities present in most of the protagonists. In addition, we can discover that these characters are united in creation and in all elements of the cosmos. Also, we have the production of opposing forces between creation and man. In Yourcenar's work, especially in Nouvelles orientales, we notice that in the "double" an absolute quest is presented in its different play of mirrors. It is as if this fusion of the human with the universe brings each character to be part of the Universality, beyond time, space and the world of the material.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p895g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s360</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Yourcenar, Marguerite -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Doubles in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aht24wm136"><dcterms:title>L'opposition savante dans le debat linguistique de la premiere moitie du dix-septieme siecle : Guillaume Du Vair et Francois de La Mothe Le Vayer</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chenevert, Martin.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>When Renaissance linguists took charge of the French language and its evolution, trying to define what French eloquence would be, they relied mostly on classical Greek philosophers' theories about language.

In the same way, during the Renaissance, Ciceronians promoted Aristotelian rhetoric, whereas their opponents, such as Erasmus or Montaigne, revived Plato's thesis.

The model was implemented in Simulink and consists of 6 lumped vascular compartments interconnected by segments allowing unidirectional blood flow. A set of 6 differential equations describe changes in blood volume in the four systemic and two ventricular compartments as functions of time in terms of the pressure across each compartment and the resistances between them. The model was used to investigate why pulmonary venous pressure rises after the onset of left ventricular dysfunction. Special attention was given to the pericardial and peripheral resistance effects. Sensitivity analysis showed that our parameter values and ratios were more appropriate than those of Burkhoff and Tyberg [6]. We conclude that, although stressed volume has a fundamental role in raising the pulmonary venous pressure, contractile strength and systemic arterial resistance also contribute considerably.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bates, J.

The complex geometry of the middle ear was defined using both magnetic-resonance microscopy and histological data. Contributions were made to the locally written software which was used for image segmentation and finite-element mesh generation. The action of the smooth-muscle fibres is modelled by applying a radial load to the model of the tympanic membrane. The radial load is represented by placing load vectors tangential to the model of the tympanic membrane.

This thesis examines both traditional noise suppression algorithms and ones that incorporate an auditory model to achieve better performance. The different auditory models used by these algorithms are examined. A novel approach, based on a method to remove a specific type of noise from audio signals, is presented using a standardized auditory model. The proposed method is evaluated with respect to other noise suppression methods in the problem of speech enhancement. It is shown that this method performs well in suppressing noise in telephone-bandwidth speech, even at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139387f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xt64p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pj200"><dcterms:title>A programmable display system for perceptual stability research /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Fang, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A programmable display system for perceptual stability research is presented.

While these materials possess high strength-to-weight ratio and are corrosion resistant, their durability in water has been not well studied due to the lack of historical data for these fairly new materials. The purpose of this research is to establish the absorption characteristics of a pultruded fiberglass-reinforced polyester composite for a sheet pile wall and quantify the effect of water on long term mechanical properties. The tests conducted were water absorption, tensile strength, flexural strength, and freeze/thaw cycling. An analytical model was developed to establish the nature of the absorption process and prediction of the change in mechanical properties. The results indicated that the water absorption process of the material followed a combination of Fickian diffusion and polymeric relaxation. The moisture saturation was 1.72% for the flange and 3.11% for web. The absorption process modeling indicated that saturation would be reached in 4.5 years for flange and 7 years for web in tap water, at room temperature. The coefficients of diffusion calculated were 4.2 10-6 mm2/s and 3.0 10-6 mm2/s respectively. During the water absorption test at 70°C and in boiling water, a mass loss of the material occurred. Tensile strength was found to decrease with the increase in percentage of water absorbed with no further degradation seen after saturation was reached. There was a decrease of 60% in the tensile strength at saturation. On the other hand, there was no noticeable change in the tensile modulus of elasticity during the water-ageing period. The freeze/thaw cycling test revealed that there were no significant changes in the tensile strength and the modulus after 564 cycles from 4.4°C to -17.8°C.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Shao, Yixin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rk00v.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr86h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Marine and Ocean.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p8971"><dcterms:title>Development of an annular reactor to investigate fouling in UV disinfection systems</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gray, Sandy-Kae A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An annular photo-reactor was designed to investigate precursors and mechanisms thought to promote the fouling of ultra-violet lamps in wastewater disinfection systems. Parameters investigated included temperature of the fouling surface (quartz sleeve) and average fluence applied to the wastewater under irradiation. The reactor was designed to independently control and monitor variations of these parameters. For experimentation, these parameters were manipulated individually and in various combinations to be able to separate those factor(s) that could affect the fouling potential of the system. The compact and mobile unit utilized a standard low-pressure mercury UV lamp surrounded by two concentric sleeves. The annulus immediately surrounding the lamp was used to control temperature (10--50°C) and fluence (10--100 mJ/cm2 using a chemical transmission filter) emitted by the lamp. The outer annulus was used for the passage and irradiation of wastewater flowing at 10--12 L/min (Re ≅ 1,000). A quartz sleeve separated these annuli. Hydraulic and heat transfer properties of the unit were fully characterized, and the stability of system operations was confirmed. Optimal lamp UV output approached 3 mW/cm2 and maximum skin temperatures were 45°C. A cupric sulfate solution (0--2 g/L) in distilled water was determined to be the most stable transmission filter. Application of temperature and fluence control revealed that both parameters influenced the disinfection potential of the unit (achieving 1--4 log reduction of fecal coliforms). Collimated beam tests and Point Source Summation computations were used to model fluence distributions within the reactor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gehr, R.

These considerations reflect what one might call the social norm. An appropriate understanding of consent serves, therefore, to express the social norm as a constraint, which, in turn, acts as a measure of what it means to belong in society. Thus, while consent is often presented as the fundamental principle to be respected in biomedical research, it is in reality, merely one principle to respect among others. These limitations connected to consent are exacerbated in emergency situations where consent is sometimes reduced to mere signature, and in some cases it has been recognized that research can be undertaken without the subject's prior consent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kasirer, Nocholas (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x731.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw47s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medicine -- Research -- Social aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical ethics -- Decision-making.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human experimentation in medicine -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical ethics -- Social aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Informed consent (Medical law)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medicine -- Research -- Moral and ethical aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rz47n"><dcterms:title>A system to detect gradual change in long term EEG /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2001</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Grennan, Eoin David.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A system was developed for detecting gradual changes in background EEG, with a view to simplifying the tedious task of long-term monitoring in the neurological intensive care unit.

A fixed scaling operation is performed so that differentiation between segments using the Euclidean distance between feature vectors relies equally on each feature. Cluster analysis is performed to select five types of EEG that best represent the data spread for each hour. Color-coded circles representing clusters from every hour are mapped on a two-dimensional plot. The relative location of these circles reflects the difference between their associated EEG. Change between hours is detected by observing the movement of circles associated with each hour. Detection of change with this method agreed closely with that observed via manual review but was much simpler.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gotman, J.

The experiments were divided into four parts: (1) preliminary studies on the preparation and characterization of soil that included grinding, sieving, soil texture measurements, total metals content post digestion and the distribution of metals in different soil fractions as well as (2) a comparison of the extraction efficiencies of six chelating reagents toward Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, and Mn. Additionally, the chelating reagent was liberated and recycled by treatment of the metal-complexes with disodium diethyl dithiocarbomate (DEDTC). Additionally, supercritical CO2 was used to extract metal-DEDTC complexes using various surfactants to maintain the metal-DEDTC complexes in suspension. Finally, (4) magnesium metal was evaluated as an alternative method for liberating the water-soluble chelating reagent from the complex so as to be able to recycle this reagent as well. The different approaches were promising in terms of recycling the chelating reagents that suggests a means of optimizing the experimental conditions in future applications.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Marshall, W.

The outcomes of in-hospital death and discharge home (among survivors) were ascertained for the period April 1, 1992 to March 31, 1997, using the Quebec hospital discharge database (Med-Echo). The estimator of variation was the ratio of the hospital-specific observed number of stroke admissions that ended in death or discharge home to the risk-adjusted expected number of deaths or discharged home, obtained using logistic regression. A second stage of analysis involved estimating the contribution of hospital-related factors to the log odds of death or discharge home, using multiple linear regression. Over the five-year period of study, 43,357 acute stroke admissions occurred. For death, the estimator of variation varied 3 fold across hospitals (range of 0.6 to 1.8). For discharge home, the same estimator yielded a 2.6 fold variation (range of 0.5 to 1.3). Non-teaching hospitals are associated with higher rates of death (~OR: 1.3 depending on the number of acute stroke hospital admissions per year and the level of urbanization of the area a hospital is located). Hospitals with 40 to 100 acute stroke admissions per year are associated with higher rates of death (~OR: 1.4 depending on teaching status and level of urbanization). Hospitals situated in urban regions are associated with the lowest rates of discharge home (~OR: 1.1 depending on number of acute stroke admissions and teaching status).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mayo, Nancy E.

These features facilitate application development but are expensive to support; applications written in Java are often much slower than their counterparts written in C or C++. To use these features without having to pay a great performance penalty, sophisticated optimizations and runtime systems are required. We present SOOT, a framework for optimizing Java bytecode. The framework is implemented in Java and supports three intermediate representations for representing Java bytecode: BAF, a streamlined representation of bytecode which is simple to manipulate; JIMPLE, a typed 3-address intermediate representation suitable for optimization; and GRIMP an aggregated version of JIMPLE suitable for decompilation. SOOT also contains a set of transformations between these intermediate representations, and an application programming interface (API) is provided to write optimizations and analyses on Java bytecode in these forms. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework, we have implemented intraprocedural and whole program optimizations. To show that whole program bytecode optimization can give performance improvements, we provide experimental results for 10 large benchmarks, including 8 SPECjvm98 benchmarks running on JDK 1.2. These results show a speedup of up to 38%.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w877.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010s05m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ax059c939n"><dcterms:title>Cyclooxygenase-2 in models of acute lung inflammation : expression of the enzyme and the effect of selective inhibition</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Surgical Research</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Utsumi, Tomoki.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Prostanoids are important mediators of inflammation and tissue homeostasis. Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostanoids from arachidonic acid. Of the two isoforms of COX, COX-1 functions in tissue homeostasis whereas COX-2 is more abundant in inflammation. Selective COX-2 inhibition seems effective in reducing inflammation with fewer side effects compared with non-selective COX inhibitors. In this study, the expression of COX-2 in lung inflammation was investigated in two models, which include acute rejection and antigen-induced inflammation. The effect of selective COX-2 inhibition in these models was also determined. COX-2 was expressed in infiltrating cells in both models, in addition to constitutive expression in bronchial epithelium and bronchial smooth muscle cells. Selective COX-2 inhibition significantly reduced the extent of inflammation in both models. These results suggest that selective COX-2 inhibition may be effective in the treatment of acute rejection and asthma.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Recklies, A.

To offer a better understanding of the textural characteristics of the new Sainte-Anne's Hospital (SAH) modified texture reformed foods, rheological evaluations were performed. Apparent viscosity, consistency coefficient, flow behavior index and yield stress values were calculated for the thickened beverages. Texture profile analyses were performed on the reformed foods. Secondly, to evaluate the impact of SAH's reformed foods on nutritional intake and weight, a 12-week clinical trial was undertaken. Dysphagic frail elderly subjects (n = 17) of a long-term care facility of Montreal were randomly assigned to receive SAH reformed foods or traditional care. The experimental group demonstrated a significant increase in nutritional intake resulting in significant weight gain. These findings suggest that dysphagic frail elderly could reach healthy weight when adequately fed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray-Donald, Katherine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Ramaswamy, H.

This design was used in order to permit the measurement and modeling of changes in various quality parameters as a result of changes in the process variables. The color parameters (L*, a*, and b* values), physical attributes (drip-loss, protein leaching and water holding capacity) and texture parameters (firmness and springiness) in each case were evaluated, and modeled as second order polynomial equations. Artificial Neural Network modeling was employed to investigate its ability in predicting the quality changes in both pressure-treated trout fillets and shrimp samples, and its performance was with statistical models.

Pain intensity was rated on the Coloured Analogue Scale (CAS) and affective quality on the Faces Pain Scale (FPS). In school and hospital settings a Sex by Sweet by Chew interaction was seen on CAS (p = 0.29; p &lt; 0.01) and FPS (p &lt; 0.05; p &lt; 0.05) respectively. A consistent pattern was seen in which chewing reduced and sweet taste increased pain ratings in boys. The opposite effect was seen in girls.

It also examined the existence of group differences in motivation and in perceptions of the work environment. The sample was 117 middle management staff at a Canadian research university, varying in age, level of education, job classification, work unit, and job and institutional tenure. Data was collected using a questionnaire consisting of scales from the management and educational literature. Using multiple regression analysis and MANOVAs, workplace environmental characteristics were found to be predictors of employee motivation. The best predictor of motivation to learn was a composite measure of incentives, while the best predictor of growth need strength was a composite measure of lack of independence and freedom of choice. No group differences in motivational characteristics were found, however, there were differences in perceptions of the work environment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Grutter, Peter (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w1587.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g6865</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j298j"><dcterms:title>The domain specificity of resilience in native adolescents from a remote community /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2000</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Zygmuntowicz, Catherine E.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study is based on Luthar's finding (1991) that resilient inner-city adolescents, those adolescents that displayed high behavioral competence despite high stress, experienced significant difficulties in domains of social-emotional adjustment. The characteristics of resilience were examined among 61 Native adolescents from a remote community. Stress was operationalized by scores on self-report measures of uncontrollable negative life events and demographic stressors. Definitions of social competence were based on school grades, peer ratings, and teacher ratings. In addition, social-emotional adjustment was based on self-report measures of depression and anxiety. Contrary to previous findings, resilient adolescents did not display significant amounts of depression or anxiety. Furthermore, the findings indicate that resilient adolescents have lower levels of anxiety than adolescents from high stress backgrounds with lower levels of competence. The prevailing constructs of social competence and stress, and their appropriateness for the study of resilience in Native adolescents, are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jacob A.

The aspects examined included developmental differences in RT for local and global visual information, the influence of filtering on global and local perception, and role of distracter congruency and compatibility on processing local and global stimuli. At a general level, the findings revealed that participants processed global faster than local stimuli. With the presence of distracters, 6 and 8-year-old participants demonstrated slower RTs for global targets relative to local targets. Distracter congruency or compatibility did not differentially affect global and local processing. However, congruency did appear to be related to differential performance for 6-year old males versus females. These results indicate that the underlying processes involved in global and local perception may be separate, with global perception relying on attentional mechanisms to a greater extent than local perception.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Burack, Jacob A.
