This rapid rate of disappearance at high conversion cannot be accounted for on the basis of changing styrene content during polymerization or upon mercaptan addition to the polymer double bonds. Changes in viscosity of the polymer during polymerization were studied. A decrease was observed in the same conversion range where the rate of the mercaptan disappearance increased. Tertiary hexadecyl mercaptan was applied to the preparation of relatively homogeneous polymers of different composition and molecular size. On the basis of the modifier reaction theory polymers of various compositions but of the same molecular weight were prepared and studied.

[...] The botanist has found that all plants may be divided into two major groups; the members of one group (Vascular plants) have a vein system and are characterized by possessing distinguishable roots, stems and leaves; the members of the other group (Non-vascular plants) which have developed more slowly are without a vein system. [...] Those plants which possess a vein system and are termed the Vascular plants are divided into Spermatophytes or Flowering plants and Pteridophytes or ferns depending on the method of reproduction. The Spermatophytes which are the most highly developed are reproduced by seeds and the Pteridophytes, like all Non-Vascular plants, are reproduced by spores. [...] The chemist has already made some progress in determining chemical differences between the Classes of Spermatophytes, the cellulose, hemicellulose, and certain minor components have been shown to differ and it was naturally of interest to determine if general chemical differences in lignins occurred as seemed likely from earlier work.

The next section deals briefly with some writers prior to the fifth century who were concerned with this problem. It gives some examples of the Greek love of liberty and equality which characterises fifth century thought and is of prime importance in the conception of supreme political power.

In grass the digestibility of true fats was lower.

The mutant wheats studied were an anomalous 41-chromosome homozygous speltoid, B and C Series heterozygous speltoids, sub-normals, sub-compactoids, and a homozygous compactoid. Plants of these different mutants may be distinguished by various characters of the head such as shape of glume and length and compactness of head. These mutants form a series of types grading from those like Triticum spelta L.

Unfortunately, however, the thermal decomposition reactions of these compounds generally involve complicated steps, difficult to untangle, with the result that to deduce a mechanism from the experimental data obtained is, in many cases, little better than pure speculation. Consequently present day trend, in the field of gas kinetics, is to the more simple and elementary processes and for this reason investigations with the lower members of the aliphatic hydrocarbons have been favoured. Since the available information on the reactions of the simple hydrocarbons comes from a variety of sources it is considered desirable to outline briefly, in a general way, the information that can be obtained by various independent methods. Before doing this, however, it is necessary to discuss briefly the essential features of unimolecular gas reactions generally. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maass, O.

In the case of inulin and levan, the chain is made up of anhydro-fructose units, while xylan and other pentosans are linear anhydro-pentose polymers.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hibbert, H.

These sources exhaust the material available to anyone treating this subject in Canada. This work represents an attempt to make the student of English history, sheriff conscious. For as yet, this official has not received the attention rightfully due him as an important dignitary in the county government of England.

Iron ore beneficiation methods are largely determined by the nature of iron ores as well as by the blast-furnace requirements. In modern blast-furnace practice the structure of the ore and the chemical composition are both of importance. Certainly, the higher the iron content and the lower the silica, phosphorus and sulphur, the more desirable the ore becomes, but if its structure is bad, that is, if the blast-furnace gases penetrate the lumps of ore with difficulty, the ore is even less satisfactory than one of poorer chemical composition but more porous structure.

Il a consacré au moins la moitié de son oeuvre à l'étude des complexités des passions de l'amour. Il est d'usage, en effet, de distinguer deux groupes d'ouvrages dans sa production. Le premier groupe est avant tout l'oeuvre d'un psychologue qui regarde dans le coeur de l'homme pour y suivre la naissance et le délevoppement des passions. L'auteur étudie l'individu et les problèmes de son âme. Les derniers romans, cependant, s'éloignent un peu des problèmes de l'individu pour sa préoccuper d'avantage de ceux de la société en général, réflétant ainsi les pensées d'un auteur plus intéressé par la sociologie que par la psychologie. Parce que l'auteur mûri se soucie avant tout du bien de la société, on parle souvent des romans de sa deuxième manière comme de l'oeuvre d'un moraliste, en laissant de côté les premiers romans. Le vrai, pourtant, c'est que le moralists s'est lentement épanoui chez l'auteur comme l'aboutissement natural de ses études sur l'individu. En tant que "physiologists de l'amour moderne," il avait déjà noté les devoirs moraux de l'individu envers le reste de la société. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lariviere, H.
