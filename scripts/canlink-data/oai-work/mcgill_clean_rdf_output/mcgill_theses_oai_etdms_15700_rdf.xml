The poor setting in apparently healthy tomato plants has been shown to depend largely upon the climatic conditions at the time of pollination.

Using the circuit, the time characteristics of the beta-ray Orange Spectrometer are determined to be such that for most coincidence measurements the lower limit of resolution will be determined primarily by the photomultipliers and scintillators, and not the spectrometer. A method for calculating the electron path lengths - and so, times of flight - which can be applied to spectrometers of this type is outlined and tested. The circuit provides a ready means for measuring the time characteristics of the avalanche transistor itself, and such a study is made. On this basis it is shown that the coincidence only “sees” the photomultiplier pulse for that instant at which it reaches a certain predetermined voltage.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, R.

To evaluate the results of analysis by physical methods, by comparing them with the results of chemical analyses. Analyses by physical methods were made by measuring the refractive indices, the lattice constants and the specific gravities of the garnets and plotting them, along with chemical composition, on a three dimensional tetrahedral diagram (after Winchell, 1958). No difference was found between the garnets from diamond bearing and those from non diamond-bearing kimberlites.

Therefore hippuran, an end product of metabolism, and neohydrin, a foreign compound, are rapidly removed from the circulation, and concentrated in the kidney.

The differentiation of the various nuclei within the amygdala has remained essentially unchanged from marsupials to man.

G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main object of this thesis is to solve the following problem, which was raised, a few years ago, by Fine, Gillman and Lambek. If X and Y are triangulable manifolds of dimensions m and n respectively, and if Q(X) is isomorphic to Q(Y), then m=n. (Q(X) is the maximal ring of quotients of the ring of all continuous real valued functions defined on X.) The contents of the thesis is divided into three parts. In the first, we prove some general propositions, which will be needed later. In the second part, we prove that, if X and Y are triangulable manifolds such that the dimension of X is 1 and Q(X) is isomorphic to Q(Y), then the dimension of Y is also 1.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lambek, J.

These theories of human nature are the "notions" referred to in the sub-title of the thesis. It will be realised that in a work of this nature it is impossible to survey the entire range of philosophers who have, at one time or another, been interested in or referred to liberty.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taylor, C.

K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The geology of Ceylon, as it applies to this study, is basic in concept. The most important factors being the resistance of the rocks to weathering and erosion, and the tectonic activity, both local and regional, to which they have been subjected. These are the factors which, under the tropical conditions obtaining, control to a large extent the development of the various landforms characteristic of the area. In general, the views outlined are those at present accepted by the geologists working in the area. No radically new ideas with respect to rock type, lithologies, or stratigraphic sequences are presented. Much of the tectonic history however has been deduced from photogeomorphologic evidence and may not agree entirely with presently held views.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bird, J.

Turner (1) obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of 5-oxo-3,5- seco-A-norcholestane-3-oic acid (lIa) (2), two lactones, m.p. 116-116.5°C and m.p. 109.5-110°C, the latter in large amount. He provisionally assigned to these compounds the structures IXa and VIIIa respectively because of their optical rotations and because hydrogenation of 4- oxacholest-5-en-3-one (IIIa) (3), which should be expected to give lactone IXa, gave the higher melting isomer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Edward, J.

One is quite liable to fall victim to his own prejudices, pre-conceived opinion, likes and dislikes, and, -to use a Marxist concept, to be influenced by one's own social and economic background. This task, however, becomes even more difficult if we consider that the present Hungarian regime and its official organs abroad never are overanxious to publish the truth. Moreover the history of Hungary, and especially the history of the Hungarian Labour movement is, from time-to-time, re-written according to the psychological demands of the current political order. Consequently, it would not be difficult for an effort such as this to fail within a very short time after its conception.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mladenovic, M.

Investigations concerned with the problem of PMD were inaugurated in the Department of Biochemistry, at McGill University in 1957. From the time of its inauguration to the present, the various aspects of this research program have been under the direction of Dr. E. A. Hosein. PMD, in humans, is characterized by the degeneration and atrophy of striated muscle (1), and is accompanied by a number of non-specific biochemical abnormalities which have been shown by numerous investigators to extend to several different aspects of normal muscle metabolism (2-11).</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hosein, E.
