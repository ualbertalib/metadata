A stepped decline in nutritional status has been postulated as a mechanism for malnutrition wherein patients progressively suffer weight loss with each COPD exacerbation. A randomized clinical trial of continuous enteral nutrition could not successfully address whether or not the stepped decline in weight can be prevented. Despite this, sixteen patients admitted for a COPD exacerbation, participated in an observational prospective study wherein anthropometric, biochemical, dynamometric, respiratory, general well-being and energy consumption measures were obtained. Twelve patients had body weights below 90% of ideal weight. The mean energy intake was 107% $ pm$ 30 of estimated resting energy expenditure. Measures were repeated to assess changes during hospitalization. Weight change was a poor indicator of nutritional status. Midarm muscle circumference and handgrip strength appear to be useful as nutritional status indicators among unstable hospitalized COPD patients. Changes in handgrip strength and midarm muscle circumference were closely linked (r =.78, p $&lt;$ 0.0005) and tended to decrease over the course of hospitalization despite clinical improvement. In the absence of adequate nutrition, COPD patients have at least as much risk of developing iatrogenic malnutrition as are other hospitalized medical patients.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray-Donald, Katherine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375x216.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vc29x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lungs -- Diseases, Obstructive -- Nutritional aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nutrition -- Evaluation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z80c"><dcterms:title>US and European product liability applied to the aircraft industry</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1992</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saulais, Claire</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the most important legal issues international aircraft manufacturers have to deal with is product liability for aeroplanes and equipments. Due to the economic importance of passenger claims in some countries, the legal regime the manufacturers are submitted to, may even become a decisive competitive advantage. In order to find out to what extent the major Western legal systems respond differently to the needs of consumer protection, we submit four major national legislations to a detailed analysis working out the most striking particularities. We have a special look at the EEC harmonization attempts in this field and we oppose the European standards to the current legal situation in the US. The results are refined by an exploration of aviation related jurisprudence and legislation. Our study reveals that many differences remain between European and US product liability standards despite apparent approximation of the regimes. The availability of numerous defenses and the less extensive practice with regard to the award of damages lead generally to a more manufacturer-friendly situation in Europe. However, the resulting competitive advantage of European aircraft manufacturers might be compensated by rules of private international law allowing for "forum shopping" which often leads European aircraft manufacturers before US jurisdictions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Haanappel, P.

This proposition seems realistic, even if in past practice the parties seem to have taken a more pragmatic stance. To that end, this propositions also tries to reach an equilibrium between the "rule oriented" and "power oriented" approach by controlling the margin of manoeuver the parties will have in negotiations, should they adopt this agreement.

The first involved culture-independent and dependent analyses which    assessed the diversity and structure of cryosol microorganisms. Active layer communities were    distinct from permafrost communities in DGGE profiles, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries for Bacteria    and Archaea and total cell enumerations and viable cell counts. Findings suggest novel aspects of    Arctic wetland permafrost soil compared to previously studies. Comparisons to other Arctic    permafrost and more temperate wetland 16S rRNA gene clones demonstrated the existence of common    features of cold-adapted communities and Arctic wetlands. The second study was to compare    characterizations from two phylogenetic microarrays (PGMAs) against 6 previously constructed    clone libraries from high Arctic sites. A general environmental PGMA (GE.10) and a PGMA    specifically for cyro-environments (Cryo-PGMA) were tested. The combined data, or "dual-PGMA",    had moderate coverage of the taxa identified in clone libraries (51%) and detected corresponding    genera at a relatively low rate (26%). The dual-PGMA demonstrated capability of reproducing broad    phylogenetic community structures identified in clone libraries and contributed additional    taxonomic detail not found there. The dual-PGMA had comparable sensitivity to other PGMA    platforms and detected taxa occupying 0.6% of the total clone library. Principle coordinate    analysis grouped communities from similar geographical and physical environments. The dual-PGMA    demonstrated a capacity for profiling patterned differences in microbial communities while    providing general approximations of taxonomic structure.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Cette thèse comprenait deux études : la biodiversité de cryosols    arctiques humides et l'examen de deux biopuces à ADN phylogénétiques en utilisant des    échantillons environnementaux du grand arctique canadien.

Les communautés des couches actives étaient clairement    distinctes des communautés du pergélisol dans les profils DGGE, les librairies de clones 16S pour    Bactéries et Archaea de même que les énumérations du nombre total de cellules et du nombre de    cellules viables.

The great demand for clean energy and renewable power can potentially be resolved by    utilizing the process of solar energy conversion. However, the extensive usage of solar energy is    not happening due to the high cost and insufficient efficiencies in existing solar cell devices.    Nanostructured materials, particularly one-dimensional (1-D) nanowires (NWs), have provided new    opportunities to enhance the efficiency by enabling improved photon absorption, electron    transport as well as collection, at a reduced processing cost. Particularly, InN has become an    attractive material for constructing NWs due to its high electron mobility, high chemical    stability, low toxicity, and a narrow bandgap of ~ 0.7 eV that can be tuned to ~ 3.4 eV by    incorporating Ga, which essentially encompasses the whole solar spectrum. In this thesis,    epitaxial growth and characterization of superior quality InN NWs vertically grown on Si, as well    as the first demonstration of InN NWs on Si heterojunction solar cell will be presented.

The energy-transducing complex of    TonB–ExbB–ExbD in the CM helps overcome this obstacle in TonB-dependent transport systems. In    order to further understanding of this multi-component complex, ExbD was purified for use in    phage display (PD) experiments to predict interacting partners and to identify sites of    interaction with other members of the complex. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was carried out to    biochemically validate PD predictions. Affinity-selected peptides from two commercial PD    libraries predicted interactions between ExbD–ExbD and ExbD–TonB. No interaction between    ExbD–ExbB was predicted. Notably, an interaction was predicted between ExbD and the periplasmic    binding protein BtuF of the vitamin B12 transport system. SPR experiments validated the    prediction of interactions between ExbD and TonB. Interaction between ExbD–ExbB was not apparent.    Additionally, TonB–ExbB and ExbB–ExbB interactions were observed. Multi-component SPR analyses    suggested that ExbB and ExbD bind to unique sites on TonB suggesting the role of primary scaffold    for TonB in the complex.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>L'un des traits distinctifs de la membrane externe des bactéries    gram-négatives est son dénuement de toute source d'énergie permettant le transport actif des    nutriments. Ces bactéries font plutôt appel à l'énergie disponible à la membrane cytoplasmique.    Localisé à la membrane cytoplasmique, le complexe de transduction de l'énergie formé des    protéines ExbB, ExbD et TonB permet de surmonter cet obstacle dans les systèmes de transport    TonB-dépendants. Dans le but d'avancer notre compréhension de ce complexe multi-protéique, nous    avons purifié ExbD et l'avons soumis à des expériences de présentation de phage (PP) avec pour    objectif de prédire certains de ses partenaires d'interaction et aussi afin d'identifier ses    sites de contact avec les autres membres du complexe. Nous avons fait appel à la résonance    plasmon de surface (RPS) pour valider nos résultats de PP.Nous fîmes usage de deux librairies de    phages disponibles commercialement, grâce auxquelles nous pûmes prédire qu'ExbD interagit avec    TonB ainsi qu'avec lui-même. Il nous a cependant été impossible de prédire une interaction entre    ExbD et ExbB. Fait digne de mention, nos résultats prédisent une interaction entre ExbD et la    protéine périplasmique BtuF impliquée dans le transport de la vitamine B12.

Malgré que ces méthodes se sont avérées utiles pour    des problèmes de prise de décision séquentielle, elles nepeuvent pas être appliquées avec leur    forme actuelle dans le domaine médical puisqu'elles ne fournissent pas les garanties    généralement requises dans ce genre de domaine.

Reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework to solve sequential planning and decision    making problems in such environments. In recent years, attempts were made to apply methods from    reinforcement learning to construct adaptive treatment strategies, where a sequence of    individualized treatments is learned from clinical data. Although these methods have proved to be    useful in problems concerning sequential decision making, they cannot be applied in their current    form to medical domains, as they lack widely accepted notions of confidence measures. Moreover,    policies provided by most methods in reinforcement learning are often highly prescriptive and    leave little room for the doctor's input. Without the ability to provide flexible    guidelines and statistical guarantees, it is unlikely that these methods can gain ground within    the medical community. This thesis introduces the new concept of non-deterministic policies to    capture the user's decision making process. We use this concept to provide flexible    choice to user among near-optimal solutions, and provide statistical guarantees for decisions    with uncertainties. We provide two algorithms to propose flexible options to the user, while    making sure the performance is always close to optimal. We then show how to provide confidence    measures over the value function of Markovian processes, and finally use them to find sets of    actions that will almost surly include the optimal one.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joelle Pineau (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv92s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw46c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Applied Sciences - Computer Science</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526d309"><dcterms:title>Test-retest reliability of shoulder functional characteristics using measures from the Simulator II in a healthy adult population of women</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boulay, Evelyne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract> Shoulder Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) are prevalent conditions particularly    among women.

In the telescopes of the    VERITAS project the correct interpretation of shower images in the camera plane is only possible    if the plate scale is properly known. Well understood images help to better calculate the shower    parameters, thus allowing more efficient background rejection and more accurate estimation of    primary gamma-ray properties. The VERITAS telescopes' plate scale has been calculated    and simulated but never actually measured or studied in detail. The purpose of this thesis is to    measure the plate scale and compare it to the simulated and calculated values. The effect that    the plate scale has on the angular resolution and the source location reconstruction is also    analyzed. It was found that a known plate scale effect was not being handled properly by the    offline analysis and was causing a systematic error. As a result of this research, the plate    scale effect was recently added to the shower reconstruction analysis code, thus improving the    calculations of the primary gamma-ray properties.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kenneth J Ragan (Internal/Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc57b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q9879</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics - Astronomy and Astrophysics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q492z"><dcterms:title>Characterization of resistance-welded thermoplastic composite double-lap joints</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chazerain, Aurélie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An investigation of resistance welding of thermoplastic composite double-lap    shear joints is presented.

Par conséquent, notre objectif était d'estimer    l'étendue avec laquelle la fatigue musculaire modifie la proprioception du membre    supérieur chez des sujets adultes. Douze sujets en bonne santé ont été assignés à un groupe avec    fatigue, auquel on avait demandé d'effectuer une tâche d'atteinte en saisissant un bloc    de bois. Ils devaient toucher, avec le bloc, une cible de même forme affichée sur un écran plat,    dans l'une de trois différentes orientations (vertical et ±30°, 10 répétitions chaque),    sans vision. Puis, les sujets devaient exécuter une série de mouvements avec résistance contre un    ruban élastique, de façon à induire la fatigue musculaire. Finalement, les sujets répétaient la    tâche d'atteinte.Six autres sujets ont été assignés au groupe sans fatigue, qui a suivi    le même protocole, mais sans la phase de fatigue.

Therefore our objective was to estimate the extent    to which muscular fatigue alters the proprioception of the upper extremity in healthy adult    subjects. Eighteen healthy subjects participated in this study. Twelve subjects were assigned to    a fatigue group who were asked to do a reaching task while grasping a wooden block. They had to    match the block with its corresponding target displayed on a flat screen, in one of three    different orientations (vertical and ±30°, 10 repetitions each) with blocked vision. Following    this reaching task, the subjects performed a series of resistive movements against an elastic    band in order to induce muscular fatigue. The reaching task was then repeated, immediately after    the fatiguing exercise. Six other subjects were assigned to the non fatigue group, who performed    exactly the same protocol, but without the fatiguing phase. An independent t-test showed a    significant difference both in the distribution and in the mean change of endpoint position in    the fatigue group compared to the non fatigue group. However, a repeated measure ANOVA revealed    no significant change in orientation. In this study, we found that position reproduction ability    was greatly changed in the presence of muscular fatigue whereas no difference was found in    orientation. The result of this study could serve as a basis for further research on upper limb    proprioception and neuromuscular control.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Philippe Archambault (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs79n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hg41z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences - Physical Therapy</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As1784m64n"><dcterms:title>Exporing murine placental development in vitro: explant model for placental development and expression of Notch 1 during trophoblast differentiation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2009</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Human Genetics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sarikaya, Didem</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Normal development of the placental labyrinth layer is required for proper    nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and the fetus.

As a    result of chorioallntoic attachment, the chorion and ectoplacental cone differentiate into the    trophoblast cells of the placenta, and the allantois forms the embryonic vasculature of the    placenta. The objectives of this thesis are to: generate an explant model that will mimic early    labyrinth development, and to analyze the expression of Notch1/NICD1 during in vitro trophoblast    stem cell differentiation. In Vitro culture of pre-placental tissues resulted in successful    fusion between the two separate tissues, generating an explant model for chorioallantoic    attachment.
