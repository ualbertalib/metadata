In this investigation, the cladoceran, Daphnia magna was exposed to lethal levels (48h LC50) of ten, $ sp{14}$C-labelled, narcotic organic chemicals in a closed system. Exposure times, ambient concentrations, and body sizes were varied to evaluate their effects. The $ sp{14}$C-method developed in current work can detect chemicals in single D. magna in concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 6310 mmol/kg. Moreover, the technique detected phobic and lipophilic chemicals equally well. The technique's sensitivity (nmol/kg) allowed for detection of differences in the internal concentrations of pollutants among the unaffected, immobilized, and dead D. magna. Immobilized D. magna contained between 0.14 mmol/kg and 200 mmol/kg of narcotics. On the average, however, the internal residues were 3.1 mmol/kg (95%CL = 3.1 $ pm$ 2.0). This agreed with literature values. The effects of time of exposure, ambient concentration, and body size on the tissue residues of narcotics varied with the chemical compound.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peters, Robert H.

It is shown that clothing enables the formation and distinction of social groups. The ways in which clothing becomes symbolic for a group and the way in which this system is challenged and/or destroyed are also examined. A distinction between fashion and antifashion is made to enable a repositioning of the Western system of dress into a wider context of meaning. Assumptions on the nature of appearance as related to the concept of truth are examined. Chapter One looks at the various and contradictory myths of body ideals, challenging the opposition of nature and culture. Chapter Two examines the uniform and applies its characteristics to all forms of dress. Chapter Three provides a brief summary of the history of sumptuary laws and how they operate in the social world. Throughout this work, common sense assumptions and privileged reading of particular theoretical frameworks are challenged. Theory itself is subject to fashion, allowing for a comparison to be made between human adornment and the methodologies that attempt to define its practices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h0373.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g12b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social structure</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fashion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Clothing and dress -- Social aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s101b"><dcterms:title>Childhood bereavement : an application of the stress and coping paradigm</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Del Vasto, Rosalie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The existing literature on childhood bereavement reactions and sequelae is integrated within the Stress and Coping Paradigm to demonstrate its functional utility. The coping resources (i.e., psychological and social resources) and coping efforts of seventeen (8 male, 9 female) children who experienced the death of a loved one were assessed and compared with standardized norms. Results suggest that children who experienced bereavement did not significantly differ from typical children on measures of psychological resources (Self-Perception Profile for Children and Assessment of Coping Style) and on measures of coping effort (Coping Inventory). However, differences were found on a measure of social resource (Family Environment Scale). When compared with the norm group, children who experienced bereavement scored significantly higher on the Cohesion, Expressiveness, Conflict and Control subscales, and significantly lower on the Achievement Orientation subscale. The data are analyzed and discussed with reference to mediating factors including time elapsed since the death, relationship to the deceased and mode of death. Implications for health care professionals are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Derevensky, Jeffrey L.

AIDS is a critical health problem worldwide and AIDS contamination within a Cree community could be a threat to its survival. A questionnaire was developed to survey attitudes, knowledge and behavior of Cree students in relation to AIDS. Further analysis included finding relationships between knowledge level, attitudes and behavior in order to guide future educational interventions. A satisfactory level of knowledge about AIDS can be credited to the interventions of the clinic, the school, and the television. The level of knowledge is positively correlated with the level of tolerance of Cree students towards people infected by the HIV virus and of their perception of the danger of AIDS for the Cree population. While knowledge level and attitudes cannot be used to predict safer sexual behavior, alcohol consumption is highly related to risky sexual practices.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ghosh, Ratna (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk37t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p1191</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Cree Indians -- Sexual behavior</dc:subject><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) in adolescence -- Qu√©bec (Province)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Apk02cb70s"><dcterms:title>The computational complexity of the decision procedures for Presburger arithmetic /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Computer Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Crowley, Chris</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work studies the computational complexity of the decision procedures for Presburger Arithmetic (PA) and specific subclasses of this logical theory.

We assert that the successful emergence of rentierism is dependent on specific factors in the pre-rentier state period. To support our claim we examine and analyze three modern day rentier states; Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. These case studies allow us to demonstrate that the pattern we call rentierism is not common to all rentier states the mode of politics in both Venezuela and Iran differs significantly from that of Saudi Arabia, the literature's embodiment of rentierism. Moreover, analysis and comparison of the pre-rentier state period for all three cases allows us to propose specific pre-rentier state factors which, we suggest, are essential for the successful emergence of rentierism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Haskel, Barbara (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr81s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w819w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>National income -- Iran</dc:subject><dc:subject>National income -- Venezuela</dc:subject><dc:subject>National income -- Saudi Arabia</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zx40r"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of backscatter factors for diagnostic X-ray beams</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Patrocinio, Horacio Jose</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis proposes models for the calculation of upper and lower limiting values to the backscatter factor (BSF) that can be used to evaluate measured and modelled BSF values. The upper limit to the BSF is obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation of an infinite parallel beam incident on a semi-infinite phantom in which the dose contribution from all orders of photon scatter is considered. The lower limit is calculated using an analytical photon transport model which considers only the primary dose and the scatter dose from photons that have undergone a single scattering interaction in the phantom. A parametrization of the limiting values in terms of photon energy and irradiation field size is presented and comparisons are made with BSF's from the literature. To further illustrate the utility of the limiting BSF's, comparisons are also made with current TLD-measured BSF's and Monte Carlo simulations of the BSF.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Schreiner, L.

Philip.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A method was developed for the isolation of tissue fractions from the middle lamella and secondary wall of black spruce (Picea mariana) tracheids. The concentrations of cellulose and glucomannan were found to be lower in the middle lamella tissue than in the secondary wall tissue, while the reverse was found for galactan and arabian. The content of glucuronoarabinoxylan was essentially the same in both morphological areas. The concentration of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the lignin in the two tissue fractions was determined by turbidimetric spectrophotometry and by pyrolytic gas chromatography. Secondary wall lignin was found to contain more than twice as many phenolic hydroxyl groups per phenylpropane unit as middle lamella lignin. The concentration of methoxyl groups in secondary wall lignin was 1.6 times the concentration in middle lamella lignin, indicating that about 40% of the lignin polymer in the middle lamella consisted of para-hydroxyphenyl residues. Most of the carbonyl groups in the lignin in wood were found in the middle lamella lignin. The carboxyl content of the middle lamella was about three times that of the carboxyl content of the secondary wall. Secondary wall lignin was more reactive towards chlorine, chlorine dioxide and sodium bisulphite. Secondary wall lignin was also more quickly dissolved than middle lamella lignin in kraft, acid-sulphite, and acid-chlorite pulping. The activation energies, towards kraft pulping, of middle lamella and secondary wall "bulk" lignin were found to be essentially the same. However, it was discovered that while most of the secondary wall lignin followed first order reaction kinetics, 70% of middle lamella lignin did not. It was also discovered that the majority of milled wood lignin originated in the secondary wall of the tracheid.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww66s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p79w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Wood -- Chemistry.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Black spruce.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tracheary cells.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
