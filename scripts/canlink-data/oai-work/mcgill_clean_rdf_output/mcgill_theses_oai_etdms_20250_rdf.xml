This study summarizes the popular discussion pertaining to planning the farm transition, and the following six concepts that are useful to take into account when designing sustainable systems: vision, creativity, values, the efficiency - substitution - redesign spectrum, an holistic, systems perspective of the farm, and popular participation in the development process. Case studies of six farms in the early phase of transition are presented. Farm and farmer characteristics are detailed as well as the potential of each to influence the evolution of the farm. The outcomes of farm-level planning and activities in the first two transitional years are described. Particular attention is paid to the implications of creative visioning and approaches to problem solving, value adjustments, decision-making criteria, and the farmers' perceived restraining forces. A comprehensive, practical strategy designed to facilitate the farm transition process is constructed. This combines the current popular template for appropriate planning and the theoretical constructs of sustainable development, with insights gathered from the six case study farms. Finally, procedures for using the strategy are outlined, together with some requirements for its further development.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b233h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707958894</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Farms -- Québec (Province) -- Case studies.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sustainable agriculture -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ar207tq44d"><dcterms:title>A solar climate control system using a water film flow to conserve energy in greenhouses /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ménard, Odette</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>One of the greatest problems encountered in greenhouses and buildings with large glazing is control of the internal atmosphere. The inherent characteristic of these buildings to act as solar collectors is to be used effectively for collecting and storing the excess solar energy. A new type of glazed roof, a Solar Climate Control roof system, was designed as a means to cool the interior environment of the greenhouses during the daytime and to heat during the nighttime or on overcast days. A heat exchanger-storage system, using water as a thermal mass is included in the design of the Solar Climate Control system. A film of water flows on the inner surface of the roof and absorbs the direct solar heat radiation, acting then as a cooling agent. The energy absorbed may be reused for nighttime heating. An efficient water dispersion pipe for the Solar Climate Control system was developed. The use of a soap solution rather than water alone for the Solar Climate Control water film system permitted a significant reduction in pumping rate and improved uniformity of the film. A computer simulation model was run to determine the energy loads for both a conventional (double glazed roof) greenhouse and one equipped with the Solar Climate Control system. The Solar Climate Control system shows low operating cost and very good efficiency in heat removal.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r675r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq44d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Greenhouses -- Heating and ventilation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Energy conservation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Greenhouses -- Energy conservation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Solar energy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A37720d98f"><dcterms:title>Participatory extension strategies for the implementation of sustainable agriculture</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Renewable Resources</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nault, Jacques</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Requirements for the development of sustainable farm systems include the generation of site-specific management practices and heightened levels of awareness and empowerment within the farming community.

The stages of a "process of development model" are: General Systems Description, Convergence, Implementation, Exchange, and Monitoring and Evaluation. This model is proposed as a means to expand the potential of participatory extension strategies to facilitate the development of sustainable agricultural systems.

One clone was isolated that contained a lacZ transcriptional fusion induced by arsenic, antimony, and their associated salts. When cells were subjected to DNA-damaging agents such as mitomycin C and sodium dichromate, a low level of induction resulted. In addition, a marked increase in arsenic sensitivity was observed in the fusion clone as compared to the parent strain presumably due to the insertional inactivation of the E. coli gene(s) by the Mu prophage. By Southern Blotting analysis of the original gene fusion, as well as genetically identical transductant, only one copy of the lacZ fusion was observed. From these results, a preliminary map of the site of insertion of the reporter gene within the arsenic/antimony responding gene has been generated. This strain should prove to be useful in the rapid detection of low bioavailable concentrations of arsenic, as well as to study the molecular mechanisms of arsenic toxicity.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c1697.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm754</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abg257g17g"><dcterms:title>Modeling conduction in the ventricles</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lewis, Timothy J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Two models of electrical conduction in the cardiac ventricles are considered. The first model considered is that of a strand of ventricular muscle which uses the one-dimensional cable equation with the Beeler-Reuter model to represent the transmembrane currents. The effect of periodic stimulation on the strand is numerically simulated, and it is found that as simulation frequency is increased, the rhythms of synchronization are successively encountered. It is shown that this sequence of rhythms can be accounted for by considering the response of the strand to premature stimulation. This involves deriving a one-dimensional finite-difference equation or "map" from the response to premature stimulation, and then iterating this map to predict the response to periodic stimulation. The second model states that the highly ramified His-Purkinje system is reminiscent of a fractal branching structure, and that the ventricular myocardium is activated in a "fractal" (time-scale invariant) fashion, since it is activated via the His-Purkinje system. A 1/$f sp alpha$ power spectrum can sometimes be linked to fractal processes. The averaged power spectrum of single QRS complexes falls off as 1/$f sp alpha$ ($ alpha sim$ 4).</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237ht01z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257g17g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, General.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0v8381707"><dcterms:title>Phosphocreatine-dependent phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins in rat skeletal muscle</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ouellet, Marc</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Phosphocreatine was found to alter the phosphorylation state of two proteins of apparent molecular weight 18 and 29 Kd when added to dialysed, cell-free extracts of rat skeletal muscle and brain, in the presence of $ lbrack tau$-$ sp{32}$P) ATP. The 29 Kd protein was identified as phosphoglycerate mutase. Phosphoglycerate mutase was phosphorylated at the active site histidyl residue by (2-$ sp{32}$P) 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate was labelled through the concerted action of phosphoglycerate kinase and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase. Phosphocreatine-dependent phosphorylation at this site resulted from a shift in phosphoglycerate kinase equilibrium, in the presence of creatine kinase, ultimately resulting in an increase in available (2-$ sp{32}$P) 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Maximal catalytic activity of phosphoglycerate mutase was not affected by phosphocreatine. These results suggest that phosphocreatine is unlikely to be important in regulating the activity of phosphoglycerate mutase in normal muscle. Previous reports of 3-phosphoglycerate-dependent protein phosphorylations, attributed to the action of novel kinases, are probably phosphoenzyme intermediates phosphorylated in a similar manner.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn96w.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v8381707</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d097t"><dcterms:title>Regulation and function of the Lck proto-oncogene product</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Abraham, Ninan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>lck is a member of the src family of tyrosine protein kinase genes expressed predominantly in T-lymphocytes.

However, the effect of magnesium on the eutectic microstructure is unclear. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of magnesium on the eutectic microstructure and to clarify its role in the silicon solidification. Experiments were performed on hypoeutectic and eutectic alloys (Al-7%Si, Al-11%Si, Al-13%Si and 413.2 alloys). Assessment of the eutectic microstructure was done using thermal analysis and metallography. The silicon phase was quantified by image analysis in terms of its perimeter, shape factor and aspect ratio. The results reveal that in hypoeutectic and eutectic synthetic alloys magnesium decreases the homogeneity of the microstructure. At about 1%Wt Mg, however, magnesium refines slightly the silicon phase. It was found that magnesium has a negative effect on strontium modification, that is, it changes the microstructure from well modified to partially modified. This is believed due to the presence of a complex intermetallic compound $ rm(Mg sb2SrAl sb4Si sb3)$ formed prior to the eutectic transformation. It is suggested that magnesium not be added in excess of 0.6 Wt% in strontium modified Al-Si alloys.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b236b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fj21q</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akh04dq74c"><dcterms:title>Educating for sustainable development : a case study of an environmental immersion school</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Samuel, Hilary R.

Using participant observation and dialogue as methods of inquiry, an attempt is made to render an account of the workers' day-to-day experience of youth protection work. The findings suggest that their conditions of work encourage a passive subordination to the bureaucratic organization of practice. This tendency emerges in response to the difficulties workers encounter while trying to conform to the requirements of the Youth Protection Act and, at the same time, to the norms and realities of Inuit village life. The resultant tension is central to the Inuit workers' experience and not amenable to any simple resolution.

The average open state probability appeared not to be affected by choline at any of the membrane potentials that were studied.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wh187.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xj82s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aw95051666"><dcterms:title>The effect of muscle contractility on surface EMG /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physiology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Young, Richard N. (Richard Norman)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study was designed as an investigation of the role of changes in muscle force and changes in muscle length on the EMG for the Tibialis Anterior (TA). Using surface electrodes we examined the EMG for 4 contraction levels at 5 ankle positions over 60$ sp circ$ of ankle rotation. The change in median frequency with muscle length identified a significant shift in the power spectrum to lower frequencies with increasing muscle length. To further investigate our results we performed three other experiments: First, using X-rays to identify the relative change in distance between two intramuscular wire electrodes we found the change in TA muscle length for this study to be 15% over the 60$ sp circ$ of ankle rotation. Second, to test for synergist contamination we used fine wire electrodes in the Extensor Digitorum Longus and the Peroneus. We found no evidence to support significant contamination. Third, we examined the role of smaller electrodes with a smaller interelectrode distance on our findings. The EMG showed drastic changes with even a slight shift in electrode position most likely due to the large number of innervation zones. Therefore, the results indicate a shift in the power spectrum with a change in muscle length. In addition, surface EMG results are heavily dependent on the innervation zones and on the electrode geometry, all of which are important considerations in developing the EMG as an accurate diagnostic tool.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb52v.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95051666</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biophysics, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053h14h"><dcterms:title>Relationship between energy intake, backfat thickness and reproductive performance of sows</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Trottier, Nathalie Lucie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Three experiments were conducted on sows. In experiment I, Landrace gilts were fed ad libitum, from 10 weeks of age to puberty, diets containing either 2800 (LE), 3400 (ME) and 3900 (HE) Kcal DE/kg. Age at puberty was delayed in gilts fed LE and ME. Backfat thickness was significantly reduced in LE and ME groups. Puberty onset was more determined by age and backfat thickness than by weight. In experiment II, all gilts that had shown normal heat within 240 days of age, were inseminated on the second estrus and given the same diet as received during their growing period. Feed was restricted to 2.0 kg per day during gestation and was provided ad libitum in lactation. Gilts in LE and ME gained less weight and backfat during gestation than gilts in HE group. Gilts gaining more weight and backfat during gestation, with a resulting higher body weight and backfat thickness at parturition, lost more in lactation. Incidence of anoestrus after weaning was higher in the LE and HE groups. In experiment III, multiparous Landrace-Yorkshire sows from two herds were used. An extended weaning to remating interval and reduced number of piglets weaned was observed in first and second parity sows. Lower reproductive performance in one herd was related to an excessive loss of backfat in lactation and a low backfat level at weaning.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591950s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h14h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sows -- Reproduction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sows -- Nutrition.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sows -- Experiments.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1r66j2162"><dcterms:title>Representativeness and behaviors of volunteers in a study of pregnancy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leclerc, Pascale C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The principal objective of this study was to examine use of alcohol, cigarettes and medication by women who were or were trying to become pregnant using two available data sets: one from l'Etude sur la Grossesse de Montreal (EGM) and the other from l'Enquete Sante Quebec (ESQ).

We studied the relationship between "time trying to conceive" and consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and medications and we compared the prevalence of these behaviors among pregnant and non-pregnant women. To assess the representativeness of volunteers, we compared the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes of the whole groups of ESQ and EGM women, and of the subgroups of pregnant women. In summary, there were variations in some of the studied behaviors with "time trying to conceive" and pregnancy status. Also, volunteers were similar to the general population for cigarette smoking, but not alcohol consumption.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4626633.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j2162</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Psychology, Behavioral.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axp68kh52t"><dcterms:title>Les risques de dèveloppement dans la responsabilitè des fabricants etude comparative /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tartanson, Florence</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The concept of development risk is new in product liability.

Due to their distributed nature however, the control and programming of robotic workcells is often a difficult task, for which dedicated environments have to be designed and built. Simulation, especially graphic simulation, can greatly contribute to the development of programs for such integrated robotic applications: the simulator emulates the behavior of the workcell on a computer display, and allows the programmer to test and debug programs without requiring an immediate access to the physical equipment. This thesis presents the design of a graphic simulator for robotic workcell applications. The simulator is based on SAGE/WRAP, an environment for the programming and run-time control of robotic workcells. Given a WRAP program as input, the simulator displays a top-view of the workcell and animates graphically the execution of the program; the coordination and the flow of operations within the workcell being shown, the programmer can quickly assess the overall validity of the program. The simulator was developed in C under the X Window System, and is currently implemented as a standalone software; the design was made flexible and modular, to facilitate an eventual integration to the WRAP environment.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k371x.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bq50m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Artificial Intelligence.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t317z"><dcterms:title>Disappearance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a soil using biostimulation techniques</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tousignant, Luc Paul</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The Mascouche site (located near Montreal, Quebec) served as a petroleum waste dump ground during the 1950's and 1960's. It then housed a petroleum waste incinerator from 1969 to 1974. Laboratory forced air biostimulation studies were performed on a soil sample from this site for two reasons: (a) high permeability sand presented optimal conditions for the application of biostimulation and (b) the wish to test the effectiveness of the method in site reclamation. The concentrations of various pollutants, such as PAHs, PCBs and heavy metals, were first determined in the soil samples. Biological degradation using forced aeration was responsible for at least 20% of PAH disappearance over 20 days. Various soil microorganisms were isolated, in soil extract media, in order to identify biodegrading activity. The results obtained suggested that bioremediation as the sole decontamination method may not be as effective as anticipated. The results also show that chemical/physical mechanisms are also of importance. Procedures for forced aeration bioremediation should include monitoring of soil atmospheric parameters to account for possible volatilization effects.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q2692.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t317z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Environmental Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Engineering, Civil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5h73px193"><dcterms:title>Ideological shifts in the education of adults in China, 1949-1986</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rong, Meng</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The educational policy for adults in China has fluctuated over the 40-year period since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The purpose of this study will include the effects on adult education of ideological shifts in the underlying educational philosophy related to social and political development in China during the three identifiable key periods of change associated with the re-building and development of the nation from 1949 to 1986; namely, (1) 1949-1966, the beginning of the Communist Era; (2) 1966-1976, the Cultural revolution period; (3) 1976-1986, the period after the Cultural Revolution. In many cases, the development of Chinese education for adults has been quite irregular due to political upheavals. Marxist principles of education have been felt in China to be difficult to integrate with the developmental needs of the country. Commitment to adult education as an important element of the development pattern has been high, but political struggle has seriously hampered educational expansion. The struggle within the high-level leadership seems to have been the most direct reason for ideological shifts over the 37 year period.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x0138.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px193</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Adult education -- China -- History -- 20th century</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adult education -- Government policy -- China</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajq085m337"><dcterms:title>Holocaust studies for moral and religious education</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Satov, Tauba</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis will present an account of the religious way of living drawn from the writings of selected authorities.

This is one of the essential ESM functions which must be done in real-time. Considering the complexity of the Filter IC and its crucial service in Electronic Warfare (EW), fault-tolerance should be an important element of the circuit. However, in the initial design, fault-tolerance was not included. Therefore, fault-tolerance schemes especially suitable for ESM Filter IC are presented in this thesis. A concurrent error detection technique is presented. The method utilizes a code, referred to as MATCH code that is inherent in the function of ESM Filter IC. Effectiveness of the approach is measured by its error coverage. In the analysis of the coverage, error detection capability of MATCH code and probability of fault detection are incorporated. The hardware overhead required to implement a lookup-table which stores MATCH code is also given for various CAM (content-addressable memory) cells. As an alternative approach, recomputation with rotated comparands (RERC) is suggested for detection of all single errors. The possibility of multiple error detection and single error correction by the same method is also discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm600.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz69c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
