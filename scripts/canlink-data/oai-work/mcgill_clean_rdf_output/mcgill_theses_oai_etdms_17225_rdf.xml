D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Concrete work during cold weather is normally avoided by the construction industry. The reasons for this can be grouped under two general headings; firstly, the poorer working conditions which prevail and secondly, the effect which a low ambient temperature has on the strength of freshly poured concrete. The lower standard of working conditions in winter are due mainly to snow, the fewer hours of daylight available and the heavy clothing worn and personal discomfort experienced by the workers. These factors result in added cost due to snow removal, artificial lighting and a decrease in output of the labour force.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wilson, V.

Her problems of central banking are part of the general problem as to whether central banking institutions are necessary in underdeveloped countries, or not. No matter what importance a central bank has for an underdeveloped country, it is now a fact that every country regards it as an indispensable part of the institutional framework of her economy. In fact the central banks of today have become a symbol of independence in the regulation of monetary affairs of a country.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Armstrong, D.

In many cases, such as the passage of gases in the lungs, it is probably a physical process, but one can visualize the existence of special transfer processes in certain tissues. The transfer of material through the wall of the small intestine, or the reabsorption of material in the renal tubules, could conceivably be due to the existence of a special process. Van Slyke and Meyer (1), in 1912, were the first to suggest that such a process exists in all tissues.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quastel, J.

Considering a two person zero sum game, the equivalence of the theorem to the existence of “good” strategies in any finite game is shown, and implications to certain types of games discussed. Although there are several independent proofs of the theorem, most fall into two broad categories--the one using the theory of convex sets, the other the fixed point property of certain transformations. We examine in detail one proof of each type, and extend the theorem to the case of one player having a countable number of choices at each play of the game.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peck, J.
