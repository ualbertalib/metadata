Focusing on Hungary and Poland, it examines how the right  institutions can advance the creation and strengthening of a constitutional order.  Among the institutions special attention is paid to the constitutional courts. The  establishment and prominence of constitutional courts in most new democracies in  East Central Europe fits into the general trend that was perceivable throughout  Western Europe after WWII. The main rationale of these new institutions was to  safeguard the democratic order from the return of authoritarianism. The main  practical as well as theoretical significance of the introduction of judicial review  was that it put an end to the then prevailing primacy of unlimited popular  sovereignty and recast the concept of democracy in constitutional, rather than  majoritarian terms. Such an innovation plays an even more significant role in  Eastern Europe, where concepts of majoritarian democracy on the one hand, and  reliance on a strong leader, especially in times of difficulties on the other, were  prominent due to both communist and pre-communist legacies. Furthermore, the often  ambiguous constitutional documents produced by the negotiated transitions, as well  as the sometimes irreconcilable aspirations of political forces, provided the courts  with a prominent role in shaping the new order. Through the study of two issues, transitional justice and the  presidency, the dissertation examines the various functions constitutional courts  can play in democratic consolidation in general and in advancing rule of law  systems, in resolving constitutional ambiguities and in controlling political actors  in particular. Drawing on the analysis of political events, primary sources,  parliamentary minutes, newspaper articles and court decisions, the dissertation  concludes that while the courts' record in solving institutional problems cannot be  regarded as an unequivocal success, their role in defining fundamental  constitutional principles is more praiseworthy. Not only did they manage to settle  controversial issues as in the case of transitional justice, they also successfully  curbed majoritarian endeavors and steered the new systems towards the acceptance of  basic liberal constitutional values.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cb32c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b1738</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Democracy -- Europe, Eastern</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hungary -- Politics and government -- 1989-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poland -- Politics and government -- 1989-</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Az890rt85h"><dcterms:title>Texture and microstructure in copper damascene interconnects</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Cho, Jae-Young, 1970-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Copper has been recently used as an interconnecting material  since it has high conductivity and good electromigration failure resistance. Recent  studies show the close relationship between texture and reliability of Cu damascene  interconnects. However, textural and microstructural evolutions of Cu damascene  interconnects as function of substrate texture, current density, line width and  annealing process are still not well understood. At first, to understand the influence of substrate texture and  electroplating conditions on the texture and surface morphology of Cu  electrodeposits, three different polycrystalline copper specimens were used as  substrates and electrodeposits were plated using different current densities. The  mechanism of growth of Cu electrodeposits and the importance of smooth surface  morphology were discussed. To analyze the effect of line width and annealing process on  textural and microstructural evolution of Cu damascene interconnects, Cu  interconnects samples which have a different line width and different annealing  process were investigated. According to x-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron  backscattered diffraction (EBSD) results, the directional changes of (111) plane  orientation with the different line width and annealing were observed. In addition,  the analysis of microstructure and grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) of  Cu damascene interconnects demonstrated that bamboo-like microstructure was  developed in the narrow line and a polygranular structure was developed in the wider  line. Also, the fraction of Sigma3 boundaries was changed depending on the line  width and annealing process. To analyze a relationship between the stress distribution and  textural and microstructural evolution in the samples investigated, stress was  calculated using finite element method (FEM), and these results were verified by  physical stress simulation of copper in the Chapter 7. Through this investigation,  it was found that the inhomogeneity of stress distribution in Cu damascene  interconnects is an important factor which is necessary for understanding textural  transformation after annealing, and the effects of stress on textural and  microstructural evolution of Cu depends on the crystallographic texture and the  annealing temperature. A new interpretation of textural and microstructural evolution  in Cu damascene interconnects lines after annealing and possible factors responsible  for the texture transformation are suggested, and the optimum processing conditions  are recommended.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149q37g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt85h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqv33rx17q"><dcterms:title>Self-reports from portraits of six Greek adult trilinguals : growing up as 'Bill 101' allophone children</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Konidaris, Ephie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This inquiry explores six Greek trilingual adults' perceptions  about becoming and being trilingual. The six participants are "children of Bill  101", that is, as allophones (speakers of other languages than English and  French) they were formally schooled in the French public school system. The  participants received English instruction taught as a second language and attended  Greek heritage language schools. I adopted a socio-cultural approach to learning,  language and literacy and embraced the tenets of activity theory to describe the  participants' development of culture and a trilingual identity. To understand how  they came to develop cultural and linguistic skills in English, French and Greek,  and describe themselves as trilinguals, I conducted 40 hours of in-depth and  life-story interviews over three years. I aimed to access the participants'  perceptions of their experiences 'growing up Greek' in Montreal, Quebec, their  self-identification with the three languages and their perceptions of becoming and  being trilingual. I examined their audio-recorded discussions by first transcribing  them and searching for relevant vignettes and themes. These vignettes helped  determine the larger contextual and personal factors that influenced and affected  the participants' perceptions of the process of becoming and being trilingual.  Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Davis's concept of "portraiture" is a useful  methodology to illustrate how trilingual adults present and negotiate their life  worlds in the three languages and spaces---home, work, social and community events.  The results of my inquiry suggest that the six "children of Bill 101" who  are now Greek trilingual adults constructed their knowledge and their identities  through their interactions with parents, relatives, teachers and peers within home,  school, work, and diverse social contexts in both different and similar ways.

Through  interviews and personal experience as a participant observer within the program,  this longitudinal qualitative case study, influenced by social constructivist  theory, of the Nunavut Teacher Education Program attempts to provide an account of  the program's growth and development, its strengths and its weaknesses and  possibilities for the future. However, in order to locate the program in its time  and place, it is necessary to examine the nested contexts of traditional, colonial  and post-colonial worlds from which and in which it has developed. Consequently, I begin by tracing the political and social  development of Nunavut to its present day realities, realities that are far from the  often overly romantic view of the Canadian arctic. I then outline the impact of  colonialism upon the Inuit and their pre-contact traditional lifestyle before  reviewing the growth and development of education. I commence with precontact  traditional education and what it may have been like before embarking upon a  description of the education experienced by Inuit, first from the missionaries, and  then by the Federal government followed by the Territorial Government of the  Northwest Territories and finally by the government of Nunavut. Data for the study  was collected, in part, from fifty interviews conducted predominately in Iqaluit,  the location of the institutional program. The Nunavut Teacher Education Program (NTEP) is a key element in  the development of education in the territory. There are therefore great  expectations put on the program, expectations that may exceed its ability to fulfil  them. In my account of the program and its effect, seen through the lens of critical  pedagogy, upon students' academic, linguistic and cultural knowledge, I examine the  pressures and the tensions caused by these expectations upon on the program and its  students.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv03r.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vb80p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education -- Nunavut -- History</dc:subject><dc:subject>Teachers -- Training of -- Nunavut -- History</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avx021f68h"><dcterms:title>Direct and indirect responses to divergent phenotypic selection for fiber traits in timothy (Phleum pratense L.)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Claessens, Annie</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Genetic improvement of timothy digestibility by breeding  requires an effective and reliable selection procedure. The general objective of  this study was to evaluate the concentrations of four fiber components (neutral  detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, hemicellulose, and  cellulose) and four ratios involving these concentrations (acid detergent lignin  over hemicellulose, acid detergent lignin over cellulose, acid detergent lignin over  the sum of hemicellulose and cellulose and hemicellulose over cellulose) as  selection criteria to improve timothy digestibility without affecting plant biomass.  Selected genotypes and populations derived from them were evaluated in a field  experiment. Significant variability was observed among genotypes for all nine  traits. Divergent phenotypic selection for seven of the traits (all except  hemicellulose and hemicellulose over cellulose) produced groups of genotypes that  consistently differed for the trait used as the selection criterion. Selection  criteria that involved acid detergent lignin were the most effective in identifying  genotypes with consistent differences in in vitro true digestibility. Genotypes  selected for high or low values of each criterion were intercrossed to produce  progeny populations. Five of the nine pairs of divergent populations were  consistently different for the trait used as the selection criterion. Selection for  acid detergent lignin over cellulose was the most effective in producing populations  with consistent differences (22 to 32 g kg-1 DM) in in vitro true digestibility,  with reduced values of this ratio associated with increased digestibility. This was  mainly due to a reduction of the concentrations of lignin and neutral detergent  fiber, particularly in the stem fraction, resulting in greater stem digestibility.

Canner  [The American Statistician, vol. 23, no. 5, pp. 39--40 (1969)] in which it was noted  that in simple linear regression it is possible for the generalized least squares  regression line to lie either entirely above or entirely below all of the observed  data points. Chapter I builds on the observation that in Canner's model the  ordinary least squares and generalized least squares regression lines are parallel,  which led us to introduce a new measure of efficiency of ordinary least squares and  to find conditions for which the total Watson efficiency of ordinary least squares  in a partitioned linear model exceeds or is less than the product of the two subset  Watson efficiencies, i.e., the product of the Watson efficiencies associated with  the two subsets of parameters in the underlying partitioned linear  model. We introduce the notions of generalized efficiency function,  efficiency factorization multiplier, and determinantal covariance ratio, and obtain  several inequalities and equalities. We give special attention to those partitioned  linear models for which the total Watson efficiency of ordinary least squares equals  the product of the two subset Watson efficiencies. A key characterization involves  the equality between the squares of a certain partial correlation coefficient and  its associated ordinary correlation coefficient. In Chapters II and IV we suppose that the underlying partitioned  linear model is weakly singular in that the column space of the model matrix is  contained in the column space of the covariance matrix of the errors in the linear  model. In Chapter III our results are specialized to partitioned linear models where  the partitioning is orthogonal and the covariance matrix of the errors is positive  definite.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602114p.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dc997</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Statistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv9353448"><dcterms:title>Kernel estimators : testing and bandwidth selection in models of unknown smoothness</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kotlyarova, Yulia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Semiparametric and nonparametric estimators are becoming  indispensable tools in applied econometrics. Many of these estimators depend on the  choice of smoothing bandwidth and kernel function. Optimality of such parameters is  determined by unobservable smoothness of the model, that is, by differentiability of  the distribution functions of random variables in the model. In this thesis we  consider two estimators of this class: the smoothed maximum score estimator for  binary choice models and the kernel density estimator. We present theoretical results on the asymptotic distribution of  the estimators under various smoothness assumptions and derive the limiting joint  distributions for estimators with different combinations of bandwidths and kernel  functions. Using these nontrivial joint distributions, we suggest a new way of  improving accuracy and robustness of the estimators by considering a linear  combination of estimators with different smoothing parameters. The weights in the  combination minimize an estimate of the mean squared error. Monte Carlo simulations  confirm suitability of this method for both smooth and non-smooth  models. For the original and smoothed maximum score estimators, a formal  procedure is introduced to test for equivalence of the maximum likelihood estimators  and these semiparametric estimators, which converge to the true value at slower  rates. The test allows one to identify heteroskedastic misspecifications in the  logit/probit models. The method has been applied to analyze the decision of married  women to join the labour force.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs084.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9353448</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Kernel functions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonparametric statistics</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8910jv105"><dcterms:title>Building a search engine for music and audio on the World Wide Web</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Knopke, Ian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The main contribution of this dissertation is a system for  locating and indexing audio files on the World Wide Web. The idea behind this system  is that the use of both web page and audio file analysis techniques can produce more  relevant information for locating audio files on the web than is used in full-text  search engines. The most important part of this system is a web crawler that  finds materials by following hyperlinks between web pages. The crawler is  distributed and operates using multiple computers across a network, storing results  to a database. There are two main components: a set of retrievers that retrieve  pages and audio files from the web, and a central crawl manager that coordinates the  retrievers and handles data storage tasks. The crawler is designed to locate three types of audio files:  AIFF, WAVE, and MPEG-1 (MP3), but other types can be easily added to the system.  Once audio files are located, analyses are performed of both the audio files and the  associated web pages that link to these files. Information extracted by the crawler  can be used to build search indexes for resolving user queries. A set of results  demonstrating aspects of the performance of the crawler are presented, as well as  some statistics and points of interest regarding the nature of audio files on the  web.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c173.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jv105</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Information storage and retrieval systems -- Music.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Information storage and retrieval systems -- Audio-visual materials.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Web search engines.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music -- Computer network resources.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag158bh70p"><dcterms:title>Freedom's limits : self-determination and international law</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Irving, James, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This work seeks to settle the doctrine of self-determination in  international law.

This  reveals a doctrine lacking coherence. The philosophy of political liberty is  proposed as a foundation for self-determination in law. The way this new approach  manifests itself in practice, and its merits, are considered in relation to the  politics of Crimea, with a focus on the immediate post-Soviet period of 1991-2002.  In conclusion, a programme for implementation and refinement is offered.

The mass transfer of the pulping liquor into the wood as well as the  interfacial properties between the liquor and wood, and the changes in the  properties due to the surfactants present in the liquor were  investigated. A mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants, effective in  neutral sulfite pulping, was selected during the pulping experiments. Due to the  surfactants present in the pulping liquor, the reaction rate of carbohydrate  degradation was found to be considerably lower when compared with those of control  without surfactants. The surfactant mixture was observed to accelerate the  deresination process during the pulping heat-up period. However, the dissolved  extractives diffused out of the wood chips at slower rate when the surfactants were  present. This was a result of more micelles being formed by surfactants and  dissolved extractives which also are surfactants. The sodium sulfite concentration profiles in wood after cooking  indicated that the surfactant mixture could increase the diffusion process by  improving the swelling of the lignin fraction. It was concluded that surfactants  could modify the mass transfer mechanism. However, the experiments also indicated  that the diffusion of surfactants was rather slow. Compared to the cooks with the  surfactants, the reaction rates of the control cooks were found to be higher. As  more of the wood components got dissolved, the more porous wood structure was  developed during pulping, which explains, why after certain period of time, the  sodium sulfite content of the control cook was higher. In order to obtain quantitative information on the diffusion  process, the chemical profiles in wood were simulated using the diffusion model with  simultaneous reactions. The simulated chemical distribution curve was adjusted to  fit the measured ones by changing the effective diffusivity. Measurements of a dynamic contact angle, as well as a diameter  and volume of a droplet of pulping liquor were carried out to obtain an in-depth  understanding of the surfactants behavior in pulping process. The results show that  the surfactants did not improve the spreading wetting but improved the absorption.  This phenomenon could not be simply explained as a function of capillary pressure,  in fact, the liquor containing surfactants must have been able to disperse the air  inside the wood structure and therefore to reduce the resistance of air to  penetration and diffusion. Finally, it was found that surfactants improved the pulp yield  as a result of a slower reaction rate and faster diffusion rate, as less lignin  condensation and carbohydrate degradation was observed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Berk, D.

From a  post-structuralist feminist position I show that in its current state the  educational discourse in Pakistan actually disempowers women. This discourse  constitutes gendered identities and positions them in a way that exacerbates and  intensifies inequalities between men and women. Gendered constitution and  positioning of subjects also regulates the relationship between the subjects and the  state in such a way that women and minorities are excluded from the citizenship  realm. Educational discourse in Pakistan is the premier site where  meanings of signs such as woman, man, mother, father, patriot, nationalist, etc.,  are gendered and fixed. It also provides the techniques of discipline and  surveillance for naturalization of meaning and normalization of subjects. Urdu and  social studies curricula and textbooks for classes 1-8 and 3-8 respectively  constitute subjects and subjectivities and relations among them by means such as  inclusion and exclusion from the text, hierarchization of the meanings ascribed to  the subjects, normalization of the ascribed meanings (so that subjects stop  questioning the meaning fixation), totalization (where all theoretical and  explanatory differences are obfuscated), and classification of subjects in terms of  binary opposites where one is superior to the other. As a result of such gendered subjectivity constitution and  subject positioning, women in Pakistan have been subjected to the worst kind of  social, political, economic and juridical discrimination. However, Pakistani women  have refused to be passive victims. They have used their agency to put up a spirited  resistance against the unequal citizenship status and rights resulting from the  gendered subjectivity constitution and subject positioning. In order to make  education more meaningful and empowering for the women of Pakistan it is imperative  that both women's groups as well as the educational policy makers understand the  working and dynamics of the educational discourse in conjunction with the judicial  and economic discourses and those of the state and the media. It is only from within  the discourses that a change can be brought about.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk32g.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv06k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education -- Curricula -- Pakistan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education and state -- Pakistan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women -- Education -- Pakistan</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex discrimination -- Pakistan</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806027v"><dcterms:title>The relationship between student teachers and cooperating teachers as a foundation for the development of reflective thinking : an exploratory study based on student teachers' perceptions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Thibeault, Johanne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The development of reflective thinking in student teachers has  been gaining greater attention in the teacher education literature. Nevertheless,  some of the multiple factors involved in this process have not yet been examined.  This study focused on the perceptions that student teachers have of their  relationship with their cooperating teachers in the context of a practicum. More  specifically, it attempted to determine if and how cooperating teachers trigger  student teachers' reflective thinking. Seventeen student teachers, who made up the  first cohort to experience the four-year undergraduate program in teaching English  as a second language, participated in this exploratory study. Three sets of data  were collected through questionnaires, interviews and reflective logs. Two phases of  analysis followed, allowing the categorization of results and patterns into five  distinct categories that corresponded to the research questions. The quantitative  phase provided the results to the Likert-type questionnaire using two statistical  management softwares: SPSS 10.0 and Excel. The qualitative phase used a coding  system to identify the emerging patterns in the interview and in the reflective log  data. The first phase of analysis provided descriptive statistics indicating that it  is the cooperating teachers' verbal communication that most triggers student  teachers' reflective thinking. The second phase revealed that student teachers  attribute the triggering of their reflective thinking more to themselves and to  class incidents than to their cooperating teachers. Based on the findings, Taggart's  (1996) Reflective Thinking Model was enhanced by a socio-constructivist micro-model  designed to help cooperating teachers better support student teachers' reflection.  The study contributes to teacher education research by elucidating the relationship  between student teachers and cooperating teachers with regards to the development of  reflective thinking.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winer, Lise (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gd485.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806027v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Teacher Training.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqz20st04w"><dcterms:title>Characterization and functional analysis of the SIV untranslated region</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Whitney, James Burton</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The focus of this dissertation is twofold. The first section  aims at elucidating and describing the functional role(s) of the 5' untranslated  region of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239). This work focuses on several  interrelated areas involving this important control locus of SIV. Specifically, the  first section involves the determination of cis-acting structural elements and  sequences involved in RNA encapsidation and regions impacting RNA dimerization. This  work also elucidates the location of the KLD/DIS region within the SIV leader  expanse. This work is novel and has contributed significantly to the overall  understanding of this region and its role in RNA-protein  interaction. Although the second portion of this dissertation is somewhat  arbitrarily divided, the general focus is on the characterization of novel SIV  vaccine candidates. The salient difference of the abovementioned variants is that  they are devoid of all accessory genes. The missing functions have been replaced by  comparable elements from other viruses. One adjunct to this work, in conjunction with the above RNA  packaging studies, was a discovery process for genetically stable attenuated  variants suitable for evaluation as vaccine candidates in the macaque model system.  One area of concern in live attenuated vaccine research is compensatory reversion  and the inherent genetic instability of live-attenuated vaccine approaches. This  latter topic is addressed in part in the second half of this dissertation. The final  chapter specifically considers methodologies that might impair or offset viral  compensatory mutagenesis. Interestingly, the region investigated in the first half  of this thesis, i.e. SL1, is a determinant of retroviral variation, that has been  found necessary for efficient reversion in conjunction with RT. The first chapter of  this section summarizes this work and integrates it into the current body of  literature in review format.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wainberg, Mark A.

The results of these investigations have  indicated that the use of higher values of carrier gas flow rates or high constant  pressures, during Py-GC/MS analysis can increase the total number of peaks and total  area counts of the pyrograms. The influence of the reaction phase on the mechanism  of formation of Maillard products was studied by comparison of 13C-label  incorporation patterns of the common products formed in model systems consisting of  labeled glycine and D-glucoses subjected to both pyrolysis and heating in aqueous  solutions. Although pyrolysis reaction produced higher number of products, however,  the major pathways of formation of variety of important Maillard products followed  the same mechanism under both pyrolytic and aqueous systems.

Our initial emphasis is on  the description of time-dependent, yet supersymmetric, brane configurations and to  this end we first provide a review of established results on D-branes. We then  investigate various supersymmetric brane intersections. Motivated by the recent  results on supertubes, we investigate general constraints under which parallel  brane-antibrane configurations are supersymmetric. Dual descriptions of these  configurations involve systems of intersecting branes in relative motion. In  particular, we find new supersymmetric configurations which are not related to a  static brane intersection by a boost. In these new configurations, the intersection  point moves at the speed of light. We then briefly review the AdS/CFT correspondence  between string and gauge theories. Our emphasis here is on the recent development of  D-brane configurations that can be used to add fundamental flavour to the gauge  theories. We compute the meson spectrum of an N = 2 super Yang-Mills theory with  fundamental matter from its dual string theory on AdS5 x S 5 with a D7-brane probe.  For scalar and vector mesons with arbitrary R-charge the spectrum is computed in  closed form by solving the equations for D7-brane fluctuations; for matter with  non-zero mass mq it is discrete and exhibits a mass gap of order mq/ gsN . The  spectrum of mesons with large spin J is obtained from semiclassical, rotating open  strings attached to the D7-brane. It displays Regge-like behaviour for J ≪gsN  , whereas for J ≫gsN it corresponds to that of two non-relativistic quarks  bound by a Coulomb potential.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Myers, Robert (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79407x78z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q4449</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avd66w0424"><dcterms:title>Entre globalisation et réalités locales : centres commerciaux et formes urbaines à Los Angeles, Montréal et Paris = Between globalization and local realities : shopping centers and urban forms in Los Angeles, Montreal and Paris</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Urban Planning</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moretti, GianPiero</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Since the end of World War II, the shopping center has been  diffused as a building type through the western world and has acquired a central  role in suburban territories.

Even if it  contributes in an important manner to the life of suburbia, it is an introverted  building that has limited relationships with exterior spaces.

The narratives compared and contrasted in this study are the  birth narratives of Moses and the Buddha.

This comparative study  highlights and examines the similarities and differences presented in their birth  narratives and seeks to determine the significance these narratives have from within  the context of their respective doctrinal traditions. Although studying one  tradition alone produces important results, it is only by comparing and contrasting  religious traditions, and in this case the birth narratives of different religious  traditions, that the uniqueness and qualities of each come into full  view. This study begins with an examination of Moses' birth narrative,  first as it has been understood by modern scholarship, and then as it has been  presented in the classical literature of early Judaism. In the second part, the  Buddha's birth narrative is explored, first from the perspective of modern, Western  scholarship, and then as it appears in the Pali and Sanskrit literature of early  Buddhism.

The introduction places the study in the context of literary studies  of biblical texts and of recent scholarship on Lamentations. The book is read in its  canonical order, identifying the images and patterns of imagery which occur in each  poem. Major images are compared with similar images in other biblical poetry and  interpreted as to the themes which they express. Comparison of imagery which appears  in several poems illustrates how the experience of the fall of Jerusalem is  variously understood and expressed within the book as a whole. The poems depict the  suffering and losses of the community during the siege and its aftermath, while  attempting to understand what these events mean for the community's relationship  with its god. The speaker of Lam 3, however, reflects on human suffering from the  perspective of an individual man. The poems and the book as a whole express vividly  the experience of loss and suffering. The religious meaning of the disaster remains  unanswered throughout the book, with the possible exception of the first chapter,  where the balance of imagery of sin and suffering suggests that the sufferers  receive what they have deserved for their sins. The book as a whole both expresses  loss and suffering and inquires without final resolution as to the religious meaning  of the communal disaster.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh21z.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268565z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Suffering in the Bible</dc:subject><dc:subject>Symbolism in the Bible</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj49r"><dcterms:title>La fatigue romanesque de Joseph Joubert /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beaulieu, Etienne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The opus of Joseph Joubert (1754--1824) was for a long period  barely known, due to the fact that it languished unpublished, both during his  lifetime and after his death, until the complete version of his Notebooks was  brought out in 1938 by Andre Beaunier (reissued in 1994). It was thanks to this new  form which his thoughts now took that a completely new Joubert came into view. No  longer was he merely a moralist, as portrayed by Sainte-Beuve, whose version held  sway for a number of decades, but a diarist as well, i.e., writing his thoughts on a  daily basis, in the bourgeois tradition of the books of hours. However, there is  something else visible in Joubert's works, for, as Maurice Blanchot put it,  "[Joubert's] journal, while it still takes days as its starting point, is not a  reflection thereof, but reaches toward something other than them" (Le Livre a  venir). Toward what does it reach? On the one hand, one can see, as Georges Poulet  does, that Joubert "is not a philosopher, a moralist or an aphorist, but a  wonderful poet of light." (Etudes sur le temps humain ). On the other hand,  however, Joubert, in a way which is surprising and as yet unexplored, is also a  thinker who takes on novelistic thought, that is, the Hegelian world, and thus the  world of prose in all of its fullness. If we consider novelistic thought as  superimposing essence onto existence in an attempt to discover the former within the  latter (which makes the novel the locus, through the experience of weariness, of the  question of man's salvation in a world in which religion's possibilities are  elusive), this study ventures a survey of the Notebooks, paying particular attention  to the forms taken by return in Joubert's thought and then following the uncompleted  circles of detour which Jacques Ranciere has called "The Book of Life" (La  parole muette).

The field of  quantitative genetics provides the tools necessary to study evolutionary  constraints, mainly through the estimation of the matrix of additive genetic  variance and covariance (the G matrix). The main goals of this Ph.D. dissertation  were to study the persistence of constraints across environments and across species,  to explore the consequences of constraints on species divergence, and to try to  understand some morphological and life history characteristics of field crickets in  light of genetic variation. Populations of seven wing-dimorphic cricket species from  the genera Gryllus and Teleogryllus were sampled from the wild and reared in the  laboratory. Using multiple statistical approaches to the comparison of G matrices,  results revealed little variation in G matrices across species. Moreover, the  relatively small effect of rearing environment and of the two wing morphologies on G  were shown to be of the same magnitude as variation between species, therefore  confirming the general constancy of genetic constraints through evolutionary time  scales. Mean trait values, selection regimes and phylogenetic distances were all  shown not to be predictors of G matrix variation. In agreement with the constraint  hypothesis of quantitative genetic theory, morphological divergence between species  was shown to be predictable from a reconstructed ancestral G matrix. In addition,  information on genetic variation was used to explain various patterns relating to  size, ovipositor length, wing morphology and diapause occurrence in field crickets.  Overall, we suggest that genetic constraints, as described by quantitative genetics,  have played a major role in shaping the observed biological diversity of field  cricket species, a conclusion tha</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bell, Graham (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Roff, Derek (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333271t.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301190x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dimorphism (Animals)</dc:subject><dc:subject>field crickets</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gryllus -- Morphology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gryllus -- Evolution.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quantitative genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agt54kn622"><dcterms:title>Generalized models in epidemiology research</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Benedetti, Andrea</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Traditionally, epidemiologists have used methods that categorize  or assume a linear or log-linear form to model dose-response associations between  continuous independent variables and binary or continuous outcomes. Recent advances  in both statistical methodology and computing resources have made it possible to  model relationships of greater complexity. Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a  flexible nonparametric modelling tool that allows the user to model a variety of  non-linear dose-response curves without imposing a priori assumptions about the  functional form of the relationship. In GAMs, the extent of smoothing is controlled  by the user-defined degrees of freedom (df). GAMs are generally used to: (i) suggest  the parametric functional form for the association of interest; (ii) model the main  effect nonparametrically; and (iii) control confounding by continuous covariates. By  way of a series of simulation studies, this thesis addresses several unresolved  methodological issues involving all three of these uses. Although GAMs have been  used to detect and estimate thresholds in the association of interest, the methods  have been mostly subjective or ad hoc, and the statistical properties have not been  evaluated for the most part. In the first simulation study, a formal approach to the  use of GAMs for this purpose is suggested and compared with simpler approaches. When  GAMs are used to estimate the effect of the primary exposure of interest different  approaches to determining the amount of smoothing are employed. In the second  simulation study, the impact on statistical inference of various a priori and  automatic df-selection strategies is investigated and a method to correct the type I  error is introduced and evaluated. In the final simulation study, parametric multiple logistic  regression was compared with its nonparametric GAM extension in their ability to  control for a continuous confounding variable and several issues related to the  implementation of GAMs in this context are investigated. The results of these simulations will help researchers make  optimal use of the potential advantages of flexible assumption-free  modelling.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Abrahamowicz, Michal (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n848h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn622</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Att44pn40s"><dcterms:title>Participatory action research (PAR) : a view from the field</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Fahmi, Kamal Hanna</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The phenomenon of street children is world-wide and on the  increase despite numerous programs aiming at its eradication. The failure to  adequately address this complex and very diverse phenomenon is the result of  conceptual confusion with respect to defining who a street child is. The dominant  discourse on street children defines them as victims or deviants to be rescued and  rehabilitated. As such, the capacity of many of these children for human agency is  occluded by excluding them from participation in the construction of solutions to  their problems. I argue that, far from being mere victims and deviants, these kids,  in running away from alienating structures and finding relative freedom in the  street, often become autonomous and are capable of actively defining their  situations in their own terms. They are able to challenge the roles assigned to  children, make judgements and develop a network of niches in the heart of the  metropolis in order to resist exclusion and chronic repression. I further argue that  for research and action with street kids to be emancipatory, it is necessary to  acknowledge and respect the human agency the kids display in changing their own  lives and to capitalize on their voluntary participation in non-formal educational  activities as well as in collective advocacy. The thesis draws on a participatory action research (PAR)  methodology spanning eight years of fieldwork with street kids in Cairo, which  eclectically combined street ethnography, street work and action science. I  critically review the historical development of these methodologies, and I argue for  a conception of PAR as an open-ended process of action and reflective participatory  research incorporated into everyday activities and work with excluded, marginalized  and oppressed groups such as street kids. As such, I pay special attention to the  ethical dilemmas that arise in day-to-day PAR practice.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Davies, Linda (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Racine, Guylaine (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh35s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn40s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Street children -- Egypt -- Cairo.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Participant observation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social work with youth -- Egypt -- Cairo</dc:subject><dc:subject>Street youth -- Egypt -- Cairo.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w783q"><dcterms:title>Metabolic role of the mitochondrial NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Di Pietro, Erminia</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Folate-dependent enzymes are compartmentalized between the  cytoplasm and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. The cytoplasm contains an  NADP-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate  cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase that is involved in interconverting  one-carbon substituted tetrahydrofolates that play essential roles in thymidylate  and purine biosynthesis as well as in methionine regeneration. The extent of  contribution of mitochondrial folate metabolism to cytoplasmic processes is an area  of active investigation. A bifunctional NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate  dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (NMDMC) is located in  mitochondria of certain mammalian cells. NMDMC expression in embryonic tissues and  established cell lines but not in most adult tissues suggests that it plays a role  in embryonic development. Examination of the expression pattern revealed that nmdmc  is widely expressed in tissues of embryonic day (E)9.5 and E10.5 embryos. To  determine its metabolic role, a knockout approach was used to disrupt the gene  encoding NMDMC in mice. Heterozygous mice appear normal but nmdmc-/- embryos die in  utero beyond E13.5. Nmdmc-/- fetal livers at E12.5 are smaller in size, lack the  characteristic red coloring of a normal liver, but contain similar frequencies of  hematopoietic progenitors as do the livers of wild type or heterozygous littermates.  This indicates that the failure to establish definitive erythropoiesis in nmdmc-/-  embryos is due to the inability of the hematopoietic progenitors to proliferate.  Established fibroblasts were generated from wild type, heterozygous and null mutant  embryos. Mitochondria of nmdmc-/- cells are structurally intact, retain a membrane  potential and do not require NMDMC to support the initiation of protein synthesis.

Online news sites offer new patterns for the  production and consumption of media content and function as communication spaces in  realms which lie beyond existing social and political constraints. This dissertation  begins with an analysis of the social construction of the Internet in Egypt. It  endeavours to show how certain political, economic and cultural interests and the  agendas of key social actors are shaping the development of the Internet in Egypt.  It also describes how institutional arrangements, the regulatory system and the  communications culture are mediating the implementation and uses of the Internet.  Following this analysis, the dissertation explores the nature of the Internet news  medium, its communication architecture and its unique capabilities. Case studies of  two Egyptian news organizations and their online news production processes are  presented in order to develop an understanding of journalists' conceptions of the  new medium, their work practices and the online gate-keeping processes. These case  studies highlight different methods for constructing online audiences and different  ways to approach the online news medium. Online news text and its structural and  stylistic features are then analysed. Finally, the impact of the Internet on the  mass media regime is assessed, paying particular attention to issues of access and  participation, censorship and freedom of expression. The dissertation closes by  considering the implications of the online medium for the emerging civil society in  Egypt. The online medium permits new actors to participate freely in public debate,  and could thus present a serious challenge to the dominance of the state in the  public domain.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Robinson, G.

It has  re-opened basic theoretical questions about cinematic representations of and  reference to reality. This thesis begins with a critical review of the vast  theoretical literature dealing with the digitization of the cinema. Most theorists  have come to the conclusion that the cinema is dead because digitization has severed  the ties between what we see on the screen and real life. At root, this conclusion  is derived from a structuralist, nominalist position prevalent in contemporary film  theory. I argue, instead, that film theory needs to re-address the  complex issue of the relationship between image and reality, rather than simply  accepting the traditional view. In so doing, I follow Stanley Cavell's call for a  more thorough consideration of realist traditions in film theory, the premise of  which is an unquestioned relationship between representation and  reality. The complexity and subtlety of that relationship has been  addressed most systematically and fruitfully by Charles Saunders Peirce. Indeed,  many structuralist theorists have made reference to Peirce in response to the  shortcomings of a semiologically inflected film theory. In the second step of my  argument, however, I show that structuralist theory has produced misleading  conclusions, since a Peircian semiotics is incommensurable with the structuralist  position. In fact, this implicit conflict has led theorists to doubt the real in the  digital cinema, rather than investigating the logically necessary continuity of  reality and representation, regardless of its technological kind.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straw, William (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb83h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf03c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Digital cinematography</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- Aesthetics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motion pictures -- Semiotics</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
