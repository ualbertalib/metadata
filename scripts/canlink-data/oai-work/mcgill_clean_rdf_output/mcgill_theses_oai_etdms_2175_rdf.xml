The steady-state conformational equilibrium of the double mutant (alpha1M32E233K) is shifted towards E 1, which was evidenced by kinetic changes including (1) a 15-fold reduction in catalytic turnover (Vmax/EPmax), (2) an increase in apparent affinity for ATP, (3) a decrease in vanadate sensitivity, (4) a marked (≈10-fold) K+-activation of Na-ATPase activity, and (5) altered cation affinities. The decrease in catalytic turnover effected by the double mutation was associated with a 5-fold decrease in Vmax and a compensatory ≈3-fold increase in expressed alpha1M32E233K protein. The importance of charge at residue 233 is underscored by the consequences of single and double mutations comprising either a conservative (E233D), a neutral (E233Q), or a positive (E233K) substitution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blostein, R.

Differences were not statistically significant in terms of age and ISS between treatment groups. Mortality, when examined using both the Intent to Treat and Efficacy approaches, did not differ between ALS and BLS patients. Prehospital treatment type was not a significant predictor of mortality, or length of hospital stay. Patients treated by MD-ALS required home-care services more often than BLS patients once discharged, and spent significantly more time at the injury scene.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sampalis, John (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz67c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p248p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4j03d219v"><dcterms:title>Identification of the transcriptional repression domain of the adenovirus type 5 E1B-55 kDa protein</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Assefi, Laila.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The E1B-55 kDa protein of human adenovirus type 5 is known to function early in lytic infection by reversing growth arrest and apoptosis that result from E1A-induced accumulation and activation of the p53 cellular tumor suppressor. This function allows infected cells to survive long enough to produce high levels of progeny virions, and in the case of rodent cells it permits the formation of stable E1A transformants. The E1B-55 kDa protein binds to p53 and inhibits its ability to activate transcription. Inhibition of p53 appears to result from transcriptional repression activity associated with the E1B-55 kDa polypeptide. In the present studies using fusion products containing the DNA binding domain of Gal4 linked to a series of mutant E1B-55 kDa proteins, we have identified a domain towards its carboxy terminus that is responsible for repression. It may function directly as a repressor or it may bind to a cellular repressor that is targeted to p53-dependent promoters through interactions of the E1B-55 kDa protein with p53. This domain is also present in the 156-residue (156R) product of E1B, which is composed of the amino terminus 79 and carboxy terminus 77 amino acids of the E1B-55 kDa protein. Although 156R does not appear to bind to p53 in the in vivo experiments conducted here, its repression activity could be directed against other targets through a separate mechanism.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Branton, P.

Statements generated by youth during focus groups and on the questionnaires raise considerable concerns regarding the painful experience of shame, and the resultant feelings of self-harm and suicide.

Without adequate detection, referral to social and community services are less likely to occur, rendering women victims vulnerable to continued risk physically, psychologically and medically. This study seeks to describe actual detection and referral practices in an emergency department at a large teaching hospital in Quebec, as well as explore health care professionals' knowledge about and practices regarding the detection and referral of battered women. Its aim is to better understand the pathways and barriers to detection and referral of abused women in order to enhance current practice responses in emergency departments. To examine detection and referral rates and predictors of battery, 200 medical charts from the emergency department were reviewed. Supplementing analyses of the charts were in depth interviews with ten health care professionals working in the emergency department. From these sources of data, it became apparent that neither detection nor referral occur in any systematic fashion. Whereas health care professionals seem to know a great deal about battery, their actual practice appears to be contradictory. Gynecological problems and woman's age were not found to be related to detail in charts but physical injuries were. Whereas a positive relationship was found between detection and referral in the chart reviews, everyday practice showed inadequacy in both areas. Implications for social work contributions to health care practice related to battery are offered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Krane, Julia (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v7689.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw70k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Medical social work.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hospitals -- Emergency services.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Abused women -- Medical care.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Azg64tp079"><dcterms:title>Home care : evaluation of a case management model</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Grenier, Amanda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Increasing numbers of older persons, service provision within the home and shrinking resources have resulted in the need to evaluate service provision.

Examination of files (N = 100) revealed that objectives were not being obtained: client involvement was low, services were late, and files were poorly completed. Only 14 (9%) of clients were referred for the SF-12(TM); further investigation revealed systemic difficulties such as lost clients (N = 4). Worker interviews (N = 12) explained that heavy caseloads result in reactive services, poor completion of case management functions, and service implications for clients. Strengths included the multi-disciplinary approach and single point of entry. Recommendations include a cost benefit analysis, an outcome measure, a caseload standard and a quality assurance model that assures accountability and monitoring.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duder, Sydney (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4306857.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tp079</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Older people -- Home care -- Québec (Province) -- Evaluation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Home care services -- Québec (Province) -- Evaluation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5712m896m"><dcterms:title>The impact of AIDS on the life cycle of young gay men /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bourgeois, Chantal G.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Objectives. Explore and describe the impact of premature life-threatening illness, stigma, multiple loss of significant others, decreased vocational choice and mobility and decreased financial security among young gay men living with AIDS. It was hypothesized that young gay men with AIDS and the elderly experience similar physical, social, and psychological changes, but the cognitive adaptation to these changes are hindered by the non-normative timing of these events. Methods. Thirty-two self-identified gay men with AIDS between the ages of 22 to 44 years were recruited from an out-patient clinic in Montreal. These participants were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire, which assessed the respondent's daily stress, impact of HIV, health-related quality of life, ways of coping, multiple loss, dependency on informal and formal supports, and preparation for death. Quantitative methods were used to analyse the data. Results. The hypothesis was confirmed. Respondents reported relatively low levels of health-related quality of life, significant concern over health and financial security, considerable multiple loss, increased dependency on informal and formal supports, proportionally greater use of active coping strategies, and significant concern about discrimination. Conclusions. A comprehensive method of intervention which addresses all of the biopsychosocial aspects to care is proposed. It is suggested that a coordinated multidisiciplinary approach to clinical and research endeavors should be adopted to address the multidimensional obstacles facing young gay men with AIDS.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rowe, William (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs66g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m896m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) -- Patients -- Mental health</dc:subject><dc:subject>AIDS (Disease) -- Psychological aspects</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axs55mf00h"><dcterms:title>De l'impasse du divorce à l'aliénation parentale</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bellerose, Jean-Guy.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As the rate of divorce is increasing, the number of children who have to cope with these stressful situations is also growing. Since these divorces come with many problems for the children involved, they are getting more and more attention. The professionnals who are required by the court to give their opinion on who should get the custody or what will be the right of access, have pointed out a particular phenomenon: parental alienation syndrome. The first person who described this syndrome was Gardner (1989, 1992a). He blamed the court system for the syndrome, where, in its adversarial perspective, one side tries to win over the other using alienation as one of their strategies. In our opinion, this view does not account for all the aspects of the parental alienation syndrome and for the emotional turmoil created by the divorce. When, after a divorce, one is trapped in one's emotions, the result is an impass, where parental alienation is but one aspect of this impass. This paper shows how an impass, grows and which form the parental alienation syndrome takes. Cases from our practice will illustrate some situations of parental alienation resulting from a psychological impass and where the children are the victims.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>John, Lindsay (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75df70p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mf00h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Divorced parents -- Psychology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Divorced parents -- Family relationships.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children of divorced parents</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6t053j257"><dcterms:title>Architecture and the bee : virtue and memory in Filarete's Trattato di architettura</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yocum, Carole.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Antonio Averlino, known as Filarete (1400--1469), wrote that architecture is a gestational process, likening the architect to the mother and the father as the client. The process requires the architect-mother to " fantasticare e pensare e rivoltarselo per la memoria," fermenting ideas and incubating them in conjunction with one's memory. The intent is to understand mnemonics as a creative operation in Filarete's Trattato di Architettura. A key to this lies with Filarete's personal symbol, the bee. The bee's process of mellification acts as a metaphor of the architect's gestational design. The bee, long utilized as a memorative trope, points towards other memory models created throughout the treatise, culminating with the design for the House of Vice and Virtue. Directing the reader and inhabitants of the city in a social narrative, Filarete's architecture reveals the dependence upon remembrance and virtue for the city's creation and public rituals to sustain its life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n327j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053j257</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Filarete, ca. 1400-ca. 1469.

This has resulted in a change in the built environment of traditional settlements. There are many dynamic factors which help to shape the decisions people make about the physical nature of their built environment. The linking of these decision-making factors to the external forces influencing society is very important to arrive at a clear understanding of how traditional forms give way to new ones. This thesis links global and local forces in interaction in the small mountain community of Karimabad, Hunza in Northern Pakistan, which is experiencing the effects of a capital economy and the new social and cultural milieu which accompanies it. Added to that the community has also been subjected to the effects of international tourism and development projects. The thesis shows, how, under the influences of these factors, the local traditional house form has transformed in terms of change in building materials and housing layouts. This study was also carried out with the view of linking local perceptions of change, with the actual physical changes in housing. The thesis attempts to show how the ordinary household in Karimabad makes its decisions for change, and views the outside world and their place in it, and how this change is reflected in the changed house forms and building materials. This research also draws on the theoretical framework and references of how globalization is affecting traditional settlements on the periphery. The findings of the study point to a strong link between external influences, especially of media, tourism, and international development institutions, and the changed house forms and materials. It also shows that it is not possible to isolate individual decision-making from external influences, especially where material culture is concerned.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227ms032.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752j942</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Pakistan -- Karimabad.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hunza (Pakistan) -- Social conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A7s75df71z"><dcterms:title>An architectural excursus into the site of becoming : Domenico Fontana's Della trasportatione dell'obelisco Vaticano</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Toker, Eric Solomon.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>At the close of the sixteenth century, the Roman architect Domenico Fontana choreographed the transformation of the Vatican Obelisk from its antique position on the circus of Nero, to its present location facing St. Peter's. Fontana's treatise Della trasportatione dell'obelisco Vaticano (1590), records this event in a detailed narrative, and a series of remarkable etchings. Architect to Pope Sixtus V, Fontana is often cited as a founder of city planning due to his seminal reorganization of Rome's topography, and as an early proponent of civil engineering owing to his calculated mechanics. Yet neither of these appellations do justice to Fontana's complex practice, one in which architecture is composed in time, characterized by the intensity and profundity of the festival, and the divine power of Man to operate within a world of sympathies. The scaffold which translates the obelisk---and the occulted knowledge of these cosmographic relations---into the space of the city, also invokes an alternate tradition for architecture. Opposite classical solidity and eternal being, Fontana's castello proposes the immaterial, and the ephemeral. An inquiry into this scene of emerging order is particularly relevant for our contemporary world, with our idols fallen and our foundations in rain. Appended to this thesis is an abridged English translation of Della trasportatione, chapter 1.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s645.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75df71z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Obelisks -- Vatican City.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vatican City -- Buildings, structures, etc.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fontana, Domenico, 1543-1607.

Six building systems, developed and produced in Canada, have been selected for this purpose. In order to compare them to existing system, the set of criteria for evaluation is developed, based on three major aspects: the technical aspect deals with codes and regulations, implementation, durability and other physical characteristics of building systems; the economic aspect compares costs; and the psychological aspect investigates the level of acceptance from both the builders' and homeowners' point of view. The results of this research prove the complexity of the issue of technology transfer. Even though all evaluated building systems showed technical and, particularly economical improvements over the existing masonry, it is the issue of cultural acceptance that is the determining factor in the success of a new product. That is the main reason why building systems based on concrete would more likely be accepted over "light" frame systems.

Two approaches were used to minimize the effect of the high gangue density in estimating the GRG content, oversize removal and 2:1 ratio dilution with silica flour. The amount of GRG was determined in four ore samples with an established protocol, yielding values of 35% to 78% of total gold. Results from the Angnico-Eagle La Ronde Division (AELRD), Louvicourt and East Malartic mills suggest that the typical Knelson-based gravity circuit which can recover one half to two thirds of GRG from low density gangues will only recover one third to two fifths of the GRG from high density gangues. Simulation of gold recovery at AELRD showed that the high circulating loads, 700--1100%, were a significant factor in reducing gold recovery by gravity.

Extraction of this valuable fuel has always been influenced by control over hazards such as water inflows and potentially explosive dust and methane gas. A major focus of the research has been on methane including: methane properties of seams, insitu and laboratory testing; methane emissions; investigation of operational issues (e. g. Phalen 7 East); and refinement of prediction models. This thesis gives an overview of methane and ventilation research covering the following aspects: Defining coal seam characteristics: specific emissions---the relationship between methane content, coal 'rank' and depth; the geothermal gradient; insitu gas pressure; and associated hydrocarbon content of mine air samples analyzed. Defining the performance of Sewergate ventilation, particularly on Phalen 7 East. Sewergate ventilation is a marriage between a typical 'U' and a bleeder ventilation system. Underground measurements including a novel use of 'tubebundles', have provided a clearer understanding of factors affecting Sewergate performance.

Three types (to test the effect of gangue density and size distribution) of synthetic feeds were used to characterize a laboratory 4-in SuperBowl (SB4) as a function of feed rate and fluidization water flow rate.

Dwell is the period where a driven link remains stationary and the tool can be replaced or the workpiece can undergo a machining operation. Unlike lower-pair mechanisms, cam mechanisms can produce dwell exactly. In this thesis, cam-follower systems are used as building modules in the design of quick-return mechanisms. The underlying cam mechanisms are optimized to obtain a compact, quick-return mechanism. A unified method for the optimization of cam mechanisms is proposed. The optimum parameters of the cam mechanism are obtained by cam-area minimization subject to performance and geometric constraints. In addition, the power required from the motor is reduced by adding an elastic torque-compensation mechanism to the system. A Graphical User Interface is developed to aid the designer during the design process. The modular method is applied to the synthesis and optimization of long-stroke, quick-return mechanisms. In addition, the design of a simple cam mechanism to replace the transmission mechanism of a textile machine composed of an elliptic-gear train and a four-bar linkage is also included as an application example.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pg114.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731616d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anc580p73p"><dcterms:title>A system for the acquisition and analysis of blood data for positron emission tomography /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biomedical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wolforth, Mark.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A two-part system for the semi-automatic collection, correction, and analysis of blood data collected during positron emission tomography (PET) studies is presented. The blood data collection system may be used for either manual or automatic sampling of blood, from either arterial or venous source. It performs all corrections required on the blood for confounds external to the body. In addition, this blood collection system allows the integration of an automatic blood sampler with a PET scanner that does not otherwise support one. Finally, it writes a data file in a new, portable, and extensible file format for the storage of blood data. The blood analysis system reads this blood data file and allows the rapid implementation of compartmental kinetic models of tracer behaviour. The tools that comprise this system are also extensible and allow the development of analysis tools for other brain imaging modalities.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Evans, Alan C.

As a feed stream enters the thickener, the solids settle to the bottom. Clarified liquid overflows the top and the settled solids (underflow) is removed. Thickeners are widely used in the minerals and metal processing industry. To assist in the monitoring and control of thickeners a conductivity probe has been developed. Test work was carried out on a concentrate thickener at the Copper Cliff, Ontario Division of Inco Limited in Sudbury. The conductivity probe is a multicell arrangement. It exploits the difference in conductivity between liquid, slurry and settled solids. A conductivity profile is collected which locates the interfaces (liquid/slurry, slurry/settled solids) by detecting the change in conductivity, The conductivity profile can be readily converted to a solids concentration profile using a model due to Maxwell. From the solids profile, a solids inventory are obtained along with an estimation of underflow density. The main tasks in this thesis were to (a) develop a method of on-line calibration and (b) develop a level estimation procedure. The former was achieved by designing a portable probe and lowering it in to predetermined positions corresponding to rings on the probe. The time between re-calibration was also established (ca. 10 days). In the case of the level a previous method using a 0--1 scale has been converted to a true bed height using the bed height estimated by the operators using a weighted rope.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Finch, J.

The microstructure was manipulated through room temperature deformation, heat treatment and varying the C content of the material. Deformation of the material resulted in a strain-induced transformation (SIT) of the metastable face-centered cubic crystal structure to the stable hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. The volume fraction of the HCP phase was found to be proportional to the applied strain and was also found to decrease with an increase in the C content. Nor deformation of the material improved the mechanical properties by increasing the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the material without any significant losses to the elongation to fracture. A heat treatment was performed prior to room temperature deformation in order to homogenize the microstructure. This lowered the amount of SIT and the strength of the material, due to the coarser grain structure. The coefficient of friction of the material decreased when the C content in the alloy was low. There were no significant changes to the coefficient of friction with increasing amounts of the HCP phase in the bulk microstructure.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Yue, Steve (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Bobyn, J.

In this thesis, we will consider the design of an electrical-optical interface for a free-space optical backplane that can support 307.2 Gigabits per second (Gb/s) of aggregate data traffic. The electrical-optical interface is also known as a "Smart Pixel Array" (SPA) since it is an integrated two-dimensional array of opto-electronic devices with optical and electronic I/O, and with electronic processing capabilities. To take advantage of the very high bandwidth of optics, the on-chip electronics must be carefully designed to support the necessary functions required, while minimizing critical paths to support very high optical clock rates.
