This study identifies the law applicable and its origins. By its very nature and to a great extent, admiralty law is linked to the private law system. What should be the role played by admiralty law and what is the relationship between admiralty law and civil law when a maritime case arises in the province of Quebec is the question addressed here. To identify the applicable law and its sources is a very complex and difficult task because of the Canadian federalism and the civilian character of Quebec's private law. Accordingly, the purpose of this thesis is to present a theoretical framework necessary to identify the sources of the applicable law and its contents. After pointing out the diversity of the activities carried on by the shipping industry, the author analyzes the historic and the actual sources of the applicable law in Quebec. In this regard he questions the desirability of applying rules from the common law in admiralty cases where such litigation has its origins in Quebec. Particularly, it is the author's contention that the Supreme Court of Canada's approach in this respect is not well founded from a legal point of view. In the second part of the thesis, he analyzes the contents of the applicable law. He focusses on the relationship between traditional admiralty rules and the civil code of Quebec. In order to do so, the study is made on a comparative basis--civil law and common law.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq35p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c61w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Law.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aj38607812"><dcterms:title>Social identity patterns in the police : attitudinal and performance implications</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Perrott, Stephen B.

Results from two questionnaires showed that police peers were a clearly defined ingroup, and that social nearness to community groups was determined both on the basis of race and social class. In spite of significant between group differences, those officers closest to their peers were also socially nearest to the community groups. This finding, in conjunction with unremarkable levels of authoritarianism and stress in the sample, tend to refute the ethnocentric and stressed stereotype of police officers. The second questionnaire also elicited attitudes and behavioral intentions in response to police situation vignettes. Results showed the officers were most satisfied, and perceived most support from the public, when acting in a crime fighting capacity.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x479c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j38607812</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Police psychology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Police -- Attitudes.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqn59q482q"><dcterms:title>Effects of polymers on colloidal interactions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>De Witt, James A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The behaviour of neutral, linear polymers in colloidal systems was studied.

The observed optimal surface concentration and capture efficiency were compared with theoretical estimates. Self-reversing flocculation was seen in some cases involving non-equilibrium adsorption. The forces between pairs of sterically stabilized spheres colliding in shear flow were determined from analysis of the particle trajectories. Impingement of the polymer layers was not extensive. A simple model demonstrated that drag due to fluid drainage through the adsorbed layers may contribute significantly to steric interactions in flow.

Three other tracers were also injected with the surface markers: two vascular space markers, ($ sp{51}$Cr) erythrocytes and ($ sp{125}$I) albumin, and a water space tracer, ($ sp{14}$C) 1,8-octanediol. The mixture was injected into the pulmonary circulation and timed outflow samples were collected in the ascending aorta to obtain dilution curves. With exercise, the increase in pulmonary blood flow was accompanied by a linear increase in oxygen consumption. The range of blood flow achieved varied from 41 ml/s to 457 ml/s. The central blood volume as measured from the intravascular references increased linearly with flow. The tracer accessible extravascular lung water increased with flow and rapidly approached a maximal asymptotic proportion representing 75% of the postmortem lung weight. The ratio of the dilutional estimates of the extravascular lung water to that measured gravimetrically also increased in a similar fashion to reach an asymptotic proportion of close to 100%. These values were attained for moderate values of blood flow and did not increase further with higher blood flows.

The evoked potential was shown to be spatially and temporally stable as well as stationary. The results of the analysis showed that the evoked potential profiles recorded as a function of cortical depth are the product of an interaction between two populations of neurons, each temporally and spatially distinct from the other. Each population could be activated independently of the other. Each were active at the focus of the potentials. There they produced the classical evoked potential characterized by a reversing polarity as a function of depth. Elsewhere in cortex the populations interacted differently and it was possible to separate the contribution of each. The current source density method defined the dimensions of the active populations with a precision not available from the potential field analysis thereby confirming their existence and specifying their origins more accurately. In the discussion, a model is proposed that takes into account these findings in the context of current knowledge of the neuronal connections in the somatosensory cerebral cortex.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b692z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924c625</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqj72p8016"><dcterms:title>Microstructure and 13c-nuclear magnetic relaxation of bacterial poly (b-hydroxyalkanoates)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1991</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Nedea, Maria Elena</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A new method for the determination of the composition of poly($ beta$-hydroxybutyrate-co-$ beta$-hydroxyvalerate) (P(HB-co-HV)) copolyesters, by using optical rotation dispersion (ORD) spectra, was proposed.

This analysis leads to the definition of a work station adapted to design so as to bridge the existing gaps.$ sp4$ The first chapter consists of an introduction which illustrates the approaches that were used to complete this thesis. Several methods and analyses support the development of approaches upon which future research into the philosophy of design using new computer tools should be based. The second chapter lists the computer peripherals which determine the features of a computer work station. Without its peripherals, the computer is simply a giant calculator. It is therefore important to address this subject in depth when creating a work station adapted to design. The third chapter covers the description of current CAD and the manner in which the data are classified according to their use. Following a summary of the history of CAD and the evolution of generations of systems, this chapter describes today's CAD from the point of view of the user, that is, by the data he uses. The fourth chapter of the thesis describes the progress of a project using the process of continuous design. This chapter looks at the interrelation that exists between the stages in order to show the usefulness of the computer as a design tool. Significant interest has been shown in a new stage: the formalization of the project, which makes the link between the drawing stage and the preproject stage. The conclusion of this thesis puts the current CAD situation into perspective in order to pave the way for the development of new CAD, better adapted to architects and designers and allowing them to finally conceive their projects on computer.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Castro, Ricardo (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q75m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb691</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer graphics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Architectural design -- Data processing</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqf85nc027"><dcterms:title>Dynamics and stability of pinned-clamped coaxial cyclindrical shells conveying viscous flow</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Tian, Bin</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents a theoretical study of the stability of pinned-clamped and clamped-pinned coaxial cylindrical shells conveying internal and/or annular incompressible viscous fluid flow. In the present analytical model, fluid viscous effects are taken into consideration. Generally, the viscous nature of the fluid results in both steady and unsteady viscosity-related loads being exerted on the shells, the latter of which are approximated by their inviscid counterpart in this thesis. Upstream pressurization of the flow (to overcome frictional pressure drop) and skin friction on the shell surfaces are taken into account, generating time-averaged normal and tangential loads on the shells. In this model, the shell motions are described by Flugge's shell equations, suitably modified to incorporate the time-averaged stress resultants arising from viscous effects. The unsteady fluid-dynamic forces in these equations are formulated from potential flow theory: the perturbation pressures on the shells are determined from the perturbation velocity potentials via the unsteady Bernoulli equation; those velocity potentials are governed by the Laplace equation, which is solved by the Fourier transform technique. For the clamped-pinned system, since the downstream end of the shell is simply supported, a so-called out-flow model is utilized in modelling the decay of flow perturbations beyond the pinned end. Comparison is made with the existing results for clamped-clamped and clamped-free cases. Finally, future work is suggested with regard to setting up a new analytical model with the unsteady viscous effects taken into account.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Paidoussis, M. P.

Despite their low initial cost and immediate impact, conventional landscapes require significant annual capital and physical resources, such as fuel, water, herbicides and fertilizer. However, low-maintenance alternatives exhibit lower consumption rates and annual cost savings. This paper investigates the saving potential of four low-maintenance alternatives when compared to a conventional option through an evaluation of life cycle cost and annual maintenance resource consumption. The five options were simulated using the proposed site and building of a low-rise, multi-residential housing project in Ottawa, where only the planting design varied for each simulation. The four alternatives involved: (1) replacing 70% of lawn areas with woody plants grouped in mulched beds, (2) eliminating turf and including 85% woody plants and a hard surface area of 15%, (3) replacing 70% of the turf area with naturalized woodland plantings and (4) replacing all turf areas with 85% naturalized woodland and tall grass prairie plantings and including a hard surface area of 15%. Only species that are well-adapted to the site conditions were selected for the alternatives.

To determine if there is a difference in compliance with antimalarial chemoprophylaxis between travellers with and without malaria. Secondarily, to determine if clinical presentation can be used in predicting malaria infection. Design. Case-control study. Subjects. 157 patients with malaria and recent travel to a malaria-endemic area and 157 matched controls. Results. 152 (48%) of all patients had antimalarial chemoprophylaxis prescribed. Chemoprophylaxis use was correlated with region and purpose of travel. Cases were less likely to have been compliant (53%) than controls (76%) (OR = 0.35 (0.27,0.73)). Fever pattern, symptom duration, temperature, splenomegaly, and platelet count were correlated with malaria infection. These criteria, either singly, or in combination, had low sensitivity. Conclusions. Compliance with antimalarial chemoprophylaxis is protective against the subsequent development of malaria. Travel agents and health practitioners should provide travellers with adequate information about chemoprophylaxis. Because no criterion could accurately predict the presence of malaria, testing for malaria should be done in all symptomatic patients with a history of travel to a malaria-endemic area.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gyorkos, Theresa (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h0348.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p46d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An009w3132"><dcterms:title>The Arcadian metropolis : towards a sustainable urban form</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Architecture</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Architecture</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Epp, Eduard</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Our own American past has an invaluable lesson to teach us: a coherent, workable landscape evolves where there is a coherent definition not of man but of man's relation to the world and his fellow man. sk{81} rm John Brinckerhof Jackson This thesis endeavors to give evidence of the Arcadian vision, of a synthetic view of nature and humanity, as it has been understood in the evolving settlement patterns of American civilization over the last 350 years. This thesis suggests that the Arcadian vision is still very much a part of the American psyche and awaits reinterpretation. Evidence is given of how this reinterpretation is already taking place in the urban landscape of America. It also suggests how the Arcadian vision may provide significant clues to realizing meaningful urban and suburban growth into the 21st century expressed in a sustainable urban landscape.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sheppard, Adrian (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Adams, Annmarie (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mc77q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w3132</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>City planning -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Urbanization -- United States</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cities and towns -- United States</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8049g5923"><dcterms:title>A formal method for modeling and analysis of requirements for software /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Pino, Lou</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Requirements that are well understood by a client and a provider are a major contributor to developing and supporting reliable, quality software on time and within budget. This thesis has two thrusts to facilitate improved interpretation of requirements: (1) a requirements model and (2) a new formalism called LaP, with automated tools, to express and analyze requirements. The new formalism is based on the integration of an algebraic based language, Larch, and an extended finite state machine based language, Promela. Larch comes with a theorem prover (Larch Prover) and Promela comes with a tool (SPIN) to aid in the validation of dynamic properties. It is the objective of LaP to express the control and data intensive aspects of requirements. The two thrusts are demonstrated by building a requirements model for real telecommunications requirements that ask for a system that can manage the access configurations of user's accounts in telecommunications equipment.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ferguson, M.

The mut$ sp circ$ mutation is characterized by undetectable enzyme activity in cell extracts, and by the low incorporation of ($ sp{14}$C) propionate in the presence of hydroxocobalamin in culture. A mut$ sp circ$ fibroblast cell line, WG 1681, from an African-American male infant was shown to complement another mut$ sp circ$ cell line, WG 1130. Subsequent cloning and sequencing of cDNA from WG 1681 identified two previously described homozygous polymorphisms: H532R and V671I(1). In addition, compound heterozygosity was observed for two novel changes at highly conserved sites: G623R and G703R. Hybridization of allele specific oligonucleotides to PCR amplified MCM exons from WG 1681 and family members identified a clinically normal mother, sister and half-brother as carriers of the G703R change in cis with both polymorphisms. The putative father was not identified as a carrier of the G623R change. transfection of each change, singly and in cis with both polymorphisms, into GM1673 cells demonstrated a lack of stimulation of ($ sp{14}$C) propionate uptake in the absence and presence of OH-Cbl, in comparison to controls. Co-transfection of each separate mutation with the previously identified R93H mutation of WG 1130 (2) stimulated propionate uptake. These results indicate that G623R and G703R are novel mutations responsible for deficient MCM activity and the mut$ sp circ$ phenotype in WG 1681, and both mutations are independently capable of complementing the R93H mutation of WG 1130.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Rosenblatt, David S.

Tu and Dm5/8, a gene for resistance to Bremia lactucae, are linked in L. sativa. The area surrounding Dm5/8 on the genetic map of L. sativa contains restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. The orientation of Tu relative to Dm5/8 was not known. Locating Tu would indicate which markers are on the map of lettuce close to Tu. To locate Tu on the L. sativa genetic map, F$ sb3$ families from recombinant F$ sb2$ in the Dm5/8 area of a cross between TuMV-resistant (Cobbham Green) and susceptible (Calmar) cultivars were inoculated with TuMV and phenotyped for Tu by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Polyclonal antibodies for immunodetection were produced using turnip mosaic virus coat protein expressed in E. coli. Phenotypic ratios within F$ sb3$ families were used to determine individual F$ sb2$ genotypes for Tu. With these genotypes, Tu was located on the genetic map of L. sativa relative to data present for Dm5/8 and surrounding markers, between OPM18 and OPY13. Using bulked segregant analysis, bulks created for the Dm5/8 locus were screened for genetic polymorphisms by the RAPD technique. Five new RAPD markers, UBC346, UBC517, UBC563, UBC599, and UBC675 were found linked to Tu after mapping relative to F$ sb2$ genotypes for Tu and other RAPD markers. The resulting three-point mapping information indicates that Tu is flanked by two markers, OPM18/OPL08 and UBC346, at respective genetic distances of 0.4 and 0.7 cM.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Fortin, Marc (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx87n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hg30f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Lettuce -- Disease and pest resistance -- Genetic aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Turnip mosaic virus.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sd505"><dcterms:title>Controls on channel form and floodplain character along the Bulstrode River, southern Quebec, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1993</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geography</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Savanhu, G. M. (George Mutangamberi)</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The hydraulic dimensions and planform character of a river channel are very much affected by the channel gradient and the calibre of the bed materials. One of the two major objectives of this study is to analyze these effects on selected reaches along the Bulstrode River, near Victoriaville. The second objective is to relate the variations in gradient, sediment calibre and channel geometry to the changes in floodplain character along the river valley. The river is about 85 km long and flows across the Appalachian highlands and foothills in southern Quebec. This study focuses on six alluvial reaches along the river, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 km in length. The channel gradient ranges from 0.0036 to 0.0001. The decline in gradient is associated with rapid downstream fining from small cobble and gravel-bed in the 'upvalley reaches' to a sand-bedded channel in the 'downvalley' reaches. The discharge remains fairly constant over the river length, averaging about 140 m$ sp3$/sec. Channel depth, particularly the thalweg depth, increases appreciably in the downstream direction. The channel width decreases appreciably in the downstream direction. The channel capacity varies significantly without a clear pattern in the steeper cobble-gravel bed reaches and generally declines in the more hydraulically efficient, gentler and more hydraulically efficient fine gravel-sand bed downstream reaches. This study finds that floodplain characteristics vary with specific stream power and within-channel processes, but not in the same manner as suggested in the Nanson and Croke (1992) model.
