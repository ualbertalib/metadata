They then rated how much they would care, feel and think about the unequal outcomes, that were of equal value to both genders.

People who are self-determined are autonomous, self-realizing, psychologically empowered and self-regulated (Appendix A). Self-determination involves making choices and decisions with minimal influence from others. Choice making is a component element of autonomous functioning and was the focus for this research project. This study looked at the choices students make pertaining to physical activities. Students in regular and special education schools were compared to determine the extent of self-determination involved with their choices. Twenty students participated from a regular school and 18 from a school for students with intellectual disabilities (ages 7 to 19 years). In the first part of the study, students were asked to identify which activity they preferred, from various pairs of physical activities presented via pictures. This was performed three times. From student responses, activities were ranked from most to least preferred for each child. The second part of the study consisted of a semi-structured interview that focused on the four categories of self-determination. Student responses were compared with Wehmeyer's model on self-determination (1998) to assess their level of self-determination. Findings suggest that the students with intellectual disabilities were not as consistent in their choices of physical activities compared to their peers without disabilities. As well, the degree of self-determination, according to Wehmeyer's model differed for the two groups.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f7872.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h493</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Autonomy (Psychology)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Children with mental disabilities -- Education (Elementary)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Decision making in children.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physical education and training -- Study and teaching (Elementary)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6395w933x"><dcterms:title>Reviving the spirit in the practice of pedagogy : a scientific perspective on interconnectivity as foundation for spirituality in education</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Culture and Values in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Golf, Jeffrey.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a response to the fragmentation prevalent in the practice of contemporary Western pedagogy. The mechanistic paradigm set in place by the advance of classical science has contributed to an ideology that places the human being in a world that is objective, antiseptic, atomistic and disjointed. As a result, education has largely become a practice in which the learner is encouraged to identify with, and "successfully" live according to, a world that is competitive, materialistic, lonely and devoid of any spiritual dimension. This paradigm is presently being challenged by recent developments in the sciences, from physics to biology. The vision emerging recognises the universe as holistic and fundamentally interconnected. Moreover the idea of interconnectivity is seen as the key to a richer understanding of both matter and consciousness. Seeking out expressions of such interconnectivity in education offers a space in which learners can identify the self with an extended context of life. With the knowledge that one's individuality exists by virtue of its relationship to a larger community, the learner may begin to experience the self and the world in a way that is more whole and more meaningful. The philosophy of science discussed in this thesis offers a language where the spirituality of education may be reclaimed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Morris, Ronald (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719p146.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w933x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religious education.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education -- Philosophy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Spirituality.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aq237ht672"><dcterms:title>Learning through experience : the United Nations Secretaries-General and the evolution of peacekeeping</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Halton, Daniel A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The ability of organizations to learn---the process by which individuals learn from direct experience and translate that learning into organizational doctrine and memory---largely determines the course and outcomes of organizational policymaking.

A conceptual model linking processes of organizational learning, individual personality characteristics, and the nature of the international system is developed and operationalized.

The emerging technology of digital imaging is challenging this unique position. This paper proposes to examine the status of the photographic image in the digital age, as well as the debate surrounding the new technology and its implications. Chapter one begins with a brief technical history of the medium and establishes the construction behind the myth of photographic truth. Chapter two debunks the myth of photographic image's objectivity. Chapter three describes the specifities of digital imaging technology and discusses the potential problems and consequences of the invasion of digitally enhanced images in the media, as well as possible solutions. Finally, the fourth chapter considers the use of digital imaging in women's magazines and examines what such a use says about our society's values. By considering the issue of photo-manipulation, one can understand that manipulation expresses the human will to create a world of simulation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838240q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j304g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Women in mass media.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Images, Photographic.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Image processing -- Digital techniques.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Photography -- Social aspects.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8k71nk05g"><dcterms:title>Understanding the patterns of language use of Chinese children in a Montreal community school</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Curdt-Christiansen, Xiao Lan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study investigates the patterns of language use among a selected group of Chinese students in a Chinese Heritage Language school in urban Montreal, Quebec. Observation and interview are used as tools for the inquiry. Language socialization and social identity theories provide a framework for the data interpretation. Classroom interactions are examined in terms of the patterns of language use between teachers and students, students to teachers, and students to students. The emergent findings in the study suggest that teachers use mainly Chinese when addressing students and students use mainly Chinese when addressing their teachers. However, the patterns change when students are addressing each other. French and English are preferred in their peer to peer social interactions. As 'Chinese language' is a broad term, covering several different regionalects and dialects, it is taken into consideration that the students' home language may be very different from the standard language, Mandarin, which is taught at the school. In addition, the age of arrival to Canada, the desire for peer recognition and identification with the mainstream culture, and the forces of socialization as factors which affect the children's language use and their maintenance of their mother tongue are examined. Finally, the concept of speech community, a sociolinguistic concept, is applied to the discussion of how the patterns of those Chinese children's language use are shaped and may be interpreted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Maguire, Mary (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w669z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nk05g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chinese students -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social interaction.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Chinese language -- Social aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3An583xw88d"><dcterms:title>Reservoir inflow forecasting using time series and neural network models</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Burton, Holly.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In practice, the reservoir net inflow is computed based upon the application of the water balance equation to the reservoir system since it is difficult to obtain direct and reliable measurements of this variable. The net inflow process has been thus found to possess a random behaviour because it is related to the stochastic nature of various physical processes involved in the water balance computation (e.g., precipitation, evaporation, etc.). Therefore, the aim of this research is to propose a forecasting method that can accurately and efficiently predict the random reservoir inflow series. The proposed forecasting methods considered were the linear regression, the exponential smoothing technique, the periodic autoregressive moving average (PARMA) method, and the neural network procedure. An illustrative application was carried out using 25 years (1970--1994) of monthly rainfall and inflow data from the Pedu-Muda reservoirs in Kedah, Malaysia. The first 18 years (1970--1987) were used for calibration while the remaining 7 years (1988--1994) were used for verification of the proposed models.

We will demonstrate that, in favoring a vision of society made of individual components, Quebec's class action fails in its attempt to reflect the collective dimension of conflicts. Hence, it does not allow unorganized social groups to influence social relationships in a significant manner. However we will argue Quebec's class action, in changing the focus from the individual to the member of the group contributes to a certain visibility of social conflicts.

The ultramafic units intrude both Raglan horizon siltstone as well as volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Povungnituk Group. Magnesium, silica and chromium variation along with analyses of fresh olivine grains from the East Lake Zone indicate the ultramafic rocks were formed by olivine and chromite accumulation in a magma containing 11--13 wt % MgO. Rare Earth Element profiles of intrusive margins and some Chukotat Group pyroxene-phyric basalts show Light Rare Earth Element enrichment consistent with contamination by Raglan siltstone, however the enrichment occurs stratigraphically below the siltstone, reducing the likelihood of contamination having occurred locally. Sulphur concentrations and olivine nickel contents indicate that minor amounts of sulphide liquid (&lt;0.5%) were present during emplacement. Previous studies have proposed a model for Raglan ultramafic unit contamination and sulphide saturation by thermal erosion of sulphidic sediments by flowing lava. The current study excludes thermal erosion by flowing lava as a mode of contamination and sulphide production as the East Lake Zone units are intrusive, and already have been contaminated and carry a sulphide phase.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Francis, Don M.

This thesis proposes the use of a VCSEL-based parallel optical interconnect system to achieve the high-speed, multi-channel, chassis-to-chassis interconnection requirements. With 1 x 12 VCSEL and PIN arrays operating at 2.5 Gb/s per channel, a large aggregate bandwidth of 30 Gb/s can be interconnected in a very small footprint. In order to validate the selection and verify that these components would be suitable for the scalable routing system, a detailed test plan was created based on pre-determined key performance parameters such as bit error ratio and jitter. This test plan was carried out and results were obtained, confirming both the estimated optical link budget and electrical jitter budget. Full electrical and optical system testing was also performed verifying that the designed system was fully functional, thereby endorsing the use of the parallel optical interconnect components within current and future versions of the scalable routing system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Plant, David V.

An Internet Protocol (IP)-based conference bridge is subject to speech distortions and substantial computational demands due to the tandem arrangement of high compression speech codecs. Decentralized architectures avoid the speech distortions and delay, but lack strong control and have a key dependence on silence suppression for endpoint scalability. One solution is to use centralized speaker selection and forwarding, and decentralized decoding and mixing. This approach eliminates the problem of tandem encodings and maintains tight control, thereby improving the speech quality and scalability of the conference. This thesis considers design options and solutions for this model, and evaluates performance through live conferences with real conferees. Conferees found the speaker selection of the new conference model to be transparent, and strongly preferred the resulting speech quality to that of a centralized IP-based conference bridge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Blostein, M.

When a primary insurance company becomes insolvent, there may be insufficient funds in the estate to pay claims in full and it may take several years to distribute such funds. For this reason, some insureds and third-party claimants seek to collect reinsurance proceeds directly from reinsurers (direct actions). However, The indemnity nature of the reinsurance agreement prohibits direct actions against reinsurers for reinsurance proceeds by insureds and other claimants. Under a marine reinsurance contract, the reinsurer does not assume the liability of the reinsured insurance company. In other words, the original insured cannot enforce his insurer's contract of reinsurance and is not a third-party beneficiary to that contract. Therefore, no privity exists between the reinsurer and the insured or persons claiming through him under the contract of reinsurance. Absent an intent to benefit directly or create rights in insureds or other third parties, reinsurance proceeds are payable only to the reinsured insurance company or its domiciliary liquidator where the insurer becomes insolvent. The insolvency of the reinsured does not affect this fundamental premise. Yet, in the face of this well-established principle of law, the original insured and other claimants still seek to recover themselves by making direct claims on the insolvent's reinsurers. The persistence in pursuing the variety of theories upon which the claimants have proceeded suggests a continuing unwillingness to accept the balancing of interests stay in liquidation statutes and the need for reinsurers to clearly settle their rights and obligations in reinsurance contracts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Tetley, William (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n520r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx38d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Reinsurance -- Law and legislation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insurance, Marine</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2j62s6696"><dcterms:title>Information warfare, cyber-terrorism and community values</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Moore, Joe Wesley</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Information Warfare involves the attack and defense of information and information systems, both in time of armed conflict and in operations short of war.

The purpose of this dissertation is to determine under which conditions non-therapeutic sterilization can lawfully be performed under Canadian law. Whereas the legality of non-therapeutic sterilization when voluntarily consented to by a competent individual is today established in all Canadian provinces, it appears that Quebec is the only province to allow non-therapeutic sterilization to be performed on an individual lacking through age and/or disability the necessary capacity to consent, common law provinces denying any beneficial aspects to the procedure. The law on involuntary non-therapeutic sterilization however lacks clarity, certainty and consistency, a legislative reform is therefore advocated.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z73b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cj50z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sterilization, Eugenic -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterilization, Eugenic -- Law and legislation -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterilization (Birth control) -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sterilization (Birth control) -- Law and legislation -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajd472z34q"><dcterms:title>Extending the principle of the common heritage of mankind to outer space</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dietrich, George B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of the thesis is to explore to what extent, if any, has the principle of the common heritage of mankind been implemented in the practice of states and in what areas.

Like the high density sludge (HDS) process, heavy metals are removed by precipitation in the presence of other solids. The effects of cycling, neutralization rate, temperature, and solution composition were investigated. Sludge density, percent solids, sludge viscosity, and settling velocity of the solids generated were used to characterize the system. Experiments were performed on iron (III) and zinc solutions. For the iron system, it was shown that the solids generated were in the form of aggregates rather than discrete particles. Both cycling and lower neutralization rates tended to improve the solids settling velocity. This was attributed to aggregate restructuring under turbulent mixing conditions, and to the local supersaturation conditions created under different neutralization rates. A critical addition rate of 7.5 mL/min was identified, below which little benefit was realized. A modified form of the Richardson-Zaki correlation was developed. With this function, it was shown that the settling velocity of the solids could be described using volume fraction as the single independent variable. This was unexpected, and identifies particle interactions as the dominant factor in determining the settling characteristics of the solids. The zinc system exhibited improvements in the settling velocity with mixing time, while none were realized with the iron solids. The main effect of higher temperatures was to decrease the viscosity of the suspending fluid, giving increases in the solids settling velocity. However, this effect did not fully explain the increase that was found with the zinc solids at higher temperatures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brown, W.

As such devices are used in many different configurations, manufacturers need to ensure that each potential configuration will not fail due to device defects. This flexibility leads to severely increased test times, which in turn increase the semiconductor device's total cost. This thesis presents a method to speed up test and diagnosis times using reconfigurability. Furthermore, a scheme for the incorporation of the test architecture, which reduces test and diagnostic times of reconfigurable logic interconnects, is described. The test architecture includes added Feedback Shift Register (FSR) components that change the circuit configuration during testing but are completely transparent during the eventual customer's usage. Equally, algorithms are presented to produce test and-diagnosis configuration sets with a minimized number of configurations, along with the creation of an FSR that produces the test and diagnosis sets by dynamic reconfiguration of the device.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zilic, Zeljko (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892c75n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd92h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Awp988n025"><dcterms:title>Switchgrass combustion studies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martin, Kendrick</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis presents fundamental research about the combustion gas products and solid phase residue of switch grass combustion. To identify the compounds released during the combustion phase, tests were conducted using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) coupled to a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. These test revealed that aromatic compounds as well as carbon dioxide and water were released. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and GCMS/GCFID were also used to identify and semi-quantify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and benzene derivatives. From these analyses it was concluded that thermal synthesis was not occurring within an oxidative environment and as such no PAHs were found. Finally an infrared microscope and a scanning electron microscope were used to study functional group, morphology and metal content change resulting from the combustion process. This research provided information about the combustion mechanism of switch grass and laid the foundation for pilot-scale testing.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g930b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988n025</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526f208"><dcterms:title>Towards pronking with a hexapod robot</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Engineering</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McMordie, Dave, 1975-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>RHex is a robotic hexapod with springy legs and just six actuated degrees of freedom.

Five female expert Canadian university coaches of team sports were individually interviewed with an open-ended approach. Data were analysed inductively, following the guidelines of Cote, Salmela, Baria, and Russell (1993) and of Cote, Salmela, and Russell (1995). The results of the analysis identified four key elements for the building of a successful program. First, coaches possessed a variety of personal attributes that enabled them to display appropriate leadership. Second, coaches possessed thorough organisational skills from which they set goals, planned the season, and prepared their team for games. Third, coaches had a personal desire to foster their players' individual growth, by empowering them and teaching them life skills. Finally, the aforementioned elements were interrelated and linked together by the coaches' vision, without which success was unlikely. Data also showed the correspondence of these four elements with a transformational leadership style that has been successfully used in business, military, industry, and educational settings.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bloom, Gordon (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397b14n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv89z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Sports teams -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Women coaches (Athletics) -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coaching (Athletics) -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Leadership -- Canada</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans0647715"><dcterms:title>Teaching arithmetic to students with learning disabilities : a unique approach</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Simon, Rebecca A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study was designed to see if children with learning disabilities could be taught three-row, double-digit addition problems using a dot-notation method. Three children with learning disabilities were selected for the study. Prior to the intervention, these students used a combination of count-all and count-on strategies when solving addition problems and used concrete referents such as fingers or tallies. A multiple-probe design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention with the 3 subjects. The experiment consisted of a teaching phase where students were taught to touch and count the dots on numbers 1 to 9 in a specified pattern and an intervention phase where students progressed through nine levels of addition problems. The final stage consisted of three-row, double-digit addition problems requiring regrouping with touch points removed. Results indicate that the 3 subjects were able to learn and apply the dot-notation method successfully and were able to retain the method from one and a half to four and a half months after completing instruction. Suggestions for future research and for teachers are discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hanrahan, Jim (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gj36w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0647715</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Arithmetic -- Remedial teaching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arithmetic -- Study and teaching</dc:subject><dc:subject>Learning disabled children</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A5999n5229"><dcterms:title>Myth, the body and wholeness : towards a more holistic conception of education</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Teoli, Roberto.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The literature in education is conspicuously lacking in any meaningful or sustained discussion of the body's role in education. This thesis suggests that body and mind do not mutually exclude one another but rather, they are the two aspects that, together, form the whole person. Paradox is a key concept here because it offers a vision of reality that brings together "apparent opposites" into a tensed relationship thereby creating a framework that allows for the integration of body and mind into a cohesive whole. This thesis argues that myth is an expression of humankind's paradoxical nature, and that the hero myth, in particular, points to a path that leads to the embodiment of paradox, and thus to wholeness. This, however, requires a journey into the depths of the body in order to get in touch with the body and the entire range of its feelings. It is further argued that this process reconnects us to our body. To embody paradox, therefore, signifies the integration of body and mind into a unified whole.

I examine how changes in the technological, legal and commercial environment of disc jockeys in the 1990s are articulated in the styles and methods of deejaying. I argue that the conspicuous and covert styles of sampling articulate different forms of authorship, economic interests, and notions of originality. While the covert style has been crucial to the emergence of the DJ-as-author and deejaying as a legitimate art, the conspicuous style of copying on the edges of DJ culture troubles the tenuous links between the new DJ-stars and their works.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamilton, Sheryl (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns88x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0324868</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Disc jockeys</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
