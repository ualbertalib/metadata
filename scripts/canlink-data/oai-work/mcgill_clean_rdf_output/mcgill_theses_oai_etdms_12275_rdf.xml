These have emphasized the importance of the liver (104), the capillary “pool” (12,105), and bacterial toxins probably originating from bacteria in the portal system, and prior to this the bacterial flora of the intestines (33,37). There are, however, very few studies on the possible role or roles played by the lungs during the shock process to be found in the literature. A few authors have written on the pathological picture (69,77) which may or may not be present; others have studied the circulation of the blood (27,60) and lymph following hemormage and tourniquet shock; and still others have studied the oxygen content of the mixed venous and the arterial blood during various forms of shock (94). Careful study of these and other articles, however, does not leave the reader completely satisfied as to the actual role of the lungs. Do they have a primary function in the response of the body to the decreased circulating blood volume that may eventuate in irreversible shock? Or are they merely passive reactors in the chain of events? Undpubtedly, in tbose cases where the congestive and other changes have became advanced, the normal respiratory functions must be unfavourably effected; but is there a basic pulmonary effect that is being obscured?[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Webster, D.

Since then, a great deal has been learned about the effects ot adrenalectomy, and replacement therapy, on electrolyte metabolism. A number of adrenal cortical compounds have been isolated, and their biological activity in adrenalectomized animals, and in patients with Addison’s disease, has been ascertained. No attempt will be made, in this section, to cover all of the findings reported on the subject of the adrenal cortex and electrolytes, as several excellent reviews have appeared in recent years (3,4,5). However, some findings, pertinent to the present study, are presented below. In 1932, Loeb (6) found that there was a fall in plasma sodium in Addisonian crisis, and that the administration of sodium chloride would render the patient symptom-free (7). The fall in plasma sodium following adrenalectomy in the dog was related to the abnormally large quantity of sodium in the urine (8). This urinary loss of sodium was attributed, by Harrison and Darrow (9), to a disturbance in the tubular reabsorption of this ion from the glomerular filtrate. Anderson and co-warkers noted that adrenalectomized rats, unsupported by salt treatment, had increased total sodium excretion, and an increased rate of excretion of administered sodium-24, as compared with normal animals (10,11,12). They found the reverse to be true for potassium.[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s810x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j4245</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biochemistry.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1831cp109"><dcterms:title>Geology of the Round Pont map area, Newfoundland.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1952</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Slipp, Robert Munro.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is a description of the geology of 150 square miles of map area in south central Newfoundland. The area was mapped by the author and assistants during the summer of 1951. Previous to the writers work very little geological investigation had been carried out in this part of Newfoundland. The mapping shows the following: a belt of steeply tilted sedimentary rocks with a northeast trend occupies most of the area. Lesser amounts of gneiss and igneous types are present. The sedimentary rooks have undergone some metamorphism. Location and means of access. The map area, to be referred to as the Bound Pond Map Sheet, lies in the southern watershed of Newfoundland within the drainage basin of the Bay East (Salmon) River. Round Pond is approximately 30 miles north of Baie d’ Espoir and 60 miles south southeast from the town of Buchans. Approximate limits of the Round Pond Sheet are Latitude N 48° 10’ to N 48° 18’ and Longitude W 55° 57’ toW 56° 12’. The area is most easily reached by means of float equipped aircraft. Access is also possible by a moderately difficult canoe route from the south coast. This route starts at the head of Baie d’Espoir and leads north through a series of streams and lakes.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Riddell, J.

It attempts to derive limited knowledge and tentative conclusions pertaining to the way in which these children have evolved a concept of themselves as adopted children and the general success of the adoption. A research interview elicited the parents’ appraisal of the extent and manner in which own origins had been shared with the children and, also, the parents’ estimate of how the adoption had turned out. Origin of the Study: The need for a study on adoptions grew out of the questions of a private child caring agency. This agency, The Protestant Foster Home Centre, is a member agency of the Protestant federation of community agencies. The investigation of applicants requesting children for adoption and the placement of children for adoption is one of the services of the agency. The agency recognizes the need for a continuous evaluation of its service to the community. Wetha Kelly expresses something of the thinking of the agency: “It has been said that too little is known about adoption. There is a dearth of information about the outcome of adoptive placement which ultimately and definitely terminates in the legal creation of parent to child. For the child and his new parents, this termination is only the beginning. What happens to the relationships beyond this termination and this beginning is not known generally.

Carlyle’s comprehensive method of writing - selecting a portion of a philosophical or practical system here which suits his purpose, rejecting a component of another system there - would seem to defy complete analysis and explanation under any single heading. To those seeking an understanding of Carlyle’s personal religion and philosophy, Sartor Resartus forms the central document. To other men who could not fathom this transcendantal, mystical thinking Carlyle left his practical gospel of “Work” and “Duty” for their edification. The men who were to lead their fellows in society to the best possible way of life were the “Heroes”, the intuitive seers of Carlyle’s ideal government. But behind and beyond all these conceptions the question remains - what was the fundamental core of Carlyle’s philosophical system, which he applied in a most practical way to everyday social life? What sanctions - divine, intuitive or logical - did he have for taking his most pronounced, absolutist view of life and government? How did this belief begin, and can its development and consistent application be traced in Carlyle’s writings? The object of this study will be to establish that Carlyle’s ultimate authority in all his pronouncements is what is usually referred to in his writings as the “Laws of Nature”.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Phelps, A.

Acrid and aromatic substances were used as a means of driving away the evil spirits. It is quite likely, however, that primitive man in many instances was successful in combating the spread of infectious diseases, since some of the substances he selected were good disinfectants. It seems strange, however, that present day practices of disinfection appear to have been founded upon early religious rites of purification, rather than on the age-old knowledge, that meats and ether putrescible materials are protected from spoilage by certain substances. Our present practices may be described as a summation of the following:- 1. A curious mixture of early religious rites. 2. Knowledge derived from centuries of empirical observations. 3. Information obtained from the critical testing of various substances which possess disinfectant properties. An example of this may be seen in that ancient Persian laws directed that drinking water be kept in bright copper vessels. Whether or not observation had shown that there was less disease when drinking water was kept in this way, or whether the law has some entirely different basis is not known.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gray, P.

Initially, the species of insects in the community are governed by the character of the slash, that is, the tree species, thickness of bark, and size of tops. The condition of the slaah changes with the passage of time, the rate of change being directly affected by bark beetles and wood borers which initiate the ingress of wood-destroying fungi. As the environment changes, those species, for which the habitat is no longer suitable, drop out, leaving in the association of animals only those which can exist under the new conditions. The succession of communities of animals inhabiting slash, logs, dying and dead trees has been shown by Adams (1915) and Savely (1939) to continue until the wood has disintegrated completely. The community of insects and other arthropods invading red and white pine logging slash during the first summer following winter logging has been examined during this study. One object of the study was to determine the importance of the development of broods of various species of bark beetles in the subsequent establishment of other arthropods in the community. Wherever possible, from original observations or from works of other authors, the role of each species in the particular environment has been indicatad.

The theory of the subharmonic functions which was developed mainly by F. Riesz (in 1926) and Paul Montel (in 1928) appeared principally, as we will see, as a generalization of the convex functions of one variable to functions of two variables obeying the same fundamental properties [cf. F. Riesz (10) * and P. Montel (8)]*. Two other names must be mentioned in the connection of this theory, those of J.E. Littlewood and T.

Part of this research involved a consideration of American influences on Canadian education. From this arose the idea of a more extended study of such influences. The present thesis is the result. It was soon determined that no comprehensive or thorough study of this topic was extant. Despite quite heavy labours, the writer is ruefully forced to concede that the situation has not changed.

The existence of free radicals was first demonstrated by Gomberg in 1900 (2) in his classioal identification of the triphenylmethyl radical in solutions of hexaphenyl ethane. It remained for H. S. Taylor, 25 years later, to suggest that simple radioals, such as C2 H5, might function as chain carriers in chemical reactions (3). He reacted ethylene with hydrogen atoms and round more ethane produced than would be expected from the number of hydrogen atoms available. He postulated the chain mechanism. H + C2H4 → C2H5; H2 + C2H5 → C2H6 + H. The possible validity of the suggestion received support from the well-known demonstration by Paneth and Hofeditz (4) that such simple radicals., in particular the methyl radical, had an appreciable lifetime. They showed that methyl radicals, produced by the thermal decomposition of lead tetramethyl, could be detected with metallic mirrors placed in the path of a stream of methyl radicals in a carrier gas. This was followed by a program of research by F. O. Rice and collaborators (5) which showed that the thermal decomposition of many organic vapours yielded free radicals as intermediate products.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Winkler, C.

These are the bundle plugging theory and the toxin theory. According to the former the movement of water through the water conducting vessels of the stem is hindered or even prevented by the clogging of the vessels with the pathogenic bacteria or fungi and other obstruction materials such as tyloses and gums formed under the stimulation of the pathogen. The proponents of the toxin theory claim that the wilting symptoms are due to toxins formed by the invading organisms or resulting from the interaction between host and parasite. Each of these theories is supported and weakened by experimental evidences. One approach to the solution of this problem is to study the effects of the disease upon certain aspects of the physiology of the host, such as transpiration, stomatal movement and photosynthesis. Many investigators working on diseases caused by wilt organisms have measured the transpiration course of the wilting plant. The methods used for these measurements vary a great deal and are very often specially adapted to the type of plant under observation, although the weighing method seems to have been most generally adopted. Weights are recorded daily or at different intervals during the day. To obtain more accurate frequent measurements of the water uptake is not necessary.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Scarth, G.

The obvious questions that present themselves are; does anemia truly represent a reduction of the red cell mass or is it merely apparent because of an increased plasma volume; is the polycythemia due to an increased red cell mass or a reduction of the plasma volume? Indeed, the early workers suggested that chlorosis was an apparent anemia only, with a normal red cell mass, and that pernicious anemia was a true anemia. The importance of a three dimensional view of the state of the blood can be readily appreciated. The variety of methods for the determination of the blood volume that have been utilized by various individuals merely attest to the fact that an ideal method remains to be discovered. The variety of modifications of a single method, and there is hardly an investigator whose method has not been slightly altered from that of the next, is evidence of the hope that these changes will add to the accuracy of the method. By this time, a fairly good understanding of the factors affecting the blood volume determination has been established. By the application of these factors, a reasonably accurate determination of the plasma volume and the red cell mass may be made independently. The determination of the plasma volume, however, does not give a sufficiently accurate estimate of the cell volume, and vice versa.[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Browne, J.

Blackhead is acknowledged to be economically the most important disease of turkeys, having forced the abandonment of turkey rearing in many parts. Fortunately, in other susceptible species of birds, the disease seldom causes serious losses. In the caeca of the chicken, and perhaps,too, in the caeca of other susceptible birds, the blackhead organism, Histomonas meleagrldis, lives and multiplies without producing clinical disease except on rare occasions. Another inhabitant of the caeca is the worm, Heterakis gallinae, which picks up Histomonas, serving as vector host of blackhead by virtue of the fact that Histomonas becomes incorporated in its eggs. It is not known how Histomonas gets into the caecal worm egg or what form the egg-borne stage of the parasite takes. There is overwhelming evidence to show that it is there, however, because when the eggs of the worms from birds carrying blackhead are embryonated and fed to susceptible turkeys, the latter develop clinical blackhead. The work leading to the discovery of the above facts, and of others relating to the subject are considered in the historical review. H. gallinae does not always carry the organism that initiates blackhead.[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s5760.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s0756</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Parasitology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahm50tv79r"><dcterms:title>The anaerobic bacterial flora of the upper respiratory tract in children.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1949</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Bacteriology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Collins, Anne M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During two years spent as a technician in the Department of Bacteriology of the Children’s Memorial Hospital, it was noted how frequently cultures from children with upper respiratory tract infections yielded none of the common pathogens by routine laboratory aerobic culture methods. The etiologic agents of cases such as these might well be viral or aerobic bacteria not ordinarily recognized as pathogenic, or anaerobic bacterial species. The anaerobic bacterial flora of the upper respiratory tract has been but little studied, possibly due to the time consuming and cumbersome methods of obtaining anaerobiosis; possibly because relatively little is known about anaerobic bacterial species, and their classification is still in a state of confusion. It was thought, therefore, that a survey of the anaerobic flora would prove of interest, and perhaps yield further results showing some correlation between certain anaerobic species and disease, the flora of the respiratory tract at different ages, and cast a little more light upon the taxonomy of anaerobic bacteria.

They are found universally in horses and other equines, where they may cause serious diseases. The most important genera, from the standpoint of their prevalence in horses, are Strongylus, Triodontophorus, and Trichonema, the latter being generally known as the Cylicostomes. Other genera of the Family Strongylidae which comprise part of the Sclerostome grouping are Craterostomum, Oesophagodontus, and Gyalocephalus. There are approximately fifty different species of Sclerostomes known to be found in horses and other equines, but up to the present time it has been impossible to distinguish between them from the examination of the eggs alone, Theiler (1923), Taylor (1933), Cornils (1935), Kopirin (1941), and Hummelinck (1946a). Some degree of differentiation has been accomplished by means of the freeliving larvae, Albrecht (1933), Lucker (1936) and (1938), and Hummelinck (1947). The general description that Taylor (1933) gave for the life cycle of Strongylus edentatus may be applied to all of the Sclerostomes and their related groups. “The life cycle in general outline is the same for all species but is identical for none”, Cameron and Parnell (1939).

It seemed appropriate at that time to undertake some evaluation of the new scheme in medical social statistics which had been inaugurated at that hospital in January of that year. In the course of enquiring into the background of this new plan, the writer found it both necessary and intensely interesting to examine the reports of the department’s work from its beginning in 1905. Special attention was given to the forms of medical social statistical reporting which were developed throughout the years and it soon became evident that running through each of these was the thread of an evolving purpose. That is, that as the function of medical social workers became more clearly defined, the method of statistical reporting changed in accordance with it . With this theory in mind, the writer determined to test it on a broader scale. On returning to Canada in 1946, further consideration of this problem convinced the writer that there was sufficient evidence in the material already assembled to warrant further exploration and development of the emerging theme.[...]</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623g81f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687m47r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Social Work.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ahd76s351z"><dcterms:title>The influence of gonadal hormones on the composition of the blood and liver of the domestic fowl.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1949</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chapman, Douglas Gordon.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>During recent years a large body of information has accumulated regarding the nucleic acids, not only from a standpoint of their structure and properties but also in relation to their functions in the cell. It is a well-established fact that those organs which are most actively engaged in protein synthesis tend also to contain relatively greater amounts of nucleic acids. A considerable amount of information is available concerning the nucleic acid content of the liver of rats of various ages and under various conditions. However, there is comparatively little information regarding the nucleic acid content of the liver of fowl. As the female bird approaches the laying period and the endogenous gonadal hormones come into play, one might reasonably expect to find a change in the protein synthesizing activity of the liver. During the course of the present study, therefore, an attempt was made to follow the normal changes in the proportions of nucleic acids in the liver of the fowl, including both males and females, from hatching until the beginning of full reproductive activity at twenty-five weeks of age. At the same time, a group of sexually immature pullets was treated with gonadal hormones in order to investigate as fully as practicable the possible effects of estrogens and androgens upon the amounts and proportions of liver nucleic acids in the fowl. It was hoped in this way to have observations on the normal bird which would be helpful in interpreting observations[...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Common, R.

The literature which may be called characteristic of this period began with the novels which writers like Stephen Crane and Theodore Dreiser were publishing around 1900. These men initiated a new period in American writing, which developed in power and maturity especially during the twenties and thirties. For the first fifteen years of the century, however, neither academic criticism nor journalistic opinion were prepared to favor the new growth. Taking American universities as a measure of the prevailing attitude toward writers who were interested in becoming part of the new movement, Bernard De Voto pointed out that even as late as 1920 few universities provided any encouragement for the man (at the time he would hardly be called a scholar) who was interested primarily in literature written in the United States. Universities on the whole provided favorable climates only to that scholarship and criticism which was devoted to English literature of a respectable age, and looked upon American literature as “at best only a pleasant brook flowing toward the stream of English literature and acquiring merit only as it drew near.” Similarly the critical journals were not much interested in the American literary output. Even important periodicals like The Nation and The Bookman followed trends [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Files, H.

Wint., the apple scab fungus, grows during the summer on the living leaf, producing a mycelium which develops only between the cuticle and the epidermis. But when the infected leaf dies naturally, this mycelium then grows as a saprophyte and sends its hyphae all through the tissues of the dead leaf. It is during this saprophytic part of its life cycle that the fungus passes through its sexual stage. Ascogonial hyphae arise in the mesophyll of the dead leaves and, after fertilization by antheridia from oppositely sexed thalli, initiate the perithecia. These fruiting structures then are the result of the fertilization of an ascogonium from a mycelium of one sex by an antheridium from a colony of opposite sex. The perithecia do not enlarge greatly and show little internal differentiation during the winter. As soon as snow has melted, however, the asci in the perithecia become differentiated, the perithecia enlarge rapidly and by the time the apple trees start to grow, the twocelled ascospores are formed and, if the weather is suitable, are discharged into the air, from the dead leaves on the ground. These ascospores cause primary scab infections in the orchard. The dead leaves in which apple scab is living and fruiting, are certain to harbour other saprophytic organisms. It has been a common observation that dead leaves support growth of many saprophytes.

A very good agreement was found between experimental and predicted values. In the construction of the meter two voltages 90° out of phase are required.
