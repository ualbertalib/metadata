We hypothesized that this neonatal deficiency might be due to an insufficient brain adenosine production and/or a decreased sensitivity of the cerebral vessels to adenosine, a crucial metabolic regulator of adult cerebral blood flow. This hypothesis was tested on newborn (1-3 day old) and older pigs as the experimental model. Our findings are as follows: (1) Adenosine induced a concentration-dependent vasodilation of the newborn cerebral vessels, especially in the brain stem and periventricular area. (2) The cerebrospinal fluid concentration of adenosine and adenosine metabolites increased during both hypoxic-hypoxia and systemic hypotension. During hypoxia, these levels were inversely correlated to the arterial oxygen content and positively correlated to the increase in cerebral blood flow. (3) Adenosine receptor antagonism by 8-phenyltheophylline completely blocked the cerebral hyperemia during moderate hypoxia, partially reversed it during severe hypoxia, and abolished autoregulation (i.e. the maintenance of a constant cerebral blood flow over a wide range of systemic blood pressure). Moreover, adenosine receptor blockade altered the regional redistribution of cerebral blood flow during severe hypoxia and hypotension. (4) Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of adenosine during normoxia and hypoxia were lower in the newborn than in the older animals. (5) Relative to adult internal carotid arteries (important cerebral resistance vessels), newborn vessels were less sensitive to adenosine. These data demonstrate that adenosine is a potent dilator of the cerebral vessels and an important mediator of the regional cerebral adaptive response to brain oxygen deficit in the newborn. Brain interstitial concentrations of adenosine and the cerebral vessel sensitivity to adenosine are lower in the newborn than in the older individual. These findings may explain the relative deficiency in the adaptation of the newborn cerebral vasculature during brain oxygen deficit, leading to an unusual vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xf92p.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p531w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A4t64gn99z"><dcterms:title>Intercropping corn and soybean for high-protein silage in a cool temperate region</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martin, Ralph C.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The overall hypothesis of this research was that silage biomass and protein yields would be higher in corn-soybean intercrops than in monocrops on the same land area.

Indeed, the cellular heterogeneity of a tumor may be viewed as a caricature of normal tissue that defines the tissue of tumor origin and prognosis. The heterogeneity of a simple tissue, bladder epithelium, has been studied with quantitative flow cytometry to measure light scattering properties and lectin binding to cells in normal and malignant tissue. It was confirmed that such quantitative assessments could be used to reveal relationships of normal tissue heterogeneity to malignant tissue heterogeneity which were relevant to both normal tissue development and tumor status. In addition, an indicator of DNA replication/cell proliferation (a monoclonal antibody for DNA cruciforms) was studied for future use in normal and tumor tissues to reveal various aspects of that functional heterogeneity. Fundamental methods for quantitative assessment and qualitative distribution of the initiation sites of DNA replication were established and applied to normal and malignant cell lines.

Several different mutations which were predicted to affect the structure of the amino terminus of middle T antigen rendered the DNA incapable of transforming Rat-1 cells as measured by the focus assay. The middle T antigens encoded by these non-transforming mutants were efficiently synthesized but failed to associated with protein kinase activity. By contrast, mutants that were not predicted to affect the structure of the amino terminus of middle T antigen transformed Rat-1 cells efficiently, and their encoded middle T antigens were associated with a kinase activity comparable to that of wt middle T antigen. The data suggest that the amino-terminal 100 amino acid residues of middle T antigen constitute part of a domain that is required for activation of the pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ kinase activity and for cellular transformation. To determine the consequences of simultaneous overexpression of both middle T antigen and pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ in the same cells, two recombinant adenoviruses which individually encode middle T antigen and pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ were used to co-infect 293 cells. Evidence suggests that the capacity of middle T antigen to activate the intrinsic kinase activity of pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ is reduced when pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ is overexpressed. To study the role of small T antigen in cellular transformation by polyomavirus, Rat-1 derived cell lines were established by co-transfection of a cDNA encoding only small T antigen together with a gene encoding resistance to G418. A number of these cell lines exhibited growth in agarose in the presence of a high serum concentration, but failed to induce tumours in isogenic rats. Unlike middle T antigen, small T antigen failed to detectably associate with pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ when both proteins were overproduced in 293 cells, suggesting that the mechanisms of action of small T antigen and middle T antigen are different.

(1986) was adapted and utilized with 16 families having infants (birth to three years) with moderate or severe developmental disabilities. The intervention included the selection and development of appropriate instruments as well as a 20-week treatment program for the entire family unit. Individualized family service plans were developed and incorporated the collaborative efforts of parents and the interventionist. Multiple baselines across targeted, individualized, familial behaviors resulted in progressive skill attainment by each family member. As a result of intervention, predominantly positive interactions were exhibited between infants with handicaps and their family members. Data obtained from the family assessment tools revealed statistically significant relationships among the family variables. Qualitative analyses of parental and sibling statements and behaviors confirmed enhancement of their skill repertoire and the identification of specific events that impacted upon families. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the family-focused intervention model resulted in high levels of parental satisfaction, accelerated rates of progress by children with moderate or severe developmental disabilities, and acquisition of functional skills by families. Positive benefits of the model exceeded family gains acquired with previously implemented child-focused programs.

An abnormal ABR predicted neurologic sequelae at 1 year; however there were false negatives. In this study, somatosensory evoked responses (SER) were performed together with the ABR so that a wider distribution of the nervous system could be evaluated. Testing was carried out on healthy and high risk neonates in the newborn period and in infancy. Infants were subsequently evaluated in a blind fashion at 1 year of age by a pediatric neurologist and psychologist. As part of this study, normative data and reliable testing procedures needed to be established. The effect of gestational age on evoked responses performed in the newborn period was also determined. The results demonstrated that the ABR and SER can be reliably recorded in newborns. Latency and morphological changes on serial testing reflected maturation of the nervous system. Chi square analysis revealed that an abnormal SER or ABR predicted neuromotor impairment at 1 year of age. The type of SER abnormality further delineated the degree of disability. A normal SER and ABR predicted normal neurodevelopmental outcome. In conclusion, multi-modality evoked response testing yielded valuable prognostic information for the newborn at high risk for neurologic sequelae.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh46t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p787k</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Psychology, Developmental.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Human Development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2b88qc890"><dcterms:title>Residual erectile capacity of paraplegic rats</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Courtois, Frédérique J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This series of studies was designed to investigate the residual erectile capacity of paraplegic rats. Results from human studies suggest that erectile capacity in paraplegic men may be maintained following psychogenic, but not reflexogenic, stimulation. Using an animal model to overcome methodological difficulties associated with human studies, reflexogenic stimulation was defined as local stimulation of the genitals, and psychogenic stimulation as stimulation of a key central structure. Results from higher CNS stimulation showed that electrical stimulation of the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus reliably triggers penile responses in rats and elicits penile responses as a post-stimulation effect. Optimal stimulation parameters were identified and used to maximize the effect on spinal animals. The effect of central stimulation was then compared to that of local stimulation to examine whether truly sexual responses were elicited. Results demonstrated that central stimulation elicits primarily erectile responses with a few urine-marking responses. The two stimulation sources were then used to test the residual erectile capacity of paraplegic rats whose lesions interrupted the L6-S1 fibers. Results showed that a high proportion of animals (85%) indeed maintain erectile responses to central stimulation but lose reflex activity from the genital area. These results support the hypothesis under study and are discussed in terms of the neural substrates of erection and their implication at the human level.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064671z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc890</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rats -- Physiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Paraplegia -- Research.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sexual excitement</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8g84mm93f"><dcterms:title>Population ecology of the fish Poecilia gillii in an intermittent tropical stream : the effects of seasonal flooding</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chapman, Lauren J.

I focused on the seasonal ecology of Poecilia gillii from pools in a steep gradient, intermittent stream in Costa Rica. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were affected by season, by between-pool differences, and by the interaction between seasonal and spatial influences. Seasonal flooding resulted in a catastrophic loss of fish from most pools. Population loss was influenced by the susceptibility of the pools to flooding and population density, with mortality occurring primarily in nearby desiccating "graveyard" pools. Pools increased in population size and density over the 5-month post-flood study period, and their densities converged to their pre-flood values. Variability in the rate of increase among pools was related to water quality and population density. Striking changes in the size and abundance of males over the season suggest social influences on maturation in Poecilia gillii.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vc06m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm93f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Poeciliidae -- Costa Rica -- Parque Nacional Santa Rosa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Fish populations -- Costa Rica -- Parque Nacional Santa Rosa.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poecilia.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A41687j17m"><dcterms:title>Ottawa ways : the state, bureaucracy and broadcasting, 1955- 1968</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bartley, Allan, 1950-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The dissertation develops a theory-based, state-centered revisionist explanation of the development of Canadian broadcasting policy during the years 1955 to 1968.

The concept of decision points is used to explore the origins of the 1958 Broadcasting Act and the 1968 Broadcasting Act. The evidence suggests the content of these measures was largely determined by bureaucratic actors. Two aspects of the 1968 legislation (the power to approve broadcasting licenses and extension of broadcasting regulatory jurisdiction to cable television) are examined in detail.

Inca myths and rituals both expressed and enacted this corporeal and cosmic order. With the arrival of the Spanish, the Incas were confronted with a radically different image of the body and the cosmos. The clash between the Spanish and Inca orders was experienced by the Incas as a disordering of the human and cosmic bodies. While the Spanish Conquest destroyed the Inca empire and imposed a new culture on its former inhabitants, however, many of the principles which ordered and interrelated the body and the cosmos in Inca cosmology have survived in the Andes to the present day.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x31m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365579j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Incas -- Religion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Body, Human (Philosophy)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6d56zx29r"><dcterms:title>Weyl orbits and branching rules for affine Kac-Moody algebras</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Physics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bégin, François</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The method of Weyl orbit reduction for obtaining branching rules is extended to affine Kac-Moody algebras.

The numerous experiments were conducted under various conditions to characterized the interactions in terms of the experimental results, e.g. axle displacement, contact area, contact pressure, etc. The results of pressure distribution indicate that recognizing a tire as a pneumatic body is crucial in establishing a rational theory for tire-supporting ground interaction problems. The pressure distribution and contact area obtained in the experiments are also utilized in validating an analytical approach (i.e. First Analytical Approach) established in the dissertation. A hypothetical description of the progress of tire deformation is discussed based on the experimental results. The discussion helps in providing a better understanding of the mechanics of the interaction, and for selecting basic analytical and/or numerical tools in establishing the present analytical methods. In the analytical work, the two distinct analytical approaches (i.e. First and Second Analytical Approaches) are established under the plane strain condition in predicting contact length and pressure. However, the first analytical approach is emphasized in this dissertation, while the second one is rather a complementary work. In the first analytical approach, the real contact profile is taken into account, while the existing contact theories (by Hertz, Muskhelishvili, etc.) essentially ignore the real kinematics of contact surfaces on which the pattern of pressure distribution greatly depends. In this first analytical approach, the following steps are taken: (1) transform a tire-supporting ground interaction problem into an equivalent free boundary (-value) problem of the deformed supporting ground; this is done so that the complex factors inherent to pneumatic tires are not directly taken into the analytical formulation; (2) determine the modulus of elasticity of the deformed supporting ground by taking into account the contact profile; (3) find the contact length and pressure by means of the complex variable method. The contact length and pressure analytically obtained are in close agreement with those obtained through experimentation. An attempt has also been made to solve the sliding interaction problems. The second analytical approach, which is an iterative technique combining the incremental finite element method and the complex variable method, is established fundamentally to solve an interaction problem between an elastic solid and a nonlinear elastic half-plane. Two different types of interaction problems are solved, i.e. tire-clay and rigid wheel-snowpack interactions. Numerical results on contact length for both problems showed acceptable agreement with the experimental results, while those on sinkage obtained for the rigid wheel did not.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j980.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021g01b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Applied Mechanics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anv9353715"><dcterms:title>Search for the marker of physiological state in Clostridium acetobutylicum</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1990</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Srivastava, Ashok K.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The potential of selected culture parameters for characterization, quantification and elucidation of the culture physiological state in batch, fed batch and continuous cultivations of C. acetobutylicum was examined in this investigation.

Correlations of key process parameters confirmed the importance of NADH as a regulatory substance in the cell metabolism. A solventogenic culture accumulates more NADH than that in the acidogenic phase. It features an inverse relationship between the specific butanol accumulation rate $(q sb{B})$ and the specific fluorescence (F/X). Fluorescence was also demonstrated to be a suitable control parameter for the regulation of the medium feed rate resulting in constant butanol levels in the fed batch culture. An improved unstructured mathematical model of the culture system represented the batch acidogenic and continuous culture solventogenic metabolism.

Subjects were given false feedback on a test of maturity and told that they were at level 4 out of 8 while their friend was at level 6. The first study indicated that social comparisons between highly similar, close friends resulted in less satisfaction, but in a more positive self-evaluation and no change in liking for the partner. A strong correlation was also found to exist between similarity and quality of friendship. It was hypothesised that this may account for the differences in comparisons between friends and strangers. The second study looked at high and low quality of friendship in addition to similarity and allowed subjects to interact with their partners. It was found that High-quality friends evaluated themselves more positively after the comparison and experienced an increase in satisfaction and liking for their partner who was found to be very supportive.

Immunosuppression with cyclosporine (radioimmunoassay levels in serum ranging from 1000 to 1200 ng/ml, 12 h after intramuscular injection), supplemented with low doses of methylprednisolone (4.4 mg/day) was sufficient to achieve long-term survival of seven neurovascular free flaps and two hand transplants. Electrophysiological recordings of more than 600 single axons, combined with light microscopy of the target tissues, revealed that muscle and most classes of skin sensory mechanoreceptors within the allografted tissues became reinnervated. Axons which served allografted tissues that had undergone repeated episodes of rejection showed a significant decrease in conduction velocity, and smaller receptive fields of irregular distribution. Processes of allograft rejection, more than any other factor, led to altered axonal response characteristics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m487b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w553v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anp193975t"><dcterms:title>Effects of exogenous recombinant bovine somatotropin on reproduction and nutritional status of dairy cattle</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Animal Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gallo, Guillermo Federico</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Long-term administration of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) significantly increased milk and 3.5% fat-corrected milk production without altering milk composition. These effects occurred regardless of breed, parity or drug delivery system (daily or sustained-release) utilized. Somatotropin did not affect apparent digestibility of rations, dry matter intake, crude protein intake, energy intake or energy balance. Body energy reserves, measured as body condition scores, decreased during rbST treatment resulting, together with the increase in milk yield, in an improvement of the efficiency of conversion of feed to milk for cows treated with rbST. Body condition was completely regained during the dry period. No effects of rbST on mastitis or metabolic diseases were observed. During lactation, injection of rbST produced elevated circulating concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, insulin, bST and IGF-I but lipid composition of liver and ketogenic functions were not altered. These lipolytic and diabetogenic activities might contribute to the galactopoietic response elicited by rbST. Somatotropin did not modify the nutritional status of cows during pregnancy or the nutritional status and growth rate of their calves from birth to weaning. With regard to reproduction, somatotropin augmented ovarian progesterone production during the first two estrous cycles post-injection and during gestation. These effects may have been mediated through increased ovarian IGF-I synthesis. Somatotropin enhanced the GnRH-induced LH response at 14 d postpartum. In spite of these positive observations, somatotropin treatment tended to produce longer calving to conception intervals. Nevertheless, the higher persistency of milk production by cows treated with rbST may compensate for this difference economically.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903070c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193975t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Dairy cattle.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bovine somatotropin.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719n12f"><dcterms:title>Fractal stochastic modelling of airborne magnetic data</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gregotski, Mark Edward</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Airborne magnetic field data exhibit downward continued power spectra of the form $1/f sp beta$ (where f is the spatial frequency and $ beta$ is a non-negative real number). This form of spectrum is observed for magnetic data recorded over a range of sampling scales from various areas of the Canadian Shield. Two scaling regimes have been discovered. The first has a $ beta$ value near 3 for wavelengths $ sbsp{ sim}{$25 km. These results suggest a "variable fractal" description of the distribution of near-surface magnetic sources. From a data modelling viewpoint, the magnetic measurements are derived from a linear superposition of a deterministic system function and a stochastic excitation process. A symmetric operator corresponds to the system function, and the near-surface magnetic source distribution represents the excitation process. The deconvolution procedure assumes an autoregressive (AR) system function and proceeds iteratively using bi-directional AR (BDAR) filtering in one dimension, which is extended to four-pass AR filtering in two dimensions. The traditional assumption of a spectrally white innovation is used in the deconvolution procedure. The data are modified prior to deconvolution by a Fourier domain prewhitening technique, to account for the long wavelength content of the fractal innovation. Deconvolution of the modified data produces the system function, which is removed from the original data to produce the near-surface magnetic source distribution. This distribution serves as a susceptibility map which can be used for enhancing magnetic field anomalies and geological mapping. Thus, the statistical descriptions of near-surface magnetic sources are useful for modelling airborne magnetic data in "shield-type" geologic environments.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv151.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n12f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Geophysics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A474299915"><dcterms:title>Outcome of pregnancy in epileptic women : a prospective evaluation of genetic and environmental risk factors</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Dansky, Linda Vivian</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A prospective study of 116 pregnancies in epileptic women was carried out in order to assess the distribution of newborn growth parameters, and the risk of abnormal outcomes (spontaneous abortions, perinatal deaths, developmental anomalies, deformations or hernias).

Major congenital anomalies were increased and head circumference was decreased relative to the general population. Maternal plasma phenytoin or phenobarbital levels were positively associated with developmental anomalies and total abnormal outcomes. An increase in maternal seizures and/or anticonvulsant drugs, as well as detoxification defects of phenytoin arene oxide metabolites were correlated with decreased head circumference, while family history of seizures was associated with reduced birth weight and/or length.

At low k values, Percus-Yevick and other theoretical model structure factors are in poor agreement with the data. Within experimental error, the temperature dependence of the structure factors is in agreement with the Debye plane wave phonon model of atomic vibrations.

The stress/strain curves determined at high strain rates were corrected for adiabatic heating and constitutive equations were formulated. When dynamic recovery is the only softening mechanism, these involve a rate equation, consisting of a hyperbolic sine law, and an evolution equation with one internal variable. When dynamic recrystallization takes place, the incorporation of the dynamically recrystallized fraction in the above evolution equation makes it possible to predict the flow stress after the peak. The kinetics of static recrystallization were characterized in terms of the mean flow stresses, which lead to more accurate results than alternative methods. Appropriate expressions were formulated for the recrystallization kinetics and the mean austenite grain size as a function of predeformation, temperature and particularly strain rate. Particular attention was paid to prediction of the temperature distribution through the thickness of the rolled plate or strip. The effects taken into account are radiation and convection from the surface when the material is between stands, and conduction to the rolls and the temperature increase due to mechanical work when the material is in the roll gap. An explicit finite difference method was used to calculate the temperature distribution through the thickness of the workpiece during processing. On the basis of the temperature model and the constitutive and recrystallization kinetics equations, a computer model for the prediction of multi-stage rolling force and microstructural evolution was developed. The predictions of these models are in good agreement with measurements on both experimental and commercial steels. Also, by appropriate control of the thermomechanical parameters, high strength steels with transition temperatures below $-$100$ sp circ$C were developed. These results constitute a step towards the on-line control of plate and hot strip mills, and the development of new tough high strength steels.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4626188.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb56z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acz30pt43t"><dcterms:title>Phosphorylation and purification of integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteings</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1989</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Anatomy</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Rindress, Donna E.

Another SRM protein of 15 kDa (pp15) was phosphorylated in vitro only by ($ tau$-32P) GTP. Comparison of the in vitro phosphorylation profile of SRM to those of other well defined subcellular fractions, i.e., plasma membranes, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria and smooth microsomes, showed the four major GTP phosphorylated proteins were restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further characterization of these proteins showed them to be phosphorylated on serine residues at the cis face of SRM and to be integral membrane proteins. The 35 kDa protein was glycosylated, with 2 N-linked oligosaccharide sidechains, therefore possessing a luminal domain. Competition and inhibition studies showed that GTP and ATP phosphorylation of the proteins were distinct. Regulation of GTP specific phosphorylation was by adenosine nucleoside. Purification of the 35 and 90 kDa phosphoproteins was achieved, along with another nonphosphorylated glycoprotein of 25 kDa, as a phosphoglycoprotein complex which elutes from Sephacryl S300 chromatography at an apparent molecular weight of about 400,000. Partial Sequence Receptor (Weidmann et al, (1987) Nature 328: 830-833), suggesting that this phosphoglycoprotein complex may form part of the translocation apparatus of the rough ER.

Macrophages produce but they do not secrete urokinase-PA, suggesting a minor role in influencing milk plasmin. Somatotropin administration resulted in a suppression of milk plasmin in vivo. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the most likely mediator of the effects of somatotropin on the bovine mammary gland, inhibited the induction of tissue-PA (t-PA) production which is observed when mammary epithelial cells are cultured in the absence of IGF-1.

The results show that heterogeneity in acquired resistance is the most consistent factor contributing to the variability and aggregation of H. polygyrus. When groups of mice did not acquire resistance, either in certain inbred strains or when mice were immunosuppressed, variability after the challenge was comparable with that after a primary infection.
