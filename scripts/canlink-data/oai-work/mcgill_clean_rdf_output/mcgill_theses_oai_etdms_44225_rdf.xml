Variety of models are used to  forecast inflation, including diffusion indices, artificial neural networks, and  traditional linear regressions. Financial market volatility is forecast using  various GARCH-type and high-frequency based models. High-frequency data are also  used to obtain ex-post estimates of volatility, which is then used to evaluate  forecasts. All forecast are evaluated using recently proposed techniques that can  account for data snooping bias, nested, and nonlinear models.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g562c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w522v</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stock price forecasting</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inflation (Finance) -- Mathematical models</dc:subject><dc:subject>Forecasting</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2n49t244n"><dcterms:title>Variability of genomic imprinting in human disease</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2004</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>McCann, Jennifer</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Genomic imprinting is the differential expression of genetic  material depending on the parent from which it is transmitted. It is involved in the  pathogenesis of many diseases, especially those involved in development, growth  abnormalities and cancer. We examined the extent of and the variability of genomic  imprinting amongst individuals in three human diseases, Wilms' tumour, Type 1  diabetes and Silver-Russell syndrome. Wilms' tumour (WT) is a renal embryonal cancer associated with  overexpression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). IGF2 is directed to the  lysosomes for degradation by the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor two  receptor (M6P/IGF2R) encoded by the IGF2R gene, a known tumour suppressor gene on  6826. IGF2R is imprinted in the mouse, with exclusive maternal expression. In  humans, however, IGF2R imprinting is a polymorphic phenomenon only being found in a  small subset of people. We present results suggesting that IGF2R imprinting provides  the first "hit" in IGF2R inactivation in WT, and show the presence of a  second "hit" in the form of deletions detectable as loss of  heterozygosity. Another disease investigated in this report is Type 1 diabetes  (TID), an autoimmune, polygenic disease. Of the several T1D loci, IDDM8 on 6q, has  been found to be subject to parent-of-origin effects and encompasses IGF2R.  M6P/IGF2R is involved in immune system regulation. In this study we show an  association between TID and IGF2R that is confined to maternally inherited alleles.  Our results strongly suggest that IGF2R is a TID susceptibility gene and may be  universally imprinted at some tissue or developmental stage not yet  studied. A third disease displaying both tissue-specific and  isoform-specific imprinting is Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), a growth disorder  associated with double dose of a maternally expressed gene within 7p11.2--p13, a  region in which the imprinted GRB10 gene was a prime candidate. We studied the  complex tissue and isoform-dependence of GRB10 imprinting and demonstrated absence  of imprinting in growth plate cartilage, the tissue most directly involved in linear  growth thus eliminating GRB10 as the gene responsible for SRS. It is evident that genomic imprinting plays a prominent role in  various diseases. Imprinted genes can be expressed in a tissue-specific,  isoform-specific or a temporally regulated manner. In addition, there is a wide  variability of imprinting between individuals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Polychronakos, Constantin (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt265.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t244n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ajs956g32z"><dcterms:title>Derivatives of monoglycerides and ligation of CD45 as programmed cell death inducers in mammalian cells</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Philippoussis, Fabianne</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a naturally occurring  process essential for development and tissue homeostasis, that needs to be tightly  regulated since too much or too little cell death may lead to several human  pathologies such as cancer. Therefore, it is critical to identify new effective  apoptotic stimuli in order to help in the design of specific therapies. This thesis  identifies two novel death-inducing agents, namely monoglycerides and CD45  cross-linking, the latter triggering an alternative death pathway. Derivatives of monoglycerides, which are a family of naturally  occurring lipids consisting of a single fatty acid moiety attached to a glycerol  backbone, were found to trigger rapid dose-dependent apoptosis in mammalian cells.  The potency of monoglycerides to induce cell death varied depending upon both the  structure of the compound and the cell type used. Specifically, monoglycerides are  inducers of apoptosis in murine lymphocytes, and in several murine and human  hematopoietic malignant cell lines. Importantly, monoglycerides readily killed  blood-borne leukemic cells obtained from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia  patients, while sparing resting or activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from  healthy individuals. Thus, these compounds represent potential anti-leukemic drugs  or could allow for the design of novel therapeutic agents applied to  leukemia. In addition, this thesis demonstrates that ligation of CD45, a  transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on all nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin,  triggers an alternative form of programmed cell death in leukocytes. This pathway,  as opposed to conventional apoptosis, does not require caspases, and does not induce  chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation in dying cells. The sensitivity to  CD45-mediated death in developing T and B cells was also characterized in this  work. Overall, the identification of monoglycerides as a new family of  pro-apoptotic compounds and the characterization of a new cell death pathway induced  by CD45 cross-linking may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches with  significant benefits in the treatment of diseases.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hugo, Patrice (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558d78c.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g32z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agm80hv82s"><dcterms:title>Origins of pseudomonas cepacia lipase enantioselectivity towards chiral primary alcohols</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mezzetti, Alessandra</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PCL) is a highly enantioselective  catalyst in the hydrolysis or formation of esters. It shows high enantioselectivity  towards esters of chiral primary alcohols. Several scientists have tried to explain  this enantioselectivity via modelling studies, however their results are in  disagreement. To explain PCL enantioselectivity towards chiral primary  alcohols, we coupled structural studies and modelling of PCL-transition state  analogue complexes containing pure enantiomers of chiral primary alcohols as alcohol  moieties. We first elucidate the different enantiospecificity of the  enzyme for primary and secondary alcohols showing that primary alcohols do not bind  to PCL like secondary alcohols. We then show that PCL enantioselectivity towards  3-methyl-2-phenyl-1-propanol, a chiral primary alcohol without oxygen at the  stereocentre, rests on the better hydrogen bond of the fast enantiomer with  catalytic histidine and that there are only subtle binding differences between the  two alcohol enantiomers within the catalytic pocket of PCL. Next, we show that PCL enantioselectivity towards chiral primary  alcohols having oxygen at the stereocentre depends mainly on the interaction of the  oxygen at the stereocentre with PCL residues Leu17 and Thr18, which may favour or  disfavour one enantiomer depending on its structural features. This explains why a  simple empirical rule cannot be reliably applied to this class of  substrates. We then exploit PCL interfacial activation and the use of a  solvent that stabilises the active open form of the enzyme to increase its  enantioselectivity towards esters of 2-methyl-3-phenyl-l-propanol and  2-phenoxy-l-propanol from 16 to ≥190 and from 17 to 70. Last, we try to increase the enantioselectivity of Bacillus  thermocatenulatus lipase (BTL2) towards solketal-n-octanoate and some other chiral  primary alcohols by structure-guided saturation mutagenesis. However most of the  mutants were inactive and we did not find a more enantioselective BTL2  mutant. Overall, we have shown that lipase enantioselectivity towards  chiral primary alcohols is always based on subtle enzyme-substrate interactions,  hence the difficulty to increase lipases enantioselectivity towards these substrates  by substrate and protein engineering.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kazlauskas, Romas J.

Further challenge studies with similarly packaged  crumpets inoculated with C. botulinum (~102 spores/g), pre- or post-baking,  demonstrated that all crumpets were toxic within 4 to 6 days at 25°C and  that toxigenesis preceded spoilage. Furthermore, reformulating crumpets to pH 8.3  and packaging in 100% CO2 had little effect in delaying the growth of C. botulinum  compared to crumpets formulated to pH 6.5 and packaged in 60% CO2. Subsequent studies were directed at determining the levels of  additional barriers that could be used to ensure the safety of high-moisture MAP  crumpets. While ethanol vapour proved to be an effective additional barrier in  crumpets (100-g, [aw 0.990, pH 6.5]) challenged with ~102 spores/g of C.  botulinum, spoilage preceded toxigenesis due to absorption of ethanol from the  package headspace by crumpets.

However, while ethanol vapour could  be used to inhibit the growth of C. botulinum in high-moisture crumpets, its  anti-botulinal efficacy was influenced by the method of crumpet leavening (yeast v  chemical). Preliminary studies were also done to assess the potential of  mastic oil, a novel inhibitor, against C. botulinum.

The majority of these subunits are  encoded by nuclear genes, and 13 of them, by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). OXPHOS  deficiencies resulting in mitochondrial disorders can be caused by either nuclear or  mitochondrial mutations; however, most pathogenic mutations reported in adults occur  in mtDNA. Such mutations often impair mitochondrial translation and are associated  with a characteristic muscle pathology consisting of a mosaic pattern of normal  fibers interspersed with fibers displaying mitochondrial proliferation and decreased  OXPHOS activity. In this thesis, the molecular basis for a severe mitochondrial  myopathy in two adult patients was investigated. All patient muscle fibers showed  mitochondrial proliferation and barely detectable Complex IV activity (a measure of  OXPHOS activity), a pattern never before reported.

They are required to eliminate unwanted or damaged cells and therefore are  able to prevent disease. Several reports have shown increased caspase-3 expression  in different cell types undergoing apoptosis. We undertook to examine the role of T  cell activation through the T cell receptor (TCR) in regulating caspase-3 gene  expression. The KOX-14 murine T cell hybridoma was initially used as a model for  activation-induced cell death. Caspase-3 mRNA levels increased by 3-fold following T  cell activation and was independent of STAT1 activation and therefore of IFN-gamma  signaling in KOX-14 cells suggesting that the increase occurs early during T cell  activation. Naive T cells were then isolated from the lymph nodes of mice to  determine the extent of the increase in caspase-3 mRNA levels in cells undergoing  proliferation rather than apoptosis. Caspase-3 mRNA levels were selectively induced  (13-fold) following TCR triggering. Furthermore, caspase-3 mRNA levels were the  highest in effector T cells which are destined to undergo AICD, when compared to  long-lived memory T cells. Interestingly, the levels of procaspase-3 were also  induced (6-fold) in activated peripheral T cells. In addition, T cells deficient for  caspase-3 were more resistant to different apoptosis inducing molecules when  compared to T cells containing normal levels of caspase-3. Altogether, these results  demonstrate that the levels of caspase-3 must be maintained in a cell to ensure  efficient apoptosis. The caspase-3 promoter region was subsequently cloned to  identify transcription factors responsible for the observed increased in caspase-3  mRNA levels during T cell activation. Several regions within the promoter had either  positive or negative regulatory effects on reporter activity when deleted.

We first consider the "program over monoid" model of  D. Barrington and D. Therien [BT88] and set out to answer two fundamental questions:  which monoids are rich enough to recognize arbitrary languages via programs of  arbitrary length, and which monoids are so weak that any program over them has an  equivalent of polynomial length? We find evidence that the two notions are dual and  in particular prove that every monoid in DS has exactly one of these two properties.  We also prove that for certain "weak" varieties of monoids, programs can  only recognize those languages with a "neutral letter" that can be  recognized via morphisms over that variety. We then build an algebraic approach to communication complexity,  a field which has been of great importance in the study of small complexity classes.  We prove that every monoid has communication complexity O(1), Θ(log n) or  Θ(n) in this model. We obtain similar classifications for the communication  complexity of finite monoids in the probabilistic, simultaneous, probabilistic  simultaneous and MOD p-counting variants of this two-party model and thus  characterize the communication complexity (in a worst-case partition sense) of every  regular language in these five models. Furthermore, we study the same questions in  the Chandra-Furst-Lipton multiparty extension of the classical communication model  and describe the variety of monoids which have bounded 3-party communication  complexity and bounded k-party communication complexity for some k. We also show how  these bounds can be used to establish computational limitations of programs over  certain classes of monoids. Finally, we consider the computational complexity of testing if  an equation or a system of equations over some fixed finite monoid (or semigroup)  has a solution.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Therien, Denis (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh252.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602115z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Asn009z27v"><dcterms:title>Receiver, transmitter, and ASIC design for optoelectronic-VLSI applications</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2003</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Venditti, Michael B.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In modern digital systems, off-chip and intra-chip electrical  interconnections suffer from a multitude of limitations as integrated circuits (ICs)  continue to grow in size and processing capacity. Optical interconnects are capable  of meeting the increasing I/O bandwidth needs in these systems. Optoelectronic-VLSI  (OE-VLSI) technology incorporates optical I/O with ICs through the integration of  arrays of optoelectronic devices with on-chip receiver and transmitter circuits.  These optical I/Os are intended to replace or complement electrical interconnects  for off-chip connections, and for connections between processing modules on the same  chip or in a multi-chip module. The design of receivers, transmitters, and OE-VLSI  application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are described from a system  implementation perspective. Numerous techniques to overcome technological problems  and allow the successful operation of large receiver and transmitter arrays are  considered.

More specifically, this thesis was  immediately addressing the question of whether autonomic fibers sprout de novo into  the upper dermis of the rat lower lip following bilateral chronic constriction  injury (CCI) of the mental nerve, a purely sensory branch of the trigeminal. In  addition to the main objective, we sought to determine whether and to what extent  the peptidergic and non-peptidergic populations of primary afferent sensory fibres  were affected following CCI. Due to the results we obtained, we also tested for any  up regulation of the high-affinity NGF receptor trkA on primary afferent fibres  following CCI as a possible trigger for the sprouting of both sympathetic and  peptidergic fibres. Most importantly, we wanted to determine if there was a  behavioural correlate to the different patterns of innervation observed by both  autonomic and primary afferent fibers following CCI. Our findings indicate that 4 weeks following CCI injury of the  mental nerve there is an abundant sprouting of both sympathetic and parasympathetic  fibres into the upper dermis, a region of skin from which they are normally absent.  In addition, we have demonstrated that peptidergic population of nociceptive fibres  display a robust sprouting into the upper dermis which is maximal at the same time  point as autonomic fibre migration. Interestingly however, we also demonstrate that  in the epidermis, both populations of sensory fibers experience a significant  decrease in density at 2 weeks post-CCI, followed by fibre re-growth at levels above  those seen in sham-operated animals at 4 weeks post-CCI; however, this increase was  only statistically significant for the nonpeptidergic population. Furthermore, the  high-affinity NGF receptor, trkA, is up-regulated on CGRP-IR fibres with a peak at 4  weeks post CCI. Finally, we observed behavioural evidence for spontaneous pain or  dysesthesiae at the time point when there is sprouting of both autonomic and sensory  fibres.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr843.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225b580</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Agx41mj522"><dcterms:title>Growth and nutrition of trembling aspen in harvested black spruce forests in northwestern Québec</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Toribio Fajardo, Monica</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) were observed  growing along roads far north from the area where it dominates, in sites dominated  by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)

The  relationship of aspen growth with Ca availability and mineral soil access is the  main focus of the study. Soil and foliar samples from aspen seedlings were collected  from roadside, slash and cutover locations during the summer of 2003. Trees were  also measured for height and basal diameter. Microsites where aspen was growing and  where it was absent were compared to determine whether aspen was associated with  specific microsites soil properties. The results suggest that there are differences  in the growing conditions for aspen between different locations but that the trees  are growing successfully in all of the three location types. In the cutovers, aspen  seedlings were consistently found in association with patches of Polytrichum moss.  All the sets of data indicate that Ca availability and access to mineral soil are  not the main factors influencing the distribution of aspen but that soil pH, or a  factor relating to pH, may be important.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gw725.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj522</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Black spruce -- Québec (Province) -- Abitibi-Témiscamingue.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Populus tremuloides -- Québec (Province) -- Abitibi-Témiscamingue -- Nutrition.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acj82k7794"><dcterms:title>Modulation of executive function in children with Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder by allelic variants of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene and three varying doses of methylphenidate</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Psychiatry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Taerk, Evan</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>An association has been observed between the  catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, the predominant means of catecholamine  catabolism within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and neuropsychological task  performance in healthy and schizophrenic adults.

Chemical inhibition of  JNK (SP600125) and p38 (PD169316) sensitize tumor cells to Fas mediated apoptosis. I  studied Fas mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells and in some experiments HeLa cells.

I show that p38alpha is essential for Fas mediated  caspase-8 activation: it promotes the dephosphorylation and exclusion of c-FLIPS but  not c-FLIPL from the death inducing signal complex (DISC). Distally both p38  isoforms positively influenced the intrinsic pathway by common and selective effects  on pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.

Despite increased metabolic demands, infantry  soldiers are known to not eat enough during military manoeuvres. We undertook this  study to examine food provided and consumed by male soldiers in the Canadian Forces  in operational environments to examine and potentially improve their  nutrition. Methods. Subjects recorded their food intakes using dietary  questionnaires during two exercises. The adequacy of dietary intake and the nutrient  value of foods offered were assessed against Dietary Reference Intakes  (DRI). Results. Soldiers did not consume enough energy, carbohydrate,  fibre, folate, vitamin C, potassium and calcium compared to operational  requirements. The combat rations provided less than the recommended DRI for some  nutrients. Food sources of nutrients were examined. Discussion. We recommend increasing the quantity of easy-to-eat  nutrient-dense foods while decreasing sodium content. To optimize nutrition and  combat readiness, new products rich in carbohydrate, potassium, folate and calcium  need to be added.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z66s.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d022r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- Armed Forces -- Infantry -- Nutrition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada.

This study will examine  BMI as a risk factor for caesarean section in women in a developing  country. This study included a cohort of 290,124 births in Uruguay, from  the years 1992 to 2001, and a cohort from Pelotas, Brazil with 8,475 births, from  1982 and 1993. Three statistical methods were used to deal with missing data in the  logistic regression analysis: casewise deletion, use of a missing data indicator,  and multiple imputation. BMI showed a strong relationship to caesarean section, with  increasing risk of caesarean with increasing BMI, except in women with previous  caesarean section in Pelotas. Other important risk factors included level of  education, diabetes, hypertensive diseases and primiparity. Risks differed by labour  type and history of caesarean section.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh65k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf260</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ag732d9527"><dcterms:title>Identification of a novel bacteriocin, thuricin 17, produced by Bacillus thuringiensis NEB17</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gray, Elizabeth Jean</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Bacillus thuringiensis NEB17 is a plant growth promoting  rhizobacterium that produces a compound that directly increases plant growth.

In particular, we consider the two NP-hard problems of finding a maximum  packing and a minimum covering. In 1994 Brass [53] conjectured that tau, the minimum  size of an odd cycle cover, is at most twice nu, the maximum size of a packing. The  conjecture is known to be false in general [11, 41]. We prove here that tau &lt;  10nu for planar graphs. Our structural results leads to the first constant  approximation algorithm for the packing problem. The covering problem was shown to  be tractable for graphs of constant sized solutions [42]. We give a linear time  algorithm for the covering problem restricted to the case where the graphs have  constant sized solutions and are planar.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g34h.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd506</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Mathematics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab5644s09s"><dcterms:title>Unwilling foes : Russia's and China's reaction to the challenge of the American ballistic missile defence programme</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Political Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Beaupré, Maxime</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The official reaction of the Russian Federation and of the  People's Republic of China to the announcement made by the United States in December  2001 to abrogate the almost thirty years old Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty has  been remarkably weak, given their sustained and coordinated opposition to the  deployment of strategic defences against ballistic missiles (BMD). Because the  existing literature, particularly balance of power theory, under-explored this  puzzle and fails to provide a satisfactory explanation to it, a neoclassical realist  model building on structural and unit-level variables is proposed to supplement this  caveat. It is argued that Russia, as a stagnant great power experiencing trouble at  the domestic level, bandwagons with the United States because it discounts the  medium- and long-term threat posed by BMD. China, a rising developmental state, is  soft balancing because it resents the project and the threat it poses to its  security.

Their structural  efficiency depends to a great extent on the lightweight core separating the face  sheets and providing overall high stiffness. Detailed finite element modeling of the  penetration of honeycombs by a projectile can be fairly complex, and computationally  expensive as shown in the first part of this study. A computationally efficient  axisymmetric equivalent numerical homogeneous model for Aluminum 5052-1119 1/8in -  0.001in hexagonal honeycomb subjected to high speed impacts in the range of 60 m/s  to 140 m/s is then developed. An equation-of-state model for porous media is used  for the equivalent honeycomb medium. A Taguchi optimization, based on four unknown  porous material parameters, is carried out. With the optimal set, the equivalent  model can accurately predict perforation velocities for different impact conditions.  The methodology for the optimization is explained and can be used for any velocity  range. The product of this work is a computationally efficient numerical model that  requires less than 8% of the time needed to numerically analyze honeycombs in  detail.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wq70m.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9674212</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq191"><dcterms:title>A study of culture teaching in English classes in Korea and rural elementary schools in the Republic of Korea /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2005</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Arts</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kim, EunYoung, 1979-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explores culture teaching in English classes in urban  and rural elementary schools in Korea from the perspectives of both teachers and  students.

In particular, the paper was influenced by Benedict Anderson's depiction  of the sovereign nation-state as a model available for 'pirating'. This analogy was  broadened and it is argued that piracy is a valuable way to illustrate the character  of national projects as well as the particularities of specific projects. The  pirating of nationalism emphasizes its malleability and dependence on those who have  the means and will to develop it. Although invention in social organization is not  particularly unusual, the unique and capacious force of nationalism to structure  identity and meaning in society has generated an ideology of political legitimacy  and sovereignty of global consequence.</dc:abstract><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h492f.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn44w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Nationalism</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
