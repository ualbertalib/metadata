Pavlov (1927) suggested that "the orienting reflex tunes the correspondins analyser to ensure optimal conditions for perception of the stimulus." More recently, Lacey (1959) has stated that an increase in skin conductance, a characteristic component of the orienting reaction, "facilitates transaction of the organism with the environment." As far as sensory and perceptual processes are concerned, there is considerable evidence for a facilitatory effect of the orienting reaction. For example, Martin and Edelberg (1963) found that tactile sensitivity is generally enhanced immediately following a galvanic skin response. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Bindra, D.

Chapter II develops a simplified theory of trade and development which emphasizes the role of the terms of trade as an adjustment and transmission mechanism for growth in the basic two-country world. Chapter III considers the pros and cons of the hypothesis that underdeveloped economies are experiencing and will continue to experience a secular deterioration in their terms of trade. The implications of this analysis are then set out. Chapter IV concludes the study with a more particularized approach to the problem through the consideration of the problem in relation to Thailand.

There are two basic approaches to the study of foreign policy. The first, the historical approach, is essentially descriptive and is primarily concerned with improving our factual knowledge of the behaviour of particular states. The second, the anayltical approach, focuses upon state behaviour in general and attempts to formulate valid generalizations about state behaviour. Its ultimate goal is the elaboration of a general theory of foreign policy. Each of these approaches is useful within its respective range. This thesis is concerned solely with an examination of the nature and utility of the analytical approach. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Noble, P.

At times, a discrepancy arises between this principle and what is therapeutically indicated for the client. Caseworkers are often faced with the conflict between creating an accepting and permissive atmosphere, and acting authoritatively in the best interests of the client. This presents a problem, but also a challenge. A clearer and fuller knowledge of some of the aspects of the use of authority in casework could well be of great assistance to the worker in the pursuit of a more competent practice.

The establishment of large centres of population followed as a logical result of industrialization, but the speed at which they have outgrown their boundaries to mature into colossal masses of people and buildings is something unique to modern time. In North America, the rapidity of urbanization has accentuated urban problems which can be remedied only with the help of proper town planning. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Spence-Sales, H.

In 1961, hay (grass and legumes) occupied 67% of the crop area and was worth $97,307,000. or 55·8% of the total value of field crops. Improved pastures, not included in the above figures, occupied over 2,000,000 acres (Anon, 1961). Since alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, red, alsike, and ladino clovers are dominant in this hay crop, their agricultural importance is apparent. This, together with the fact that alfalfa is a common rotation crop, led to the choice of this plant for study. [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Sackston, W.
