M.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The sorption of sodium, potassium and lithium hydroxides from aqueous solutions on Purves (periodate) spruce lignin has been investigated by measuring the sorption isotherms and heats of sorption at room temperature. At low concentrations, equivalent amounts of each alkali were sorbed (approximately 1.5 milliequivalents alkali per gram lignin). At higher concentrations different amounts were sorbed. The integral heats of sorption showed the same general trends. The results indicated that the process is chemisorption on acidic hydrogen groups in the lignin. The mechanism of the sorption process is discussed.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mason, S.

Since the latter reaction may involve the formation of N-halogen compounds as intermediates, it seemed desirable to prepare several of the unknown N-halogen derivatives or the cyclic imides.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Taurins, A.

The Congress had proposed Lord Mountbatten's name as joint Governor-General of both Dominions. Many people thought that the Muslim League also had in mind a common Governor-General.

Dale (1914}, with the help of his colleague Ewins, identified it in some samples of ergot and studied its pharmacology extensively. In his classical report, he described its evanescent action and suggested that it is hydrolysed rapidly in the body. He also described that it has two kinds of actions: (1) muscarinic and (2) nicotinic. The muscarinic action, a depressor effect on the effector cell, is exerted at the postganglionic endings of the parasympathetic; and its nicotinic action, which consists of an initial stimulation followed by an inhibition is exerted on the ganglionic cells of both the divisions of the autonomic nervous system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>MacIntosh, F.
