In the epilogue to “A Vision” Yeats drops his mask, and reveals the uncertainty which had followed him, wraithlike, throughout his life. “Day after day I have sat in my chair turning a symbol over in my mind, exploring its details, defining and again defining its elements, testing my convictions and those of others by its unity, attempting to substitute particulars for an abstraction like that of Algebra. I have felt the convictions of a lifetime melt through at an age when the mind should be rigid, and others take their place, and these in turn give way to others…… Then I draw myself up into the symbol and it seems as if I should know all if I could but banish such memories and find everything in the symbol.” This statement, made at the end of Yeats’s life, shows the importance of the symbol to himself and to his work. Through the medium of symbolism Yeats produced some of the most beautiful lyric poetry of our age, and its excellence testifies to the intense personal interest he had in the symbol. It was a faith for him, to which he willingly dedicated his life and his work. Because of the personal importance of the symbol, he had to define his theories of symbolism precisely, and in essays and letters, he constantly clarified his theories [...]</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Duthie, G.
