Gas packaging using 60%CO2 (balance N2) inhibited the growth of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum from 3d (pita bread packaged in air) to 35d at ambient temperature. A longer extension in shelf-life (42d) was possible using an Ageless oxygen absorbent or a Freshmax oxygen absorbent label in conjunction with gas packaging. Similar results were obtained with 2G--4G sachets of Ethicap, and 100--200S sachets of Negamold, a dual functional oxygen absorbent-ethanol vapor generator. High pressures (30--400MPa) used to inhibit mold growth, resulted in delamination of the packaging film and textural changes to the pita bread. Other alternatives, such as direct heating and microwave processing had a minimal effect in increasing the shelf-life of pita bread.

The maize growth model of DSSAT is CERES-maize. To evaluate its predictive capability under western Quebec conditions, data on corn (Zea mays L.) yield and above-ground biomass were collected from a field-scale water table management experiment conducted during the 1996 and 1997 growing seasons at St. Emmanuel, Soulanges County, Quebec. The model was calibrated using various crop growth and development data observed during the 1996 growing season. Cultivar-specific coefficients were determined during the calibration. All measured data on phenology, grain yield and biomass collected in 1997 were used for model validation. Validation results showed good agreement between predicted and measured yields. In 1996, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.64 and 0.66 Mg/ha for the free drainage plots with 200 kg/ha N (FD200) and 120 kg/ha N (FD120), respectively. In 1997, the RMSE for FD200 and FD120 were 1.07 and 1.23 Mg/ha respectively. However, the model overpredicted the biomass for 1997, and grain number for both FD200 and FD120 treatments in both years. The mean difference (MD) between simulated and observed biomass at maturity was statistically significant at (P &lt; 0.01) for both treatments. Sensitivity analyses showed that the CERES-Maize model was most sensitive to changes in air temperature. The model was also sensitive to soil water and crop genetic parameters.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Madramootoo, C. A.

The first event was the spring freshet---peaking in mid-May, 1996---while the second event---peaking on July 20, 1996---was the largest flood on record for the region. The resultant channel adjustments can be classified as either bedform evolution---in which a clear, systematic pattern of adjustment is evident---or as bedform change, in which local hydraulic and sedimen tologic conditions produce a seemingly random pattern of channel mobilization. Where bedform evolution has occurred, it is consistent with the existing paradigm for meander development. Sediment transport calculations based on the 'inverse' or 'morphologic' method were strongly correlated to reach average mobility ratios. The average rate of transport in response to the larger flood approached those reported by others for a braided system (Goff and Ashmore, 1994). Potential spawning zones within the three reaches were all subjected to significant net scour and/or fill following the second event; several potential spawning zones were significantly affected by the first event The presence of bank protection upstream of a potential spawning zone seems to be a determinant 10 the severity of the impact by promoting erosion of these zones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lapointe, M.

Data suggest both deuterium incorporation and mass isotopomer distribution analysis accurately define cholesterol synthesis in humans when measured over a period of 24 h. Our second objective was to examine the effects of weight loss through energy restriction upon human in vivo circulating cholesterol concentrations and synthesis using the deuterium incorporation methodology. Seven overweight subjects with a mean BMI of 30.6 +/- 1.6 kg·m-2 were recruited into a 2-phase prospective clinical trial including 3 mo on a weight stable American Heart Association Step I diet and 6 mo on an energy-reduced American Heart Association Step I diet. Data suggest that deuterium incorporation and mass isotopomer distribution analysis are equally effective methods for measuring cholesterol biosynthesis in humans, and that energy restriction resulting in modest weight loss effectively reduces endogenous cholesterol synthesis thus decreasing the risk of CVD development in obese and overweight men.

The block copolymer employed has 390 PS units and 79 PAA units. The copolymer is solubilised upon heating and micellisation occurs as the temperature decreases: this preparation is referred to as the single-solvent method. Temperatures reached are above 120°C and thus require the use of pressure reactors as low alkanols have low boiling points. Three types of reactors were employed. The first was the unstirred reactor which validated the method. Secondly, a stirred reactor was used in order to maximise the dissolution of the copolymer over a broader range of conditions that achieved in the unstirred reactor. Micellisation induced on cooling is explained as being analogous to that encountered on adding a precipitant to a copolymer solution. The effects of stirring and pressure are also discussed. Various morphologies were obtained in both reactors, including a highly ordered bicontinuous morphology in the stirred reactor. To determine the thermodynamics of the micellisation at high temperatures and elevated pressures, a reactor with windows was acquired. The set-up, interfacing and development of a more advanced instrument including this windowed reactor are described. Preliminary experiments showed that in-situ turbidity measurements can be carried out on this instrument; the results of these studies are also briefly reported. Finally, preliminary light scattering studies of polycaprolactone- b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PCL-b-PEO) copolymers of different compositions have been carried out. The dependence of the critical water content (cwc) on copolymer composition and concentration was studied and the results described.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eisenberg, Adi (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j96023054.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956j05g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2z10ws46z"><dcterms:title>The effect of inbreeding in various traits in a colonizing wing dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>DeRose, Marc A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Falconer (1989) made the statement that traits closely related to fitness generally experience greater inbreeding depression than traits less closely related to fitness.

This study was designed to investigate whether overexpressing the PRLR in the Mac-T cell line resulted in a change in its growth rate and an enhancement of its ability to produce milk proteins. To accomplish these goals, Mac-T cells were stably transfected with the rabbit prolactin receptor gene. Fifteen clones and a pool of transfectants were obtained. Of these, one clone and the pool were positive for the PRL receptor expression. The clone (S15) and pool (SP) cells were sorted into high (H), medium (M), and low (L) expressors, of the PRLR. The high expressors were used for all subsequent experiments. The presence of high levels of the PRLR on the surface of S15 and SP cells was further confirmed by receptor binding assay and Western Blot. Following the establishment of these cell lines, the cells were used to investigate the effect of increased levels of PRLR on cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis. It was found that the growth rate of parental cells was depressed in the presence of 5 mug/ml of PRL. In contrast, the growth rate of the transfectants was enhanced by the addition of 5 mug/ml PRL to the culture medium. In addition, both "SP" and "S15" cells produced higher levels of STAT5 upon long-term (48 h) PRL stimulation. No effect on the synthesis of alpha S1- and beta-caseins was noted. It is likely that no differences in protein synthesis were observed because the cells have lost the ability to differentiate, even when cultured on collagen gels in the presence of lactogenic hormones.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Zhao, Xin (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf74z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gz26g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Casein.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Prolactin genes -- Expression.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dairy cattle -- Genetics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Arj430682d"><dcterms:title>Quaternion algebras and the graph method for elliptic curves</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Déchène, Isabelle.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The graph method simultaneously uses the theory of quaternion algebras, elliptic curves and modular forms in order to determine all supersingular points in a given characteristic and hence to obtain a basis of S2(N).

The entry of cellular, highly vascularized channels requires the degradation of cartilage components. As a first step, aggrecan is cleaved by an unidentified MMP along the edges of the channel walls, as detected by an antiserum directed to a cleavage fragment retained in the tissue; the presence of an active MMP at the channel edge is confirmed by the binding of a recombinant MMP inhibitor, TIMP-2. Second, using histozymography, the collagen component of cartilage is degraded by another MMP, identified as gelatinase B by inhibition studies, at similar channel sites. Thus, two proteinases combine their efforts to produce the resorption associated with channel invasion preceding the appearance of the secondary ossification center in the rat tibial epiphysis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lee, Eunice R.

Detailed field mapping and petrographic analyses, coupled with remote sensing and geophysical evidence have shown that the TFZ is a fundamental structure within the Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO), separating and offsetting several lithotectonic domains. Earliest deformation preserved within the TFZ in the Wollaston Lake area is the transposition of a regional gneissic foliation onto a northeast-trending flattening plane, within north-trending sinistral shear zones. The transposed fabric is characterized by folded and attenuated remnants of the gneissic foliation, together with boudinaged leucogranitic sheets and dykes. Within these shear zones a shear fabric is developed parallel to the margins in several locations. The shear fabric offsets all earlier foliations with consistent sinistral offset. Adjacent to the shear fabric, structures are reoriented to lie dose to the shear plane. The fault and its associated structures controlled the intrusion of granitic and pegmatitic dykes which were subsequently weakly deformed. Brittle overprinting of ductile fault features is widespread. Sedimentary features, apatite fission track data, and uranium mineralogical studies all show that the TFZ was reactivated at least twice in Phanerozoic times.

The cost per case of active TB via passive detection was estimated to be $7675.87. Between 1 June 1996 and 1 June 1997, 12898 applicants underwent screening chest X-rays at the Montreal Chest Institute, among whom 16 cases of active TB were detected and treated and 322 cases of inactive TB were detected.

Thus from a cost minimization perspective, no screening was preferable to screening, but from a cost effectiveness perspective, when the benefit of cases prevented through screening was considered, the screening program appeared to be worthwhile in comparison to other health interventions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Menzies, Dick (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903202n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988n23x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amg74qp22n"><dcterms:title>Dependence of the transport in channel models of the ACC on the Rossby radius of deformation</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Crevier, Louis-Philippe.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>It has been suggested that the transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is set, essentially, by the southward Sverdrup flux at latitudes just north of Drake Passage. Although this idea is consistent with observations, it has been critized in that Sverdrup dynamics fail at Drake Passage latitudes. Here, we think of the total transport as being comprised of two components: one associated with the basin-like dynamics to the north of Drake Passage and the other associated with the dynamics of the Drake Passage latitude band itself. The Drake Passage latitudes are often simulated using channel models with bottom topography. For a two-layer channel, large topography effectively blocks geostrophic contours at depth and allows zonally-reconnecting contours in the upper layer. This concentrates the through-channel transport in the model's upper layer. Furthermore, it is argued that the statistical steady state for wind-driven channel flow (that is not too viscous) should be baroclinically unstable. Assuming marginal instability then leads to an estimate of the through-channel transport. A two-layer primitive-equation channel model with bottom topography and wind forcing is used to test this relationship. Model integrations are made to obtain statistical steady states for a range of parameters. The Rossby radius and the wind strength are varied as the theory predicts that transport should go like the square of the former and be relatively insensitive to the latter. Integrations to test the robustness of these results to model resolution are also conducted.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Straub, David N.

Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec and at Winchester and Kemptville, Ontario. A total of 11 cultivars were evaluated based on parameters pertinent to successful production. The French cultivar 'Ariane' stood out as the cultivar whose performance was most consistent across a variety of soil types and locations. The best method of establishing fibre flax (c.v. Ariane) in terms of seeding depth (zero, one, two, four or six centimeters), with soil compaction prior to vs. after seeding, or not at all, was also investigated during 1997 and 1998 at Macdonald Campus. Results were somewhat contingent on soil type at a specific site, but generally, a shallow seeding depth of one or two centimeters is best, with soil compaction prior to seeding more effective in lighter soils, and the same shallow seeding depth with no soil compaction in heavier soils. Preliminary investigations at Macdonald Campus in 1998 indicate good potential for the production of fibre flax (cv. Ariane) in minimum and zero tillage systems compared with conventional tillage. There were no significant differences between treatments in fresh straw yield, and minimum tillage plots produced significantly taller plants in one of the two sites. Overall, findings from this research indicate that fibre flax can successfully be produced in Eastern Canada using cultivars; of European origin and in a variety of tillage systems.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watson, A.

Myelin debris was first examined immunohistochemically in the presence or absence of regenerating axons. From these preliminary experiments it was apparent that the clearance of myelin debris was not affected by regenerating axons and that the debris was removed in a differential pattern along the visual pathway. Specifically, in the distal stump of the nerve as well as in the optic tract, myelin debris had been effectively cleared by one-month postoperative, while in the cranial segment of the nerve debris persisted for at least 6 weeks after injury. The differential pattern of myelin debris in the optic nerve and tract was then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using thick and thin plastic sections at various time points during regeneration. The results suggested that highly activated peripheral macrophages were responsible for the effective clearance of myelin in the distal nerve stump. In the optic tract a number of cellular properties, including their unique population of astrocytes may have enhanced the rate of debris clearance. By contrast, in the cranial segment of the nerve persistent debris was found both intracellularly in phagosomes and extracellularly, suggesting that the resident phagocytes were deficient in effecting both phagocytosis and emigration. Deficient phagocytosis may be a result of the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in this region, while the failure to emigrate is most likely due to the rigid network of astrocytes in the nerve.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Levine, R.

Oocytes recovered from abattoir-derived ovaries were centrifuged for 5 min at 6000xg to facilitate sperm injection. Sperm were pre-treated in vitro with 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and diluted (approximately 1:5) with 5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in 0.9% saline. After sperm injection, various activation procedures were compared. Initially, 3 h after activation with 5muM Ionomycin (A23187), oocytes with second polar bodies were selected and treated with 1.9mM 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP). The cleavage rate of sperm-injected oocytes treated with Ionomycin and DMAP was higher than with Ionomycin alone (62.1 vs. 27.3%, p &lt; 0.05). In sham-injected control oocytes treated with Ionomycin and DMAP, the cleavage rate was approximately six times higher than that of oocytes treated with Ionomycin alone (44.3 vs. 7.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Upon examination 16 h after ICSI, pronuclear formation was observed in 33 of 47 (70.2%) DMAP-treated oocytes.

With the advent of community based medicine, knowledge of the changes in health status of caregivers of stroke patients during the early period of community re-entry is needed. The overall objective of this study was to determine if there are changes in the physical and mental health status of stroke caregivers during the first three months of the patient's return home. Two successive mini-cohort studies were conducted using measures of physical and mental health and caregiver burden. The first mini-cohort consisted of 28 caregivers and measured changes in the first six weeks of community re-entry. The second mini-cohort consisted of 15 caregivers and measured changes between six weeks and three months after community re-entry. In this study, the vast majority of caregivers come from the context of a long term relationship with the person with stroke and tend to be in good physical health when compared with age-matched norms. As measured by the Mental Components Summary score of the SF-36 Health Survey, the mental health scores of caregivers were low in comparison to age-matched norms and approximately 25% of the caregivers showed scores consistent with clinical depression. No significant changes were found in measures of caregiver health in either mini-cohort over time. However, a lot of individual variation was seen and caregivers used significantly lower levels of coping skills over the first six weeks of community return. Significant correlations were found between caregiver mental health status and the disability of the person with stroke in both mini-cohorts.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Mayo, Nancy (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Wood-Dauphinee, Sharon (advisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:supervisor>Wolfson, Tina (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t420g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182n33p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773x75b"><dcterms:title>Monocyte chemotactic proteins in allergen-induced rhinitis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1998</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Pathology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Christodoulopoulos, Pota.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Allergen-induced rhinitis is associated with the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils and CD4 + T cells into the nasal mucosa. Monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCPs) have been shown to induce chemotactic activity in these particular cell types under in vitro assay conditions. To assess the contribution of MCPs in the recruitment of inflammatory cells in vivo, we investigated the allergen-induced late response in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, we demonstrated a constitutive expression of MCP-1, -3 and -4, of which MCP-3 and -4 were significantly increased in the nasal mucosa following allergen provocation. This upregulation of MCP-3 and 4 immunoreactivity in response to allergen, was reduced in patients pretreated with topical corticosteroids. Colocalization experiments revealed that the majority of MCP-positive cells were macrophages. The results of this study suggest that allergen-induced rhinitis is associated with an increased expression of MCP-3 and -4, which may be closely related to the influx of inflammatory cells and may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hamid, Outayba (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172037b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773x75b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afx719p47r"><dcterms:title>Zeolite in pig diet : effect on growth performance and air quality</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Choinière, Denis.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Zeolite (77% clinoptilolite) was supplemented in grower hog rations at a rate of 2 or 5%.

However, information concerning the long-term functional recovery of burn survivors remains limited. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine the effects of burns on quadriceps muscle endurance and fatigue recovery by comparing healed major burn survivors with healthy matched individuals. Muscle endurance was measured by the number of intermittent submaximal isometric contractions completed during two standard fatigue protocols (SFPs). Recovery from fatigue was monitored for 10 minutes using the interpolated twitch technique. Parameters that were collected at baseline and post SFPs included maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, muscle activation level, twitch tension (Pt), compound muscle action potential (M-wave) amplitude, and activity of agonist (vastus medialis)/antagonist(biceps femoris) muscles. Results revealed a lower endurance level in major burn survivors than in matched individuals. The differential detrimental effects of fatigue on Pt and MVC force indicated excitation-contraction uncoupling as the major underlying cause of fatigue in both groups. In addition, neuromuscular propagation impairment, decreased muscle membrane excitability and increased antagonist activity may contribute to the decrease in force generating capacity in major burn survivors. Further research is needed to examine the residual physical limitations from major burn injuries and their effects on quality of life.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>St.-Pierre, Diane (advisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tf17x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66345818</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ast74cs656"><dcterms:title>Characterization of the 5' region of the human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1999</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chan, Manuel</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyses the reduction of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a methyl donor for the re-methylation of homocysteine to methionine. A thermolabile variant of this enzyme, present in approximately 35% of alleles in the North American population, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, and colon cancer. A cDNA of 2.2kb for human MTHFR has been expressed and results in an active enzyme, but the cDNA and genomic sequences 5' to the ATG start site have not been adequately investigated. The characterization of the 5' region of the human MTHFR gene is reported here. Four additional 5' exonic sequences were localized to a 4kb genomic fragment. The original exon 1 extends directly upstream into a 5' UTR. Three other 5' exons (two with open reading frames) are alternatively spliced into a common splice acceptor site, generating cDNAs with 4 possible 5' ends. The N-terminal peptide sequence of the porcine MTHFR has not been identified in the human sequence suggesting that the missing human coding sequence might be localized further upstream or not conserved across species. A putative chloride ion channel gene (ClC-6) was located in the opposite orientation, at 3.5kb upstream of the original ATG codon, suggesting an overlap with the MTHFR gene and potential co-localization of regulatory elements. A CpG island was identified in the region of a 5' exon (43S) suggesting that a transcription start site and a promoter might be nearby.
