The design required the development of new: a) A.-c. power amplifiers b) Square law device c) D. C. sum and difference amplifiers e) A normalizing divider circuit. The instrument was tested by measuring the cross-correlation coefficient in a reverberant room of known characteristics. It was found that the instrument has an accuracy of better than 2 percent.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Howes, F.
