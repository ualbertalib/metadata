Behavioural tasks provided measures of cognitive function, affective behaviour and locomotor ability. Adult and aged transgenic mice, expressing the C104 fragment of the human $ beta$-Amyloid Precursor Protein, displayed increased anxiety by seven months of age in the Thatcher-Britton Novelty Conflict paradigm, memory impairments in the Forced Alternation T-Maze, the Porsolt Forced Swim test and the Recognition test, and decreased hippocampal acetylcholinesterase staining. BIBN99, a muscarinic M2-antagonist that increases release of acetylcholine, failed to ameliorate these changes. Apolipoprotein E deficient mice showed impairments of spatial memory in the Morris swim maze, but were unaffected by the administration of tacrine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Segmental trisomy 16 mice, a model of Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, showed increases in hippocampal choline acetyl-transferase activity and mild memory impairments in the swim maze. BIBN99 had no effect on this deficit. These findings suggest that each of these models is beneficial in its own right for studying the functional deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Welner, Sharon A.

A significant, albeit not well characterized, component of the PP originates in EC layer III pyramidal cells and terminates directly in area CA1 of the HPC, circumventing the classical trisynaptic circuit. In an attempt to elaborate the input-output properties of this pathway, neurons of this layer were characterized both morphologically and electrophysiologically in an in vitro rat brain slice preparation using intracellular labeling and recording techniques with sharp micropipettes and under current-clamp conditions. These cells showed a typical pyramidal cell morphology. Analysis of the voltage-current relations demonstrated a rather linear membrane voltage behavior in the subthreshold range with the exception of pronounced inward rectification in the depolarizing direction due to a persistent Na$ sp+$-type current. This depolarizing current may provide the drive for the tonic discharge observed at rest in many of these neurons. Also, blockade of Ca$ sp{2+}$-conductances suggests that there is a high-threshold Ca$ sp{2+}$ component responsible for the shape of the spike, and indirectly responsible for both the spike AHP and the slow AHP following a train of spikes. The intrinsic electroresponsiveness of EC layer III pyramidal cells suggests that these neurons may perform a rather high-fidelity transfer function of incoming neocortical sensory information directly to the CA1 hippocampal subfield. This feedforward signal may function to gate the result of the information processing through entorhinal layer II and the trisynaptic pathway.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Alonso, Angel (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p912x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558g21n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Abc386m36n"><dcterms:title>Effects of water table management on water quality and strip cropped corn-soybean yields</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mej√≠a, Manuel.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A two-year field study was carried out in eastern Ontario to investigate the effects of water table management (WTM) on water quality and crop yields.

Chronic exercise increased milk fat concentrations and an interaction between chronic exercise and 20% dietary glucose decreased milk lactose concentrations compared to 40% or 60% glucose diets. Restricting maternal dietary glucose also decreased milk fat concentrations and exercise decreased mammary fat. In addition, pups of dams fed the 40% glucose diet were heavier on lactation day 15 than pups of dams fed the 60% diet. These results suggest that competition for glucose occurs and that a 40% glucose maternal diet may be more appropriate for pup growth.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Koski, Kristine G.

The transforming activity of the virus resides within the virally encoded v-rel oncogene, the first member identified of a growing number of transcriptional regulators called the REL/NF$ kappa$B family. The mechanism of v-rel mediated transformation of avian as well as mammalian cells remains elusive, however immunoprecipitations performed with anti-v-rel antibodies clearly reveal associated proteins which include pp40 I$ kappa$B alpha, p68 c-rel, hsc70 and the p124 and p115 precursors for the p50 and p52 subunits of the REL/NF$ kappa$B family, respectively. In normal cells these same proteins are also found associated with the proto-oncogene c-rel. REL/NF$ kappa$B members have been implicated in the regulation of lymphocyte growth, differentiation and activation suggesting that v-rel mediated transformation involves the deregulation of normal REL/NF$ kappa$B function. In order to better understand v-rel protein function, we have investigated several gene regulatory systems. Specifically, we have tested and used phophorothioate oligonucleotides as well as vectors producing antisense RNA for the purpose of disrupting gene expression in avian cells. We have tested the RCAS system (Replication competent avian leukosis LTR &amp; splice acceptor) of vectors to infect and disseminate within a chicken effectively producing somatically transgenic chickens where cloned genes may be expressed from the infected cells. Also investigated was the feasability of using the tetracycline regulated gene expression system in avian cells. These new regulatory systems will allow us to understand the role played by individual members of the REL/NF$ kappa$B family in cellular transformation.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Ratcliffe, Mike (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236407z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q348h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Microbiology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0g354h29q"><dcterms:title>Efficiency evaluations of North american university libraries by Data Envelopment Analysis</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mann, Gillian Margaret.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A method for ranking efficient decision making units in Data Envelopment Analysis is suggested.

Initial storage trials of both raw and cooked battered and breaded value-added nuggets in air and under various modified atmospheres (MAP) showed that a microbiological shelf-life of 28 d was possible for cooked nuggets at 4 and 12$ sp circ$C packaged under various gas atmospheres, compared to $ sim$14 d for raw nuggets stored/packaged under similar conditions. Growth of Listeria monocytogenes occurred in both raw and cooked nuggets at 4 and 12$ sp circ$C, irrespective of packaging conditions. However, growth of Clostridium botulinum type E was inhibited in both raw and cooked nuggets stored at 4, 12, and 25$ sp circ$C. While inhibition was suspected to be due to the decrease in pH of raw nuggets to $ sim$4.1-4.5, due to the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), subsequent studies on cooked and sterilized nuggets showed that the anti-botulinum effect was due to heat resistant Bacillus species. Further challenge studies with C. botulinum type E in sterile nuggets (i.e., in the absence of LAB and Bacillus spp.) showed that toxin was produced after 14 and 28 d in nuggets stored in air, and in air with an Ageless SS oxygen absorbent at 25 and 12$ sp circ$C, respectively. Further studies have now confirmed that Bacillus isolates, specifically B. subtilis, inhibited the growth of C. botulinum type E.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, J. P.

The purpose of this thesis is to integrate procedure facilities into an existing relational database system. A relation is defined over a set of attributes. Given the values of a subset of attributes as input, a selection operation looks up the relation and outputs the values of the remaining attributes. Our proposed procedure construct supports this concept: a procedure is defined over a set of parameters, and the procedure can be invoked with different subsets of input parameters. This is accomplished by allowing procedures to have a sequence of blocks within the procedure body. Each block abstracts a sequence of actions which requires a subset of parameters as input. Users can select different blocks to be activated by supplying different subsets of input parameters. While a relation can be selected with any subset of input attributes, a procedure can only be invoked with defined subsets of parameters. Our proposed procedures also support the usual properties of procedural abstraction: encapsulation and parameterization. A procedure declaration defines the procedure name, formal parameters, and the body. Procedure invocation is through the use of a stand-alone procedure call statement which specifies the procedure name and a list of actual parameters. Before a procedure is activated, the formal parameters within the procedure body are replaced by the corresponding actual parameters. Moreover, a procedure can be printed, shown, deleted, called by itself or other procedures, and passed as a parameter.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Merrett, T. H.

Since the first description by Pierre Marie in 1893, the classification has been controversial. This is mainly due to the variety of symptoms observed and the inter- and intrafamilial variability in age of onset, clinical features, neuropathological and biochemical findings. Up to the beginning of 1993, two loci had been identified: one on the short arm of chromosome 6 and more recently a second locus assigned to the long arm of chromosome 12 in a large Cuban family. These loci are termed SCA 1 and SCA 2, respectively. We have studied four large families from different ethnic backgrounds segregating an autosomal dominant form of SCA. A total of 266 individuals, including 65 affecteds, were ascertained. We found clinical similarities among the four families. All kindreds showed progressive cerebellar ataxia, with a mean age onset in the fourth or fifth decades of life. We performed detailed clinical, genetic and linkage analyses in these families in order to assess the clinical and genetic heterogeneity.

Bone marrow cells exposed to 20% L929-fibroblast conditioned medium (LCM) were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. Western ligand blotting (WLB) analysis detected four bands in all samples. 41-kDa and 30-kDa bands were detected after 12 h and remained constant during BMM differentiation. The 28-kDa and 25-kDa proteins were almost undetectable until day 2, but accumulated significantly from day 3 to day 7. Immunoblotting analysis verified these two bands as IGFBP-4. Northern blotting analyses detected both IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-3 mRNA in the cells. The 41-kDa protein was postulated to be IGFBP-3 in a glycosylated form. The identity of the 30-kDa band is not known. Northern blotting analysis showed that IGF-I mRNA level increased in a time-dependent manner until day 3, and decreased thereafter during BMM differentiation. The effect of IGF-I and its analogs on cell proliferation was studied by ($ sp3$H) thymidine incorporation. IGF-I and its analogs enhanced cell proliferation of freshly isolated bone marrow cells. Both IGF-I and long R$ sp3$ IGF-I, but not des(1-3)IGF-I, continued to exert a stimulating effect on day 1, although to a lesser extent.

The objective of this study was to determine if newborns with congenital heart defects demonstrate abnormalities in neurobehavioral status prior to surgery, as measured by neurologic and neurobehavioral performance as well as somatosensory evoked potentials. The results indicated that neurobehavioral abnormalities were common and included muscle tone abnormalities, seizures, microcephaly, poor state regulation, poor orienting responses, and abnormal feeding patterns.

BGP is down-regulated in many carcinomas. The mouse homolog of human BGP is Bgp1. It is a membrane-bound protein expressed in many types of epithelial and endothelial cells as well as in cells or the immune system. It functions in vitro as a cell adhesion molecule and can act as a tumor supressor. However, its physiological functions remain unclear. Histoimmunochemical studies of its expression pattern during development suggest that Bgp1 is active in epithelial differentiation, gut morphogenesis, absorption/reabsorption processes, myogenesis and mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. In order to test further the physiological functions of this protein, we have attempted to produce bgp1 +t/$-$mouse embryonic stem cells, which would have later been used to generate bgp1 $-/-$mice. The results from the developmental studies will be extremely useful in the analysis of the bgp1 $-/-$mice phenotype, when these mice become available.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Beauchemin, Nicole (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tr29h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk79f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544br424"><dcterms:title>The study of prognosis in Alzheimer's disease : a critical review and comparative analysis of methodology</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lesperance, Kathleen Joan.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Knowledge of the clinical progression and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for planning the care of afflicted individuals and evaluating the potential benefits of interventions. There is little consensus, however, regarding the prognostic importance of clinical and demographic characteristics investigated to date. This thesis examined the methodology of prognostic studies of AD through: (1) a critical review of published studies (1984-1995); (2) an assessment of the concordance among different methods of estimating annual rate of change; and (3) an evaluation of the assumption that decline in AD is linear. A review of 59 eligible studies revealed considerable methodological diversity. The studies also varied in the extent to which they may have been influenced by several sources of bias. Despite this, the findings for some potential prognostic factors were fairly consistent across studies. Illustrative re-analyses of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) data from two longitudinal cohorts of probable AD patients (N = 65 and 46) indicated that annual rate of change estimates obtained from the two-point, adjusted two-point, and linear regression methods were comparable. Those of the trilinear model showed poorer concordance. Analyses of data from one cohort confirmed the presence of significant group and individual linear trends in MMSE scores over time and failed to provide evidence of a common quadratic trend. These findings suggest that prognostic research in AD could benefit from more rigorous study design and further investigation of outcome instruments. Recommendations are made for future research.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Wolfson, Christina (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z829.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br424</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ans064779c"><dcterms:title>Characterization and Expression of the adenovirus type 5 E1B 19 kiloDalton protein</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biochemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lemieux, Nancy.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The adenovirus early region 1B 19 kiloDalton (19K) protein has been shown to play a role in the suppression of apoptosis caused either by viral or cellular inducers.

A comparative study involving other C. dematium isolates suggests that the isolate from E. angustifolium is a forma specialis and should be designated as Colletotrichum dematium f.sp. epilobii. The most severe damage was achieved on seedlings using a conidial density of $1 times 10 sp9$ conidia m$ sp{-2}$. Virulence decreased with plant maturity. Satisfactory levels of control were limited to long dew duration ($&gt;$18 h) and high temperature treatments. Of various adjuvants tested, significantly higher levels of control were achieved when inoculum was sprayed in a vegetable oil emulsion (25% v/v). An inoculum buffered to acidic pH levels (pH 3.0) similarly increased level of control compared with an unbuffered conidial suspension and the adjustment to more alkaline pH levels using the citrate-phosphate buffer (pH $&gt;$ 4.0), inhibited disease expression. In host range studies, C. dematium f.sp. epilobii was restricted to the Onagraceae family. Both Camissonia bistorta and Clarkia pulchella were susceptible whereas the fungus was highly virulent on all but one E. angustifolium ecotype. Among nine commercial tree species tested for susceptibility yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) was susceptible to the fungus when conidia were applied in an oil emulsion. The application of inoculum in a tank mix combination with the oil emulsion and a low rate of glyphosate provided significant growth control of E. angustifolium seedlings (7-wk-old), whereas the effectiveness of this suspension significantly decreased with plant maturity. Under controlled conditions, post-emergence application of an oil-based formulation including the ground colonized substrate of another bioherbicide candidate of E. angustifolium, Alternaria sp., significantly reduced above-ground biomass when provided a 12-h dew and applied at a rate as low as $5 times 10 sp6$ conidia m$ sp{-2}$.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Watson, Alan K.

In the present study, we examined the effects of established and novel compounds including antioxidants, ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors and iron chelators on NF-$ kappa$B activation and HIV LTR-mediated gene expression induced by TNF-$ alpha$. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) and Trimidox (TD) at various concentrations inhibited TNF-$ alpha$ induced NF-$ kappa$B binding in Jurkat cells. Pretreatment of cells with these compounds prior to stimulation prevented I$ rm kappa B alpha$ degradation. Phosphorylation of I$ rm kappa B alpha$, a prerequisite for its signal-induced degradation, was abrogated in these cells, indicating that oxidative stress is an essential step in the NF-$ kappa$B activation pathway. On the other hand, iron chelators Desferrioxamine (Desferal), Pyridoxal Isonicotinoyl Hydrazone (PIH) and Salicylaldehyde Isonicotinoyl Hydrazone (SIH) showed no inhibition on TNF-$ alpha$ induced NF-$ kappa$B DNA binding activity. Synergistic induction of HIV-1 LTR-mediated gene expression by TNF-$ alpha$ and the HIV-1 transactivator Tat in Jurkat cells was significantly suppressed in the presence of NAC and TD, but not PDTC. The inhibition of LTR-directed gene expression by NAC and TD was diminished when NF-$ kappa$B-binding sites in the LTR were deleted, indicating that these compounds affected the NF-$ kappa$B component of the synergism. Iron chelators PIH and SIH also showed some inhibitory effect on LTR-mediated gene activation, presumably through an NF-$ kappa$B independent mechanism. Conclusively, these experiments demonstrate that TD, at concentration 50 times lower than the effective concentration of NAC, potently inhibits of NF-$ kappa$B activity and suppresses HIV-LTR expression.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Hiscott, John (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt781.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j087x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Cell.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Molecular.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As4655j57p"><dcterms:title>Identification of Ty3gypsy-like sequences in A. thaliana, L. sativa, Lycopersicon, and Z. mays</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Leclerc-Potvin, Carole.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The nucleotide sequence of a cloned RAPD DNA marker (OPI08) linked to a disease resistance gene in L. sativa (lettuce) revealed homology with the conserved domain of the reverse transcriptase of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons.

Animal models of AD, to date, have largely ignored the affective components of the disorder. Therefore, we investigated whether nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM)-lesioned rats, an animal model which mimics some of the cognitive deficits associated with AD, would display behavioral alterations on tests evaluating anxiety. We also tested the ability of neural transplants to normalize lesion-related changes in anxious behavior, as it has been demonstrated that grafting embryonic cholinergic or adult chromaffin cells can ameliorate NBM lesion-induced deficits in cognitive abilities and reverse lesion-related neurochemical alterations. Thus, rats were bilaterally NBM-lesioned and, 10 to 12 days post-lesion, either behaviorally tested or grafted with chromaffin or kidney cell suspensions and tested 4 weeks post-grafting. Findings suggest that the NBM lesion-induced cognitive deficits in rodents appear homologous to the impairments in cognition associated with AD.

Accordingly, specific catabolic gene PCR primers for chlorinated degradation pathways were designed and tested to determine if these genes are involved in diclofop-methyl degradation. DNA homology analysis between the PCR products and the known catabolic genes investigated by Southern hybridization analysis and by sequencing, suggested that novel catabolic genes are functioning in the isolates.

The results of array dependence analysis are required by many parallelizing transformations as well as other analyses for further optimizations. This thesis is concerned with a symbolic framework for array dependence analysis. It has been shown that the presence of unknown symbolic values in array index expressions occurs with significant frequency such that the accuracy of array dependence analysis is compromised. The use of helper analyses such as constant propagation, resolves the problem in some situations, but in general the development of symbolic array dependence analysis is needed. This thesis shows how such a symbolic framework can be implemented for the complete programming language C, including accurate handling of multi-level pointers. In addition to the major contributions to the development of a symbolic framework and how it applies to array dependence analysis, this thesis has made contributions in several other areas. This work has been integrated into the McCAT optimizing/parallelizing C compiler and in particular into the McADT (the McCAT Array Dependence Tester). Based on this implementation, several experimental studies were conducted and the results of these experiments are discussed in detail.

While the latter are thought to be involved in neurotransmission, the physiological significance of the former are not fully understood. However, evidence suggests that the toxin sensitive receptors may mediate trophic functions. The present studies were carried out to develop and validate novel and unique model systems for studying the structure, function and regulation of the nicotinic $ alpha$-BGT receptor. To this end, two such systems are presented here. First, the immortalized rat hippocampal H19-7 cell line was investigated. This cell line was shown to express a similar set of mRNA encoding for nicotinic receptor subunits as adult rat hippocampus. Further, binding studies using ($ sp{125}$I) -$ alpha$-BGT and other nicotinic ligands demonstrated a similar pharmacological profile between $ alpha$-BGT sites expressed in H19-7 cells and those described in rat brain and primary cultures. The second model system developed involved the stable transfection of the rat $ alpha$7 nicotinic receptor subunit into a rat clonal cell line ($ rm GH sb4C sb1$) which does not endogenously express any nicotinic receptor subunits. RNase protection assays demonstrated that untransfected cells expressed no nicotinic receptor subunit mRNAs, while their transfected counterparts ($ rm alpha7/GH sb4C sb1$ cells) expressed the $ alpha$7 subunit message exclusively. Northern analysis confirmed that the size of the $ alpha$7 message expressed by the transfected cells was similar to the predicted length based on the cDNA used for transfection. The two novel model systems developed and validated in the present studies may serve as an impetus for future studies to delineate the role of the $ alpha$-BGT sensitive neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quik, Maryka (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hr67w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb33s</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A73666655r"><dcterms:title>Clinical predictors of deep vein thrombosis in patients with leg symptoms</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1996</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kahn, Susan Rebecca.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Background. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition with significant mortality and morbidity. Proximal DVT is more often associated with pulmonary embolism and the post-phlebitic syndrome than calf DVT. Identifying which clinical variables predict DVT and proximal DVT could be useful for the effective targeting of diagnostic tests for DVT. Purpose. To determine, in patients presenting with leg symptoms, which clinical variables best predict (1) DVT and (2) proximal DVT. To estimate the probability of DVT in an individual presenting with a particular grouping of these variables. Results. Male sex, orthopedic surgery, and warmth and superficial venous dilation on exam were independent predictors of DVT (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals 2.8 (1.5, 5.1), 5.4 (2.2, 13.6), 2.1 (1.2, 3.9) and 2.9 (1.4, 5.7), respectively) and proximal DVT (adjusted odds ratios 2.4 (1.2, 4.8), 4.1 (1.4, 12.3), 2.3 (1.2, 4.7) and 3.4 (1.6, 7.0), respectively). A clinical prediction index that categorized patients into different levels of DVT risk was created, and its ROC curve showed moderate predictive ability. No single cutoff point was ideal in terms of desired sensitivity and specificity, however the index was useful in a strategy aimed to limit the need for contrast venography in patients with suspected DVT. Using this strategy, 78% of study patients could have avoided contrast venography. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Joseph, L.
