The second part is an accompanying analytical text about the work. In the text, after a short description of the project, of its objectives and original contribution, we discuss the theoretical basis of my compositional approach. This approach stands on the fundamental structural independence of poiesis and esthesis, and leads to a musical aesthetics favouring formal transparency and seeking an active listening attitude. Two sets of compositional techniques are then introduced: techniques using the 12-tone row and techniques based on chance operations. We observe that those techniques all endeavour to balance systematicism and intuition to the greater profit of musical expression. We then proceed to a detailed analysis of L 'entreprise de seduction revealing its main musical material and processes. The text concludes with a few overall comments and by a discussion of the possible impact of this composition on my future projects.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sn80h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53x031g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Violoncello with instrumental ensemble -- Analysis, appreciation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Violoncello with instrumental ensemble -- Scores.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0p096b605"><dcterms:title>The spirit of sound prosodic method in the poetry of William Blake, W.B.

B. Yeats, and T. S. Eliot. It explores the relationship between each poet's poetic sound structures and his spiritual aims. The project argues that in Blake's prophetic poems The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem, in Yeats's middle and late poetry, and in Eliot's post-conversion poetry, the careful structuring of the non-semantic features of language serves to model a process through which one may arrive at the threshold of a spiritual reality. The introductory chapter situates these poets' works within the genre of mystical writing; establishes the epistemological nature of poetic sound and its relationship to mystical expression; considers the historical and personal exigencies that influence each poet's prosodic choices; and outlines the prosodic method by which their poetry is scanned. Chapter one addresses William Blake's efforts to re-vision Milton's Christian epic Paradise Lost by means of a logaoedic prosody intended to move the reader from a rational to a spiritual perception of the self and the world. Chapter two considers the development of W.B. Yeats's contrapuntal prosody as integral to his attempt to make of himself a modern poet and to his antithetical mystical philosophy. Chapter three explores the liminal prosody of T. S. Eliot by which he creates an incantatory movement that points to a spiritual reality behind material reality. The project concludes with a consideration of the spiritual aims of Gerard Manley Hopkins and H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and posits a revaluation of Hopkins' sprung rhythm and H.D.'s revisionary chain of sound as prosodic practices intrinsic to their spiritual aims.</dc:abstract><dc:abstract>Ce projet porte sur la prosodie de trois poètes importants, William Blake, W. B. Yeats, et T. S. Eliot, et il explore la relation entre les structures poétiques du son et les buts spirituels de chaque poète. L'argumentaire du projet soutient que dans les poèmes prophétiques de Blake, The Four Zoas, Milton, et Jerusalem, dans la poésie du milieu et de la fin de la carrière de Yeats, et dans la poésie après-conversion d'Eliot la structuration attentive des figures non-sémantiques du langage sert à façonner un processus à travers lequel on pourrait arriver au seuil de la réalité spirituelle. L'introduction sert à situer les oeuvres des trois poètes dans le genre de l'écriture mystique, à établir la nature épistémologique du son poétique et de sa relation à l'expression mystique, à considérer les exigences historiques et personnelles qui ont influencé les choix prosodiques de chaque poète, et à cerner la méthode prosodique selon laquelle on scande leur poésie. Le premier chapitre aborde les efforts de William Blake de revoir l'épopée chrétienne Paradise Lost de Milton selon une prosodie logaédique dont l'intention est de transporter le lecteur d'une perception rationnelle à une perception spirituelle de soi et du monde. Le deuxième chapitre considère le développement de la prosodie en contrepoint de W. B. Yeats comme étant intégral à sa tentative de se construire en tant que poète moderne et à sa philosophie mystique antithétique. Le chapitre trois examine la prosodie liminale de T. S. Eliot avec laquelle il crée un mouvement incantatoire qui indique une réalité spirituelle derrière la réalité matérielle. La conclusion prend en considération les buts spirituels de Gerald Manley Hopkins et H. D.

Prior to accepting risks, insurance companies must first be able to evaluate those risks. Accordingly, they seek to collect the most information possible from, amongst other sources, the insured, so as to gage relative risk and evaluate whether to insure or not, to what degree and at what rate. In due course, the insurer will use this information on conjunction with statistical and actuarial calculations to draw hypotheses on the degree, probability and cost of risk. In selecting relevant risks for analysis, insurers will utilise set variables based on the area of insurance in which they operate. However, said variables are highly susceptible to being discriminatory. Notably, one thinks of sex and age which are contentiously considered by practitioners and scholars whether or not they operate in the field of insurance. This dissertation will examine exhaustively the normative framework in place in order to determine to what degree, if indeed at all, insurers can legitimately and legally utilize certain classifications such as age and sex in order to select, categorise and fix the price for the various risks offered to them. The question shall arise, to what degree less or all-together non-discriminatory criteria should be favoured over criteria, sometimes considered, prohibited. In order to answer all these questions to better address the issue, we must first examine certain essential notions of insurance. Thus, in the first section, we will describe the relevant logistic practices in insurance industries. We shall focus on the decision process at various levels where potential discriminatory practices may arise. We will see that certain schools of thought on insurance classification are at odds, some times diametrically. We will, incidentally, favour the 'fair discrimination' doctrine over its traditional theoretical rival: 'anti-discrimination'. Our research shows that potentially discriminatory classification occurs at several stages of the ex ante and ex post contractual relationship, stages we will examine one at a time. In the second portion we will cover the general juridical regime of the right to non-discrimination in contracts at the international, national and provincial levels. Special attention will be paid to specific rules which allow some limited derogation to the constitutional rights against discrimination. We shall highlight that the legislative authority granted by the Quebec Charter does have limitations. What's more, certain guidelines recently established by the Supreme Court of Canada regarding application, must take precedence over various classification criteria pertaining to insurance which find their root in article 20.1 of the Quebec Charter. Ultimately, we will concentrate on what is just, which is to say the legitimacy of discrimination in a field that takes it for granted while seldomely questioning its foundations. We will come to apply a new measure for insurance discrimination. We will test this new measure in two specific fields: life insurance and automobile insurance. Overall, this thesis will allow us to determine how discriminatory classification can, at times, be legally employed (mostly in pre-selection and segmentation) in the above mentioned fields. We will conclude by proposing a new operating model which seeks to limit classification procedures that circumvent rights to privacy and non-discrimination.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bm93m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s5999</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Discrimination in insurance -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Risk (Insurance) -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Automobile insurance -- Risks -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Risk (Insurance) -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Discrimination in insurance -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Life insurance -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Life insurance -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Automobile insurance -- Risks -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9z903350h"><dcterms:title>Le principe réglementaire de neutralité techno-économique comme outil instrumentant des réseaux de nouvelle génération /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Simard, Caroline J., 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis defends the importance of a standardized designation for the principle of technological neutrality pertaining to the Next-Generation Network (NGN) migration within a competition regime.

The first part introduces the theoretical foundations to better define what it is and what it is not; the principle of techno-economic neutrality supports neither a total state non-intervention nor a progress reduced to a technical progress. The second part describes the parameters of the unanimous definition of the regulatory principle of techno-economic neutrality for the information and communication sectors considering competition and convergence. The triplets of neutrality would offer two guaranties: a regulatory burden balanced between the different suppliers of substitutable services and the emergence of an information and communication society protective of democratic values.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kk71f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903350h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- Deregulation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- Economic aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Telecommunication policy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axd07gx249"><dcterms:title>Functional specialization and religious diversity : Bernard Lonergan's methodology and the philosophy of religion</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Halse, Scott.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Religious diversity has become a central topic in the philosophy of religion. This study proposes a methodological approach to the topic by exploring the division of tasks set out by Bernard Lonergan (1904-1984). Lonergan's methodological framework, which he called functional specialization, provides a generic differentiation of tasks, each of which is central to the overall project of understanding religious diversity. This thesis explores the relevance and utility of functional specialization as a methodological approach to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion. The first chapter is an analysis of the literature on religious diversity as a topic in the philosophy of religion. It unearths the dominant concerns in the field and some of the obstacles which continue to hinder the development of this enquiry. The second chapter provides the epistemological grounds of functional specialization. While the division of tasks outlined by Lonergan's methodology is useful simply insofar as it differentiates the tasks of academic enquiry, there are more theoretical grounds by which this division is justified. The third chapter provides an explanatory account of the operations and tasks involved in each of the eight functional specialties. It elucidates these specialties by drawing upon relevant analogies from outside the field of religious studies. The fourth chapter brings together the two main concerns of the study by suggesting ways in which functional specialization can make a methodological contribution to the enquiry into religious diversity. It organizes the distinct but related tasks which constitute the philosophical study of religious diversity, demonstrates the current trends regarding each of these tasks, and suggests ways in which they can be made more effective. Lonergan's notion of functional specialization makes an important contribution to the philosophical debate over religious diversity in significant ways. It provides an effective methodology which delineates both the fundamental tasks of scholarly enquiry and the operations involved in these tasks. It explains how current work in the philosophy of religious diversity could benefit from a clear delineation of the relevant tasks. It provides a framework which is open to collaboration among scholars of diverse philosophical and theological viewpoints.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w324t.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx249</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Religious pluralism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lonergan, Bernard J.

As an informal learning environment, the web-based community was investigated based on three planes (Rogoff, 1998): Community (i.e., how does learning occur in the web-based community?), Interpersonal (i.e., how does learning occur between participants of the web-based community?), and Individual (i.e., how does individual learning occur through participating in the web-based community?). Under the umbrella of the online ethnographic approach, I applied mixed-method research combining multiple data sources (i.e., discussion transcripts, online survey, online interviews, ethnographic observation, and other documents) and analytical methods (i.e., descriptive framework for CoP, content analysis, transcript analysis, and descriptive statistics). In terms of the community plane, the web-based community was explored by applying the descriptive framework for communities of practice consisting of observable and measurable indicators in terms of organization, participation, and outcome. With regard to the interpersonal plane, I explored how learning occurs between participants of the WBC: How do participants interact with each other and what do they share through their interactions? To do that, the processes of interaction and learning were examined according to the size of threads (i.e., small, medium, and large sizes). For the individual plane, I examined (a) individuals' epistemological beliefs and (b) individuals' change of roles in relation to the degree of participation. Based on the results investigated in each plane, I discussed general characteristics of this web-based community as informal learning environment, effective features fostering interaction and learning in this web based community, and possible trajectories of the web-based community evolving for a community of practice. The importance of this study lies in its contributions to the conceptual framework (i.e., descriptive framework for communities of practice) and the methodological approach (i.e., multi-layered analytical approach) developed and applied in this thesis. The descriptive framework enables us to identify some defining features that distinguish communities of practice from other structures and hence to establish guidelines for monitoring how communities of practice evolve and what makes them evolve in successful ways. In addition, this study offers useful implications for designing and supporting web-based communities even in formal and non-formal learning environments. Because this study employed an exploratory, interpretive approach and concentrated on the breadth of learning in a web-based community through different planes, the results offer broader aspects of learning rather than specific, intensive issues of learning in this web-based community. Therefore, further studies are suggested along with the issues derived from this thesis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246w45f.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pr31f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Organizational learning.</dc:subject><dc:subject>World Wide Web -- Social aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Food service employees.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqr46r458h"><dcterms:title>The problematic of Turāth in contemporary Arab thought : a study of Adonis and Ḥasan Ḥanafï</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wardeh, Nadia.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The central theme of this study is the question of turath (cultural heritage) as perceived by contemporary Arab thinkers since the Arab defeat by Israel in 1967. The diverse understandings of turath have raised various questions with respect to it, yielding a plethora of opinions that make it difficult to come up with a common definition. This unstable view of the phenomenon has led to what may be called "the problematic of turath." This study asks whether turath has the roots of the problematic or whether it is mainly the positions on it that have led to its problematization. An attempt to explore the term reveals that the contemporary meaning assigned to turath is ideological in nature, such that it is perceived as a tool for either progress or decline. To understand how this ideologization operates, the study looks at two antithetical positions on turath: that of the Islamic-modernist, H&amp;dotbelow;asan H&amp;dotbelow;anafi (b.1935) and that of the secular-modernist, Adonis (b. 1930). Their positions are described in the light of their intellectual and ideological backgrounds, and analyzed in view of their primary texts. The study concludes that their "imagined" visions of turath reflect biased thinking, an understanding of turath that is adapted to their own ideological stance. As an Islamic phenomenologist, H&amp;dotbelow;anafi perceives Islamic revelation as a phenomenon present to consciousness, regarding it as authoritative due to its presumed "uncorrupted" character. This makes it suitable to any place and time and renders it the only legitimate source for renewal and progress. However, the fact that he feels a rereading of turath is necessary to achieve this goal reflects a paradox in his discourse, whereby the same turath becomes simultaneously the chief problem and the chief solution for Arab-Muslim society. By contrast, Adonis, as a secular deconstructionist, looks at the inherited turath as a "text" with a static/dynamic dualism, and tries to show that the static elements of turath, which always appear stable, logical and capable of achieving progress, make it otherwise. For him, divine revelation --- which is responsible for the predominance of the static and hence an obstacle to human freedom, creativity and progress --- must be deconstructed. This paves the way for his own agenda of replacing the static, i.e., religious elements, with dynamic or secular elements, which alone can enable the reconstruction of a new civilization. But in the process, Adonis may only be replacing the religious with the secular and merely setting in place a new static dimension.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w95053952.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r458h</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ḥanafī, Ḥasan.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Adūnīs, 1930-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islamic civilization.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z709122f"><dcterms:title>Second language learner speech and intelligibility : instruction and environment in a university setting</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Second Language Education</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Kennedy, Sara, 1973-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the pronunciation and intelligibility of instructed and uninstructed second language (L2) learners over time, and to identify instructional, environmental, and methodological factors playing a role in pronunciation and intelligibility. Seventeen L2 graduate students at an English-medium university recorded three personal anecdotes over five months. The students also regularly logged their exposure to and use of English. Nine of the students (instructed group) were concurrently taking an oral communication course focussing on suprasegmental pronunciation. Classroom instruction was regularly observed and recorded. All 17 students were interviewed at the end of the study. L1 listeners heard anecdotes from three instructed and three uninstructed students, matched for length of residence and first language (L1). Listeners also heard anecdotes from four L1 English speakers. One group of listeners retold each anecdote after hearing it (discourse-level task). The other group paused the recording of each anecdote whenever a word was unclear (word-level task). Each group of listeners also rated excerpts for accentedness, comprehensibility, and fluency. Results of quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that: (a) no unambiguous changes in the pronunciation or intelligibility of either L2 learner group occurred over time; (b) word-level intelligibility measures more consistently differentiated L1 and L2 groups, and the instructed and uninstructed L2 groups; (c) compared to the instructed group, the uninstructed group logged relatively more English exposure/use for academic activities and relatively less for interactive social activities; (d) many instructed L2 learners did not believe that their pronunciation had noticeably improved, but almost all expressed satisfaction with their ability to communicate in English; (e) at the end of the study, many uninstructed learners reported persistent difficulties in communicating in English. The results suggest that instruction in suprasegmental aspects of pronunciation sometimes may not lead to improved intelligibility or pronunciation. In addition, some L2 learners can be as intelligible as L1 speakers, depending on the listening task. Finally, results suggest that L2 learners' perceptions of their communicative ability and their patterns of L2 exposure/use are related. Implications for university preparation and support programs for L2 graduate students are discussed.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sx38b.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z709122f</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>English language -- Pronunciation by foreign speakers.</dc:subject><dc:subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94ht21p"><dcterms:title>Transgender : a study of quality of life</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Seidl, Helma.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This research presents a new way to improve inclusiveness for the variety of transgender self-identities in clinical settings. The spectrum of transgender identities were clustered into two groups: the fixed -- representing transgender individuals who preferred identification with the gender binary male or female, and the fluid -- representing transgender individuals that favor openness and flexibility on the gender continuum. Furthermore, different scales, the Memorial University of Newfoundland's Scale of Happiness (MUNSH) (Kozma, &amp; Stones, 1980) and Bradley's Well-Being Scale (BWB) (Bradley, 1994), Self-Confidence Scale (Oakley, 1996, 1998) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, 1994) were investigated for their reliability with transgender clients. The fixed and fluid transgender groups were then used as the key criterion for investigating differences in quality of life (QOL), self-confidence, stress and counselling satisfaction. Using combined quantitative as well as qualitative methodology, data was analyzed for a sample of 145 transgender people. Mean age was 42.27. Quality of life for the fluid transgender group was &lt;extremely low,&gt; the group difference was not significant Stress was expectedly very high in both groups, but interestingly self-confidence was also high. The mean difference between the fixed (M=17.44) and fluid (M=20.82) transgender groups was statistically significant. One in four transgender individuals identified either as &lt;neutral&gt; or &lt;dissatisfied to very dissatisfied&gt; with their counselling experience. The dissatisfaction was higher in the fluid transgender group. One hundred eleven transgender participants (111) completed seven open-ended questions and 11 participated in a semi-structured, face-to-face interview process, guided by thirteen questions. The stories of the participants demonstrated how a gender specific upbringing affects transgender individuals through: themes of shame, guilt, and anger. While, transgender individuals developed survival techniques such as daydreaming and fantasizing, negative coping methods such as alcohol abuse, drug abuse and self-harm were also common. Family was identified as the dominant factor in reinforcing gender appropriate behaviour. To improve clinical care these findings should be taken into consideration.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x478n.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht21p</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Transgender people -- Identity -- Case studies.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sh113"><dcterms:title>Federalism, public good provision and corruption : three essays in political economy</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2007</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Sengupta, Bodhisattva.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The thesis consists of three essays. In the first essay, the role of party politics in provision of public goods within a federal economy is analyzed. The public goods, which have inter-jurisdictional spillover effect, are locally produced with federal transfers and local revenues. The federal government can not commit to the level of transfers. The direction and magnitude of federal fund flows are influenced by local revenues as well as the re-election probability of the parties in power at the federal and provincial levels. Under such a scenario, politically motivated grants alter the incentive for raising local revenues. If votes swing heavily in favor of either the incumbent or the challenger in the provincial elections and/or if the coefficients for absolute prudence from the utility of public good are low enough, then grants are designed in such a way that the incentive for increasing revenues is lower in the province where the party identity is similar with the federal government. If these conditions are not met, such incentive is higher in the politically favorite regime. This result is generalized over different combinations of ruling parties in different seats of government. In the second essay, the issue of dynamic public good provision within a federation is analyzed. Provinces lobby for more federal funds to produce a pure, dynamic public good such as an improvement in environmental quality. Allocation of federal funds is dictated by the level of lobbying. Consumers' welfare equals utility from the public good, net of lobbying cost. For symmetric provinces, the steady state lobbying level and stock of public good may be greater in the case when lobbyists are non-benevolent and captures a part of the federal grant as private rent. Second, with a rent-appropriating lobbyist, the welfare of the consumers may be higher under non-cooperative lobbying protocol. In case of asymmetric provinces, welfare may 'flow' from the less efficient province to the more efficient province, violating equalization principle within a federation. In the third essay, the disciplinary role of elections is discussed. The incumbent politician in a province, with locally procured taxes, provides a local public good and appropriates some private rent. The incumbent's reputation decreases with the amount of rent. Voters may judge the performance of the incumbent in two ways: either his absolute performance matters or his performance is compared with that of the neighboring provinces' incumbent through yardstick competition. In a static setting, the unitary evaluation fares better than relative evaluation in restraining the politician. However, in a dynamic setting, when the stock of reputation increases through time, a relative evaluation imposes higher discipline on incumbent politician.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2042584.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sh113</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Federal government.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public goods.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah415pf142"><dcterms:title>Factors potentially influencing student acceptance of biological evolution</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wiles, Jason R.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This investigation explored scientific, religious, and otherwise nonscientific factors that may influence student acceptance of biological evolution and related concepts, how students perceived these factors to have influenced their levels of acceptance of evolution and changes therein, and what patterns arose among students' articulations of how their levels of acceptance of evolution may have changed. This exploration also measured the extent to which students' levels of acceptance changed following a treatment designed to address factors identified as potentially affecting student acceptance of evolution. Acceptance of evolution was measured using the MATE instrument (Rutledge and Warden, 1999; Rutledge and Sadler, 2007) among participants enrolled in a secondary-level academic program during the summer prior to their final year of high school and as they transitioned to the post-secondary level. Student acceptance of evolution was measured to be significantly higher than pre-treatment levels both immediately following and slightly over one year after treatment. Qualitative data from informal questionnaires, from formal course evaluations, and from semi-structured interviews of students engaged in secondary level education and former students at various stages of post-secondary education confirmed that the suspected factors were perceived by participants to have influenced their levels of acceptance of evolution. Furthermore, participant reports provided insight regarding the relative effects they perceived these factors to have had on their evolution acceptance levels. Additionally, many participants reported that their science teachers in public schools had avoided, omitted, or denigrated evolution during instruction, and several of these students expressed frustration regarding what they perceived to have been a lack of education of an important scientific principle. Finally, no students expressed feelings of being offended by having been taught about evolutionary science, and the overwhelming majority of the participants expressed enjoyment of the course and appreciation for having been taught about evolution.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892f51g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pf142</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>High school students -- Arkansas -- Attitudes.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Creationism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evolution (Biology) -- Religious aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evolution (Biology)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A1544bs918"><dcterms:title>Economic policies in developing and emerging market economies : three essays in international and development economics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Wang, Shengzu, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis consists of three essays, which focus on different aspects of economic policy issues faced by developing and emerging market economies. The first essay explores the effect of monetary policy credibility on exchange rate volatility in a small open economy, even if the exchange rate is not an explicit target set by the monetary authority. Using an open economy framework modified from Gall and Monacelli (2005) and Walsh (2006), it shows that monetary policy credibility helps to stabilize the exchange rate as supply and demand side shocks hit the domestic economy. The monetary policy credibility can be achieved by the monetary authority's commitment to certain rules aiming for output/price smoothing. In the empirical analysis inflation targeting is used as a proxy variable for monetary credibility. The GARCH model of selected South-East Asian countries indicates that countries with inflation targeting policies have exhibited reduced exchange rate volatility when other factors are controlled. The second essay looks at FDI inflows into developing economies. Two distinctive differences of FDI inflows between developed and developing economies are entry modes and evidence of government regulations. This essay investigates the incentives of FDI flows in terms of cost-saving merger, fixed cost of entry and the role of government policies. In particular it shows that, if the cost-saving effect is large and the government intervenes, the foreign firm will consider the FDI through either Greenfield or Brownfield, which corresponds to the situation for FDI flows into developing economies. Otherwise, the foreign firm will only consider Brownfield or staying outside, which stands for the developed economy case. Since one remarkable feature of the FDI flows into developing countries is the benefit of cost-saving from low labour costs, this essay takes this effect into account and provides insights for economic "outsourcing". The multi-stage sequential game model presented in this chapter provides comparable results for the pattern of the FDI flows affected by regulation and institutional factors, which are not addressed by existing literature. Finally, it reveals some intuition and feature of a developing economy where the government regulations on FDI flows are more often observed. The third essay deals with the resource/revenue reallocation within powerful groups in the economy and the impact of the rent-seeking behavior of these groups on the economic growth and the social welfare. In particular, it introduces a dynamic model of resource-grabbing by status-conscious agents, i.e., agents value not only their absolute consumption levels, but also the relative status within his/her reference group. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of the "positional externalities" on the urge to seek rent and to connect the "tragedy of the commons" problem with relative consumption. The model shows that the greater is agents' concern about their relative status, the more aggressively they tend to behave. Consequently, the social welfare is lower because the growth rate of the public asset is reduced due to higher extraction rate. After introducing heterogeneity, it shows that the social welfare decreases as the distribution of status-consciousness among agents widens. Finally, it provides some policy suggestions that the government might consider to achieve a second best social outcome.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xj36z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bs918</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economic development.</dc:subject><dc:subject>International economic relations.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Development economics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Developing countries -- Economic conditions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Avh53x032r"><dcterms:title>Explaining the earnings disadvantage of visible minority immigrants in Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Yoshida, Yoko, 1974-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is manuscript-based. It contains an introduction, a literature review, a conclusion along with the four research papers that constitute its core. The four substantive papers reexamine the sources of earnings differences by race and immigration status in Canada. I address two major methodological issues in the relevant literature: the measurement of experience and the modeling of the relations between the factors known to influence earnings. Data from Statistics Canada's Workplace and Employee Survey (WES) was analyzed. The first two papers examine biases in the estimates of wage disparities due to error in the measurement of experience. They do so using two conventional estimation techniques: ordinary least squares (OLS) with dummy variables, and the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition. The third and fourth papers explore deficiencies in OLS-based modeling techniques. The third paper does so by separately analyzing the relationships between racial and immigrant group statuses and access to job-related training, and then the relationship between statuses and training, on one hand, and earnings on the other. The final paper uses structural equation modeling to further examine the relationship between group status and earnings, this time explicitly incorporating the mediating effects of job types, and job-related training. The papers reveal that inadequate measurement of work experience results in overestimates of the wage disadvantage of visible minority immigrants. Furthermore, some of the wage disadvantage of this group stems from limited access to job-related training.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193d435.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53x032r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Employees -- Training of.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Immigrants -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wages -- Effect of education on -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Minorities -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Wages -- Minorities.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9s161974n"><dcterms:title>Liberté, responsabilité et utilité : la bonne foi comme instrument de justice contractuelle</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Grégoire, Marie Annik, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis outlines the guiding principles of obligations law in Quebec, more particularly its contractual component. We are trying to establish a model of analysis that will seek to define and legitimize the precepts of justice that should guide judicial intervention in contractual relationships. As part of this study, we identify certain principles that are fundamental in the theory of contract: notably, commutative justice, contract commutability, subjective rights and legitimate interests. We establish the relationship between each of these basic concepts to conclude that to be consistent with the principles of commutative justice, contract commutability shall not be based on a monetary equivalent of benefits but on the respect of a standard based on peaceful coexistence of rights and interests. It consists therefore of a normalization of contractual relations which ceases to be purely subjective. This finding leads to several inferences: the addition of the circumstances of the execution and termination of the contract, rather than simply its creation, to the possibilities of judicial review, a better legitimization of such review and the recognition of the principle of good faith as a privileged instrument for a fairer contractual commutability. Moreover, the last part of our thesis is devoted to examining judicial practice interventions based on good faith in order to illustrate the principles expressed in the study.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537445z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161974n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Contracts -- Québec (Province)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Obligations (Law) -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Good faith (Law) -- Québec (Province).</dc:subject><dc:subject>Law -- Philosophy.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Afn107263r"><dcterms:title>Advance promotions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Desautels Faculty of Management</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Legoux, Renaud.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis examines how consumers value promotions for delayed consumption depending on the time of redemption, the types of benefits offered, and the scope of the offering. The specific focus is on promotions that are redeemed in the future at the time of consumption, which we label "advance promotions". In the first essay, results from three studies demonstrate that consumers value hedonic advance promotions differently from delayed consumption of stand-alone goods or delayed incentives (rebates). Hedonic advance promotions are consistently overvalued, unless they are incongruent with consumers' consumption goals (e.g., when consumers regulate their consumption of the hedonic benefits). In contrast, advance utilitarian promotions are overvalued only when they are congruent with the consumption context of the target product (e.g., when the target consumption is also utilitarian). In general, we find that valuation of future utilitarian promotions depends on the consumption context but valuation of future hedonic promotions depends on when the target product is consumed. These findings are explained by the focalism bias that was originally suggested by affective forecasting and Construal Level Theory and are further expanded in this dissertation. The second essay explores the shape of the value function for hedonic advance promotions. It addresses the issue of what is the optimal depth of a promotion in an advance consumption setting. Drawing from the focalism framework presented in the first essay and on recent research on the valuation of hedonic goods, we argue that the shape of the function is more convex or step-like for advance promotions than for immediate ones. We then demonstrate that this finding has implications for the common variety-seeking behaviour that is generally associated with delayed consumption.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rz07z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107263r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Consumer behavior.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pre-selling.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sales promotion.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sh12c"><dcterms:title>Essays in the international economics of credit and banking</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Gebregiorgis, Bekele Sinkie.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This dissertation is entitled "Essays in the International Economics of Credit and Banking". It comprises three essays. The first essay develops an empirical model of international credit with moral hazard and the risk of repudiation to examine (i) the determinants of the intertemporal and cross-national variations in credit ceilings and (ii) the channels through which output attracts foreign credit. It reports that productivity is the most important variable in attracting credit, followed by education, and then physical capital. Furthermore, international trade, country financial risk ratings, and geography explain more than 60% of the cross-national variations in credit ceiling. Therefore, international relations and investment in education and productivity-enhancing institutions are crucial in attracting foreign credit. The second essay develops open-economy variants of the old Friedman-Schwartz and the new Lucas-Sargent-Wallace monetarist models to investigate the puzzle of monetary neutrality. The essay further introduces financial aggregation theories into the models. It studies the theoretical and business-cycle relationships between real output and financial aggregates, interest rates, exchange rate, and prices using Canadian quarterly data for the period 1959: 1 to 2002: 1. It reports that the open-economy variants of the monetarist models with aggregation-theoretic financial aggregates perform the best in producing significant sign patterns that are predicted by theory. Furthermore, Monte Carlo experiments show that large percentage of real output variance is explained by shocks to aggregation-theoretic financial aggregates relative to other variables. Thus, there is no difference between the effects of anticipated and unanticipated monetary shocks. The third essay examines the appropriate formulation of the monetary aggregate for the Nigerian economy for the period 1970:1-2000:4 for the determination of real output. This examination covers simple sum, variable elasticity of substitution (ves), and divisia (dv) aggregation over currency, demand deposits, and savings deposits. The user cost of liquid assets is employed in the construction of both the dv and the yes aggregates. Using maximum likelihood estimation technique, the essay reports that, for the Nigerian economy, currency does as well as or better than any narrow- or broad-money measure in explaining industrial production. Further, the simple sum m1 and m2 outperformed both the yes and dv aggregates. Therefore, monetary policy in Nigeria should focus on the supply of currency and/or of narrow money, rather than on broad money or the divisia aggregates.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vm498.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sh12c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Monetary policy.</dc:subject><dc:subject>International finance.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Credit.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aft848v019"><dcterms:title>La révelation inachevée : le personnage à l'épreuve de la vérité romanesque</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Roy, Yannick, 1971-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Long suspected of being frivolous, of cultivating bad taste and of encouraging its reader's chimerical daydreams, the novel, at least after Cervantes, curiously turned against itself in the name of the reality it was once accused of fleeing. In doing so, it changed radically, of course, since it separated itself from the old idealistic romances which it now named as its enemies; but it also remained, more discreetly perhaps, faithful to its origins, i.e. to the lies and illusions whose profound and secret necessity novelists have never ceased to reaffirm. This dissertation is a meditation on the paradoxical foundation of the novel, which can be defined according to the classical theories of Rene Girard and Mikhail Bakhtin. The former, by assigning the novelist the task of revealing the "novelistic truth", insists on the critical function of the novel, and on the decisiveness of the change brought about by Cervantes; Bakhtin, by placing the character rather than the author at the heart of his reflexion, and by making dialogical "openness" to this character a positive value, subtly defends the necessity of the "romantic lie". Girard and Bakhtin are both right, as the examples of the three novelists whose "poetics" are analyzed here in light of this paradox illustrate. Paul Valery, though not a novelist in the usual sense, is the creator of Mr Teste, a strange character who lives in perfect conformity with the requirements of the "novelistic truth", but whose life is inconceivable, which makes him a comic figure. Flaubert, enclosing himself in a kind of quiet lucidity, keeps his characters at a distance but still shows a sort of subtle sympathy for them. Finally Balzac, whose posture at first seems more romantic, is no less quiet and distant than Flaubert, albeit in a more discreet way. These reading exercises, together with theoretical considerations inspired by Bergson's definition of the comic and Kundera's metaphoric definition of the novelist's work as the exploration of being, lead to the idea that the novel is subjected to contradictory requirements between which it does not propose a synthesis, except that of humour -- which is not truly one.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v198m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848v019</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Fiction -- History and criticism.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Characters and characteristics in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aks65hg59n"><dcterms:title>Stepfamilies in Canada : numbers, characteristics, stability and childbearing</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Sociology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martin, Valerie, 1975 July 31-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The following thesis examines stepfamilies in Canada within a socio-demographic framework, using the 2001 General Social Survey (GSS) on families, and is divided into three main sections. First, there is an extended literature review on family theory and the emergence of stepfamilies. This section provides the background for a discussion of why stepfamilies are still often perceived as problematic and, therefore, stigmatized; we also define different stepfamily forms. The question of how to measure stepfamilies is a major concern in this research. Indeed, depending on whether one takes a residential or an inter-residential perspective, the number of households involved in stepfamily life changes substantially. We first present a cross-sectional perspective by describing the stepfamilies examined at survey. The main focus here is to compare stepfamilies with intact and lone parent families in order to see the extent and nature of the differences between them. Our results suggest that stepfamilies do not differ as much as expected from intact families with regard to certain socioeconomic variables, such as income. The next stage involves an analysis of stepfamilies in a longitudinal perspective in order to better understand stepfamily dynamics. In doing so, we focus on stepfamily instability and the likelihood of having a common child, applying the method of event history analysis. In this longitudinal perspective, we find that stepfamilies face a high risk of experiencing a separation and that this risk increases substantially over time; we also find that stepfamily couples living in a common-law union have a higher risk of separation than those who are married. The arrival of a common child within a stepfamily appears to be determined mainly by the age of the mother and of existing children. The younger the mother and the younger the children, the more likely a stepfamily is to witness the arrival of a common child. The most compelling finding of this research lies in the differences observed in the outcomes of male and female respondents with regard to their stepfamily dynamics.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z164j.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hg59n</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Stepfamilies -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A2801pk77b"><dcterms:title>Rameau and Rousseau : harmony and history in the age of reason</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Schulich School of Music</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Martin, Nathan, 1978-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Rousseau's articles on music for Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopedie , and to a lesser extent his Dictionnaire de musique, have rarely attracted the scholarly attention they deserve.

Far from being a quarrel over musical aesthetics, Rousseau's dispute with Rameau raised fundamental questions about the composer's theory of harmony. Rousseau interrogated the empirical adequacy of Rameau's theory, the soundness of its foundations, the logic of its derivation, and its pretension to universality. Over the course of his criticism, Rousseau came to regard tonal harmony as a historically-induced particularity of Western music to be explained through historical inquiry. In this respect, he anticipates a range of ideas that historians of music theory have associated far more readily with Francois-Joseph Fetis.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b6969.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pk77b</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Rameau, Jean-Philippe, 1683-1764.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Harmony.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, 1712-1778.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acf95jf680"><dcterms:title>Students' perceptions of the important outcomes of inquiry-based teaching and learning</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Saunders-Stewart, Katie Suzanne.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study explored outcomes of inquiry-based teaching and learning as perceived by students, and which they felt were the most important or salient. Participants were 6 teachers and their 181 students in classes categorized as least, middle, and most with respect to degrees of using inquiry. Information from teacher interviews was used to place classes in these groups. A student questionnaire, constructed using a criterion-referenced list of potential inquiry outcomes from a literature search, assessed the extent to which they experienced these outcomes in their classes. Principal Components Analysis yielded four components from the 32 items. A MANOVA then used these components as dependent variables, with inquiry level as the independent variable. The most inquiry group significantly more strongly endorsed Component 1--learning competencies, including several inquiry-related outcomes. On Component 2-personal motivation, most inquiry students responded more favorably than middle inquiry. The most inquiry group more highly endorsed items addressing increased responsibility for their learning (Component 3), and the least inquiry group rated more highly items that were related to traditional teacher and student roles (Component 4) such as memorization of information; the middle inquiry group highly endorsed items combining both of these components. Inquiry provides optimal conditions for students to achieve outcomes less likely to be found in a more traditional classroom. Students' responses regarding cognitive, social, and emotional benefits of the most inquiry-oriented classes affirmed that, consistent with social constructivist theory, unique outcomes are achieved through inquiry more frequently and more effectively than through other forms of instruction.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nz17g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jf680</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Inquiry-based learning.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A6108vf923"><dcterms:title>Ecclesiastical politics during the Iconoclastic controversy (726-843) : the impact of Eusebian &amp;quot;Imperial Theology&amp;quot; on the justification of imperial policies</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Faculty of Religious Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bas, Bilal.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>As a debate over the legitimacy of the liturgical use of images, the Byzantine Iconoclastic controversy (ca. 726-843) had important political and theological implications, which modern scholarship generally tends to treat unconnectedly. The primary object of this study is to explicate the relationship between the political and theological dimensions of the controversy and to reconstruct the debate over images in a comprehensive approach that accounts for both its political and theological dimensions. The main argument of the thesis is that the question of images was a politico-theological problem and the prospects of 'political expediency' and 'theological propriety' were correlated in the minds of both the Iconoclastic reformers and their Iconodule rivals. Indeed, it was through their respective soteriologies that the two parties gave meaning to the theological and political dimensions of the debate in relationship with their respective theological first principles. Therefore, the Iconoclastic debate is explained as a soteriological dispute where the worldview represented by the traditional Byzantine religio-political ideology and the worldview represented by the proponents of images were set over against each other. The main contribution of our thesis to modern scholarship of the Byzantine Iconoclastic controversy is to reconstruct the debate in the light of the contending theological paradigms of the two parties, which shaped not only their attitudes towards images but also their political stands in relation to the Byzantine Empire's involvement in ecclesiastical politics. This new synthetic reading explains the debate in reference to two essential theological cornerstones of the Byzantine tradition---the Eusebian "Imperial Theology" and the Christological definition of the council of Chalcedon---both taken as key reference points, against which the political and doctrinal stands of both parties were constructed and interpreted.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc08d.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vf923</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Eusebius, of Caesarea, Bishop of Caesarea, ca. 260-ca. 340.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Religion and state -- Byzantine Empire.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Iconoclasm.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Idols and images -- Worship.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Byzantine Empire -- Religion.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A8c97kt900"><dcterms:title>Le drôle de roman : rire et imaginaire dans les oeuvres de Marcel Aymé, Albert Cohen et Raymond Queneau</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bélisle, Mathieu.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The drole de roman gathers works by Marcel Ayme, Albert Cohen and Raymond Queneau, French novelists who belong to the same generation, share common readers and inspiration and, most of all, a specific vision: the nonserious. Their novels draw from the most obvious manifestations of the comical tradition (farce, burlesque) to its most subtle (irony, parody). In their works, laughter does not occupy a secondary position nor does it simply provide some reading impressions. In fact, laughter is often expressed by the characters and narrators themselves, whose sense of mischeviousness demonstrates the Rabelaisian joy of body and soul. Besides, the drole is not restricted to its usual comical characteristics. In the prospect of literary history, it also refers to what stands apart from the realistic conventions inherited from Balzac and Zola. In other words, the drole is made of antirealism, merveilleux and fantasy. Thus, Ayme, Cohen and Queneau put forward their own response to the mimetic function of the 19th century realistic novel. Instead of renouncing the power of fiction, as Gide and Valery will often suggest, instead of denouncing its falseness, the three novelists give fiction even greater powers. Based on the conclusions of the history of the novel and on studies concerning various aspects of its construction (the relation between reality and fiction, the conception of character and of its place in the community, the forms of the plot), this thesis wishes to shed light on the role and value of laughter through the study of three major themes: comedy, community and enchantment.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n202s.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kt900</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Laughter in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Aymé, Marcel, 1902-1967 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cohen, Albert, 1895-1981 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Queneau, Raymond, 1903-1976 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Anz806358g"><dcterms:title>La voix et l'os : poétiques du dépouillement chez Saint-Denys Garneau et Samuel Beckett</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>fre</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Département de langue et littérature françaises</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bernier, Frédérique, 1973 Apr. 11-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the poetics of impoverishment as found in the works of Saint-Denys Garneau and Samuel Beckett. It seeks to shed light on the reactivation of a Christian ascetic heritage within modern writing forms (poetic and narrative) and also, more specifically, to develop a novel analysis of these works from the perspective of their points of overlap. This thesis presents analysis of the relationships between voice and body (part I), of the doppelganger and self-generation figures (part II), of prayer, desert and image motifs (part III) throughout the totality of both corpuses. The comparative reading of the works of Beckett and Garneau highlights the complex relationship they entertain with certain Christian schemes (incarnation, sin, asceticism, kenosis) which they put into play on a properly literary level. This investigation also reveals that, within both works, these Christian schemes echo the aesthetic concerns of modernity (auto-foundation of the subject, authenticity, autonomy and purification of forms). </dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161975x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806358g</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Beckett, Samuel, 1906-1989 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Poverty in literature.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Garneau, Saint-Denys, 1912-1943 -- Criticism and interpretation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ascetics in literature.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adv13zx76d"><dcterms:title>Towards a model of Da'wah in contemporary societies : the case of Shaykh Muhammad Al-Ghazālī (1917-1996)</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Islamic Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Bensaid, Benaouda.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis is an inquiry into Muḥammad al-Ghazali's (1917-1996) model of da'wah. It uses Ghazali works as well those of his critics to build up a coherent model of da'wah for contemporary societies. The research first delves into Ghazali's life, learning, and career. It examines his association with the Muslim Brotherhood as well as his intellectual and professional contributions to da'wah and society. This examination provides us with a better understanding of the socio-cultural and intellectual background of Ghazali. The research also explores Ghazali's personality in order to find out the reasons underlying his harsh language or simply the stylistic problems that earned him much criticism. This examination shows that Ghazali was a traditional scholar who profoundly understood the dynamics and implications and of the Islamic development, with a modern approach to the question of religion and society. More importantly, it demonstrates his critical sense, in light of his reviews of contemporary of da'wah . This study also examines Ghazali's conceptual framework of da'wah. This highlights his understanding of major concepts, definitions and characteristics including da'wah in the Quran and the models of da'wah as illustrated by prophets. It also addresses some essential questions, such as innate human nature, People of the Interval ('Ahl al-Fatrah) and the universality of da'wah. It provides a closer look at the effects of society, culture and freedom on da'wah, and demonstrates Ghazali's perspective on the requirements for undertaking modern da'wah. This section provides us with a clear understanding of how Ghazali understood da'wah in light of revelation and with a serious consideration of the socio-cultural, economic and political context of Muslim societies. The above framework led Ghazali to the catalyst of da'wah, the da'i. In light of his conceptual framework of da'wah, Ghazali addresses the various spiritual, moral and educational requirements of da'is . This is made in reference to his ambitious search to quickly and comprehensively fill the serious gap between Muslim life and Islamic ideals, which caused him to produce an ideal image of da'wah. This was not easily achievable, given the many problems and deficiencies affecting contemporary Islamic learning, society and culture, which Ghazali repeatedly raised throughout his analysis. In his discussion of da'wah and da'is, Ghazali used a highly vigorous and critical approach, one that unfortunately employed harsh tones and sometimes demeaning language in his extensive discussion of da'is' undertakings and contributions. This research also considers Ghazali's methodology, including the da'is' approach to da'wah and, most importantly, his fiqh al-da'wah (legal methodology of da'wah), where he attempt to rebuild the priorities of contemporary da'wah in light of his own understanding of the best interest of da'wah (maṣlaḥat al-da'wah). Often, Ghazali justifies his criticism of legal interpretations about da'wah based on the maṣlaḥa or his re-interpretation of religious texts, yet does not provide or elaborate a systematic methodology or even clear criteria, which would assure consistency and uniformity in his approach towards the problems and challenges of da'wah. At the core of his discussion of the legal methodology of da'wah, Ghazali consistently showed a concern about the opinions of Westerners and the question of what could yield a positive impression of Islam. The various studies of Salafi scholars and da'is have intensely criticized his works as too general, literary, speculative and even destructive for the healthy development of Muslims. In contrast, his contribution was and still is viewed as strongly positive and authoritative by a considerably large number of Muslim scholars, da'is and Muslim activists. His ideas are continually drawn upon whenever modern da'wah and the relationship between East and West in particular are discussed. It is very likely that his contributions will gain increasing intellectual and academic attention, most precisely when developing a new modern model for da'wah in Muslim societies, when trying to analyze and solve the problems and challenges of Muslim societies, or when striving to present Islam and Muslims to the Western world.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429d922.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zx76d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ghazālī, Muḥammad, 1917-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Daʻwah (Islam)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Islam -- Missions.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9g54xn09d"><dcterms:title>New teachers' experiences of their first year of teaching : entering a community of practice</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2008</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Educational Studies</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Small, Lauren E.

Using a theoretical framework of phenomenological and narrative research, social learning theory, and alternative representations of research, the research design consisted of in-depth and focus group interviews and the creation of collage. Communities of practice research (notably the work of Lave and Wenger) was used as a lens to explore the experiences of first year teachers. Data were analyzed and described using the constant-comparative method. In addition, participants' profiles were reconstructed in the participants' own words using Seidman's (2006) method. Research is needed to assist administrators and experienced educators to understand and support the efforts of their newest colleagues. Attracting, nurturing and keeping our best teachers are goals that are essential to providing quality educational services to our students. As such, this research will have implications for universities, school boards and in-school administrators, teachers' unions, and others who are interested in supporting new teachers in effective and efficient manners.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rh906.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xn09d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Education, Administration.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Education, Teacher Training.</dc:subject></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
