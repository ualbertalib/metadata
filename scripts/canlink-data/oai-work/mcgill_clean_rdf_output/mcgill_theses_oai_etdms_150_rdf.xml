To study the possible role of the lymph node stroma in regulating the growth of breast cancer cells, rat peripheral lymph node stromal cells (STC) were isolated and their interaction with rat and human breast carcinoma cells was investigated. Initially we found that media conditioned by STC was mitogenic for human and rat breast cancer cells and this effect could be enhanced in the presence of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and type IV collagen, or through stromal-tumor cell contact. Several morphologically distinct clonal sublines of STC were then obtained for further analysis. Using a combination of RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis, immunochemistry and functional assays, two functional subpopulations were subsequently identified; one producing predominantly hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the other insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Monoclonal antibodies generated to these cells indicated that these subpopulations were also antigenically distinct. The results suggest that carcinoma cell growth in regional nodes may be regulated through the cooperative activities of distinct STC populations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Brodt, P.

The fact that this effect could only be seen at such high concentrations indicated that insulin might be acting via the IGF-1 receptor, which it may bind at highly elevated concentrations, but with much less affinity. We now show that IGF-1 can effectively inhibit HIV-1 replication in chronically infected U937 cells at concentrations similar to normal physiological concentrations. We have demonstrated that this inhibitory effect may be abrogated by the presence of anti-alpha-IR3 and anti-IGF-1 antibodies, directed towards the IGF-1 receptor and the IGF-1 protein, respectively. With the use of HIV-LTR-CAT and pSV-tat plasmids in a COS-7 system, we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of IGF-1 occurs at the level of transcription. Finally we also show in a human U38 target cell line stably transfected with HIV-LTR-CAT, that IGF-1 maintains its inhibitory effect, although to a lesser degree than that in the COS-7 system. Lastly, it is shown that TNF-$ alpha$ acts to augment transcription of the HIV-LTR and is able to over-shadow the inhibitory effects of IGF-1 on transcription.

Chloroquine has been very effective in treatment of this disease, however the emergence of chloroquine-resistant strains in most geographical regions where malaria is endemic has made difficult the control of malaria. In addition, resistance to other antimalarials has been observed in these regions. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in P. falciparum. We have selected in vitro a P. falciparum strain resistant to actinomycin D from a parental drug sensitive clone, 3D7. Interestingly, we found that the actinomycin D resistant clone is less sensitive to chloroquine and mefloquine (antimalarial drugs) and rhodamine123. Comparison between parental 3D7 and resistant P. falciparum did not show differences in the copy number or level of expression of pfmdr1 previously implicated in chloroquine or mefloquine resistance. Furthermore, to identify if other P-glycoprotein homologues are involved in resistance, we used oligonucleotide primers to conserved sequences in ABC domains. An ABC protein, a homologue to the subunit 4, of the 26S proteasome complex has been cloned. To determine if this gene was involved in resistance to actinomycin D, a Northern blot was done. Surprisingly it was found a decreased in the expression of this gene in the resistant cell line, 3D7R/actD2, in comparison with its parental cell line, 3D7. Studies are in progress to determine the role of the PFS4 subunit in the resistance phenotype of 3D7R/actD2.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Georges, Elias (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g215w.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fk05j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Malaria.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Plasmodium falciparum.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drug resistance in microorganisms.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Acr56n3136"><dcterms:title>Ethics and pediatric critical care : a conception of a 'thick' bioethics</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Division of Experimental Medicine</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Carnevale, Franco A.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Within this thesis, I argue for an interpretive approach to bioethics in pediatric intensive care.

The widespread use of public-key cryptography requires a public-key infrastructure to publish and manage public-key values. Without a functioning infrastructure, public-key cryptography is only marginally more useful than traditional, secret-key cryptography. This thesis presents a set of characteristics that are common to all public-key infrastructures. These criteria are intended to encapsulate the fundamental issues that arise when dealing with such systems. They can be used both as a "shopping list" for those who need to choose an infrastructure for a particular application, and as a guide for infrastructure developers, that they may be more aware of any compromises or tradeoffs they might make in their work. The characteristics are used to present a survey of current and some proposed infrastructure systems. The criteria reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each system, and indicate where improvements may be required. The characteristics presented here are intended to enhance rather than restrict development in the field. This is not necessarily an exhaustive list, and it is the author's intention to revise these criteria as new ideas emerge.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Avis, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c2553.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q638</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Computer Science.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A0z708z811"><dcterms:title>The influence of neighborhood density on phonetic categorization in aphasia /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boyczuk, Jeffrey P.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The present study was designed to examine the contribution of lexically-based sources of information to acoustic-phonetic processing in fluent and nonfluent aphasic subjects, and age-matched normals. To this end, two phonetic identification experiments were conducted which required subjects to label syllable-initial bilabial stop consonants as either /b/ or /p/. Factors that were controlled included the lexical status (word/nonword) and neighborhood density values corresponding to the two possible syllable interpretations in each set of stimuli. Findings indicated that all subject groups were influenced by both lexical status and neighborhood density in making phonetic categorizations. Although the overall results were inconsistent with the theory that nonfluent aphasics may utilize heuristic strategies in language processing more than fluent aphasics or normals, neighborhood influences seemed to be stronger for both groups of aphasics relative to control subjects. Findings regarding the time course of lexical and neighborhood effects suggested that these influences were co-occurring in phonetic identification. Results are discussed with respect to models of word recognition and theories of acoustic-phonetic perception and lexical access in normal and aphasic populations.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Baum, Shari (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h6471.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z811</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ad504rn27f"><dcterms:title>Interferon-beta is a potent promoter of nerve growth factor production by astrocytes</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boutros, Tarek.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Recent clinical evidence has suggested that interferon-$ beta$ is efficacious in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease that is thought to be immune mediated.

In the latter context, astrocytes are known to provide trophic support to oligodendrocytes and neurons. Since nerve growth factor (NGF) is reported to cause adult porcine oligodendrocytes to proliferate and extend processes and since these phenotypes can impact favourably on remyelination, we have examined the possibility that interferon-$ beta$ could increase the astrocyte production of NGF.

Currently, the main thrust of development in radiosurgery is aimed at conformal dose delivery to irregular intracranial targets. This thesis deals with theoretical and practical aspects of the use of static, non-coplanar, conformal fields in radiosurgery. For a typical radiosurgical case involving an irregular target, a comparison was made between treatment plans using the dynamic technique with one and two isocenters and a treatment plan using 7 fixed, non-coplanar, irregularly shaped beams. The static conformal fields plan achieved a target-dose conformation similar to the 2-isocenter dynamic plan, treating 2 to 3 times less healthy tissue to intermediate and high doses that did the 1-isocenter dynamic plan, while delivering a much more uniform dose to the target volume. A comparison was also made between treatment plans using a varying number of static conformal fields. While the degree of tissue sparing and target-dose homogeneity were both shown to increase with the number of static fields, this increase was found to become smaller and smaller as the number of fields was successively raised from 5 to 7, from 7 to 9 and, ultimately, from 9 to 11. A conclusion is reached that a number of fields between 7 and 9 represents a reasonable compromise between the degree of tissue sparing and target-dose homogeneity achieved, and the ease with which the radiosurgical procedure is planned and delivered.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Podgorsak, Ervin B.

It addresses the technical aspects of their preparation and application, and examines whether FISH using these probes is a valuable tool for detection of aberrations in the terminal regions of chromosomes. A set of telomere specific probes was generated from half yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) and cosmid clones by DNA preparation via Alu-PCR, alkaline lysis, cesium chloride-ethidium bromide centrifugation, or using a "Qiagen" kit. Probe quality and optimal FISH conditions were established by hybridizing half-YACs specific to telomeres 21q, 18q, 10p, and cosmids for telomeres 2q/8p, 13q, 14q and 20p to normal metaphases. Probes for 10p, 13q, 14q, 18q and 21q yielded clear and specific hybridization signals, present in over 90% of metaphases analyzed. Interphase analysis using the probes was not accurate. The ability of the telomeric probes to characterize balanced and unbalanced abnormalities was established by hybridization to patients with previously diagnosed chromosomal aberrations. The probes identified and confirmed partial trisomies 21q, 18q, and balanced translocations t(8;14), t(6;14), t(8;18), t(5;10). In three of the cases, partial monosomy 18q, translocation t(10;13), and t(1;10), the probes were able to provide information which was not revealed by banding analysis. This study demonstrates the ability of telomere specific probes to characterize aberrations in the terminal regions of chromosomes, and concludes that FISH using the telomeric probes is a valuable tool for clinical cytogenetics.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Eydoux, P.

CO$ sb2$ fixation and emission fluxes were estimated from NEE measurements and were compared within and among the peatland communities. Communities that supported shrubby, xerophytic vegetation fixed CO$ sb2$ at rates that ranged from, on average, 0.194 to 0.365 mg CO$ sb2$ m$ sp{-2}$ s$ sp{-1}$. These rates did not vary significantly on a daily to weekly timescale, and were comparable in magnitude to the wetter, sedge-dominated communities. CO$ sb2$ emissions varied within and among communities across the sampling season. Rates were, on average, from 0.0568 to 0.109 mg CO$ sb2$ m$ sp{-2}$ s$ sp{-1}$, and the variation was associated with differences in ground temperature and water table. Comparisons of CO$ sb2$ emissions from clipped and unclipped plots allowed an estimation of the contribution of vascular respiration to total CO$ sb2$ emissions. Contributions ranged from 25 to over 80%, depending on the community and season that the measurements were taken. Strong associations between vascular respiration and ground temperature were observed. Daily NEE had little variability between communities and throughout the sampling season. This was attributed to parallel variations for the CO$ sb2$ fixation and emission fluxes. Researchers should quantify the actual fluxes for vascular root respiration, as it possibly controlled a large part of the NEE variability within and between sites.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Roulet, N.

However, X-ray mammography cannot provide a positive diagnosis for cancer. A novel, dedicated breast imaging modality has been developed based on the principles of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) system is a sensitive, high resolution ($ sp sim2$ mm) breast scanner. PEM detects increased cell metabolism (indicating the presence of cancer) by imaging the distribution of tumour-specific metabolic radiotracers. The accurate co-registration of metabolic and X-ray breast images is important for localizing and characterizing suspicious lesions. Traditionally, registration between different imaging modalities has been difficult. PEM simplifies the image registration process by acquiring an X-ray image and a metabolic image consecutively, without moving the breast between scans. The PEM detectors are integrated into a conventional mammography unit and a co-registration tool has been developed. By providing metabolic information about a suspicious breast lesion, the number of invasive biopsy procedures (currently used to diagnose breast cancer) can be reduced.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Thompson, C.

The most severe effects were noted in the group that received a vitamin E deficient diet from day 10 until 21 through the mother and then fed a vitamin E deficient diet until day 48. In this group, spermatogenesis was incomplete since late spermatids from steps 9-19 were rarely encountered in all tubules. Many steps 7-8 spermatids were seriously affected and showed a large vacuolation in their nucleus, disrupted acrosome and patchy dense granular cytoplasm suggesting cell degeneration. In the epididymis, principal cells along the entire duct appeared undifferentiated. In other groups of animals that received a vitamin E deficient diet until day 48 and then fed a normal diet for an additional 30 or 48 days, the testis and epididymis were comparable to the control animals. The present results thus demonstrate that spermatogenesis is incomplete and that late spermatids are most severely affected by vitamin E deficiency.

Particles otherwise destined to reside in the deep-water profundal zone are intercepted by nearshore macrophyte communities that attenuate wave and current energy. The microenvironment found inside submerged macrophyte beds can be substantially more quiescent than that of the open-water, allowing for fine particles to be deposited out of the water column. Together with larger, eroded inorganic sediments and coarse organic particles, these materials comprise the sediments underlying macrophyte communities. Thirty-four littoral sites were sampled in Lake Memphremagog (Quebec-Vermont) to quantify the role of morphometry (littoral slope and site exposure) and macrophyte beds (mean biomass and biomass density) on the accumulation of sediments. An established historical marker, stable Pb, was used to date the sediments (approx. 110 years) and calculate rates of accumulation (SARs). Identifiable stable Pb profiles were obtained at two-thirds of the sites confirming the utility and robustness of littoral sediment core analysis. Multiple regression analyses showed that macrophyte parameters were the best predictors of SARs. Macrophyte mean biomass and biomass density were clearly most important in predicting the volume (total SAR) and organic content (organic SAR) of the sediments ($R sp2=0.57 rm to 0.76$, $P&lt;0.001$). The same macrophyte parameters, however, poorly predicted the bulk (mainly inorganic) accumulation of sediments. Biomass density was solely related to the long-term accumulation of stable Pb in the sediments supporting empirical models that credit growth form as an important factor explaining among species or among weedbed variability in sediment-plant tissue elemental concentrations. The quantification of SARs will benefit both lakewide modeling of nutrient and contaminant budgets, and the understanding of littoral succession and its contribution to lake ontogeny.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kalff, Jacob (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f91q.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws32m</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Memphremagog, Lake (Québec and Vt.)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lake sediments -- Memphremagog, Lake (Québec and Vt.).</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ah702q8308"><dcterms:title>Evaluation of the efficiency of different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on corn (Zea mays L.) and pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.) under greenhouse and field conditions</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Plant Science</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Barnola, Luis.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The objective of this research was the selection of the most efficient arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus on pepper (Capsicum frutescens L. cv.

The inoculum treatments consisted of 9 different AM inocula and an autoclaved mix of roots and sand used as a control. Plants were inoculated and planted in a pasteurized growth medium (greenhouse) and non-fumigated soil in 4 different field locations for each crop. Glomus intraradices (GinA) and both the same strain (GinA) and a mix of Sclerocysitis rubiformis and G. fasciculatum (Sru$+$) developed the highest AM colonization in sweet corn and pepper, respectively, under controlled conditions. However, no significant increases in growth were found compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. Only a mix of G. microagreggatum, G. mosseae and G. fasciculatum (Gmi+) produced a greater shoot dry mass compared with the control treatment in sweet corn under controlled conditions. None of the mycorrhizal strains used in the field experiments increased the growth of sweet corn or pepper compared with non-inoculated plants under field conditions.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Smith, Donald L.

A cortical maldevelopment has been suggested to explain the behavioral changes observed but direct evidence is lacking to support this assumption. We studied possible alterations in excitatory amino acids receptor levels in this animal model of schizophrenia. Ventral hippocampal lesion at postnatal day 7 (PD7) induced significantly increased locomotor activity after a D-amphetamine injection (1mg/kg) in PD56 and 6 month-old (PD 180) rats but not PD35 ones. In addition, behavioral deficits were observed in postpubertal rats in the radial arm maze test. By using a $ lbrack sp{125} rm I rbrack$-MK-801 receptor binding autoradiography protocol, neonatal ventral-hippocampal-lesioned rats depicted significant postpubertal increased levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in frontal cortical regions at ages PD56 and 6 month, but not prepubertally at PD35. $ lbrack sp{3} rm H rbrack$-AMPA receptor binding levels were also found increased in 6-month old rats, while no significant changes in $ lbrack sp3 rm H rbrack$-kainate receptor binding levels were found at any of the ages studied. Finally, metabotropic glutamate receptor levels measured by $ lbrack sp3 rm H rbrack$-glutamate binding were decreased in PD56 and PD180. Taken together our results suggest that cortical glutamate abnormalities observed in hippocampal-lesioned rats are of enduring nature and may underlie some of the behavioral changes observed in these animals.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Quirion, Remi (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zg52h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v93j</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57ns97w"><dcterms:title>Acyclic Models</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1997</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Science</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Akhter, Nasima.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>In this thesis we describe a new version of acyclic models, which was first given by Barr, that gives the Theorem of Barr and Beck, and of Andre as special cases.

The theory described here is based on the notion of acyclic classes. An acyclic class is a class of objects in a category of chain complexes and corresponds to a class of arrows, whose mapping cones they are. We also give an answer to the question, where do acyclic classes come from. We conclude the thesis by showing that Cartan-Eilenberg cohomology of groups, of associative algebras, and of Lie algebras are the same as cotriple ones, using proofs based on those presented by Barr.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Barr, M.

Crosslinked hemoglobin forms a major class of potential blood substitutes in which hemoglobin is chemically modified. One of the requirements for generating a viable blood substitute is to control the formation of methemoglobin. Accordingly, a study was conducted to assess the ability of superoxide dismutase and catalase to control methemoglobin formation when both enzymes are crosslinked to ultrapure hemoglobin (Hb-SOD-CAT). In vitro experiments had shown that crosslinking superoxide dismutase and catalase to hemoglobin was more effective at preventing methemoglobin formation than simply incubating polyhemoglobin with both enzymes. Similar observations were made when assessing the intravascular rate of hemoglobin autoxidation in Sprague Dawley rats during transfusion experiments. Furthermore, an investigation into the addition of NADPH to augment the antioxidant properties of Hb-SOD-CAT had shown a significant improvement.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Chang, T. M. S.

CV detected from the surface EMG was used as an indication of antagonist muscle co-activation; surface EMG recordings not showing CV were confirmed as crosstalk. As the result, CV was detected in the surface EMG from the antagonist muscle when the ankle relaxed from plantarflexion to rest, indicating the antagonist muscle was co-activated.

The method makes use of the MOESP family of identification algorithms (59), (60), (61), (62) to obtain a discrete-time model of the system. Since, the structure and parameters of discrete-time models are difficult to relate to the underlying continuous-time system of interest it is necessary to compute the continuous-time equivalent from the discrete-time model. The bilinear transform (19), (54) does this effectively but also converts extraneous system zeros (the so-called process or sampling zeros) to the continuous-time model. Here, we present an approach to distinguish which of the system zeros are due to sampling effects and which are truly part of the model's dynamics. Dropping sampling zeros yields an accurate description of the system under test. Digital simulations demonstrate that this method is robust in the presence of measurement noise. Moreover, series of experiments performed on a known, physical, linear system validate the simulation results. Finally, an investigation of the passive dynamics of the ankle was used to demonstrate the applicability of this method to a physiological system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Kearney, R. E.

The resulting displacements of the stapedial footplate, incudostapedial joint, manubrium and eardrum were examined. The footplate tilts both anteroposteriorly and inferosuperiorly for almost all Young's modulus values. The in-plane rotation of the footplate is greatest when the incudostapedial joint is effectively rigid. The joint compresses most when it is extremely flexible and less as the joint becomes less flexible. The joint compression is greater than the joint shear. The displacement pattern of the eardrum is relatively insensitive to changes in the joint stiffness.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Funnell, W. R. J.

The two angiograms are displayed side by side and several points on the vascular structure are identified in both modalities. These points are used to estimate, using a Least Squares Minimization, the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix (HTM) characterizing the projection of the DSA image. The resulting HTM is used to generate a corresponding Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) of the MRA dataset. The number and location of the required homologous point-pairs are determined empirically. Other alternatives to MIP are presented as well, and their performance relative to DSA is discussed. Images from each modality are displayed stereoscopically to reflect the three dimensional nature of the vascular tree.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Peters, T. M.

The first section of this thesis describes the expanded possibilities of compositional procedure, orchestration and vocal/linguistic construction inherent in this particular medium. The concept of the work is deeply rooted in the sociological thesis expounded in Alvin Toffler's "The Third Wave". These sociological 'undertones' and their bearing on the background structure of the work are examined in the following section of the thesis. The subsequent sections of the thesis introduce the perceptual and conceptual aspects of the overall musical language, and discuss essential characteristics of the harmonic, rhythmic and linguistic fabric of the work as well as special applications of studio recording techniques such as digital sound processing, sampling and mixing.
