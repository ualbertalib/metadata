Europe prefers thinking of it as  way to provide its market with works that reflect European culture and ideals. This  thesis questions the reality of such a statement, using the examples of the EU, the  U.S. and Canada. The author first explains the mechanism of co-production within  the framework of a presentation of the methods of film financing. Follows a twofold  discussion on the current nature of international co-productions, on both the  international and national levels. A considerable portion of this work examines the terms of the  debate about the interplay between culture and trade. As an instrument used in the  audiovisual industry, therefore strongly connected to cultural industries,  international co-production is indeed an ideal model to represent the tensions  existing between culture and global trade. This thesis sets international  co-production up as a symbol of the interface between culture and  trade. Follows a debate on the congruity of the existing global and  regional trade agreements for the protection of a culture always weaker in its  diversity and propagation. With the prospect of the imminent phasing out of the  sectoral exemptions allowed by the GATS, the inadequacy of the NAFTA cultural  exemption and current quota policy systems, what would be best to calm down the  tensions between culture and trade? Three solutions are discussed here: the New  International Instrument on Cultural Diversity; a powerful competitor to the  American majors such as Vivendi-Universal, and the technique of  co-ventures.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Lametti, David (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dm98k.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb370</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>United States -- Cultural policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Europe -- Cultural policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Foreign trade regulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Canada -- Cultural policy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coproduction (Motion pictures, television, etc.)</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aqb98mg127"><dcterms:title>The enforcement of trademark rights in the People's Republic of China /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Laws</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Comparative Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Chen, Shui, 1969-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Trademark counterfeiting is one of the most serious problems  ever encountered in China. The Chinese government, recognizing the adverse effects  that counterfeiting has had on both foreign investment and the nation's economy, has  begun to take steps to protect intellectual property rights. To this end, the nation  amended its Trademark Law on 27 October 2001. The aims of the amendment are to  improve management of trademarks, to strengthen punishment for infringements, and to  further meet the requirements of the TRIPs. Although the new amendment is laudable,  eliminating the problem will take time. This thesis offers an overview of trademark enforcement in  China, beginning with a historical review of China's trademark law before moving on  to examine the original version of current trademark legislation, the 1982 Trademark  Law. The entry into force of the WTO placed tremendous pressure on China to meet  international standards, resulting in the 2001 amendment and the protection it  affords to well-known trademarks, as is discussed next. Finally, an examination of  the enforcement of the trademark law in China, including the status of  counterfeiting, the enforcement system, and the difficulties associated with  enforcing trademark rights, is undertaken. The thesis concludes that the Chinese  government has made remarkable progress in its quest to combat trademark  counterfeiting and that the problem will gradually be overcome as the nation  continues to develop its economy and enhance its legal system.</dc:abstract><ual:supervisor>Gerdrean, Ysolde (Supervisor)</ual:supervisor><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv27b.PDF</ual:fedora3Handle><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg127</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Trademark infringement -- China</dc:subject><dc:subject>Counterfeits and counterfeiting -- China</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3As7526c94n"><dcterms:title>Treatment issues in forensic social work : a comparative case study</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>2002</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Master of Social Work</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>School of Social Work</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Lewis, Susan D.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Forensic social work is defined as the specialty that focuses on  the interface between the legal system and the human service system. Forensic  psychiatric social work is a subspecialty of forensic social work. Treatment issues  arise in forensic social work due to the nature of working within the two systems,  but some are specific to forensic psychiatric social work due to the nature of  balancing the needs of the patient with the protection of society. Issues that are  relevant to forensic psychiatric social work are, applying psychosocial  rehabilitation strategies in a forensic setting, the paradox of custody vs. caring,  issues surrounding confidentiality and the use of authority, bargaining and  persuasion as tools for social work practice. The author identified these issues as  each of them was raised during a specific case that the author was actively involved  with. The focus of the study is to explore the issues by discussing them in relation  to this case.

The literature tends to accord primary importance in the federal policy-making process to forces such as political parties, bureaucratic groups, pressure groups, and the provinces. This study demonstrates that the political leadership of an individual cabinet minister and, subsequently, the political leadership of the government as a whole were of primary importance in the development of unemployment insurance policy in the 1970's. The policy interests of political leadership took precedence over those of other forces in the policy-making process. Moreover, the input of other forces with the exception of political parties, was negligible. Political leadership required the support of sympathizers within the major political parties to exercise leadership functions of surveillance and legitimation. Bryce Mackasey, who introduced a new program in 1971, carried out these leadership functions so effectively that he became an agent of policy reform. Mackasey exercised surveillance over the policy-making activities of his public servants and legitimized the scheme to opponents within the major political parties, other bureaucratic groups, and the provinces. However, during the amending process, the government as a whole was not required to exercise surveillance but it successfully legitimized its policy interests to the same forces.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h0152.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz362</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Canada -- Politics and government -- 1968-1979</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insurance, Unemployment -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Political leadership -- Canada</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mackasey, Bryce, 1921-</dc:subject><dc:subject>Unemployed -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ab2773w28r"><dcterms:title>Social, political and cultural determinants of economic activity : comparative perspectives</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1983</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Economics</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Mendell, Marguerite, 1947-</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The inspiration for this study was the work of Karl Polanyi. The study therefore looks to an economics of which market economy is only part of a special case. On the basis of evidence from economic historians and economic anthropologists, it seeks to show that the wider economics of Polanyi can be given a unified basis that operates equally in simple and complex communities, ancient and modern communities, and in communities on either side of the "great transformation". A first charge on economic surplus is invariably the resources to perpetuate the social structure itself, and may be a charge so large as to exhaust almost all of the surplus and so variable in its expression that the charge on resources often passes unnoticed or is mistaken as irrational and non-economic. In its particulars, this study examines social, cultural and political determinants of economic activity from a selection of social systems and historical periods. It argues for a much expanded analytical framework than that of market-focussed theory. It draws attention to rarely noticed contributions by earlier writers, notably Carl Menger, and to important contemporary contributions by the substantivist school in economic anthropology.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv843.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w28r</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Economics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic development -- Social aspects.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Economic history.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A70795835t"><dcterms:title>Development and application of contour radiography</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Szirtes, Thomas.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This thesis describes the development and applications of a new, high-speed, non-invasive, radiographic method by which the orientational and configurational characteristics of an internal human organ can be determined. The application of the method requires the organ to possess a radiologically recognizable contour seen simultaneously by two X-ray sources. The method does not rely on the existence of anatomical landmarks or implanted artifacts, neither is any prior information about the general orientation of the contour necessary, nor does the operator need to have stereoscopic acuity. In the presentation, first the developed algorithm is analyzed then the method is described in terms of general requirements and execution. Subsequent chapters deal with the sensitivity and accuracy considerations and the potential of the technique is demonstrated in a series of simulation experiments showing that the accuracy of the method is basically limited only by the digital process employed. The practical feasibility of the method is demonstrated in a series of in-vivo experiments involving vertebrae of scoliotic and non-scoliotic subjects. The results of these experiments show that, in the case of vertebral bodies, such characteristics as inclination, torsion, wedge angle and true shape can be routinely determined with an accuracy of about 2 degrees angular and 0.2 cm linear.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397892m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795835t</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Radiography, Medical.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vertebrae -- Radiography.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Atq57nr619"><dcterms:title>Effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the expression of the transformed phenotype in a Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed mouse cell line</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1982</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ridgway, Anthony Allan Grinyer.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>The effects of dibutyryl 3'; 5' cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP) on several parameters of transformation were studied using a Kirsten sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV)-transformed mouse cell line (K-A31). Treated cells showed changes in morphology, decreased motility, saturation density and growth rate, and lost the capacity for anchorage-independent growth. In contrast to many other transformed cell lines, fibronectin and an elaborate cytoskeleton were present in K-A31 cells. The transcription of the proviral genome was examined using both reverse-transcribed and nick-translated ('3)H-DNA probes, and certain viral-specific RNAs were found restricted to the nucleus of dbcAMP-treated cells. Additive hybridization experiments suggested these RNAs were transcribed from rat-derived sequences located in the 5'-half of the proviral genome.

A probabilistic utility-based formulation of the serviceability design problem is presented, and design optimization is related to pseudo-limit states and associated serviceability indices appropriate to 'single point' design checks. The case study includes the review and adaptation of stochastic load models, the development of a load-response model to account for random spatial variations of structural properties, and detailed numerical modelling of time-dependent deflections of non-prestressed reinforced-concrete slabs.

Immunostaining for electron microscopy revealed that the five substances are localized in the basal lamina part of the basement membrane. Reichert's membrane, a multilayered basement membrane, was shown by immunostaining to contain type IV collagen and laminin. To examine the origin of these two substances, the endodermal cells associated with Reichert's membrane were immunostained and displayed reactivity in rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi saccules and secretory granules, a result suggesting that the two substances are secreted along the usual pathway of protein synthesis.

Part I quantifies structure and species-specificity of advertising song. Part II describes experiments on song function and recognition. Part III examines the role of morphology in mate recognition and reproductive isolation. Geospiza song is variable and lacks species-specificity, due to intrapopulation song polymorphism, dialect divergence, song parallelism and interspecific song overlap. Song functions in conspecific territorial communication. Much intraspecific song variation apparently has little functional significance, although vocal confusion between syntopic G. fuliginosa and G. fortis may exist. Visual recognition involves morphological (non-plumage) stimuli of both head and body. Male recognition of potential mates functions in reproductive isolation, and character displacement in recognition ability occurs. Visual cues appear to override vocal ones in short-range communication. Lack's (1945) hypothesis that Geospiza use characters specialized for feeding as mate identification cues is confirmed. Low interspecific song divergence is probably related to the evolution of visual species recognition.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dw17x.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b5919113</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Finches -- Speciation.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Animal communication.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9019s310g"><dcterms:title>Discriminatory refusal of carriage in North America</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Civil Law</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Air and Space Law</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Reukema, Barbara.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>This study is concerned with the situation in which a passenger holding a valid airline ticket and a confirmed reservation is nevertheless refused carriage.

These programs generally deal with three categories of problems: problems stemming from interruptions of production income due to sickness, accident, premature death of the breadwinner or caused by retirement or unemployment; problems related to non-participation in the labour force such as those encountered by mothers who stay home with their children, children themselves, students, handicapped people and individuals who due to age can no longer enter the labour force; problems related to insufficiency of production income which are usually the problems of low wage earners. This thesis studies mainly the income security programs designed to correct the first two types of economic dependency. Three main theoretical hypotheses emerge from the economic analysis of the evolution in historical time of income security mechanisms. First, the types of economic dependency which those programs try to deal with are generally collective problems of income distribution or, in other words, income transfers problems; they are not individual problems of saving, neither are they intertemporal income allocation problems. Second, in the field of income security, the institutions of the private sector do not have the economic power to efficiently implement the income security programs desired. Third, the income security collective strategies are deeply influenced by the collective values of Canadian society; therefore, the form that State intervention takes in the field of income security obeys the necessities and the constraints of these values. In addition to the influence of collective values, this thesis discusses the impact of macroeconomic stabilization policies on the evolution of income security programs. The hypotheses presented in this thesis are original in comparison to the current literature. Indeed an important number of authors consider economic dependency as being principally an individual problem of intertemporal allocation of income and not a collective problem of income distribution. Few of them study the relative efficiency of different economic institutions in providing appropriate income security programs. And finally, many authors ignore the role of collective values.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z48m.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp90c</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Income distribution -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Income -- Canada.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social security -- Canada.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Adj52w544w"><dcterms:title>Morphological variation in the Darwin's finches (Geospizinae) of Daphne Major Island, Galápagos</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Boag, Peter T.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>A three year study on Daphne Major island, Galapagos, describes the ecology and morphology of a simple Geospiza community. The four part thesis discusses the breeding and feeding ecology of two Daphne finches; G. fortis is a generalist adapted to a variable environment, and G. scandens is an ecological specialist experiencing a more stable environment. The measurement, growth, allometry, and multivariate properties of seven external morphological characters are described. The repeatabilities and heritabilities of the seven characters and principal component scores are large. Relations between the unusual intermediate-sized Daphne G. fortis phenotype and the Daphne environment are examined. Four hypotheses for the intermediacy, including genetic drift, hybridization, local adaptation, and competition are suggested, with evidence found to support parts of each except genetic drift. An episode of intense directional natural selection is documented, and Lack's character release explanation of the Daphne G. fortis phenotype is revised.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx17z.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w544w</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Finches -- Morphology.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Birds -- Galapagos Islands.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Ac821gk52z"><dcterms:title>Flow and heat transfer for impinging round turbulent jets</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemical Engineering</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Obot, Nsima Tom.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Characteristics of the flow field and of impingement surface heat transfer for round, turbulent jets were studied experimentally. The effects on the flow field and heat transfer of nozzle geometry, i.e. nozzle length, l(,n)/d(,n), and nozzle entrance configuration (contoured and sharp-edged), and semi-confinement were investigated. In addition, the role of suction on the development of flow was considered. Effects of nozzle geometry on the flow field and on heat transfer are to divide the nozzles tested into two groups; the long (10 (LESSTHEQ) l(,n)/d(,n) (LESSTHEQ) 50) nozzles with similar characteristics and modest differences between them, and the short (l(,n)/d(,n) = 1) nozzles with distinctly different patterns for flow and heat transfer. Semi-confinement restricts interaction and mixing between the jet and the ambient fluid and hence reduces entrainment, and causes significant reductions in local heat transfer coefficients over most of the impingement surface. In general, application of suction up to V(,w) = 0.25 m/s or 0.42% of the nozzle exit average velocity reduces the boundary layer thickness, increases radial velocities adjacent to the impingement surface, thereby velocity gradients near the wall.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806038c.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk52z</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Heat -- Transmission.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Jets -- Fluid dynamics.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Akp78gh034"><dcterms:title>Diagenesis and deep-water depositional environments of lower Paleozoic continental margin sediments in the Québec City area, Canada</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1980</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Geological Sciences</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Ogunyomi, Olugbenga</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Deep-water clastic sediments of the lower Paleozoic continental margin in the Quebec City area are piled up in imbricated thrust sheets and nappes constituting the External Domain of the Northern Appalachians.

Les Conferences jouissent d'un immense succes, et leurs comptes rendus sont publies non seulement en France, mais aussi en Angleterre, ou ils eveillent l'interet des fondateurs de la Societe royale de Londres. Ces comptes rendus constituent pour nous un temoignage precieux sur la facon dont etaient vecues les profondes mutations alors en cours dans tous les domaines de la vie intellectuelle, et en particulier dans la reflexion morale. Mieux que la plupart des traites des passions contemporains, ils nous permettent de suivre le lent progres du nouvel esprit scientifique qui commence a saper les fondements de l'heritage medieval et scolastique toujours dominant.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k560k.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gn964</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Ethics.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Renaudot, Théophraste, 1586-1653.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Amp48sd352"><dcterms:title>The osteology and relationships of aquatic eosuchians from the Upper Permian of Africa and Madagascar /</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1981</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Biology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Currie, Philip J.</ual:dissertant><dc:abstract>Tangasaurid eosuchians are represented by hundreds of specimens from the Permo-Triassic strata of Madagascar and Africa. The confusion surrounding the identification and anatomy of these reptiles is resolved by comparative anatomy and relative measurements, and three genera, Thadeosaurus, Tangasaurus and Hovasaurus, are described. Extensive growth series present a unique opportunity to study differences in growth strategies in two closely related Permian genera, one that was terrestrial (Thadeosaurus) and the other aquatic (Hovasaurus). The vertebrae of Youngina have a derived character state that indicates close relationship with the tangasaurids. A new genus and species of eosuchian, Acerosodontosaurus piveteaui, has a specialized feature in the carpus that is found in the Tangasauridae. The relationships between tangasaurids and other eosuchians are considered.</dc:abstract><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg04h.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd352</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Paleontology -- Permian.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Eosuchia.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reptiles, Fossil.</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Aww72bc19d"><dcterms:title>Reactions of gaseous halocarbons with clean titanium surfaces.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Summers, Wayne Richard.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935363g.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc19d</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Titanium</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alkyl halides.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydrocarbons</dc:subject><dc:subject>Metallic films</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3A9593tv77x"><dcterms:title>Interfacial phenomena in shear and electrical fields.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1970</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Department of Chemistry</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Torza, Sergio.</ual:dissertant><dc:identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j88r.pdf</dc:identifier><ual:fedora3Handle>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv77x</ual:fedora3Handle><dc:subject>Surface chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shear (Mechanics)</dc:subject><dc:subject>Electrophoresis</dc:subject></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/oai%3Aescholarship.mcgill.ca%3Axg94hq27q"><dcterms:title>Microscopic and ultramicroscopic studies of the amoeba-host relationship in cell culture systems.</dcterms:title><ual:graduationDate>1969</ual:graduationDate><dcterms:language>eng</dcterms:language><schema:inSupportOf>Doctor of Philosophy</schema:inSupportOf><dc:contributor>Institute of Parasitology</dc:contributor><dcterms:publisher rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/McGill_University"/><ual:dissertant>Eaton, Richard D.
