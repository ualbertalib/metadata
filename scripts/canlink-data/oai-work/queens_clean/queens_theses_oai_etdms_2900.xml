   <description>This research examines a new concept called information systems (IS) control alignment, which refers to the degree that controls within an IS process such as systems development are similar to an ideal profile of controls. IS controls are used to influence the behaviour of employees, often via approaches such as formal policies or managerial oversight. Many companies continue to struggle with ineffective IS controls, as evidenced by underperforming systems development projects, ongoing security breaches, and inconsistent service from third-party providers. A qualitative case study approach is adopted, drawing on data collected via interviews and company documents. IS controls are found to most effectively achieve their objectives when they are grouped into mutually reinforcing profiles characterized by either agile attributes (e.g. evolution, innovation), traditional attributes (e.g. stability, prevention), or hybrid attributes that are employed based on unique organizational circumstances. Findings from this research will help organizations to better achieve their goals by identifying IS controls that complement, rather than conflict, with one another. By more closely examining the implications of IS control choice, organizations can better understand how to influence employee behaviour and oversee day-to-day operations, a topic that is increasingly on the minds of executives and shareholders in light of the rash of business failures in recent years. Findings will also contribute to the academy by conceptualizing and empirically evaluating the new concept of IS control alignment, as well as building theory regarding the relationships between IS processes, controls, and employee behaviour.</description>

   <description>The mother-daughter relationship is dual, ambivalent, a hall of mirrors; it is at once the site of the womb and maternity, a veritable matrix of meaning.  The mother-daughter pairing moves through the body, constantly calling attention to its origins and valorising a transmission au féminin even from within a patriarchal society.  However, it can also prove catastrophic.  Though the mother is the first person with whom the daughter identifies—her first link to life—the daughter not only reacts to her, but also pushes against her.  It would appear that this confrontation is necessary, that it allows the child to detach herself from the mother even as she models herself on her.  In order to avoid a destructive union, the daughter must become conscious of the maternal love from which she must take her distance if she is to become someone, and more precisely, a woman.  In the novels analysed here, the daughter’s flight—her quest for independence from her mother—points to her need to create herself, to come into her own without destroying the mother-daughter bond.  The notion of space is of the utmost importance in the discovery and (re-)establishment of this exclusive filial/maternal relationship.  Space becomes the symbol of the mother and the antidote to filial solitude, a site of resistance, one to be conquered and understood, and thus an incentive to write the mother-daughter relationship.  The symbolic matricide—depicted in these novels through the absence of the mother during the process of identification and the liberation of the daughter—ensures, a posteriori, the continuation rather than destruction of the filial/maternal relationship, as well as the affirmation of a female lineage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       La relation mère-fille est duelle, ambivalente, jeu de miroirs. A la fois lieu de la matrice, lieu de maternage, et de matriçage. Le couple mère-fille en appelle en effet au corps, revenant à l’origine de cette relation qui valorise une transmission au féminin, et ce à l’intérieur-même d’une société patriarcale tendant à assujettir les femmes. Il peut toutefois aussi devenir désastre. La fille réagit face à sa mère, première personne à laquelle elle peut s’identifier, premier lien à la vie. La confrontation est, semble-t-il, nécessaire, elle permet à l’enfant de se détacher de la figure maternelle tout en s’en servant de modèle. Afin d’éviter une union destructrice, la fille doit prendre conscience d’un amour maternel envers lequel il faut qu’elle prenne ses distances de façon à être, à son tour, quelqu’un, et plus précisément une femme. La fuite des filles, ou du moins leur recherche d’indépendance face à leur mère dans les romans analysés indique cette nécessité de se construire soi-même sans pour autant détruire le lien à la mère. L’espace prend alors une place prépondérante dans la découverte et le rétablissement de cette relation maternelle exclusive. Il s’avère être symbole de la mère, antidote contre la solitude filiale, espace à conquérir et à comprendre, lieu de résistance, incitation à écrire cette relation mère-fille. Le meurtre symbolique de la mère, illustré ici par l’absence de celle-ci lors du processus d’identification et de libération de la fille assure a posteriori la persistance de la relation maternelle ainsi que l’affirmation d’une lignée féminine – et non leur anéantissement.</description>

   <description>As vast networks of high pressure buried energy pipelines traverse North America and other continents, the stability of such essential buried infrastructure must be maintained under a variety of earth loading conditions. The pipe-soil interaction and the longitudinal behaviour of buried pipes due to relative ground movements is poorly understood. This thesis presents full scale testing and numerical modeling of steel and Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) pipelines to better understand the flexural performance of buried pipes subjected to lateral earth movement.&#xd;
For the experimental phase of the study, a series of pipe bending experiments have been conducted on 102 mm nominal diameter and 1830 mm long steel and GFRP pipes buried in dense sand. Pipe loading was carried out by pulling pipe ends using two parallel cables attached to a spreader beam outside the test region, using a hydraulic actuator.  The different tests covered burial depth-to-diameter (H/D) ratios of 3, 5 and 7.  During the steel pipe testing phase, special consideration was given to assess the effect of boundary limits, friction within the pulling mechanism, and consistency of results using repeated tests. For the GFRP pipes, the experimental work investigated the effect of the laminate structure of the pipes, including both cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. Test results showed that burial depth significantly influenced the ultimate pulling forces, longitudinal strains, and pipe net deflection at mid-span. The results were also compared between the two types of pipes. The failure mechanism for all tests was consistently governed by soil failure, except for the angle-ply GFRP pipe that failed at a burial depth of H/D=7.&#xd;
For the numerical analysis, the study presents the development and verification of two and three-dimensional numerical models including material constitutive models for both the pipe and for the soil using a stress-dependent modulus. Calculations are presented for different burial depths and are compared to experimental data. It was shown that the numerical model can successfully capture the pipe-soil interaction behaviour for both pipe types in terms of load-displacement responses and net bending deflection. Also, the effect of material variation and laminate structure were in agreement with test data.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, German) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-19 14:01:35.498</description>
   <description>In the aftermath of the failed revolution of 1848, which had been sparked by demands for democracy and constitutional reform, Germany’s princes reluctantly introduced new freedoms regarding print and the right to assembly. However, reactionary forces in governments unwilling to cede power quickly repressed these freedoms, leading to tighter controls on public and private life. Consequently, dispirited citizens clutched at the old Biedermeier ways, withdrawing to an “ill-remembered social order of bygone days” (Shorter 169). It was against this backdrop that the illustrated works of Wilhelm Busch (1832–1908) appeared in the popular Bilderbogen (“picture broadsheets”) of the day, and later as stand-alone Bildergeschichten (“picture stories”), using satire and symbolic inversion to mock German society by skewering assorted political, social, and cultural sacred cows. The aim of my dissertation is as follows. I will start by examining Busch’s use of symbolic inversion as a way of implying a shift in power between figures of authority and the disgruntled “second-class” citizens of Biedermeier society: women and children. Next, I will examine how Busch’s animal characters, particularly apes with their close resemblance to mankind, mock human pretensions of biological superiority. Finally, I will show how objects meant to serve their human “masters” overpower them, even in their homes, suggesting that there was no refuge from the vagaries of a rapidly changing world. Key to my analysis will be an exploration of the mechanism of “inside out” and “upside down,” described by Mikhail Bakhtin with regards to the carnival scenes of Gargantua et Pantagruel, as a sanctioned and mocking way of questioning the power of the state and its institutions. Along the way, I will compare and contrast Busch’s picture stories with similar strips in the Fliegende Blätter, in order to prove how groundbreaking the author’s exposé of nineteenth-century German society truly was. As I explore the synergy between image and word, I will demonstrate how Busch’s use of symbolic inversion is slyly subversive, undermining established authority in the political, social, and cultural arenas, and providing a safety valve in the form of humour that transcends the boundaries of class, education, and gender.</description>

   <description>The water industry is a heavy consumer of electricity to pump water. Electricity generated with fossil fuel sources produce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. Carbon taxation and economic discounting in project planning are promising policies to reduce GHG emissions. The aim of this research is to develop novel single- and multi-objective optimization frameworks that incorporate a new gene-coding scheme and pipe ageing models (pipe roughness growth model, a pipe leakage model, and a pipe break model) to examine the impacts of a carbon tax and low discount rates on energy use, GHG emissions, and design/operation/rehabilitation decisions in water systems. Chapter 3 presents a new algorithm that optimizes the operation of pumps and reservoirs in water transmission systems. The algorithm was applied to the KamalSaleh transmission system near Arak, Iran. The results suggest that a carbon tax combined with a low discount rate produces small reductions in energy use and GHG emissions linked to pumping given the high static head of the KamalSaleh system. Chapter 4 presents a new algorithm that optimizes the design and expansion of water distribution networks. The algorithm was applied to the real-world Fairfield water network in Amherstview, Ontario, Canada. The results suggest that a carbon tax combined with a low discount rate does not significantly decrease energy use and GHG emissions because the Fairfield system had adequate installed hydraulic capacity. Chapters 5 and 6 present a new algorithm that optimizes the optimal rehabilitation type and timing of water mains in water distribution networks. In Chapter 5, the algorithm is applied to the Fairfield network to examine the impact of asset management strategies (quantity and infrastructure adjacency discounts) on system costs. The results suggest that applying discounts decreased capital and operational costs and favored pipe lining over pipe replacement and duplication. In Chapter 6, the water main rehabilitation optimization algorithm is applied to the Fairfield network to examine the impact of a carbon tax and low discount rates on energy use and GHG emissions. The results suggest that adopting a low discount rate and levying a carbon tax had a small impact in reducing energy use and GHG emissions and a significant impact in reducing leakage and pipe breaks in the Fairfield system. Further, a low discount rate and a carbon tax encouraged early investment in water main rehabilitation to reduce continuing leakage, pipe repair, energy, and GHG costs.</description>

   <description>This thesis concerns the synthesis of N^N- and N^C-chelate four coordinate organoboron compounds and the investigation of their photophysical and photochemical properties. The preparation of a novel BODIPY derivative possessing unusual dual emissive property has been accomplished. The origin of the dual emission was determined through a detailed investigation. The use of the new BODIPY compound as a highly effective surface ligand for achieving highly uniform and monodispersed PbS nanoparticles has been demonstrated. Electronic communication between BODIPY ligands at the nanoparticle surface and the PbS core has also been established. The incorporation of BODIPY-bearing PbS nanoparticles into a simple photovoltaic device was shown to enhance the device’s performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
The preparation of two new BODIPY molecules decorated with either BMes2(vinyl) units or N^C-chelate boryl units has been achieved. Substitution at the meso or the 2,6-positions of the BODIPY core resulted in a significant shift of the emission energy with respect to that of the parent compound. In contrast, replacement of the fluorine substituents with BMes2-vinyl or B(ppy)Mes2-alkynyl groups did not affect the emission wavelength. Both molecules exhibited excellent photophysical properties in solution and the solid state. The BMes2(vinyl) unit greatly enhances BODIPY fluorescence efficiency in a PMMA matrix. Meanwhile, the photoreactivity of the N^C-chelate boryl unit is switched off completely by the BODIPY ligand via intramolecular energy transfer.&#xd;
&#xd;
A new class of N^C-chelate organoboron compounds have been synthesized. This class of compounds has been found to display unprecedented photo-reactivity, namely, photo-elimination reactions, which enabled the synthesis of new B-N substituted phenanthrene compounds in high conversion yields. The new B-N substituted phenanthrene compounds exhibited excellent absorptive and emissive properties with potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</description>

   <description>With the growth of globalization, people and cultures are coming together like never before. As an international teacher, I am an example of this phenomenon. After six years abroad, the last three working at an international school in Mongolia, I returned to Canada noticeably changed and struggling to understand the impact of my experiences. Limited literature on the international teacher experience has led me to engage in this self-study in which I use methods of narrative inquiry to better understand my personal journey of learning and change over the three years that I lived and taught in Mongolia. As I unpack my journey, the artifacts that I remove from my backpack trigger memories of the moments that hold significance. I further ‘unpack’ my vignettes, drawing out the issues that have impacted my changing identity. As newly qualified teachers seek positions in the competitive Canadian job market, the international arena remains an appealing option. It is my hope that this project will serve to instigate self-analysis in the reader and serve as a focal point for discussion on issues that could arise while living and teaching overseas.</description>

   <description>Cavity ring-down spectroscopy has been used over the last twenty years as a highly sensitive absorption spectroscopic technique to measure light attenuation in gases, liquids, and solid samples. An optical cavity is used as a multi-pass cell, and the decay time of the light intensity in the cavity is measured, thereby rendering the techniques insensitive to light intensity fluctuations. Optical waveguides are used to build the optical cavities presented in this work. The geometries of such waveguides permit the use of very small liquid sample volumes while retaining the advantages of cavity ring-down spectroscopy.&#xd;
In this thesis cavity ring-down measurements are conducted, both, in the time domain and by measuring phase-shifts of sinusoidally modulated light, and the two methods are theoretically connected using a simple mathematical model, which is then experimentally confirmed. A new laser driver, that is compatible with high powered diode lasers, has to be designed to be able to switch from time domain to frequency domain measurements.&#xd;
A sample path length enhancement within the optical cavity is explored with the use of liquid core waveguides. The setup was optimised with respect to the matrix liquid, the geometrical matching of waveguide geometries, and the shape of liquid core waveguide ends. Additionally, a new technique of producing concave lenses at fibre ends has been developed and the output of a general fibre lens is simulated.&#xd;
Finally, liquid core waveguides are incorporated into a fibre-loop ring-down spectroscopy setup to measure the attenuation of two model dyes in a sample volume of &lt;1 µL. The setup is characterized by measuring concentrations of Allura Red AC and Congo Red from 1 µM to a limit of detection of 5 nM. The performance of the setup is compared to other absorption techniques measuring liquid samples.</description>

   <description>Despite the physical health and psychosocial benefits, few individuals with acquired physical disabilities participate in sport. This manuscript-based thesis is composed of four studies that aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of the theoretical and contextual factors that influence sport participation among this population.&#xd;
Study 1 investigated the predictive value of the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The HAPA model has been used among a variety of populations; however, it has not been used to predict sport participation among adults with acquired physical disabilities nor has athletic identity been considered as a supplement to the model. Results of the structural equation model demonstrated that the modified HAPA model explained 19% of the variance in sport participation. &#xd;
Study 2 explored how athletic identity was lost or (re)developed after acquiring a physical disability. Eleven adults with an acquired physical disability participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants’ stories of sport pre- and post-injury fit into three distinct narratives. The non-athlete narrative focused on physical changes in the body; the other two narratives primarily focused on present sport behaviour. &#xd;
Study 3 explored the influence of the perceived self and disability on participation in specific types of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), such as sport, after injury. Fourteen participants completed semi-structured life story interviews. A structural and content analysis of participant narratives revealed that beliefs about disability and comparisons to peers were influential in motivating individuals to consider some LTPA while rejecting others, such as sport. &#xd;
	Study 4 explored peer athlete mentors’ responses to four mentee narratives. A narrative analysis of the responses revealed that peer athletes generally tailored their responses and information to the vignette’s specific view of disability. However, deeply negative and resistant narratives elicited more variant responses from the peers, including responses that accepted the resistance to those that challenged their perceptions of disability. &#xd;
As a whole, this dissertation enables a more nuanced understanding of the theoretical and contextual determinants of sport among individuals with acquired physical disabilities. This dissertation will better inform and identify opportunities for interventions that increase sport participation among this population.</description>

   <description>The overall purpose of this study was to examine the nature of curriculum in college-level interior design programs, explore computer-aided design’s (CAD) place in these curricula, and examine pedagogy used to teach CAD in these programs. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to better understand (a) the nature of college-level interior design programs with regard to curricular conceptions, (b) how interior design programs integrate CAD into the curriculum, and (c) how interior design instructors adopt and integrate CAD into their teaching practices. A qualitative research methodology using case study design was used. Data at two college-level interior design programs were collected using document analysis and interviews with six interior design instructors, three from each institution.&#xd;
Previous studies (Hill &amp; Anning, 2001b) examined and identified how other design fields such as graphic, engineering, architectural, and apparel design practice the design process. However, there is little research found on how interior designers practice design and their profession, or how they use CAD in design. Therefore, this research contributes to the literature on how interior design professionals design using CAD programs and more specifically how they incorporate AutoCAD software in their professional design practice and in their teaching of interior design curriculum. Findings revealed that participants referred to their own professional practice to conceptualize and teach the design process. The phases of the design process described by each instructor were context-specific to a design project and their use of CAD in the design process depended on their preferences, skills, abilities, and the context of their professional practice.  &#xd;
Findings also revealed that CAD is an important tool in the field of interior design. Even though CAD may inhibit an interior design students’ creativity, it can save time, document drawings, and assist in better coordination with other professionals in the workforce. To enhance interior design students’ skills, it is recommended that CAD courses be placed at the early courses of an interior design curriculum concurrently with manual drafting courses. This research provides useful information for future interior design instructors and CAD curriculum planning.</description>

   <title>Leadership for Learning: How Elementary Principal Leadership Practices Influence the Professional Learning of Teachers</title>
   <creator>McDonnell, Alison</creator>
   <subject>Principal Leadership</subject>
   <subject>Teacher Professional Learning</subject>
   <description>It is widely recognized that effective leadership ranks second only to the quality of teaching in influencing student learning (Jacobson, 2008; Simkin, Charner, &amp; Suss, 2010).Taking the role of powerful change agents, principals work with staff to change schools from the‘inside out’, thereby fostering the growth and development of the people who inhabit the organization (Owens, 2004). Furthermore, a principal who exercises such leadership acknowledges the conditions for improved student learning rest within the skills of the teachers&#xd;
in the school, and thus focuses on developing the capacity of the organization to support people in improving their own professional practice (Hallinger, 2010). Hence, an ‘inside out’ approach (Owens, 2004) to change embraces teacher professional learning as a key determinant in how schools approach and sustain successful educational reform.&#xd;
Addressing the point that present research related to this phenomenon is often&#xd;
quantitative (Hattie, 2012), this study adopted a qualitative approach to narrow the gap in current literature related to principal leadership practices that influence teacher professional learning.&#xd;
This study investigated the perceptions of principal leadership practices in support of teachers' professional learning from the perspectives of elementary teachers, elementary principals, and supervisors (who are supervising principals and superintendents responsible for instructional and administrative supervision of specific groups of schools and principals). Guided by a phenomenological perspective, I used three focus groups (one with elementary principals, one&#xd;
with elementary teachers, and one with supervisors) all of whom provided their experiences and perceptions of elementary principal leadership practices that influence teacher professional learning.&#xd;
   The following research questions explored the perceptions and experiences of elementary&#xd;
principal leadership practices in support of teachers’ professional learning from the perspectives of elementary teachers, elementary principals, and supervisors:&#xd;
1. What principal leadership practices are perceived by elementary teachers, elementary&#xd;
principals, and supervisors to influence teacher professional learning opportunities?&#xd;
2. How do elementary teachers, elementary principals, and supervisors describe the&#xd;
ways in which professional learning experiences have led to professional growth?&#xd;
3. From the perspectives of elementary teachers, elementary principals, and supervisors is there a perceived set of core leadership practices that support and influence teacher professional learning?&#xd;
The findings for each of the three research questions are summarized and discussed in relation to the extant literature. The results of this study suggest that a wide variety of principal leadership&#xd;
practices are perceived to influence teacher professional learning. While a few themes were similar across teacher, principal and supervisor participant groups, the majority of identified themes were diverse. The variability or divergence among themes is in alignment with literature referenced in this study and the conceptual framework upon which this study is based. Potential&#xd;
implications of this study include: an impact on principal leadership practices; principal hiring practices; the structure of teacher professional learning opportunities; and educational policy that constructs the parameters through which teacher professional learning is implemented.</description>

   <description>Eutrophication, caused by phosphorus and nitrogen overloading, is a global pollution problem for our fresh water lakes and streams.  Regulatory bodies have developed treatment guidelines for point-source pollution to address this concern, creating a need for small and remote waste producers to develop low cost solutions for nutrient removal – in particular phosphorus.  Constructed wetlands have often been implemented as a low cost alternative to treat various sources of wastewater, however, their efficiency in removing phosphorus has been questioned.&#xd;
&#xd;
Post-treatment blast furnace slag filters (known to have a high phosphorus sorption capacity) have been in operation since 2008 in Haliburton, Ontario, Canada, treating aquaculture wastewater following treatment by a constructed wetland.  Phosphorus removal performance of three filters of varying configuration have been assessed:  &#xd;
•	a random packed filter, packed randomly with unsieved blast furnace slag removed only 26% of phosphorus overall and became severely clogged likely due to the presence of fines, poor flow distribution and formation of calcium carbonate precipitate; &#xd;
•	a screen filter, designed as twenty individual filters separated by 3 inches of space to provide more uniform flow throughout removed 55% of the total phosphorus added and maintained a uniform flow throughout the study; and &#xd;
•	an anaerobic filter, designed to be sealed from the atmosphere in an effort to prevent the formation of calcium carbonate and subsequent filter clogging, removed 19% of the total phosphorus added and revealed signs of poor flow distribution.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Lab-scale flow through cells were designed to parallel the field scale studies and were operated at varying configuration, temperature and residence times to assess these factor effects on phosphorus removal.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The results of this research provide a valuable contribution to research involving blast furnace slag filters for phosphorus removal.  It has been demonstrated that cold temperatures reduce the slag filter’s efficiency to remove phosphorus (but cold-climate filters can still be effective in removing phosphorus), the removal of slag fines reduces the potential for slag clogging, a screen design is effective in promoting uniform flow and offsetting the effects of clogging and an optimum residence time may exist for phosphorus removal beyond which phosphorus removal is minimal.</description>

   <title>CREATING SUCCESS IN ACADEMIC WRITING: FROM SECONDARY TO HIGHER EDUCATION</title>

   <description>The academic transition from one’s native language to English medium instruction is a challenging experience for second language learners (L2). This is especially true for students who are learning a new subject at the same time. Research has shown that although L2 students have undergone at least eleven years of learning English as a communicative language, this does not guarantee success in their tertiary education. Some common challenges include understanding textbooks written in English, being aware of the academic writing process, lack of confidence in their writing and  unfamiliarity with the nature of academic writing and disciplinary genres, such as citing references and writing expectations.&#xd;
Students in Malaysia do not learn academic English explicitly in secondary schools. Yet, students who envisage pursuing their tertiary education abroad must be equipped with English academic skills. Certainly, these skills must be taught directly, extensively, and explicitly, prior to their tertiary education abroad. &#xd;
As such, this project focuses on the English academic gap. There are four chapters. After the introduction which traces the evolution of English language instruction in Malaysia is a chapter that reviews studies on genres of academic writing, understanding language challenges in English medium instruction and analytical writing through building critical thinking. The third chapter via a workshop is designed to achieve three learning goals: (1) to enhance academic writing skills and (2) to develop analytical writing through critical thinking skills and (3) building of positive mindsets. This project concludes with the sharing of my academic writing experience while studying in a university setting and suggestions for the benefit of non-native speakers of English.</description>

   <description>This study presents a detailed gas-phase and surface kinetic model for n-tetradecane autothermal reforming to deconvolute the complex reaction network that provides the mechanistic understanding of reforming chemistry in a packed-bed reactor.&#xd;
A thermodynamic analysis study for diesel reforming was performed to map the carbon formation boundary for various reforming processes. Through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) type of kinetic model, which was derived using a simple mechanistic study, the need for a detailed kinetic study including both gas-phase reactions and surface reactions was identified. &#xd;
Pt-CGO (Pt on Gd doped CeO2) and Rh-pyrochlore catalysts were synthesized and characterized. In an accelerated test for reforming of commercial-diesel, Rh-pyrochlore catalyst showed stable performance for 24 hrs, whereas Pt-CGO catalyst deteriorated in 4 hrs. Minimum structural change in Rh-pyrochlore catalyst compared to Pt-CGO catalyst was observed using redox experiments. An experimental kinetic study with an inert silica bed provided clear evidence that the gas-phase reactions are important to the kinetics of hydrocarbon reforming. &#xd;
“Reaction Mechanism Generator” (RMG) software was employed to generate a detailed gas-phase kinetic model containing nine thousand three hundred and forty-seven elementary reactions and four hundred and fifty-nine species. The model was validated against n-tetradecane ignition delay data, and inert bed autothermal reforming data. The RMG model was also extended to capture the high pressure and low temperature pyrolysis chemistry to predict pyrolysis experimental data. The reactor simulation using the RMG model identified the detailed chemistry of the reactions in the pre-catalytic zone. Gas-phase oxidation/pyrolysis converts the heavier hydrocarbons and oxygen in the pre-catalytic zone to lower molecular weight products prior to reaching the catalyst surface. The steam reforming reactions that are dominant on the surface of the catalyst primarily involve lower molecular weight oxidation/pyrolysis products.&#xd;
A multi-component micro-kinetic model containing two hundred and seventy surface reactions and fifty-two adspecies was developed using a semi-empirical Unity Bond Index-Quadratic Exponential Potential (UBI-QEP) method. Transition State Theory estimates were used for elementary reactions up to C3 species, and simple fragmentation reactions were assumed for higher hydrocarbon species. Model simulations indicated on the catalyst surface that hydrogen is initially produced by the water-gas-shift reaction and subsequently by steam reforming reactions. A major reaction path for ethylene formation from 1,3 butadiene in the post-catalytic zone of the reactor was also identified.</description>

   <description>Recent research has cast doubt on the suggestion that immigration weakens the societal foundation of a redistributive welfare state: there is little evidence of a negative relationship between immigration-induced diversity and public support for social programs. This research has largely overlooked, however, that unease about immigration is likely to have a more selective effect on solidarity. In some countries, the public has become less willing to share benefits with newcomers, and policy-makers have acted upon that sentiment, implementing limits and restrictions on immigrants’ welfare access. By combining quantitative data analysis of fourteen countries and a qualitative comparison of the Netherlands, Canada, and Sweden, this research explores when and how such expressions of selective solidarity are most likely to occur. The main findings are threefold. &#xd;
First, there is no evidence that actual patterns of immigrant welfare dependence are an important driver of selective solidarity or immigrant-excluding welfare reforms. Second, more important is how those patterns are politically translated. In the Netherlands, high levels of immigrant welfare dependence are commonly described as a sign that immigrants are lazy welfare cheats. In Canada and Sweden, the discourse is less accusatory and divisive, and attempts at welfare exclusion are consequently rarer. Country characteristics, in particular the political strength of anti-immigrant parties, the nature of national identity, and the structure of the welfare state, explain why the political translation differs between countries. Third, the primary constraint on immigrant-excluding welfare reforms tends not to be public opposition but legal prohibitions on differential treatment embedded in national legislation and international treaties. Sometimes politicians are forced to amend or withdraw from existing legislation before they can pass exclusionary reforms; in other cases the reforms are simply not possible.&#xd;
In sum, in some welfare states access to benefits has changed from an individual social right to a privilege for those lucky enough to be born in the country or to have lived long enough on its territory and acquired the necessary documentation. But this development is not unavoidable. Where forces of cohesion are stronger than forces of division, welfare states will likely address immigrant welfare dependence by more sanguine means than disentitlement.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-24 21:07:13.983</description>
   <description>Proteins perform many important functions in the cell and are essential to the health of the cell and the organism. As such, there is much effort to understand the function of proteins. Due to the advances in sequencing technology, there are many sequences of proteins whose function is yet unknown. Therefore, computational systems are being developed and used to help predict protein function.&#xd;
Most computational systems represent proteins using features that are derived from protein sequence or protein structure to predict function. In contrast, there are very few systems that use the biomedical literature as a source of features. Earlier work demonstrated the utility of biomedical literature as a source of text features for predicting protein subcellular location. In this thesis we build on that earlier work, and examine the effectiveness of using text features to predict protein function.&#xd;
Using the molecular function and biological process terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) as our function classes, we trained two classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machines) to predict protein function. The proteins were represented using text features that were extracted from biomedical abstracts based on statistical properties.  For evaluation, the performance of our two classifiers was compared to that of two baseline classifiers: one that assigns function based solely on the prior distribution of protein function, and one that assigns function based on sequence similarity. The systems were trained and tested using 5-fold cross-validation over a dataset of more than 36,000 proteins.&#xd;
Overall, we show that text features extracted from biomedical literature can be used to predict protein function for any organism. Our results also show that our text-based classifier typically has comparable performance to the sequence-similarity baseline classifier. Based on our results and what previous work had shown, we believe that text features can be integrated with other types of features to provide more accurate predictions for protein function.</description>

   <description>This thesis discusses and documents findings from an investigation of performance-based testing of asphalt cement (AC), warm mixed asphalt cement, asphalt rubber (AR), and warm asphalt rubber. A number of control, warm, and asphalt rubber binders from Ontario construction contracts were investigated for their compliance with conventional Superpave® test methods such as rolling thin film (RTFO), pressure aging vessel (PAV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR), as well as additional specification tests such as extended BBR and double edge notched tension test. The quality and durability of those binders were determined. Quality means the ability of asphalt binder to reach a set of specific properties whereas durability is the measure of how well asphalt retains its original characteristics when exposed to normal weathering and aging process. &#xd;
One warm AC and two field-blended asphalt rubber samples showed high levels of physical hardening which can lead to premature and early cracking. The warm asphalt cement lost 8 °C when stored isothermally for three days at low temperatures according to Ontario’s extended bending beam rheometer (BBR) protocol (LS-308). The two asphalt rubber samples lost 10 °C and 12 °C following the same conditioning. Many of the studied asphalt samples showed deficient strain tolerance as measured in Ontario’s double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test (LS-299).&#xd;
In a study of warm rubberized asphalt cement with improved properties, a number of compositions were prepared with soft Cold Lake AC and a small quantity of naphthenic oil. These binders showed little chemical and physical hardening and reasonable critical crack tip opening displacements (CTOD). Strain tolerance was much improved by co-blending with a high vinyl type styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer and a small amount of sulfur.</description>

   <title>Using Word-of-Mouth to Portray an Image of Being Knowledgeable</title>

   <description>Word-of-mouth (WOM) is a powerful phenomenon, with the potential to determine a brand’s success by influencing both purchase decisions and the consumers’ experiences. While the predominant view suggests that WOM behavior stems from satisfaction with the brand, self-presentation can also motivate people to share their experiences. &#xd;
This dissertation examines how the desire to convey a particular image, one of being knowledgeable about a product category, motivates and affects WOM behavior. The conceptual framework suggests that social circumstances influence when people feel the motivation to use WOM to convey an image of being knowledgeable about a product category. Relative assessments of the salient audience’s capabilities resulting in perceptions that the speaker possesses more or unique information will likely activate this self-presentation goal. &#xd;
This motivation leads speakers to follow a consistent and systematic pattern of changes to both the content and phrasing of their WOM messages. Specifically, speakers will mention more brands, include claims to establish their credentials, mention both the pros and cons of a brand, adopt objective language, and include more technical jargon in their messages.&#xd;
From the receivers’ perspective, the changes to the content and phrasing result in augmented perceptions of the speaker’s credibility, though the changes affect different dimensions of this construct (i.e., through knowledge perceptions and trustworthiness perceptions). The predicted changes also enhance receivers perceptions regarding the persuasiveness of the message. &#xd;
Empirical testing of the conceptual framework involves three studies, a survey and two scenario-based experiments. The conceptual framework and findings in this dissertation yield important implications for both theory and practice.</description>

   <description>Background: Individuals who make multiple visits to EDs for mental health complaints are a highly visible and challenging group. Recent healthcare priorities aimed at reducing inappropriate or unnecessary service use call for improved continuity of care. Implementing effective continuity interventions is contingent on sound foundational knowledge including population profiling and conceptual understanding. A deficit in these key elements is apparent in existing literature. These gaps in knowledge must be addressed to ensure quality continuity research targeting frequent presenters. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research available that implements evidence-informed methods and theory-driven measurement strategies.&#xd;
Objective: To strengthen the knowledge base on frequent mental health-related ED use and continuity in mental healthcare by addressing existing gaps in foundational knowledge and examining the phenomena at a regional tertiary healthcare centre. &#xd;
Method: This was a three-phase emergent study design using mixed methods. Phase 1 was an integrative study to synthesize research on frequent presenters to the ED for mental health complaints. Phase 2 was a theory analysis to explore the conceptual understanding of continuity in mental healthcare. Phase 3 was an observational case-control study of an exemplar population at a regional tertiary healthcare centre using the evidence-informed methods emerging from the first two phases.&#xd;
Results: From this enquiry, I proposed an evidence-informed profile for frequent presenters to the ED for mental health complaints, summarized parameters used to identify the frequent presenter population, highlighted existing areas of theoretical consensus not yet recognized in continuity research, and provided a global understanding of continuity in mental healthcare and an approach for selecting measurement strategies for continuity research. The observational study strengthened the emerging frequent presenter profile and explored CoC using a comprehensive tool.&#xd;
Conclusion: This doctoral thesis addresses important gaps in foundational knowledge by providing an evidence-informed frequent presenter population profile and global theoretical summary of continuity in mental healthcare. The observational study appears to be the first to use a theory-driven measurement tool and results differ from previous studies in which simple measurement approaches are used. Given this, new hypotheses/questions about the focus and role of CoC with frequent ED use need to be explored.</description>

   <description>The aim of this thesis is the stiffness analysis of cable-driven parallel robots. Cable-driven parallel robots have drawn considerable attention because of their unique abilities and advantages such as the large workspace, light weight of cable actuators, easy disassembly and transportation of the robot. The mobile platform of a cable-driven parallel robot is attached to the base with multiple cables.&#xd;
&#xd;
One of the parameters that should be studied to make sure a robot is able to execute a task accurately is stiffness of the robot. In order to investigate the stiffness behaviour of a robot, the stiffness matrix can be calculated as the first step. Because cables act in tension, keeping the positive tension in cables becomes a challenge. In order to have a fully controllable robot, an actuation redundancy is needed. These complexities are addressed in the thesis and simulations.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, the complete form of the stiffness matrix is considered without neglecting any terms in calculation of the stiffness. Some stiffness indices such as single-dimensional stiffness based on stiffness ellipse, directional stiffness and condition number of the stiffness matrix are introduced and calculated and stiffness maps of the robot are developed. In addition, the issue of unit inconsistency in calculating the stiffness index is addressed.&#xd;
&#xd;
One of the areas which is also addressed in this thesis is failure analysis based on the stiffness of robot. The effect of the failure in one or more cables or motors is modelled and stiffness maps are developed for the failure situation. It is shown that by changing the anchor position and mobile platform orientation, the lost stiffness after failure of a cable or motor can be retrieved partially. Optimum anchor position and mobile platform orientation are identified to maximize the area of the stiffness map.&#xd;
&#xd;
Condition number of the stiffness matrix while robot is following a trajectory is optimized. In addition, when one cable fails during the path planning, the recovery of the robot is studied. Finally, these analyses on stiffness and failure provide the designer with the necessary and valuable information about the anchor positions and actuator toques.</description>

   <description>Small cells are low-powered radio access nodes that operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum that have a range of 10 meters to 200 meters, compared to a mobile macrocell which might have a range of a few kilometres. This dissertation proposes algorithms for the enhancement of small cells installed in high speed rails. The thesis addresses two main points: the link between the small cell and the base station, and the link between the end-users and the small cell. The channel between the small cell and the base station is a fast fading channel due to the mobility of the high speed rail. The first part of the thesis proposes methods to enhance the link between the small cell and the base station using Low-Density Parity-Check codes (LDPC) for fast fading channels. The proposed uses nonuniform reconstruction methods based on the soft output log-likelihood ratio (LLR) provided by the LDPC decoder. The LLRs provide information about the location of the symbols with high probability of being correct. The grid formed under the assumption&#xd;
of a correlated Rayleigh channel affecting the transmitted data is highly nonuniform. Reconstruction of the channel under such assumptions is highly unstable. A signal-to-noise- ratio dependent regularization method is implemented to enhance the performance under imperfect Doppler spread estimation. The second part of the thesis proposes algorithms for the link between the end-user and the small cell. Since power efficiency is a major factor for end-users employing battery powered devices, we propose a Linear Programming (LP) algorithm for signal shaping to minimize the average transmitted power. The other problem the thesis addresses is the minimization of Peak-to-Average Power-Ratio (PAPR) of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The PAPR is minimized using a set of phase shifts for the constituting subcarriers of the OFDM signal. The set of phase shifts is determined using a LP approach that minimizes the complexity when the block length is high. A real-time implementation of some of the algorithms is carried out using the TMS320C6713 Texas Instruments board. The results for fixed-point versus floating-point implementation is shown for a different number of precision bits.</description>

   <description>In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing efficient machine diagnostics and prognostics tools for quantitative estimation of systems condition and remaining useful life. Often, it is beneficial to combine several measures into a single feature for machine condition monitoring purposes. Selection of appropriate features represents a key step to satisfy machine condition monitoring requirements. Gearboxes represent one of those complex systems where classification of fault stages and types (diagnostics) and remaining useful life prediction (prognostics) remain a challenging task. &#xd;
This thesis focuses on certain aspects of engineering tribology related to gearbox components diagnostics and prognostics based on multi-sensor measurements. A dynamic large-scale mechanical system test-bed has been designed, built, and commissioned. This apparatus is based on the accessory gearbox of the GE J85 turbojet engine, which operates in a number of aircrafts, such as the Canadair CT-114 Tutor. The test rig is equipped with a high speed data acquisition system along with a variety of sensing technologies such as vibration, sound, and acoustic emission transducers in addition to thermocouples, power cells and loading mechanisms.&#xd;
Various attributes are compared for detecting faulty gears and a non-parametric statistical method is used as a quantitative measure of transmission quality. The feature importance level is determined by the significant difference level; and the independent coefficient of the candidate feature is used to compare and rank different time and frequency features. An optimal feature set is then evaluated using the support vector machine classification method by considering a monotonically increasing classification rate. In addition, the selected feature subset has the potential to achieve a better recognition rate than those selected by other heuristic methods such as the mutual information method. &#xd;
This thesis also introduces two metrics which identify the appropriate prognostic feature: load stability ratio and degradation value. The two criteria can be used to compare candidate prognostic features to determine which are most useful for prognosis. An optimization-based method is then used to obtain the optimal feature. The optimized feature can be used with a degradation path modeling to estimate RUL (remaining useful life) for the specific gear system.</description>

   <title>National and International Business Cycles : the Role of Financial Frictions and Shocks</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 22:56:23.03</description>
   <description>This dissertation investigates the effects of frictions that emerge from financial markets on business-cycle fluctuations. The purpose of Chapter 1 is to situate my work in the literature and to stress its contributions. In Chapter 2, I reassess the role of financial frictions in amplifying the impacts of productivity shocks using a framework in which a fraction of firms are borrowing-constrained and land is a collateral asset. A first finding is that amplification effects are much lower when land is supplied elastically. However, financial shocks that affect the maximum allowable ratio of loans to collateral have greater effects on output. Another result pertains to the role of the elasticity of substitution between land and capital in responses to financial shocks: lower values generate greater output responses.&#xd;
&#xd;
While Chapter 2's environment is set up to be in a closed-economy, the last two chapters involve two-country settings. Chapter 3 still intersects with Chapter 2 on some dimensions, in particular, land dynamics and financial frictions that feature borrowing-constrained firms. The borrowing mechanism brings about a distortion in labour markets that interacts with a class of preferences that are non-separable between consumption and leisure. Technology shocks contribute to explain international co-movements, whereas financial shocks allow the model to replicate the lack of international risk sharing that is characterized by the quantity anomaly and the Backus-Smith puzzle.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter 4, I apply Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan’s (2007) business cycle accounting method to a two-country, two-good real business cycle model. Using their approach, I measure the same closed-economy time-varying wedges and I introduce an international wedge that accounts for discrepancies between the growth in real exchange rates and in the stochastic discount factors ratio. In fact, the effects of financial frictions embedded in Chapter 3's framework can be retrieved from a combination of labour and investment wedges. The volatility of the international wedge corresponds to a metric of bilateral risk sharing. An important finding is that, from a non-separable preferences specification of the baseline model, the investment wedge partly accounts for the Backus-Smith puzzle. This suggests that distortions in national capital markets are important to consider for international risk sharing.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis was to determine the feasibility of implementing an intervention tailored to overcome barriers to adherence to recommendations of critical care nutrition guidelines in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The thesis is comprised of four manuscripts.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first manuscript described the development of a 26 item questionnaire rating the importance of potential barriers as impediments to the provision of enteral nutrition (EN) in the ICU. Preliminary evaluation demonstrated acceptable face and content validity and internal reliability, but the test retest reliability and within group reliability were poor for some items.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second manuscript provided evidence to support the construct validity of the developed questionnaire by reporting the results of a multilevel multivariate regression analysis of cross-sectional data from 55 ICUs that demonstrated that a 10 point increase in the overall barrier score was associated with a statistically significant 3.5% (Standard Error (SE) 1.3) decrease in prescribed calories received from EN.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third manuscript provided data to inform whether the intervention should be tailored to site specific barriers by describing the barriers to enterally feeding critically ill patients identified by 138 nurses, and evaluating whether these barriers differed across the 5 participating sites.  Statistically significant differences were found among ICUs for 4 out of the 22 potential barriers.&#xd;
&#xd;
The fourth manuscript described the results of a pretest posttest study involving 5 ICUs in North America and determined that all participating sites successfully developed the tailored intervention.  A statistically significant 10% (Site range -4.3 to -26.0%) decrease in overall barriers score, and a non-significant 6% (Site range -1.5 to17.9%) change in prescribed calories received was observed following the intervention. However, there was variability in the degree of implementation achieved by each site.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Taken together, the results of this thesis demonstrated that adopting a tailored approach to improving nutrition practice is feasible.  However, the findings also resulted in revisions to the barriers questionnaire and modifications to the design of the tailored intervention.  Thus, the next step is to formally test the hypothesis that a tailored intervention designed to address barriers to feeding critically ill patients will improve nutrition performance.</description>

   <description>Kindergarten was originally conceived as a place for young children to playfully participate in self-initiated investigation and creative work to facilitate their development (Froebel, 1967a). However, over time, curricular mandates have shifted from Froebel’s original conception of kindergarten to prescriptive outcomes that have resulted in a more academically oriented curriculum that emphasizes skills and content in segregated subject areas (Russell, 2011; Stipek, 2004). These expectations and the accompanying accountability have led to the development of a different kind of kindergarten driven by a different set of goals (Stipek, 2004). There has been much discussion concerning the impact of shifting expectations on teacher practice (e.g., Goldstein, 2007b). Much of this research has surrounded a singular debate: the tension between the use of developmentally appropriate practices (DAP) and the obligation to teach prescribed curricular goals (e.g., Einarsdottir, 2008). However, this debate focusses solely on two dichotomous instructional logics and, thus, belies the complexities of the kindergarten classroom (Goldstein, 2007a). To gain a deeper understanding of how kindergarten is enacted in the evolving curricular landscape, this research looks beyond the challenges of integrating competing perspectives and into the interconnected factors at play in a classroom. Accordingly, in this study, I use a conceptual lens informed by Schwab’s conception of the eclectic (1971) and the four commonplaces (1973) to examine the multiple factors that contribute to the development of a kindergarten classroom environment. I re-envision the four commonplaces – subject matter, teacher, milieu, and learner – to align them with contemporary conceptions of educational purposes, practical theory, classroom climate, and childhood. Acknowledgement of kindergarten as an eclectic space provides a framework to explore the concurrent inclusion of both academic and developmental orientations. Using an ethnographic approach that integrates data from classroom observations, teacher interviews, and photo elicitation interviews with the students, I robustly describe learning in three full day kindergarten classrooms in Ontario. The data demonstrate that a successful, albeit different, balance between academic learning and developmentally appropriate practices is present in each of these classrooms.</description>

   <description>The psychological concept of attachment began to take hold in the 1950s and 1960s.  This time period also began a significant period of social and legislative change impacting on the field of child protection.  These social science and legal developments have been mutually reinforcing and this thesis examines those developments over the course of the 60 years since Attachment Theory first emerged from the work of John Bowlby.&#xd;
This examination will include a review of the fundamentals of Attachment Theory with a particular focus on the implications of those developmental lessons on the circumstances of children removed from the care of their families due to risk or maltreatment.   Following a review of the fundamentals of Attachment Theory, this examination will review the influence of those principles on the laws of child protection in Ontario – through changes in the legislation and through decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and the Courts of Ontario.&#xd;
Finally, this thesis will examine some of the ways in which the attachment needs of Ontario’s children are being served or failed with regard to both the need for early establishment of permanency for children as well as the continuity of the care arrangements for children up to and including the point at which permanent plans are established.  This examination of the legislation and the case law will demonstrate that Ontario has seen a progressive shift away from family reunification as a fixed priority and toward the examination of each child’s individual developmental needs.  This includes an acceptance of the application of Attachment Theory and its principles as one significant means of describing those needs and assessing the best interests of children.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 03:14:47.731</description>
   <description>This thesis discusses the cultural contributions – artistic patronage, art theory, art satire - of four Ladies-in-Waiting employed at the early eighteenth-century century British court: Mary, Countess Cowper; Charlotte Clayton, Baroness Sundon; Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk; and Mary Hervey, Baroness Hervey of Ickworth. Through a close reading of archival manuscripts, published correspondences and art historical treatises, I explore the cultural milieu, historical legacy and historiographic reception of these individuals. I argue that their writing reveals fresh insight on the switch from Baroque to Rococo modes of portraiture in Britain, as it does critical attitudes to sex, religion and politics among aristocratic women. Through the use of satire, these courtiers comment on extramarital affairs, rape, homosexuality and divorce among their peer group. They also show an interest in issues of feminist education, literature, political and religious patronage, and contemporary news events, which they reference through allusions to painting, architecture, sculpture, engravings, ceramics, textiles and book illustrations. Many of the artists patronized by the court in this period were foreign-born, peripatetic, and stylistically unusual. Partly due to the transnational nature of these artist’s careers, and partly due to the reluctance of later historians to admit the extent of foreign socio-cultural influence, biased judgements about the quality of these émigré painters’ work continue to predominate in art historical scholarship. While little-studied themselves, these Ladies-in-waiting were at the center of political, social and cultural life in Britain. Their letters therefore have much of value in reclaiming, not only their own contributions to the development of British cultural life, but those of the French or Francophile émigré artists patronized at court. By studying the work of these artists and the lives of their patrons, I examine the intersection between biography and artistic practice at the early eighteenth-century British court.</description>

   <description>Large-scale assessments are increasingly being used for more than one purpose, such as admissions, placement, and diagnostic decision-making, with each additional use requiring validation regardless of previous studies investigating other purposes. Despite this increased multiplicity of test use, there is limited validation research on adding diagnostic purposes—with the intention of directly benefiting teaching and learning—to existing large-scale assessments designed for high-stakes decision-making. A challenge with validating diagnostic purposes is to adequately balance investigations into the score interpretations and the intended beneficial consequences for teachers and students. The Assessment Use Argument (AUA) makes explicit these internal and consequential validity questions through a two-stage validation argument (Bachman &amp; Palmer, 2010). This research adopted the AUA to examine the appropriateness of the Canadian Academic English Language (CAEL) Assessment for diagnostic purposes, by forming a validity argument that asked, to what extent did the CAEL essay meet the new diagnostic scoring challenges from the rater perspective, and a utilization argument centered on teachers' and students’ uses of the diagnostic information obtained from the assessment. This study employed three research phases at an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program in one Canadian university. Data collection strategies included interview and verbal protocol data from two raters (Phase 1), interview and classroom observation data from one EAP course instructor (Phase 2), and interview and open-ended survey data from 47 English Language Learners (Phase 3). A multifaceted perception of CAEL for diagnostic purposes was observed: raters noted the greatest diagnostic potential at higher score levels, and teacher and student perceptions were largely influenced by previous diagnostic assessment experiences. This research emphasized the necessity of including multiple perspectives across contexts to form a deeper realization of the inferences and decisions made from diagnostic results.</description>

   <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of Stimuli-Responsive Block Copolymers</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 12:25:54.593</description>
   <description>This thesis reports the preparation of novel multi-responsive and multiply stimulable triblock copolymers.  The resultant polymers were used to coat cotton fabrics and glass to render them amphiphobic.  Further, a method was developed for the preparation of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PHEMA) via anionic polymerization.&#xd;
	The multi-responsive copolymer refers to poly(ethylene glycol)-orthonitrobenzyl-poly[2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoloxyethyl methacrylate) (PEG-ONB-PFOEMA-b-PCEMA, or P1).  P1 was synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of FOEMA and a precursory monomer of CEMA using a PEG macroinitiator.  The copolymer was multi-responsive or dual light-responsive because the ONB junction cleaves and PCEMA block becomes crosslinked upon UV photolysis.  The multiply stimulable copolymers are a series of poly(ethylene glycol)-disulfide-poly[2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoloxyethyl methacrylate) (PEG-S2-PFOEMA-b-PCEMA) copolymers.  These polymers were synthesized by the end-coupling Py-S2-PFOEMA-b-PHEMA and PEG-SH, and subsequent cinnamation of the PHEMA block.  These polymers are multiply stimulable because the S2 junction and PCEMA block respond to different stimulations, such as reducing agents and light, respectively.  These synthetic strategies will advance the field of stimuli-responsive polymers by providing novel functional polymers for the generation of durable self-cleaning surfaces.&#xd;
The above polymers form micelles in water or water/organic solvent mixtures because of the water-soluble PEG blocks.  Polymer-coated cotton was obtained by immersing cotton in micellar copolymer solutions before subsequent drying and annealing treatment.  Upon photolysis, the PEG block was cleaved and the PCEMA anchoring layer became crosslinked.  Such a crosslinked and stable layer was rendered amphiphobic because of the exposed PFOEMA block.  A similar coating can be obtained from P2.  Two types of stimulations including photolysis and reduction treatment need to be applied to yield amphiphobic textiles.  This coating strategy is unique and environmentally friendly because the water- and oil-repellent coatings were prepared from an aqueous solution for the first time.  &#xd;
		In a further study, a novel and long-sought method was developed for the anionic polymerization of PEG-b-PHEMA.  A PEG-DPE macroinitiator was synthesized and subsequently converted into an active initiator by reaction with sec-butyl lithium.  Consequently, the active initiator underwent polymerization with HEMA-TMS to yield PEG-b-P(HEMA-TMS).  Upon post-polymerization modification, PEG-b-PHEMA was obtained with a low polydispersity of 1.08.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I undertake a study of rapid condominium growth occurring in the City of Toronto, Canada, and the emergence of an ultra-luxury condominium market during a time of global financial instability. This thesis examines the influence of rapid growth on Toronto as a world city during this time by asking the following research questions:&#xd;
1. Why has Toronto become a place of safe investment for condominium buyers during a time of global economic uncertainty?&#xd;
2. Why has the ultra-luxury market emerged in Toronto? What are the driving forces behind it, how does it contribute to Toronto’s standing as a world city, and what does the future hold for this niche market?&#xd;
3. What is the current state of the condominium market in Toronto and what can we expect to see happen in the near future?&#xd;
To answer these questions, this thesis draws insights from urban, political, economic and social geographic literature, statistical and policy data, as well as twenty-five (25) semi- structured interviews with a variety of key industry stakeholders in the City of Toronto. The results of this study point to a changing demographic landscape in a city where fundamental elements have not only secured Toronto’s reputation as a place of safe investment, but also created an environment of pent up demand leading to the emergence of the ultra-luxury condominium market. The City of Toronto has garnered international attention for its rapid rate of high-rise growth, and continues to craft its reputation as a world city through the addition of four, 5-star hotel condominiums. Additionally, this thesis recognizes the pressing social, environmental and political issues that accompany this recent, rapid growth, and provides general recommendations for addressing these complex topics through the suggestion of future research on the topic.</description>

   <description>Photonic crystal (PtC) cavities are an increasingly important way to create all optical methods to control optical data. Not only must the data be controlled, but interfacing it with high frequency electrical signals is particularly interesting especially if this occurs in the 1.55µm telecom band. We present an experiment that uses Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to modulate the frequency of the guided mode of an L3-cavity PtC created on a silicon slab. This work has the potential to interface optical and electrical signals via a mechanical strain wave operating at gigahertz frequencies.&#xd;
  Defects are carefully designed into a triangular lattice PtC to realize a waveguide coupled optical cavity. The cavity can be experimentally accessed through grating couplers excited by polarized light at 10 degrees incidence from normal. The optical components are fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with light confined to the silicon slab region. Through transmission experiments, the L3 cavity was found to have a narrow resonance characterized by a Lorentzian distribution. A quality factor of 165 centered at 6255 1/cm (1.599µm) was measured.&#xd;
  Aluminum interdigitated transducers (IDTs) were fabricated through a lithography liftoff process. Their ability to create SAWs requires a piezoelectric medium. As silicon does not have this property, growth of a thin ZnO film was required. The transducers were measured using a network analyzer and were found to produce Rayleigh SAWs at a frequency of 179MHz and a wavelength of 24µm. The acoustic energy traveled 70µm to the target optical device. The L3 cavity has dimensions of around 4µm a side - less than 1/2 a SAW wavelength.&#xd;
  Modulation of the L3 PtC resonant frequency was monitored through a repeat of the transmission experiment but with RF excitation of the IDTs at the SAW frequency. A broadening of the transmission spectrum was expected. Unfortunately no change in the fitting parameters could be measured. An HF etch was used to undercut the L3 PtC such that a silicon slab suspended in air could be realized. Simulations had been conducted showing an order of magnitude increase in the quality factor was possible. Broken wirebonds on the transducers created unintended etch channels rendering the SAW non-operational.</description>

   <title>In Situ Stress Estimation Methods and the Integration of Numerical Modelling for Stress Reconstruction and Future Stress Evolution</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 13:26:53.082</description>
   <description>A reliable estimation of in situ stress orientation and magnitude is necessary for determining wellbore stability in the oil and gas industry, or assessing excavation stability for mining and civil engineering projects.  Methods of stress estimation in deep borehole investigations are generally limited to the use of hydraulic methods or borehole imaging techniques, which identify borehole breakouts and/or borehole deformation.  However, the collection of data in a thrust regime, or in horizontally laminated ground, can be difficult and lead to unreliable results.  Moreover, the back analysis of stress magnitude from both hydraulic methods and borehole imaging methods are sensitive to estimates of strength and elastic properties around the borehole.  &#xd;
This research has shown that the magnitude of the axial stress relative to the stresses normal to the borehole axis contributes to the magnitude and distribution of maximum deviatoric stress experienced around an advancing borehole.  Furthermore, an analysis of the stress path incorporating the complete stress tensor shows that the maximum deviatoric stress does not always correlate with the typical solutions for induced stresses around a circular excavation.&#xd;
As a result of the limitations and uncertainties associated with traditional stress estimation methods, an integrated approach to determining the stress conditions at a given site using numerical models to simulate the loading history has been evaluated.  A 2-dimensional finite element model of the Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of the eastern edge of the Michigan basin has shown that a systematic incorporation of the geological and stress history can approximate a given stress profile.  Numerical models are also applied for estimating the magnitude of glacially induced stress change in the upper crust for the purpose of estimating long-term stress evolution.  The framework and methodology used for numerical stress reconstruction and evolution can be included at the site characterization and engineering design stages for various types of projects, including deep geologic repositories, where estimates of in situ stress and future stress change are important.</description>

   <description>Exploring the main factors that determine bond spreads with respect to Treasury rates is one of the most critical issues in the corporate debt market. Credit risk has long been perceived as the most important determinant of bond spreads (Fisher, 1959). One of the most critical parameters in credit risk models is asset volatility, which includes idiosyncratic and systematic components. However, these models do not distinguish between them. Chapter 2 investigates the impact of idiosyncratic volatility on bond portfolio spreads between 2000 and 2010. While the prediction of traditional asset pricing models is that firm-specific risk should be diversified away at aggregate level, I find idiosyncratic volatility plays an incremental role in explaining bond portfolio spreads beyond the market factors. &#xd;
Recovery is an important measurement of credit risk additional to default probability. Chapter 3 focuses on the estimation of firm recovery after bankruptcy using the Leland and Toft (1996) model. Using a large sample of Chapter 11 filings from 1996 to 2007, I find that the recovery derived from the Leland and Toft model has strong explanatory power on the debt recovery observed in the market. &#xd;
Recent literature finds that all extant credit risk models significantly underestimate bond spreads, especially for investment grade bonds of short maturity. Chapter 4 identifies a heretofore ignored component, perceived accounting misstatement, by regressing bond spreads on the proxy of accounting misstatement propensity, while controlling for issuers’ default risk and bond illiquidity risk between January 1994 and June 2002. &#xd;
My thesis deepens the understanding of bond price discovery mechanisms and presents an important challenge for future research to incorporate the strong empirical relationship between idiosyncratic volatility and bond yields in asset pricing models. My thesis also sheds light on the accurate prediction of debt recovery, which is important to the valuation and hedging of risky debt and credit derivatives. Furthermore, my thesis assists in solving the credit spread puzzle by identifying a new risk factor. Overall, my thesis provides new insights into research on the corporate debt market and has important implications for academic scholars and market practitioners.</description>

   <title>Risk of Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline Project to Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus)</title>

   <description>Eulachon, (Thaleichthys pacificus), is an anadromous species that spawns in the Kitimat River, British Columbia.  The proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline travels alongside this waterway and will put this species at risk.  Eulachon are a unique species, and are important to freshwater and riparian ecosystems.  Spawning runs occur at the end of winter, and they provide marine-derived nutrients that are essential to the functioning of these ecosystems.  Species such as bears, gulls, eagles, and piscivorous fish all rely on eulachon for sustenance.  The status of the central BC population of eulachon is “critically endangered”, with Kitimat River populations being “virtually extirpated” with fewer than 1000 members per run.  Since 1992, eulachon runs of the Kitimat River have dropped substantially, and an oil spill at the most inopportune time could potentially eliminate this population.  Haisla First Nations rely on eulachon runs for food, social, and ceremonial purposes.  The elimination of these populations would have devastating effects on their way of life.  The pipeline project puts eulachon at risk during all life stages; eulachon may be exposed as embryos incubating in the Kitimat River, as juveniles in the Kitimat Arm of the Douglas Channel, or as spawning adults running up the Douglas Channel.  Should there be a tanker spill in the ocean, adult eulachon may also be exposed.  There has been no research into the toxicological effects of crude oil or bitumen on eulachon during any life stage.  Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are three species that are most similar to eulachon.  Toxicity of crude oil to pink salmon and Pacific herring embryos is observed at concentrations as low as 18 µg/L and 0.4 µg/L respectively. Liver lesions are observed in pink salmon juveniles exposed to ≥ 25 µg/L crude oil.  Adult Pacific herring exposed to crude oil exhibit immunosuppression.  Eulachon may have similar effects upon exposure to diluted bitumen.</description>

   <description>This dissertation is a comprehensive and analytical study of drawings and prints produced by artists and architects between the fifteenth and early seventeenth centuries showing Roman ruins. The unprecedented interest in classical antiquity that emerged in the fifteenth century, which came to define the artistic, architectural, and cultural evolution of the Renaissance, was the catalyst for the production of such ruin-based images, of which thousands of examples survive. Because these drawings and prints were all inspired by and depict Roman ruins, they have often been treated as a single, cohesive genre of image. In this dissertation, however, these ruin-based images are categorized as architectural or archaeological studies, vedute of ruinous land- or cityscapes, architectural treatise and guidebook illustrations, topographical maps, and imaginative reconstructions of antique monuments. They are examined according to distinct criteria such as media, methods of representation, and the different purposes for the creation of said works. As a result, a better understanding of the complexities of early modern antiquarian interests is revealed, especially in regards to the contributions of artists and architects to the early study of ancient architecture. This dissertation addresses how artists and architects were innately fascinated with the architectural remains of ancient Rome, and how the medium of drawing proved to be the ideal method for studying, understanding, and interpreting ruins. The reciprocal relationship between artists, architects, and antiquarians is also addressed with the result that many extant ruin-based images found in museums and art collections throughout the world can now be understood as an integral part of a widespread antiquarian movement that shaped the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, especially in Rome.</description>

   <description>This dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive study of Francesco Salviati’s portraits, analyzed within a chronological framework.   Traditional attributions are re-examined and recent discoveries included to establish a reliable core group of the artist’s portraits, one exhibiting a stylistic coherence.    &#xd;
Salviati’s activities as a portraitist are placed in the historical, political, cultural and artistic context of his time, with particular emphasis on patronage.   Versatile and well-connected, Francesco served a number of top-ranking patrons of his time, including Cardinal Giovanni Salviati, Pier Luigi and Alessandro Farnese (in Rome), Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici (in Florence), the Grimani family (in Venice), King Henri II, and the Cardinal of Lorraine in France.   This study intends to navigate portraiture’s role in the relationships between the courtier-artist and his princely patrons.     &#xd;
Characterized by innovation and experimentation, Salviati’s portraits vary in composition, media and supports.    As one of the earliest artists to produce portrait miniatures in Italy, Francesco evidently introduced the genre to Cosimo I de’ Medici’s court to create an aura of a royal court equal to that in France and England.  His experiments with the use of various  stone supports for portraits are discussed in relation to his status as the leading painter in Rome after the death of Sebastiano del Piombo in 1547.           &#xd;
 Lastly, the artist’s career as a book illustrator is explored to shed light on his interactions with well-known literati of his time, such as Pietro Aretino, Anton Francesco Doni and Giambattista Gelli.  The designs Salviati provided for their author portraits are not only testimony to their acquaintance, but also evidence of the artist’s participation in their intellectual communities.</description>

   <description>Defects in haemostasis, specifically in the quantitative or qualitative properties of von Willebrand factor (VWF), result in the most commonly inherited bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD). Of the three types of VWD, type 1 is the most common and has the mildest phenotype. Type 1 VWD has a symptomatic prevalence of approximately 1 in 1000, but a much smaller number of patients who are actually diagnosed. This discrepancy is a result of a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria. The objective of the Self-Administered Bleeding Assessment Tool (Self-BAT) Study is to develop and optimize, a standardized, self-administered BAT to quantify bleeding history, and to distinguish between normal and abnormal bleeding.&#xd;
In Phase 1 of the study, the medical terminology in the expert-administered ISTH BAT was changed to a grade four reading level to produce the first version of the Self-BAT. Three subsequent versions of the Self-BAT were generated during optimization based on focus group feedback and statistical analysis. The Self-BAT was administered to a total of 38 control subjects and 20 subjects affected with type 1 VWD in Phase 1. Demographic information on all the subjects (gender, age) was collected and blood was drawn for determination of VWF antigen level, VWF ristocetin cofactor activity and factor VIII level. Bleeding scores calculated from the ISTH BAT and Self-BAT showed an excellent correlation of 0.869 in the final version.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Phase 2 of the study, the Self-BAT was administered to 27 control subjects and 23 affected subjects with the objective to simplify the questionnaire by identifying questions which can discriminate between unaffected and affected subjects. It was determined through category-total, category-category and item-item correlations that there was not sufficient evidence to reduce the Self-BAT.&#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, the Self-BAT functions as a simple and effective tool to distinguish between normal and abnormal bleeding and is suitable for adults to administer themselves. The Self-BAT has now moved on to prospective validation studies where it will be tested on subjects who have been referred to tertiary care, but not yet received a diagnosis, in order to test its ability to distinguish between normal individuals and those affected with type 1 VWD and, potentially, other mild bleeding disorders.</description>

   <subject>Transition</subject>
   <description>The aim of this workshop series was to create a First-Year Transition Program designed to attain help Commerce students achieve first-year success. The workshops were designed based on current student success literature surrounding academic, social, and motivational issues, and the needs of the students in the Commerce program at Queen’s University. The series includes four workshops: 1. Academic success boot camp, 2. Do I have time for a life?, 3. OMG my grades have dropped? Now what?, and 4. Reboot. Each workshop is designed to be offered at a different time during the first year of the program. The topics were chosen to advise students of important information that pertains to them at the particular point in time at which the workshop is being offered. The goal is that the students will attend to and process the information in the workshops because it applies to them at that moment and will help ease their transition.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 17:52:00.165</description>
   <description>Synchronous distributed groupware is a class of software applications allowing a geographically distributed group of people to collaborate in real time. There are different types of groupware, e.g., collaborative editing software, distributed meeting support tools, and multiplayer games. However, collaborators in groupware can become disconnected from the session. Disconnections can range in duration from a few seconds (e.g., due to a network outage) to hours or days (e.g., stowing a laptop while flying). Disconnection causes information loss and makes it difficult for users to understand both the state of the workspace and the current activities of other people upon reconnection. Thus, it is important to handle disconnection in groupware. However, handling disconnection is difficult for groupware developers. They need to determine varieties of strategies in order to address different disconnection scenarios. These strategies determine how stored information can be manipulated as the system waits for a disconnected user to rejoin, and how information should be replayed upon reconnection. If disconnection lasts for a long time, developers need to select and combine strategies in order to manage a trade-off between performance requirements (e.g., delivering stored information as quickly as possible upon reconnection) and understandability requirements (e.g., allowing users to watch missed information in an understandable manner). Developers might not know how to implement such strategies in a reusable manner. Because of this lack of knowledge in handling disconnection, developers might build disconnection-aware groupware applications that will not address the range of wide variety of user-level requirements that arise from different disconnection scenarios. Moreover, as there are a few disconnection-aware groupware applications, developers might not know the overhead (e.g., additional message transmission time, memory usage and programming complexity) of handling disconnection in synchronous groupware in practice. In order to mitigate developers’ problems to handle disconnection in synchronous groupware, this thesis provides codified solutions that capture and organize a wide range of strategies for handling disconnection, that manage the performance and understandability trade-off through selecting and combining suitable strategies and that show how to implement the strategies in a reusable manner. In order to determine the overhead of handling disconnection, a toolkit is developed following the designed solutions, and different applications are constructed using the toolkit. User studies and performance analyses are conducted that evaluate the toolkit and demonstrate its quality goals, such as offering simple application programming interface (API), high performance, and supporting different disconnection scenarios and timeframes.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 17:59:57.43</description>
   <description>Laser welding was investigated as a potential joining technology for alumina ceramic substrates. The objective of this study was to develop a method to preheat the ceramic using a single defocused laser beam prior to welding.&#xd;
Engineering ceramics are employed in a variety of systems and environments due to their unique properties. Joining technologies must be developed to facilitate the manufacture of complex or large ceramic components. Laser welding is advantageous as it forms joints rapidly, and does not introduce intermediate materials to form the bond, which can have deleterious effects.&#xd;
The Laser Machining System (LMS) at Queen’s University was adapted for this study. A defocused far-infrared (FIR) laser beam was positioned to overlay a focused near-infrared (NIR) laser beam; the defocused FIR beam preheated the ceramic substrate and the focused NIR beam formed the weld. A finite element model was developed in COMSOL MultiPhysics to simulate the preheating processes and to develop a preheating protocol. The protocol was implemented using the FIR beam and adjusted to achieve preheating temperatures of 1450, 1525, and 1600degC. Welds were performed on 1 mm thick alumina plates using the preheating protocols and NIR beam powers of 25, 50, and 75 W. Weld speed was held constant throughout the study at 0.5 mm/s.&#xd;
The preheating protocols were successful at achieving near-constant preheating temperatures, with standard deviations below 32 degrees. Partially penetrating welds were formed with the NIR beam at 25 W, and fully penetrating welds at 50 and 75 W. Large pores were present in the 25 W and 50 W welds. Minimal porosity was observed in the welds formed at 75 W. All of the welded plates experienced a transverse fracture that extended perpendicular to weld, and a longitudinal fracture extending parallel to the weld.&#xd;
This study shows that a fixed defocused laser beam can successfully preheat alumina substrates to the high temperatures required for welding; however, non-homogenous cooling results in fracture. Increasing the preheating beam diameter or introducing an auxiliary means to provide a controlled cool-down cycle may mitigate these effects.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-29 22:12:43.675</description>
   <description>In this thesis, we explore the hidden risks in a firm’s real operating process and the financial adjustments made as the risk changes. We investigate the risks associated with a firm’s vertical channel (chapter 2 and 3) and geographic location (chapter 4), and analyze what financial consequences these risks bring. We firstly show strong evidence that a firm’s cost of equity decreases as supplier immobility translates into a decrease in operating leverage and systematic risk. Next, we show that as the specificity of customers induces more cash flow instability, the firm’s idiosyncratic risk increases with customer specificity. As a result, firms with more specific customers choose more conservative dividend payout policies to adjust for the risk changes. In the third essay, we examine the information risk from firm’s geographic location. We find that this information risk affects a firm’s capital structure choice and that centrally located firms have lower leverage ratios than do remotely located ones.</description>

   <description>The use of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites for strengthening reinforced concrete structures has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, before FRPs can be implemented in interior building applications their performance during fire must be assessed and understood. There currently remains a paucity of information in this area for most currently available FRP strengthening systems. This thesis presents a study of the mechanical and bond properties of selected currently available FRP strengthening systems for concrete structures at elevated temperatures such as might be experienced during a fire. Testing has been performed and is reported to study the continuous unidirectional coupon tensile strength, lap-splice FRP-to- FRP shear bond strength and tensile elastic modulus at elevated temperatures. Results of thermal characterization tests are also completed in an attempt to relate properties of the polymer matrix, such as the glass transition temperature, and thermal decomposition temperature to the losses of strength and stiffness observed for FRP coupons during steady-state and transient exposure to elevated temperatures up to 200oC. A simple analytical model is presented, for which the input parameters can be determined using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, to describe the reduction in mechanical and bond properties of the FRP systems at elevated temperatures. Based on this testing and subsequent analysis it is recommended that a conservative limit on the allowable temperature exposure for FRP systems during fire be set as the glass transition temperature measured using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. Furthermore it is suggested that differential scanning calorimetry may not be an appropriate method of determining the glass transition temperature for available FRP systems used in concrete strengthening applications.</description>

   <description>The provision of high quality, clean water is of paramount importance to both human public health and the welfare of all biodiversity. Maintaining this quality also helps to promote sustainability of water globally through programs involving public health, watershed (ecosystem) protection, water-resource management and water governance and regulation. These initiatives allow for more effective risk assessment and management of the world’s usable water supply. Pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa which are present in faecal-contaminated water have always been a major threat to human health. Monitoring every single pathogen present in water is impractical, therefore the use of microbial water-quality indicators has been recommended. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus sp. are the main microbial indicators used for assessing fresh and marine water (recreational water), respectively. E. coli testing is conducted all over the world and there are good tests readily available, but tests for Enterococcus are limited, even though these bacteria are often better indicators of faecal contamination. We are developing an Enterococcus test by adapting technology that was developed at Queen’s University for detecting E. coli and Total coliforms. Different growth media types were used and Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) was found to be the most effective media for the Enterococcus test and can be used at full strength or half strength. The test was optimized for temperature; 41oC elicited the best results. In order to promote selective Enterococcus growth, different antibiotics were administered.  It was found that 6 mg / L of amikacin in half strength THB was optimal to make the THB media selective to Enterococcus in the presence of potentially interfering E. coli bacteria. This novel test will complement the tools already available for global water-quality monitoring, thereby promoting sustainable water-use, and thus enhancing the protection of the public’s health.</description>

   <description>With superior longevity, approximately 5 times that of compact fluorescents (CFLs), and high efficacy, around 1.5 times that of CFLs, LEDs are now attracting vast attention from both academic and industrial sectors. Unfortunately, current power supply drivers for LEDs have the following drawbacks: (1) for a two-stage configuration, the power factor correction (PFC) circuit can help LEDs achieve good operating performance but contain too many components and are large in size, have low efficiency and relatively high cost; (2) a single-stage configuration can perform well in PFC and efficiency, however reliability issues occur due to the use of the electrolytic capacitor. &#xd;
        In this thesis, the theoretical analysis and implementation of two high power factor, soft-switched, electrolytic-capacitor-less LED drivers are presented. The two drivers solve the aforementioned issues while minimizing its size and cost. The detailed theoretical analysis illustrates the advantages of the presented circuits and provides insight into their design and operation. The simulated and experimental implementations verified the performance of both circuits, which achieve a high power factor, indicating that the drivers have good operating performance. Elimination of the electrolytic capacitors improves the LED drivers’ reliability. In addition, with the help of soft-switching capability, high efficiency is achieved. Simulation and experimental results are presented to support all merits of the two circuits.</description>

   <title>NEU1 Sialidase and Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Cross-Talk is Essential for Toll-Like Receptor Activation and Cellular Signaling</title>

   <description>The molecular mechanism(s) by which Toll-like receptors become activated are not well understood. For the majority of TLR receptors, dimerization is a prerequisite to facilitate MyD88-TLR complex formation and subsequent cellular signaling to activate NF-κB. However, the parameters controlling interactions between the receptors and their ligands still remain poorly defined. Previous reports have identified that neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) is an important intermediate in the initial process of TLR ligand induced receptor activation and subsequent cell function. What we do not yet understand is how NEU1 is activated following TLR ligand binding. In this thesis, the findings disclose a receptor signaling paradigm involving a process of receptor ligand-induced GPCR-signaling via neuromedin-B (NMBR) Gα-proteins, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation, and the induction of Neu1 activation. Central to this process is that NEU1–MMP-9-NMBR complex is associated with TLR-4 receptors on the cell surface of naive primary macrophages and TLR-expressing cell lines. Ligand binding to the receptor initiate GPCR-signaling via GPCR Gα subunit proteins and MMP-9 activation to induce NEU1. Activated NEU1 targets and hydrolyzes sialyl α-2-3-linked to β-galactosyl residues at the ectodomain of TLRs, enabling the removal of steric hindrance to receptor association, activation of receptors and cellular signaling.  Furthermore, a novel glycosylation model is uncovered for the activation of nucleic acid sensing intracellular TLR-7 and TLR-9 receptors. It discloses an identical signaling paradigm as described for the cell-surface TLRs. NEU1 and MMP9 cross-talk in alliance with neuromedin-B receptors tethered to TLR-7 and -9 receptors at the ectodomain is essential for ligand activation of the TLRs and pro-inflammatory responses. However, the mechanism(s) behind this GPCR and TLR cross-talk has not been fully defined. Here, GPCR agonists mediate GPCR-signaling via membrane Gα subunit proteins to induce NEU1 and MMP-9 cross-talk at the TLR ectodomain on the cell surface. This molecular organizational GPCR signaling platform is proposed to be an initial processing stage for GPCR agonist-induced transactivation of TLRs and subsequent cellular signaling. Collectively, these novel findings radically redefine the current dogma(s) governing the mechanism(s) of the interaction of TLRs and their ligands, which may provide important pioneering approaches to disease intervention strategies.</description>

   <title>A Critical Review of the Inputs to Long Range Mine Planning of Open Pit Porphyry Type Copper Deposits</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-30 12:57:12.084</description>
   <description>Long term planning is the process used by a mining organization to develop a strategic business plan. The plan describes how the ore is going to be extracted over the mine life. As such, it is routinely updated in order to declare annual reserves, evaluate options and react to changes in the initial assumptions.  Inputs into this planning process are the parameters that drive profitability. &#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of this research is to understand and document the open pit long range planning process in current use by mining operations, isolate the input parameters that feed into this process, and conduct a critical review of these parameters in an effort to develop a more robust plan.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis also searches for answers to the following questions: Can the copper metal price be correlated to a factor (or a set of factors)? Can the price be predicted? How useful is the work of O’Hara and Taylor in predicting the mine life and milling rate at the scoping study stage? How can the pit by pit graph be used to better guide the selection of the ultimate pit? Is there a realized benefit from operating at an elevated cutoff grade strategy with low grade copper porphyry deposits? &#xd;
&#xd;
The research concludes with a proposal (not common in the industry) for the selection of the metal price as an input into the mine planning process. This approach, if implemented, can give a corporation a dominant position in the future. The research also presents a modified approach for the selection of the ultimate pit. Furthermore, the use of Taylor’s rule in predicting the mine life was tested and verified on an open pit copper porphyry deposit and the benefits of operating at an elevated cutoff grade strategy was demonstrated for the deposit.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-30 12:38:44.0</description>
   <description>RFID technology has attracted much attention due to its wide range of applications, such as inventory control and object tracking. Passive RFID tags are battery-less, mobile and lack intercommunication. Hence, they require a central node (the reader) to power them up, organize their replies, and read their data. In the last decade, several proposals have targeted the channel efficiency in RFID systems to improve time and power efficiencies. While such proposals achieve significant performance improvements, they are limited by the backscattering half-duplex channel in which the reader has to wait for the tag to finish its reply (even if the reply is corrupt or redundant).&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, the Modulation Silencing Mechanism (MSM) is proposed as a novel full-duplex-like communication over half-duplex RFID links. With a simple additional circuit at the tag and upgraded software algorithms at the reader, the reader is capable of terminating the tag's non-useful transmissions. Consequently, we propose three schemes that utilize MSM in key application domains where the tag-reader transaction contains a considerable amount of non-useful transmissions. MSM is utilized to enhance tag identification, tag count estimation and tag authentication.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, we propose a Modulation Silencing Anti-collision (MSA) scheme that targets collision time reduction in time slotted anti-collision protocols. In MSA, the time requirements of state of the art identification protocols are significantly reduced. Moreover, we establish a backward compatibility procedure for proper identification of legacy and MSM-enabled tags. Secondly, a Variance- Modulation Silencing Estimation (VMSE) scheme is proposed to increase tag estimation accuracy and to minimize overall estimation time. Variance-to-mean ratio estimator is proposed to determine the most accurate tag count estimate. VMSE combines both, the accuracy of the variance-to-mean ratio estimator and the time efficiency of MSM and delivers rapid, accurate, and anonymous tag estimation that outperform recent estimation schemes for small and large scale tag deployment. Finally, we propose Unique Hash Sequence Authentication (UHSA) scheme for efficient tag authentication. The UHSA is based on hashed key prefetching algorithm at the reader augmented by the MSM circuitry at the tag. UHSA scheme provides higher time efficiency and robustness against tracking and compromising attacks.</description>

   <description>The use of a standalone Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has proved to be insufficient when navigating indoors or in urban canyons due to multipath or obstruction. Recent technological advances in low cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) – based sensors (like accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers) enabled the development of sensor-based navigation systems. Although MEMS sensors are low-cost, lightweight, small size, and have low-power consumption, they have complex error characteristics. Accurate computation of the heading angle (azimuth) is one of the most important aspects of any navigation system. It can be computed either by gyroscopes or magnetometers. Gyroscopes are inertial sensors that can provide the angular rate from which the heading can be calculated, however, their outputs drift with time. Moreover, the accumulated errors due to mathematical integration, performed to obtain the heading angle, lead to large heading errors. On the other hand, magnetometers do not suffer from drift and the calculation of heading does not suffer from error accumulation. They can provide an absolute heading from the magnetic north by sensing the earth’s magnetic field. However, magnetometer readings are usually affected by magnetic fields, other than the earth magnetic field, and by other error sources; therefore magnetometer calibration is required to use magnetometer as a reliable source of heading in navigation applications.&#xd;
In this thesis, a framework for fast magnetometer calibration is proposed. This framework requires little space coverage with no user involvement in the calibration process, and does not need specific movements to be performed. The proposed techniques are capable of performing both 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) calibration for magnetometers. They are developed to consider different scenarios suitable for different applications, and can benefit from natural device movements. Some applications involve tethering the magnetometers to the moving platform (like in cars and machinery applications). Other applications are related to portable navigation (smartphone navigation, whether for pedestrians or while driving). The developed framework was examined through experimental work to verify its performance and robustness.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-01 20:26:56.981</description>
   <description>SNOLAB located in Sudbury, Canada, is hosting a new liquid scintillator experiment&#xd;
for studying neutrinos which is called SNO+. Many interesting physics topics such as&#xd;
measuring low energy solar neutrinos and searching for neutrinoless double beta decay&#xd;
are expected to be performed using the SNO+ detector. SNO+ is designed to measure&#xd;
the solar neutrino &#xd;
flux at a lower energy range than SNO, and therefore it is able to&#xd;
study LMA-MSW oscillations at this range of energy. This research is concerned with&#xd;
extracting low energy 8B solar neutrinos while studying the tagging and reduction of&#xd;
214Bi by 99.8%, one of the main backgrounds in the energy range of interest. Ways&#xd;
to measure and control radon were also studied since it is the source of the 214Bi&#xd;
background. Scintillation material, zinc sulfide, was selected for use in fabrication of&#xd;
radon detectors known as Lucas cells. The fabrication of cover gas bags employed in&#xd;
the SNO+ experiment to react to mine air pressure &#xd;
fluctuations is described and the&#xd;
interior radon emanation of these bags was measured and calculated.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, microelectrode arrays of micropumps have been designed, fabricated and characterized for transporting microfluid by AC electro-osmosis (ACEO). In particular, the 3D stepped electrode design which shows superior performance to others in literature is adopted for making micropumps, and the performance of such devices has been studied and explored. A novel fabrication process has also been developed in the work, realizing 3D stepped electrodes on a flexible substrate, which is suitable for biomedical use, for example glaucoma implant. &#xd;
&#xd;
There are three major contributions to ACEO pumping in the work. First, a novel design of 3D “T-shaped” discrete electrode arrays was made using PolyMUMPs® process. The breakthrough of this work was discretizing the continuous 3D stepped electrodes which were commonly seen in the past research. The “T-shaped” electrodes did not only create ACEO flows on the top surfaces of electrodes but also along the side walls between separated electrodes. Secondly, four 3D stepped electrode arrays were designed, fabricated and tested. It was found from the experiment that PolyMUMPs® ACEO electrodes usually required a higher driving voltage than gold electrodes for operation. It was also noticed that a simulation based on the modified model taking into account the surface oxide of electrodes showed a better agreement with the experimental results. It thus demonstrated the possibility that the surface oxide of electrodes had impact on fluidic pumping. This methodology could also be applied to metal electrodes with a native oxide layer such as titanium and aluminum. Thirdly, a prototype of the ACEO pump with 3D stepped electrode arrays was first time realized on a flexible substrate using Kapton polyimide sheets and packaged with PDMS encapsulants. Comprehensive experimental testing was also conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties as well as the pumping performance. The experimental findings indicated that this fabrication process was a promising method to create flexible ACEO pumps that can be used as medical implants and wearable devices.</description>

   <description>The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a networking paradigm where entities are viewed as objects that are identifiable, traceable and connected. This view requires the integration and interoperability of numerous wireless standards. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are two dominant technologies that jointly constitute a class of hybrid/integrated IoT architectures known as RFID-Sensor Networks (RSNs). &#xd;
Data delivery across such integrated architectures faces challenges in terms of cost-efficiency, scalability and connectivity, among many others. Moreover, IoT-driven solutions are required to address constraints on node mobility, delay-tolerance and resource management, and may have to adhere to an economic model in order to establish incentive-based schemes. Most available RSN solutions are tailored for a single-application and fail to address the aforementioned IoT constraints. To the best of our knowledge, a detailed framework that comprehensively addresses such constraints does not exist. We investigate this promising research direction by proposing a novel framework that incorporates an RSN integrated architecture to improve delivery over heterogeneous topologies. Our framework provides data delivery solutions that adhere to delivery and connectivity considerations of integrated RSN architectures in IoT. Moreover, our data delivery solutions incorporate pricing policies for incentive public sensing applications over the proposed architecture. We show, by theoretical analysis and simulations, that our framework outperforms rival RSN integration approaches, as well as other wireless Ad-hoc data delivery schemes in realizing IoT performance requirements.</description>

   <description>Purpose&#xd;
The purpose of this enquiry is to explore the symptom experience and the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children who have survived a brain tumour. &#xd;
&#xd;
Design&#xd;
An emergent, mixed-method study design was used with three phases of inquiry.&#xd;
1) A systematic review was undertaken of previous research on the HRQL outcomes and symptom experience of children who have survived a brain tumour. &#xd;
2) A quantitative study of the relationship between symptom experience and HRQL in 50 children who have survived a pediatric brain tumour was completed. This study was followed by a qualitative study of 12 children that used an interpretive descriptive methodology to understand the perceived relationship between symptom experience, coping and quality of life.&#xd;
3) The results of phases 1 and 2 were translated into an evidence-informed clinical practice framework.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results &#xd;
1) Pediatric brain tumour survivors had poorer HRQL outcomes than other cancer survivors or healthy peers. Only two previous studies had explored the relationship between symptoms and HRQL. &#xd;
2) Pediatric brain tumour survivors experience many symptoms following the completion of treatment. The most distressing symptoms were pain, headaches, fatigue and sleep problems. Survivors of pediatric brain tumours described multiple symptoms that affect their life; yet overall they described their quality of life as good. Survivors used a variety of coping strategies to help mitigate the negative effects of these symptoms. &#xd;
3) The results of the above studies informed the development of a clinical practice framework (the Queen’s-Macartney Multidisciplinary Action Plan for Oncology Survivors - Q-MapS), that requires further testing. It is intended to optimize clinical practice, to encourage education and to stimulate further research. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions&#xd;
Child survivors of brain tumours experience various symptoms that can affect their HRQL. Nurses play a pivotal role in the systematic assessment and management of the multidimensional symptom experience of children following treatment for a brain tumour. Q-MapS can empower patients and their families by increasing their awareness of potential or actual problems related to their symptom experience and HRQL. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between symptoms and HRQL in children surviving brain tumours.</description>

   <description>The degradation of toxic and volatile contaminants in aqueous streams is considered a challenge using conventional bioremediation strategies. At moderate concentrations, toxic contaminants induce microbial inhibition, which results in an overall decrease of reaction rates. On the other hand, volatile compounds are often stripped out of solution into the atmosphere during aeration in conventional wastewater treatments, and are not treated.&#xd;
The addition of a second non-aqueous phase with affinities for the contaminants can reduce aqueous concentrations to sub-inhibitory levels and also decrease contaminant volatilization, while still allowing controlled release of contaminants back to the microbial population; such systems have been denoted as Two Phase Partitioning Bioreactor (TPPB). The current work examined and compared the performance of solid-liquid TPPB to a liquid-liquid TPPB and a single phase system. The systems were compared in the simultaneous degradation of phenol and butyl acetate, two substrates known for their relatively high levels of toxicity and volatility, respectively.&#xd;
The solid-liquid TPPB, using 2 polymers selected heuristically, showed an improvement of 40 and 54 % in phenol degradation rates compared to the single phase and the liquid-liquid systems. Additionally, the solid-liquid system presented a 55 and 11 % enhancement in the amount of butyl acetate degraded. At higher initial substrate concentration the solid-liquid TPPB showed an improvement in the phenol degradation rate and the amount of butyl acetate degraded of 44 and 94 % respectively, compared to the single phase system.&#xd;
In order to rationalize polymer screening for solid-liquid TPPBs, selection criteria based on first principles were developed, and were based on consideration of polymer accessibility and polymer-solute thermodynamic affinity. Polymer accessibility was evaluated by considering glass transition temperature (Tg) and degree of crystallinity, while polymer-solute thermodynamic affinity was assessed using three different methods, Hildebrand solubility parameters, Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and activity coefficients at infinite dilution. It was found that the HSP method gave the best trends and its predictions had better agreement with the experimental results. Consequent biodegradation experiments with a single, rationally selected polymer, and a mixture of waste polymers, demonstrated the superior performance of rational selected polymers.</description>

   <description>Life course literature states that early childhood development (ECD) can influence most aspects of health throughout the life-cycle. Canada ranked last among 25 wealthy nations in meeting ECD objectives. Fewer than 5% of children born have clinically detectable shortcomings in developmental health, increasing to 26% by school age with emerging socioeconomic associations. Understanding how social determinants of health (SDH) influence ECD at the household and neighbourhood scales would help identify conditions for optimal developmental outcomes.&#xd;
&#xd;
The effects of SDH on ECD in the Kingston, Ontario area were studied. SDH were classified via marginalization (ONMarg) and deprivation (Pampalon) indices. ECD was measured via 2006 Early Development Instrument (EDI) scores for children most at risk upon school entry (Grade One). The basic spatial unit of analysis was 2006 Census of Canada Dissemination Areas, subdivided into quintiles of deprivation (Q1 being the least deprived and Q5 the most). EDI results from each of the quintiles within the two indices were compared and then combined.&#xd;
&#xd;
The socioeconomic health gradient assumes that EDI scores will directly correlate to material and social deprivation. Social deprivation had a slightly greater impact than material deprivation on children’s developmental vulnerability, with Q5 being the most vulnerable in all competencies. Surprisingly, emotional health and social competence were significant areas of vulnerability for children in Q1 and Q2. “Village effects” – when social determinants at the neighbourhood level have protective effects on ECD despite material deprivation at the household level – were present within the Q3 and Q4 groups for the domains of social competency and emotional health. While the highest proportions of early childhood developmental vulnerability are found within the most deprived households, the largest numbers of vulnerable children are spread throughout the middle-class in a variety of neighbourhoods. &#xd;
&#xd;
Canadian policy should focus on mediating avoidable risks within this critical time to avoid future deleterious health effects and costs. Mapping the effects of SDH at the neighbourhood level generates knowledge that informs intersectoral action by policy makers to provide the supports needed to foster healthy children.</description>

   <description>Attenuation of uranium (U) and rare earth elements (REEs) has been observed in stream and wetland sediments, but the geochemical and mineralogical processes involved in sequestering these elements in natural systems are not well understood. The decommissioned Bicroft Uranium Mine near Bancroft, ON uses a modified stream and wetland system to reduce the concentrations of U and other metals in tailings pond effluent to levels below the Provincial Water Quality Objectives. The Bicroft Mine was operated from 1957 to 1963, and processed low-grade (~0.17 wt% U3O8), disseminated U hosted by pegmatite dykes in amphibolite gneiss, forming 2,284,421 tonnes of tailings, deposited into two tailings impoundments. The Bicroft site has since operated as a passively attenuating stream and wetland remediation system for 55 years, demonstrating the potential longevity and viability for long-term sequestration of U and REEs through natural attenuation.&#xd;
To identify U and REE hosts and their stability in the natural environment, colloids, tailings, stream and wetland sediments were analyzed using various methods, including tangential flow filtration (TFF), ICP-ES/MS, scanning electron microscopy, and synchrotron techniques (bulk and µXANES,  µXRF, and µXRD). The results show that Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides, goethite, and birnessite are the main mineral hosts for U and REEs in both the colloids and sediments. In addition, detrital grains of U- and REE-bearing minerals were found >200 m downstream in colloids and wetland sediments, showing the potential for long range transport of colloids and particulates in the stream system. Seasonal influences on the stability of trace metals in sediments were observed, and may demonstrate the limitations of passively attenuating remediation systems as a viable method for attenuation. Changes in the redox state of the stream system were observed to influence the attenuation of U and REEs, however, changes in the redox state with depth in the wetland sediments were not observed, and showed no direct influence on the attenuation of U and REEs. The results of this study will help to develop better monitoring strategies for U tailings sites and should reduce the impacts of future U mining operations.</description>

   <description>Processing GPS carrier-phase measurements can provide high positioning accuracy for several navigation applications. However, if not detected, cycle slips in the measured phase can strongly deteriorate the positioning accuracy. Cycle slips frequently occur in areas surrounded by trees, buildings, and other obstacles. The dynamics experienced by the GPS receiver in kinematic mode of navigation also increases the possibility of cycle slips. Detection and correction of these cycle-slips is essential for reliable navigation. One way of detecting and correcting for cycle slips is to use another system to be integrated with GPS. Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), using three-axis accelerometers and three-axis gyroscopes, is integrated with GPS to provide more reliable navigation solution. Moreover, INS was utilized in the past for GPS cycle slip detection and correction. For low cost applications, Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes are used inside INS. For land navigation, reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) utilizing two accelerometers, one gyroscope, and the vehicle odometer was suggested. MEMS-based RISS has the advantage of using less number of MEMS-based gyroscopes and accelerometers thus reducing the overall cost and avoiding the complex error characteristics associated with MEMS sensors. In this thesis, we investigate the use of MEMS – based RISS to aid GPS and detect and correct for cycle slips. The Kalman filter was employed in centralized fashion to integrate the measurements from both GPS and RISS. This thesis research also offers a new threshold selection criterion resulting in a more robust cycle slip detection and correction. The proposed method was tested in different scenarios of road tests in land vehicle. Results show accuracy &#xd;
improvement over the conventional double differenced pseudoranges-based integrated system. Moreover, the adaptive selection criterion of the detection threshold proposed in this thesis improves the detection rate, especially in the case of small-sized cycle slips.</description>

   <description>Endometriosis is a gynecological disease defined as the growth of endometrium outside of the uterus. Although linked to 50% of female infertility cases, current medical treatments fail to maintain fecundity. Since the survival of endometriotic lesions is dependent on their early neovascularization, antiangiogenic therapies specifically targeting blood vessel growth could be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of endometriosis. Angiogenesis, the branching of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, promotes robust vascularization of lesions. ABT-898 (Abbott Laboratories), a thrombospondin-1 analog, induces endothelial cell apoptosis while sequestering pro-angiogenic growth factors. We postulated that ABT-898 would reduce endometriotic lesion vascularization while physiological angiogenesis and pregnancy remained unaffected in a murine model of endometriosis. The antiangiogenic effect of ABT-898 was tested in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell line revealing disruption of endothelial tube branching. Two in vivo experiments were conducted in which endometriosis was induced in female alymphoid BALB/c-Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice by adhering sections of human endometrium to the abdominal wall. Lesions from ABT-898 treated mice contained a reduced number of CD31+ endothelial cells and a decrease in blood flow supplying the lesion compared to 5% dextrose controls. Reproductive status was evaluated through maintenance of pregnancies up to gestation day 12 revealing unaffected implantation site structure and physiological angiogenesis. In a trans-generational study, pregnant F0 generation mice received ABT-898 or 5% dextrose injections on gestation days 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. F1 generation mice were raised to reproductive age and bred resulting in litters (F2 generation) comparable in size to the F0 generation litters. Chronic exposure to ABT-898 did not affect angiogenic plasma cytokine levels in F0 generation mice. In addition, physiological angiogenesis was unaffected within the uteri of ABT-898 treated mice.  Histological examination of the kidney, liver, ovary, and uterus revealed no structural abnormalities in F0 and F1 generations exposed to ABT-898. These results suggest that ABT-898 inhibits pathological angiogenesis within endometriotic lesions without affecting physiological angiogenesis involved in pregnancy and organ function across three generations of mice. Further research will establish the effects of ABT-898 on embryonic development, organ toxicity, and physiological angiogenesis in all organs.</description>

   <description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no existing cure. Since cognitive control influences saccade behaviour, saccades provide a valuable tool when studying cognitive changes in healthy and pathological aging. This thesis aims to evaluate differences in predictive capacity and working memory between cognitively normal older adults (NC) and mild AD patients using customized saccade paradigms and a battery of neuropsychological tests.&#xd;
In the predictive paradigm, we hypothesize that AD participants would display a decreased level of prediction, predictive capacity and learning capacity. In the memory-guided paradigm, we hypothesize that AD participants would have a decreased ability to maintain fixation and capacity to retain information and reproduce it correctly. &#xd;
Overall, we found that in the predictive paradigm, NC displayed a greater degree of prediction than AD participants. However, both groups had an optimal level of prediction at intermediate inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) (750 and 1000 ms). As ISI increased, both groups, although more so in AD, elicited a greater proportion of SRTs below -200 ms and -400 ms. This may suggest that as ISI increased, participants switched from a predictive to an anticipatory/guessing strategy. At an ISI of 500 ms, NC’s learning capacity was greater than AD participants. Cognitive scores of neuropsychological tests did not correlate with learning capacity in NC. However, learning capacity in AD participants was positively correlated with working memory capacity and attentional control. &#xd;
The memory-guided paradigm revealed AD participants completed less viable trials, less correct trials, and had more combined directional and timing errors than NC. Cognitive correlations showed that NC’s working memory capacity positively correlated with the frequency of correct trials, whilst negatively correlating with saccade errors. Since AD participants completed 10% of viable trials correctly, the task may have been too difficult for AD participants to comprehend, rendering correlations invalid. &#xd;
These findings suggest that although the predictive paradigm does not solely assess for prediction, it may provide a measure to cognitively differentiate NC from AD patients, and detect AD severity. Since the memory-guided paradigm may be too difficult for AD participants, it may provide a better indicator of cognitive changes associated with healthy aging.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines liberal statist and liberal cosmopolitan attempts to explain global justice. It argues that liberal statists misidentify their own commitments regarding human rights, and that once these implications are drawn out, many statist and cosmopolitan theories of global justice converge on several of their central positions. Although statists and cosmopolitans differ in their methodologies, emphasis, epistemic commitments, and some logical commitments of their respective positions, I argue that they are nonetheless committed to many of the same positions about practices in the sphere of global justice. They share elements of a logical structure, based in liberal domestic principles, which commits them to similar practical implications. Their convergence is most visible in an examination of their human rights commitments. They nonetheless differ in their analytic priorities, and hence in the ease with which they arrive at many of their insights and conclusions. In particular, despite Rawls’s denial of the desirability or feasibility of cosmopolitanism, he shares many practical commitments with cosmopolitans such as Tesón, Beitz, Buchanan, Tan and Caney. Their shared liberal egalitarian premises arising from liberal domestic theory result in convergence on what they take to be the central questions of global justice, and moreover on their answers to these central questions. Liberal theories on both sides of the cosmopolitan and statist divide endorse a practical approach to human rights that links human rights compliance with such practical global justice privileges as non-intervention, humanitarian aid, treaty relations, and even tolerance. And this convergence entails a more united liberal account of global justice than theorists on either side of the statist and cosmopolitan divide have been willing to admit.</description>

   <description>Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of extreme ambient temperature on hospital emergency room (ER) visits related to mental and behavior disorders in Toronto, Canada.&#xd;
Methods: A time series study was conducted using health and climatic data from April 1st 2002 to March 31st 2010. Relative risks for increases in ER visits were estimated for specific mental and behavior disorders (MBD) after exposure to hot and cold temperatures while using 50th percentile of the mean temperature distribution as the reference. The non-linear nature of the exposure–outcome relationship was accounted for using a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM).  The effects of seasonality, humidity, day of the week and outdoor air pollutants (CO2, O3, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2) were also adjusted.   &#xd;
Results: We observed positive associations between elevated mean temperatures and hospital ER visits for MBD. For hot temperatures, significant increases in ER visits for MBD were observed after a mean temperature threshold of about 24°C. The association generally lasted about 3 to 4 lag days with the strongest effect occuring at lag 0 (RR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.09).  Similar trends and associations were observed for specific mental illnesses such as mood, neurotic, substance abuse, and schizophrenia related disorders. Cold temperature associations were only observed for schizophrenia.&#xd;
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that extreme temperature poses a risk to the health and wellbeing for individuals with mental and behavior disorders. Patient management and education may need to be improved as extreme temperatures become more prevalent.</description>

   <description>Recruitment of American eels (Anguilla rostrata) to Lake Ontario has declined rapidly over the past few decades. The commercial yellow eel fishery in Lake Ontario was closed in 2004 due to a lack of eel abundance. Researchers have been attempting to ascertain the reasons for the decline, although thus far, without definitive answers.&#xd;
In this thesis, the question of chemical contamination is addressed as it relates to female eel spawner quality. Spatial concentration trends of halogenated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are described in eels collected from across eastern Canada, as well as temporal concentration trends in eels collected from a historically important area of northeastern Lake Ontario, Canada. Chlorinated POPs in eels, namely, organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans are all significantly less than historic values which peaked in the 1960-70s. Measured concentrations of chlorinated POPs in eels from Lake Ontario have decreased by up to 3-fold over the past three decades, and exceeded toxicity thresholds historically for surrogate species (European eel and lake trout). Thus, chlorinated POPs may have had an effect on spawner quality. Concentrations of legacy POPs in eels were dependent on their origin, with eels from highly urbanized and industrialized areas having significantly higher concentrations than eels captured in less developed regions. Similar trends were observed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers and chlorinated norbornene flame retardants. A number of emerging brominated compounds were also measured in these eels by non-target analysis including bromophenols, bromobenzenes, and bromoanisoles. This thesis demonstrates that eels are an ideal species to investigate local sources of pollution, and provide chemical data that may be used in the future, when more toxicity information is available for eels, to assess the health risks posed by accumulated chemical contaminants.</description>

   <title>Establishing Total Airflow Requirements for Underground  Metal/Non-metal Mines based on the Diesel Equipment Fleet</title>

   <subject>diesel quantity airflow underground mining</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-23 22:33:11.36</description>
   <description>Traditionally, ventilation requirements for modern, mechanized underground mines have been based upon the power of the diesel equipment fleet, with a multiplier (determined from empirical data collected and compiled over a long period of time or required by regulations) being applied in order to determine the total airflow volume requirements of entire mines and/or individual sections or working areas.  Often, in the absence of unusual geographic, climatic or geologic conditions that warranted special consideration, the airflow required for the dilution of diesel exhaust products would provide sufficient ventilation for the entire mine.  However, recent studies regarding the health-effects of diesel exhaust, particularly the relationship between exposure to diesel emissions and cancer in humans, coupled with additional scrutiny on so called greenhouse gas emissions, have resulted changes to the regulations for engine and equipment manufacturers to provide cleaner burning and less polluting equipment; and are currently causing profound uncertainty in the mining industry.  This influence is particularly felt in the case of ventilation engineers and those involved in long-term mine planning who have responsibility for designing the ventilation systems of both existing and future mining projects around the world.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis identifies the major parameters affecting airflow requirements for diesel-powered mining equipment and examines how each of them will change in scale and scope in the aftermath of regulatory changes mandating drastic reductions in the type and amount of diesel engine emissions.  Culminating from this research, a new procedure for making total airflow determinations based on the underground diesel equipment fleet is proposed and tested with a practical case-study.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ultimately, the determination of the amount of airflow required for an underground mining operation or other sub-surface facility can depend on several factors, including the equipment fleet, ambient temperature, rock type, mining method and airway type (or use).  Obtaining a universal, repeatable protocol for determining airflow quantities required for underground diesel equipment fleets is in the best interest of the industry as a whole, including ventilation practitioners, mine-planning engineers, mining financiers, executives, equipment manufacturers, and of course, the mine workers themselves, who perhaps have the most at stake of anyone involved in the equation.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this project is to examine how environmental education (EE) can be improved through the application of transformative learning theory and environment-based education (EBE) techniques within conventional classroom curriculua. This paper will explore reasons why EE needs to be expanded within Ontario’s secondary school system, how transformative learning can be promoted within adolescent students, and how EBE techniques can be applied to create more impactful, meaningful experiences for learners. This inquiry includes a series of curriculum planning recommendations which can be used to create more effective EE for students enrolled in conventional classroom-based learning.</description>

   <description>Home First is an Ontario transition management approach that attempts to reduce the pressure on hospital and Long Term Care (LTC) beds through early discharge planning, the provision of timely and appropriate home care, and the delay of LTC placement. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to obtain descriptions from South Eastern Ontario Home First clients and their family caregivers of their experiences with and thoughts about care transitions, the provision of care, and the Home First approach. The goal was to enable insight into the Home First approach, care transitions, and the provision of care through access to the perspectives of study participants. Nine semi structured interviews (and one or more follow-up calls for each interview) with Home First clients discharged from hospitals in South East Ontario and their family caregivers were conducted and their content analyzed. &#xd;
All participating Home First clients were pleased to be home from hospital and did not consider LTC placement a positive option. All had family involved with their care and used a mix of formal and informal services to meet their care needs. Four general themes were identified: (a) maintaining independence while responding (or not) to risks, (b) constraints on care provision, (c) communication is key, and (d) relationship matters.&#xd;
Although all Home First clients participating in the study were discharged home successfully, a sense of partnership between health care providers, families, and clients was often lacking. The Home First approach may be successfully addressing hospital alternative level of care issues and getting people home where they want to be, but it is also putting increasing demands on formal and informal community caregivers. There is room for improvement in how well their needs and those of care recipients are being met. Health professionals and policy makers must ask caregivers and recipients about their concerns and provide them with appropriate resources and information if they want them to become true partners on the care team.</description>

   <title>Experiencing Shakespeare through performance: A handbook for teachers</title>

   <subject>transformation</subject>
   <description>When I was a teenager in high school I hated William Shakespeare. Not only did I hate him I resented him and dreaded having to sit in an English class and struggle with trying to find meaning in the heightened language that is the poetry of William Shakespeare. I found myself in a constant state of questioning the relevance of being forced to read these epically long and difficult plays. Now looking back, I can identify what my resistance to Shakespeare was. I was bored. It was like being forced to listen to a story in another language without having any frame of reference or understanding. Of course there were moments of clarity. It was not difficult to understand the tragic events of Romeo and Juliet and if looked  close enough, it would not be too difficult to see Macbeth as a tragic twenty first century action hero.&#xd;
	 So why was I bored in the first place? Why was Shakespeare so inaccessible to me? It was not until I actually witnessed my first live performance of a Shakespeare play that I began to understand the potential impact not only of Shakespeare's language but of the theatre itself. I remember very vividly going on a class outing to see a production of Henry V.  From my perspective as a fourteen year old anything was better than sitting in that English class watching the hands of the clock move backwards. In my mind Henry V was going to be a play about a big fat English monarch who married six times, executed a few wives and ate chicken legs. &#xd;
	Little did I know that the production of Henry V I was about to see would change my own personal journey in a very profound way. I was completely engaged by the production and invested in the struggles, defeats and triumphs of the characters before me. For the first time I was able to make meaning and understanding of the poetry of Shakespeare because for the first time I was experiencing it as it was intended to be experienced: as a living breathing entity. Why? Because I was experiencing the play through multiple perspectives and voices. Actors were infusing their own lives, experiences and emotional investmentinto the words and for the first time I could associate action with the language. For the first time the language was clear and I was able to understand the potential of how these plays could be relevant to my own life. This is what my project is all about.</description>

   <description>The kinesin-14 Kar3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) is a C-terminal motor that forms a heterodimer with the kinesin-accessory protein Vik1. Although Vik1 possesses a typical kinesin motor domain (MD) fold, it lacks a nucleotide-binding site. However, it binds microtubules with affinities that can be regulated Kar3’s nucleotide state. This implies intermolecular communication between its subunits. This thesis aimed to understand this communication by studying the structures and functions of Kar3Vik1 orthologs.  &#xd;
First, we biochemically characterized Kar3 from Ashbya gossypii (Ag) and determined the crystal structure of its MD. It was shown that the active site features of the AgKar3MD are similar to that of the ScKar3 R598A mutant, and that the β1 lobe at the edge of the MD was unique in structure and amino acid content. These results may provide a rationale for the unique enzymatic properties of this motor that could be relevant to its interaction with AgVik1 and function in Ashbya gossypii.   &#xd;
We also determined the crystal structures of Kar3 and Vik1 orthologs from Candida glabrata (Cg). While the CgKar3MD structure was very similar to that of ScKar3MD, crystals of CgVik1 captured three novel conformations of the Vik1 motor homology domain (MHD). We observed that when the N-terminal neck helix docks against the MHD core in two unique positions, the C-terminus resembling neck mimics of kinesin-14 motors also docks against the neck-core junction. However, when the neck is non-helical and disengaged from the MHD, the C-terminus is undocked and disordered. &#xd;
To assess the functional importance of these N- and C-terminal segments of Vik1 MHD, we created CgKar3Vik1 constructs whose Vik1 subunit contained either a point mutation or complete truncation of the C-terminus (neck mimic), and analyzed their biophysical properties. All mutants showed defective ATPase activity and microtubule-gliding ability. Characterization of the mutations in CgVik1MHD by molecular dynamics simulations showed that residues Ile578 and Asn580 are not only involved in stabilizing interactions between the neck and neck mimic but they also influence and respond to conformational changes of the neck. These observations implicate the N- and C-termini of Vik1 as a key element of Kar3Vik1 function and communication.</description>

   <description>This project explores some of the ways in which individuals may create a sense of place attachment through a case study of paddling recreation in the Thousand Islands. Such connections are often regarded as important influences on attitudes towards conservation and development. Tourist experience on kayaking tours was studied through participant observation and interviews with participants and key respondents in the local tourist industry in order to evaluate whether or not these short but intensely experienced trips can indeed facilitate feelings of connection to the Thousand Islands region within a relatively short period of time.</description>

   <description>Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polymer on the planet and there is great interest in expanding its use beyond its traditional applications.  However, its hydrophilicity and insolubility in most common solvent systems are obstacles to its widespread use in advanced materials.  One way to counteract this is to attach hydrophobic polymer chains to cellulose: this allows the properties of the copolymer to be tailored by the molecular weight, density, and physical properties of the grafts.  Two methods were used here to synthesize the graft copolymers: a ‘grafting-from’ approach, where synthetic chains were grown outward from bromoester moieties on cellulose (Cell-BiB) via Cu(0)-mediated polymerization; and a ‘grafting-to’ approach, where fully formed synthetic chains with terminal sulfide functionality were added to cellulose acetate with methacrylate functionality (CA-MAA) via thiol-ene Michael addition.  &#xd;
	The Cell-BiB was synthesized in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and had a degree of substitution of 1.13.  Polymerization from Cell-BiB proceeded at similar but slightly slower rate than an analogous non-polymeric initiator (EBiB).  The average graft density of poly(methyl acrylate) chains was 0.71 chains/ring, with a maximum of 1.0 obtained.  The graft density when grafting poly(methyl methacrylate) was only 0.15, and this appeared to be due to the slow initiation of BiB groups.  Using EBiB to model the reaction and improve the design should allow this to be overcome.  Chain extension experiments demonstrated the living behaviour of the polymer.   &#xd;
	The CA-MAA was synthesized by esterification with methacrylic acid.  Reactions of CA-MAA with thiophenol and dodecanethiol resulted in quantitative addition of the thiol to the alkene.  The grafts were synthesized by Cu(0)-mediated polymerization from a bifunctional initiator containing a disulfide bond, followed by reduction to sulfides.  The synthetic polymers were successfully grafted to CA-MAA but the grafting yield was limited by the low sulfide functionality. Better retention of sulfide functionality is necessary for more efficient grafting.</description>

   <description>We performed large eddy simulation of the flow over a series of two- and three-dimensional dune geometries at laboratory scale using the Lagrangian dynamic eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model. First, we studied the flow over a standard 2D transverse dune geometry, then bedform three-dimensionality was imposed. Finally, we investigated the turbulent flow over barchan dunes. The results are validated by comparison with simulations and experiments for the 2D dune case, while the results of the 3D dunes are validated qualitatively against experiments. The flow over transverse dunes separates at the dune crest, generating a shear layer that plays a crucial role in the transport of momentum and energy, as well as the generation of coherent structures. Spanwise vortices are generated in the separated shear; as they are advected, they undergo lateral instabilities and develop into horseshoe-like structures and finally reach the surface. The ejection that occurs between the legs of the vortex creates the upwelling and downdrafting events on the free surface known as “boils”. The three-dimensional separation of flow at the crestline alters the distribution of wall pressure, which may cause secondary flow across the stream. The mean flow is characterized by a pair of counter-rotating streamwise vortices, with core radii of the order of the flow depth. Staggering the crestlines alters the secondary motion; two pairs of streamwise vortices appear (a strong one, centred about the lobe, and a weaker one, coming from the previous dune, centred around the saddle). The flow over barchan dunes presents significant differences to that over transverse dunes. The flow near the bed, upstream of the dune, diverges from the centerline plane; the flow close to the centerline plane separates at the crest and reattaches on the bed. Away from the centerline plane and along the horns, flow separation occurs intermittently. The flow in the separation bubble is routed towards the horns and leaves the dune at the tips. Barchan dunes induce two counter-rotating streamwise vortices, along each of the horns, which direct high-momentum fluid toward the symmetry plane and low-momentum fluid near the bed away from the centerline.</description>

   <description>A polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is a solid-state polymer device operating according to in situ electrochemical doping and the formation of a light-emitting polymer p-n junction.  This operating mechanism, however, has been the subject of much debate.  Planar LECs with millimeter scale interelectrode spacings offer great advantages for directly observing the electrochemical doping process. Photoluminescence quenching and the formation of a light-emitting junction have been observed in planar polymer LECs, demonstrating the existence of electrochemical doping.  The chemical potential difference between the p- and n-doped regions creates a built-in potential/electric field in the junction region, which can be probed by measuring the optical beam induced current (OBIC).&#xd;
This study utilizes a versatile and easy-to-use method of performing OBIC analysis.  The OBIC and photoluminescence profiles of LECs have been simultaneously measured by scanning a focused light beam across large planar LECs that have been turned on and cooled to freeze the doping profile.  The photoluminescence intensity undergoes a sharp transition between the p- and n-doped regions.  The OBIC photocurrent is only observed in the transition region that is narrower than the width of the excitation beam, which is about 35 μm.  The results depict a static planar polymer p-n junction with a built-in electric field pointing from n to p.  The electrode interfaces do not produce a measurable photocurrent indicating ohmic contact.</description>

   <description>It is natural to think that in order to learn about the world from perceptual experience, a person does not need to do anything. All that is required is that she has her eyes open, or her ears unplugged, so that she can receive sensory input from without. On the basis of this input, she can form justified empirical beliefs. This way of thinking about experience is central to many philosophical views about perception. It is my contention that the approach is mistaken, and that in fact it cannot explain how perceptual experience justifies belief. This dissertation argues, in contrast, that perceiving is not something that merely happens to us, but something we do. On my view, experience is a source of justification in virtue of being an activity which aims at knowledge.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter 1, I present the topic of the dissertation and provide an analytical overview. Chapter 2 discusses and criticizes John McDowell's account of perceptual experience. I argue that McDowell is faced with a dilemma, as his original account mischaracterizes perceptual experience, and his later, revised account cannot explain how perception justifies empirical belief. The solution is to deny a claim common to both: that in experience we are passive. In contrast, I argue that experiencing is a full-fledged activity that is teleologically structured. In Chapter 3, I begin to substantiate my position by drawing on Wittgenstein's rule-following considerations. Chapter 4 supplements this claim by appeal to some features of Alva Noe's enactive view of perception. The resulting account portrays experience as an activity that has knowledge as its end. This explains how experience justifies belief, for it shows how perceptual knowledge cannot but be the result of experiencing going well for one. Chapter 5 argues that perceptual activity can take different forms, varying in complexity, as one aims at knowing features of one's environment. I argue, however, that keeping track of an object is the fundamental mode of perceptual activity. I conclude the dissertation by considering two objections to my account.</description>

   <description>The current study investigated teachers’ grading practices on achievement and non-achievement factors in the classroom of Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages (TCSOL). Specifically, this study investigated how teachers assigned grades in relation to students’ achievement and non-achievement factors, and further, whether this relationship between achievement and non-achievement factors and grades was different based on teachers’ past experiences.&#xd;
    This study was a quantitative survey study. The participants were 214 TCSOL teacher candidates at Master’s level in two universities in Beijing, China. The study employed a questionnaire made up of two sections. Section One provided 32 grading scenarios that illustrated 32 students with different characteristics (achievement and non-achievement factors). Section Two included four items on teachers’ past experiences. These items were training in classroom assessment and grading, perceptions about grades previously received, teaching experience, and grading experience. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analyses were the two main statistical methods used.&#xd;
Results showed that teachers involved both achievement and non-achievement factors when assigning grades. Generally, sixteen students with low achievement received a mean grade higher than their achievement, and most students with high achievement received a lower grade than their achievement. Further, raw grades assigned by 214 teachers to every student demonstrated large standard deviations, indicating teachers’ decisions on grades were quite different from each other. Paired-sample t-tests found significant differences in grades among four students who presented extreme characteristics. Regression results further showed that while achievement was the main factor teachers considered when assigning grades, all of four non-achievement factors also contributed significantly to grades, with attendance being the most significant contributor, followed by effort, progress and ability. This relationship between the mean grades and all five factors did not change when teachers had different experiences in assessment training, perceptions in the grades they previously received, teaching and grading experiences.&#xd;
    This study expands upon the limited research evidence regarding TCSOL teachers’ grading practices. It confirms the hodgepodge nature of grades in this context. It also provides teacher educators with insights and understanding in teachers’ grading practices, and has implications for preparing future teachers to assign grades appropriately.</description>

   <description>The central argument of this text is that the liberal subject is constitutively rather than coincidentally or contingently exclusionary.  From this initial premise, I explore the conceptual and practical inadequacies of liberal articulations of multicultural justice, many of which I argue can be traced back to this exclusionary subject. When making this critique, I frame my analysis around the scholarship of Canadian philosopher Will Kymlicka, whose articulation of a distinctly liberal defense of the value of cultural belonging has shaped much of mainstream theoretical debate on multiculturalism both within Canada and elsewhere.  Although Kymlicka’s work has faced a multitude of critiques from within and without liberal theory, he is widely recognized as the most prominent liberal defender of multiculturalism, and his work has been particularly influential within related discussions of national unity, multicultural accommodation, and national identity in Canada.  I have chosen, then, to focus my critique of liberal multiculturalism on Kymlicka specifically for two reasons. Firstly, due to his prominence within the field and, secondly – and more importantly – because of the instrumental relationship between subject and culture which Kymlicka defends throughout his work.  &#xd;
Despite this critical focus, what is primarily at stake in such a project is a rearticulation rather than a rejection of multiculturalism. While my arguments are based fundamentally on a critical interrogation, and ultimately a rejection, of liberal articulations of multicultural justice, within my project I also offer an alternative model of multiculturalism conceived as a vital form of epistemic cooperation. Such an alternative defense of multiculturalism is rooted in a commitment to the value of everyday experience, a more dialectically formed and culturally embedded sense of self, and finally, a critical and substantive awareness of context, both contemporary and historical.  In making this positive case for a more radical form of multiculturalism expressed through intercultural dialogue/negotiation and a widening of the public sphere, I challenge dominant understandings of the value of multiculturalism defended within liberal theory and the mainstream of Canadian Political Science (CPS).</description>

   <description>As sessile organisms, coordination of development and reproduction in a dynamic, and often stressful, environment presents a particular challenge for plants. Rapid processing of internal and external cues by complex signal transduction pathways leads to stimulus-appropriate physiological responses on an organismal scale. In plants, myriad signaling pathways are mediated by calcium (Ca2+) signals, and it is thought that different stimuli elicit unique patterns of Ca2+ influx into cells (termed Ca2+ ‘signatures’) that encode information important for proper physiological responses. Encoding of information in the form of Ca2+ signatures requires that decoding elements be present in cells to direct downstream cellular processes. This role is filled by Ca2+-binding proteins that serve as Ca2+ sensors. Interestingly, plant genomes encode multiple expanded families of Ca2+ sensors not found in animal genomes. Among these, the calmodulin (CaM)-like proteins (CMLs) are represented by a 50 member family in Arabidopsis. On the basis of structural homology, CMLs are predicted to function like conserved CaM, however, little work has been done to address this question. Biochemical characterization of CML39 indicates that it possesses structural properties consistent with function as a Ca2+ sensor. Analysis of transgenic CML39 loss-of-function (cml39) mutants revealed that CML39 is important for proper seedling establishment in the absence of exogenous metabolisable carbon as cml39 seedlings entered a state of developmental arrest shortly after germination. cml39 mutants also exhibited a conditional ‘de-etiolated’ phenotype when grown in complete darkness and exaggerated hypocotyl elongation under a short-day light regime. Genetic data suggest that CML39 functions in signaling pathways downstream of light perception, and this idea is supported by the observation that CML39&#xd;
iii&#xd;
is expressed in light-sensing tissues, and that subunit 5 of the COP9 signalosome, a protein critical for photomorphogenesis, was identified as a putative target of CML39. Collectively, results show that CML39 is Ca2+ sensor that serves a critical regulatory role during seedling establishment when sucrose is limited, and importantly, further underscore the pervasiveness of Ca2+ signaling in plant growth and development.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-30 12:26:18.732</description>
   <description>Most robotic systems reported for MRI-guided prostate interventions use manual needle insertion, based on a previously acquired image, which requires withdrawing the patient from the scanner multiple times during the procedure. This makes the intervention longer, more expensive and elongating the discomfort to patient and, most importantly, less accurate due to the virtually inevitable motion of the target. As a remedy, automated needle placement methods were proposed, putting human supervision out of the control loop. This thesis presents the development of enabling technologies for human-operated in-room master-slave needle placement under real-time MRI guidance, while the patient is kept in the scanner and having the process of needle placement under continuos control of the physician. The feasibility of teleoperated needle insertion was demonstrated by developing a 1-DOF (degree of freedom) MRI-compatible master-slave system, which was integrated with a 4-DOF robot for transperineal prostate biopsy and brachytherapy. An accuracy study was conducted on a robotic system for MRI-guided prostate needle placement. Different error sources were identified and quantified. This study concluded that errors occurring during needle insertion have the most significant contribution to needle placement error. In order to compensate for these errors, teleoperated needle steering under real-time MRI guidance was proposed. A 2-DOF piezo-actuated MRI-compatible needle steering module was developed and integrated with the aforementioned 4-DOF transperineal robot, yielding a fully actuated 6-DOF (x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll) robotic platform for MRI-guided prostate interventions. A novel MRI-compatible master robot was also developed to enable teleoperated needle steering inside the MRI room. MRI-compatible controller hardware and software were developed. A novel MRI-compatible force/torque sensor was devised using Fiber Bragg Grating for force measurement in MRI room. Phantom experiments proved the feasibility&#xd;
iii&#xd;
of teleoperated needle steering under real-time MRI guidance. A system was also developed for real-time 3D shape tracking of a bevel-tip needle with Fiber Bragg Grating sensors embedded along the needle shaft. The needle profile was overlaid on the real-time MR image, yielding real time navigation with accuracy better than 0.5 mm. The experimental system is presently being refitted for clinical safety and feasibility trials on real patients.</description>

   <description>Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have been steadily increasing since the Industrial Revolution. The release of greenhouse gases and the results in changes in global climate have made it a challenge for parks and protected areas to respond to the potential negative impacts to ecological integrity. The predicted rate of climate change is forecasted to be faster than the rate of deglacial warming and a fragmented landscape between large protected areas further contributes to our challenges. The Algonquin to Adirondack corridor provides a corridor for flora and fauna to migrate in the face of climate change. Assessing the perceived threats, current level of monitoring and assessment, and climate change policy provides the framework to assess our preparedness to adapt to climate change on study areas within the Algonquin to Adirondack corridor. To compile data, a literature review was completed and 8 individuals representing 7 governmental and non-governmental organizations were interviewed. The findings include: 1) there are concerns that climate change is affecting study areas, however, climate change is a large problem that many areas are not financially or capacity-wise able to deal with; 2) monitoring and assessment relevant to climate change is occurring within study areas but no standardized method is utilized; 3) budget cuts for all organizations is impacting the ability to accomplish continuous data collection, however, citizen science may potentially fill this gap; 4) there are no specific climate change policies for parks and adjacent regions. The main policy recommendation based on this research is to employ an adaptive management approach to take into account the unpredictable nature of our climate future. Additionally, given the board range of climate change impacts, tackling this issue can be done quicker and more effectively when accomplished strategically and using partnerships across this region.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates representations of happiness in recent German literature and film. The interpretations focus on how happiness is negotiated in the context of home and travel, of Heimat and Fremde, in order to understand happiness, not only insofar as it contributes to “the good life”, but also as an element that shapes public discourses. My readings of works of fiction take into account how notions of happiness have shifted since the turn of the millennium. One reason for this shift is the heightened interest in happiness research, one of the most thriving interdisciplinary research fields of the last decade, which includes disciplines such as psychology, neurosciences, political science, sociology and economics.&#xd;
The following texts and films are examined in this context: Sommerhaus, später (1998) and Nichts als Gespenster (2003) by Judith Hermann, Transfer Lounge (2003) by Gregor Hens, Die Habenichtse (2006) by Katharina Hacker, Head-On (German: Gegen die Wand, 2004) by Fatih Akın, When We Leave (German: Die Fremde, 2010) by Feo Aladağ, Der Blick hinab (2007) by Shirin Kumm, Unveiled (German: Fremde Haut, 2005) by Angelina Maccarone, Cherry Blossoms (German: Kirschblüten – Hanami, 2008) by Doris Dörrie and Zehn (2010) by Franka Potente. &#xd;
 My theoretical framework is informed in part by Sara Ahmed’s 2010 influential study, The Promise of Happiness, which takes a critical view toward recent happiness research from a cultural studies perspective. My analysis is directed at the ways in which concepts of happiness are narrated, negotiated and challenged within the context of transnational stories, which are inscribed with the effects of “supermodernity” (Augé) in a globalized world. I show how these works subvert themes and motifs that are associated with happiness, such as home and Heimat and travel or migration into the West. Finally, my readings show how these works mediate and reflect public dialogues and traditional notions about what makes us happy or unhappy, and I demonstrate how new configurations of happiness arise from these narratives.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2013-05-30 23:32:00.87</description>
   <description>The adolescent transition involves a number of changes that for many adolescents result in increased negativity, heightened emotional reactivity, and risk for internalizing symptoms.  The purpose of the present set of studies was to examine the role that emotional awareness has in relation to emotion regulation and to subsequent mood symptomatology in adolescence.  The first study tested the hypothesized relationship between emotional awareness and emotion regulation, specifically, that emotional awareness is a necessary precursor to adaptive regulation efforts.  This study examined the direct and indirect effects of emotional awareness on internalizing symptoms by exploring the extent to which certain emotion regulation strategies influence this relationship.  The purpose of the second and third studies was to examine the association between emotional awareness and emotion regulation as measured by changes across three emotional response domains: 1) physiological arousal, 2) self-reported experience, and 3) observed expression during an ecologically valid emotion elicitation task.  Participants in these studies were identified as alexithymic or non-alexithymic.  Alexithymia involves difficulty identifying and describing emotions and has been used to classify individuals with extremely low emotional awareness.  The second study examined the effects of alexithymia on the three emotional response domains in adolescents.  Because of the high prevalence rates of alexithymia during adolescence, it could be an important vulnerability factor to help explain increases in internalizing symptoms during the adolescent transition.  The purpose of the third study was to examine how patterns of decoupling between physiological arousal, self-reported experience, and observed expression were related to depressive and anxiety symptoms in alexithymic individuals.  Overall, findings confirmed that emotional awareness is an important precursor to adaptive emotion regulation efforts.  In addition, emotion regulation emerged as a more proximal mechanism in the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms in individuals with low emotional awareness.  At a theoretical level, this research has guided our understanding of emotional processing and regulation.  At a practical level, results from this program of research will help guide intervention and treatment approaches for adolescents with low emotional awareness.</description>

   <description>Organic nitrates, such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), have been used clinically for more than a century. However optimal nitrate therapy is hindered by the development of tolerance, which is associated with a desensitized response to GTN, oxidative stress, and the inactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). This thesis evaluated the ALDH2 inactivation hypothesis of GTN tolerance and investigated the role of oxidative stress in GTN tolerance mediated by the lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). &#xd;
	 Evidence for a direct role of ALDH2 in nitrate action was sought using a stably transfected cell line that overexpressed ALDH2, or siRNA to deplete endogenous ALDH2. Neither manipulation altered GTN-induced cGMP formation, indicating that ALDH2 does not mediate GTN bioactivation and tolerance. In a second study using an in vivo GTN tolerance model and a cell culture model of nitrate action, a marked increase in HNE adduct formation was detected in GTN-tolerant tissues, and treatment with HNE reduced the cGMP and vasodilator responses to GTN, thus mimicking GTN-tolerance. Together, the results suggest a primary role for HNE in the development of GTN tolerance, and provide the framework for a unified hypothesis that accommodates the previous findings of sulfhydryl depletion, ALDH2 inactivation and oxidative stress that are associated with nitrate tolerance. &#xd;
	Studies have implicated oxidative stress and increased HNE formation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It was hypothesized that the gene deletion of ALDH2 would result in increased HNE-adduct formation leading to impaired cognitive function, and AD-like pathological changes. We observed a marked increase in HNE-adduct formation in Aldh2-/- mouse hippocampi as well as hyperphosphorylated tau, activated caspases, age-related changes in hippocampal amyloid βeta1-42 (Aβ1-42), post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (pCREB) expression, endothelial dysfunction and other vascular pathologies. These data provide further evidence for the importance of HNE and oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis, and establish Aldh2-/- mice as a new, oxidative stress-based animal model of age-related cognitive impairment and AD.</description>

   <title>Examining the Relationship between Pumping Energy and Geographically-Targeted Water Conservation Measures in Municipal Water Distribution Networks</title>

   <description>Municipal water distribution systems are operated and maintained by utilities whose first priority is the safe and reliable provision of drinking water to consumers. The cost to move and treat water through distribution networks is significant and can account for up to 80% of a utility’s energy costs. As these networks age, operating and maintenance costs continue to increase due to higher incidences of leaks and breaks and increased pipe friction leading to higher energy use. Many utilities are considering water conservation as a strategy to reducing their energy consumption by reducing the amount of water being pumped and treated in their jurisdictions.&#xd;
This work studies the pumping energy response of a distribution system when water conservation strategies are implemented in small geographic areas in the network. A water conservation plan is tailored to each defined area by specifying which conservation measures are feasible to implement, desired by the customer, and are attractive to the utility based on a potential return on investment in the form of reduced electricity bills to pump and treat water. Energy intensity and energy elasticity indicators are developed to assess the mechanical energy used in a network to distribute water to end-users. A case study for the City of Kingston water distribution system is presented. The distribution system studied indicated that when water conservation strategies produced marginal water savings, the energy response was inelastic to changes in water demand. The amount of energy required to move one cubic metre of water through the network increased with higher water savings because the percent savings of water was higher than the percent savings of pumping energy.</description>

   <description>The Common tern (Sterna hirundo) is considered a sentinel wildlife species for monitoring mercury (Hg) and other contaminants within the St. Lawrence River Cornwall/Massena Areas of Concern (AOC). Here, I investigate the relationship between Hg bioaccumulation and diet using stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in adult and chick Common terns from three colonies along a 160 km transect of the upper St. Lawrence River. The foraging range of the colony furthest downstream (EMC) includes both the Massena and Cornwall AOC’s while the two upstream colonies (213 and Ice) are more removed from known point sources of Hg. I also sampled winter- and summer-grown breast feathers to compare diet and Hg exposure on the terns’ breeding ground vs. the terns’ wintering grounds. Hg exposure in summer-grown feathers was significantly higher than Hg exposure in winter grown feathers. Stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes revealed a switch from a marine-based diet during the winter months to a freshwater-based diet on the breeding grounds. Among colonies in summer-grown and chick feathers, the only significant difference in total mercury (THg) exposure was found in chick feathers where Hg was significantly lower at 213 than Ice – both of which are upstream from the AOC’s.  However, THg was negatively correlated with δ13C in both winter and summer feathers, and the most parsimonious multi-regression model for winter and summer feathers indicated that δ13C explains 24 and 25% of the variation in Hg exposure, respectively. This suggests terns foraging offshore bioaccumulate more Hg than individuals foraging inshore or in freshwater (winter feathers), and that during the breeding period, terns foraging in pelagic habitats bioaccumulate more Hg than terns foraging in littoral habitats (summer feathers). For the upper St. Lawrence River, these results provide strong evidence that foraging habitat is more important than colony location in determining Hg exposure in a top trophic consumer.</description>

   <description>This thesis concerns the economic dimensions of second language knowledge and acquisition and the economic implications of language policies. The value of the ability to speak and understand a second language depends on the extent to which it enlarges one's communicative sphere which, in turn, depends on the language abilities of others. This implies that second language acquisition decisions are associated with strategic considerations and spillover effects. Consequently, the equilibrium distribution of language skills may not be socially efficient and policy remedies may be called for.&#xd;
The first essay of the thesis investigates the relationship between earnings, second language knowledge and the distribution of language skills in local labour markets in Canada using census data. We estimate the elasticity of local language complementarity in earnings: a parameter that measures the importance of the linguistic environment in the earnings of the individual as well as the importance of language in the economy generally.&#xd;
The second essay addresses the efficiency of second language acquisition decisions in a theoretical model where bilingualism is rewarded with a higher wage for two reasons. First, language skills constitute a form of human capital in the sense that a worker's productivity is positively related to the proportion of the population with whom she shares a language. Second, language skills serve as a signal of productivity to employers. In general, the private and social benefits of bilingualism do not align due to counteracting network and signalling welfare effects.&#xd;
The third essay concerns the role of language policy in improving social outcomes. A tax-subsidy system is considered under various assumptions about the ability of the government or planner to discriminate between individuals and groups. A Pareto improvement is possible if the government can condition the tax-subsidy system on language acquisition costs but not otherwise. &#xd;
The fourth essay considers the optimal provision of public services when individuals' effective consumption of the services depends on their proficiency in the language they are provided in. The planner faces a trade-off between compensating minority language speakers for their lower wages and encouraging their integration by rewarding higher levels of dominant language proficiency.</description>

   <description>We are living in the era of climate change which becomes more complicated whenever some new environmental issue emerges only to get linked with this already existing challenge. Engineered nanoparticle (NP) contamination is of such issue which may become a major environmental problem under some circumstances in the decades to come. NP-based technologies have proven themselves useful and have the potential for greater promise, but they could become more than a nuisance. Unfortunately, very limited information is available on the environmental impacts of NPs in general and soil in particular. In this thesis, I examined the impact of NPs on soil microbial communities and by trying to avoid the presence of existing NPs I used soil from arctic regions. To examine the effect of another anthropogenic change on the same soil, I investigated the impacts of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). This thesis demonstrated that Ag-NPs and Cu-NPs cause a shift in microbial communities. The use of culture-dependent and culture-independent assessment techniques for microbial communities inspired the development of a toxicity indicator. This tool assigned the highest toxicity index to Ag-NPs and a low toxicity to SiO2-NPs. Supporting in vitro studies confirmed that Bradyrhizobium canariense was particularly sensitive towards Ag-NPs. Further analysis showed that a mixture of Ag-, Cu-, and SiO2-NPs were toxic. FTCs were also a significant stress; they had a differential impact upon soil communities derived from different arctic sites. My results suggest that the impact of climate change at high latitudes may not be predictable. Finally, I used a FTC regime shown not have an impact on low arctic sites and compared two different concentrations of Ag-NPs and Ag-microparticles and validated the higher toxicity impact of Ag-NPs on both bacterial and fungal communities. Taken together, these findings represent an initial attempt to try to understand the impacts of two stresses attributable to human activities on arctic soils, soils that are crucial to the health of our planet.</description>

   <description>Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural compound that improves mitochondrial function and metabolic health in animal models. Thus far, RSV’s effects on metabolic outcomes in humans are controversial, and RSV’s acute mechanism has not yet been confirmed in vivo. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an acute dose of RSV on insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation, and to determine RSV’s mechanism of action in human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Overweight males (n=8; BMI, 30.5±3.6; VO2peak, 34.0±7.3 ml/kg) reported to the lab on 2 occasions and were provided a breakfast supplemented with 0.3g of RSV or a placebo pill. Experiments were performed in random order using a double blind crossover design. Gas exchange measures, blood samples, and skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies were obtained before and 2 hours after the supplement meal. RSV acutely improved insulin sensitivity, but had no effect on fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, RSV supplementation had no effect on the intracellular signaling of key proteins proposed to mediate its effects in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Taken together, these results suggest a single dose of RSV can acutely enhance insulin sensitivity, but its mechanism of action is not conserved across species, and its intracellular signaling pathway is different in humans than previously thought. Due to its insulin sensitizing effect, RSV retains its clinical value, but further research is required to determine its most useful application for human metabolic health.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the writings of Nobel Laureate J. M. Coetzee in order to explore pressing issues that have emerged in literary, philosophical, and theoretical approaches to animal studies.  These include animals as disputed objects in claims to territorial, national, and cultural belonging; and the use of animality to manage cultural difference and mobilize identity-based violence.  I investigate the roles that hierarchical discourses of species, and the rhetorics of animality that mobilize them, play in cultural and social inscription, cross-cultural conflict, and cultures of violence in the writing of J.M. Coetzee.  My dissertation provides historical, material, and cultural context and specificity to the entanglements of race, gender, and culture with the rhetoric and hermeneutics of species, by demonstrating how colonial, Enlightenment, and traditional humanist thought mobilizes speciesism for the cultural work of violence.  Intervening in assumptions about the irreconcilability of animal- and human-endorsing approaches to animal studies, I demonstrate that human and non-human animals alike are mutually implicated in conceptual economies that employ animality as a trope; and in the material logistics that mobilize discourses that surround nonhuman animals to do violence to human and nonhuman animals.  Coetzee embeds questions about what nonhuman animals mean, or more precisely are made to mean, firmly within the broader politics of interpreting and recognizing alterity, regardless of species, while asking how animals might have a place—in our worlds, in our thought, and in our interventionist strategies—as more than means to human ends.  Coetzee’s fictional and critical engagements with nonhuman animals, I argue, comprise a major reassessment of the codes of, and struggles concerning, human and nonhuman animal correspondence and difference.  Highlighting the complex interrelations between the cross-cultural violence that mobilizes the rhetoric of species and its attendant violations of nonhuman animal life, Coetzee challenges speciesist schemata that give nonhuman animals symbolic and material currency by imagining how we might read across species differently, in ways that affirm, rather than master, nonhuman animal life.</description>

   <description>Under the contemporary spectrum usage regulations, radio frequency bands are allocated statically to licensed users in a large geographical area and over a long period of time. Recent investigations have revealed that such static spectrum allocation has led to very poor usage of the overall spectrum. Cognitive radio has emerged as a new communication paradigm to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum. It is defined as an intelligent wireless communication system that allows coexistence of unlicensed users with the licensed ones as long as the perceived interference at the licensed user is capped below some acceptable level. In addition, the users in this system adopt efficient communication protocols to enhance spectral efficiency.&#xd;
&#xd;
We employ cooperative mechanisms wherein multiple users cooperate in order to accomplish the following tasks:&#xd;
1) Cooperative spectrum sensing: In this task, the licensed users do not actively engage. Instead, the unlicensed users passively monitor the activity of the licensed users and transmit only during their absence. 2) Cooperative spectrum management: The licensed and unlicensed users can benefit from cooperation with each other, e.g., they can assist each other in transmission via relaying. In this fashion, they can save power or bandwidth and therefore, the whole network can accommodate more users.&#xd;
\end{itemize}&#xd;
&#xd;
In the first part of this thesis, we focus on cooperative spectrum sensing. We first study the performance of the optimal distributed detectors as the number of samples increases and identify the conditions under which the highest or lowest asymptotic performance is achieved. For each condition, we study several suboptimal detectors and obtain novel asymptotic expressions for their performance. We then consider distributed detection of an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal source. We propose different optimal and suboptimal frequency-domain detectors and derive closed form expressions for their performance. These frequency-domain detectors, despite their lower computational complexity, outperform the state-of-the-art time-domain detectors. Finally, we consider distributed spectrum sensing in mixture-Nakagami fading channels. We propose several novel detectors that significantly outperform the traditional detectors. In all these cases, we prove that the suboptimal detectors are asymptotically optimal, i.e., their performance converges to the Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) tests as the number of samples increases.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second part of the thesis, we focus on cooperative spectrum management. We study the problem of cooperative relay selection and power allocation and determine the conditions, in terms of channel gains and network geometry,  under which such cooperation leads to an increase in rate, or a reduction in power and bandwidth usage. Lastly, we propose cooperative protocols that exploit these results and greatly enhance spectrum efficiency.</description>

   <description>Arctic tundra vegetation communities are rapidly responding to climate warming with increases in aboveground biomass, particularly in deciduous shrubs. This increased shrub density has the potential to dramatically alter the functioning of tundra ecosystems through its effects on permafrost degradation and nutrient cycling, and to cause positive feedbacks to global climate change through its impacts on carbon balance and albedo. Experimental evidence indicates that tundra plant growth is most strongly limited by soil nutrient availability, which is projected to increase with warming. Therefore research to date into the mechanisms driving tundra 'shrub expansion' has taken a 'bottom-up' perspective, overlooking the potential role of herbivory in mediating plant-soil interactions. In this thesis, I integrate the impacts of climate warming and caribou browsing on tundra vegetation community structure, and specifically investigate if increases in soil fertility with warming might lead to changes in vegetation biomass and chemistry that could fundamentally alter herbivore-nutrient cycling feedbacks, shifting the role of caribou browsing from restricting shrub growth to facilitating it. Using experimental greenhouses, nutrient addition plots, and caribou exclosures at Daring Lake Research Station in the central Canadian low Arctic, I showed that warming increased soil nutrient availability and plant biomass, and that caribou browsing restricted tundra shrub growth under present conditions. Plant and soil nutrient pool responses to warming demonstrated that increased growing season temperatures enhanced tundra plant growth both by increasing soil nutrient availability and by inferred increases in the rate of photosynthesis, however that the former process was comparatively more limiting. Species- and plant part-specific changes in biomass and chemistry with warming and fertilization clearly indicated the rate and magnitude of change in soil fertility substantially alters plant community structure. Nonetheless, since plant nutrient concentrations decreased with warming and plant responses to browsing were independent of soil fertility, I did not find evidence for a shift from caribou decelerating to accelerating nutrient cycling with warming. Altogether this research indicates effective conservation and management of Rangifer populations is critical to understanding how climate change will affect tundra vegetation trajectories and ultimately tundra ecosystem carbon balances.</description>

   <description>Unmanned ground mobile robots are land-based robots which do not have a human passenger on board. They can be either autonomous, or controlled via telecommunication. For navigational purposes, GPS is often used. However, the GPS signal can be distorted in obstructive environments such as tunnels, urban canyons, and dense forests. IMUs can be used to provide an internal navigational solution, free from external input. However, low cost IMUs are prone to various intrinsic sources of error, which leads to large errors in the long run.&#xd;
Using the short term accuracy of the IMU, and the long term accuracy of the GPS, these two technologies are often integrated to combine the aforementioned aspects of the two systems. For integration of the two, various methods are implemented. Such integration methods include Particle Filters, and Kalman Filters. Kalman Filters are commonly used due to their simplicity in calculations. However, the Kalman Filter linearizes the nonlinear error estimates which are inherent with low cost IMUs. The Kalman Filter also does not account for IMU measurement drift, which is present when the measurement unit is used for a long period of time.&#xd;
In this thesis, a Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI) algorithm is augmented with the Kalman Filter (KF) to model the nonlinear errors which are intrinsic to the low cost IMU. The method of integration used was 2D GPS/RISS loosely coupled integration using a Kalman Filter. The PCI algorithm modelled the nonlinear error for the z-axis gyroscope while the GPS signal was available. During a GPS outage, the PCI nonlinear error model was combined with the KF estimated error and the mechanization error, to provide a corrected azimuth. The KFPCI algorithm showed an improvement over the KF algorithm in RMS position error, maximum position error, RMS azimuth error, and maximum azimuth error by an average of 30.76%, 34.71%, 66.76%, and 53.58% in each of the respective areas.</description>

   <description>MexCD-OprJ is an RND-type multidrug efflux pump present in P. aeruginosa and is capable of exporting, and as such providing resistance to, several clinically important antimicrobials including fluoroquinolones, cephems, macrolides, and several biocides including chlorhexidine (CHX).  Expression of mexCD-oprJ is negatively regulated by NfxB, a LacI-type repressor.  The promoter region of mexCD-oprJ was identified and included two inverted repeat operator sites, B1 and B2, both of which are required in order for NfxB to bind, thereby repressing mexCD-oprJ.  NfxB oligomerizes into a tetramer in solution and likely functions as a dimer of NfxB homodimers.  In addition to being derepressed by loss of NfxB, MexCD-OprJ is inducible by a variety of non-antibiotic membrane-damaging agents (MDAs) such as CHX.  A homologue of NfxB, PA4596, was found to be induced in response to CHX-promoted envelope stress in an AlgU-dependent manner and is directly repressed by NfxB.  Loss of PA4596 resulted in increased resistance to the biocide CHX, shown to be a result of increased CHX-dependent expression of mexCD-oprJ.  Susceptibility to CHX was restored upon expression of PA4596 from the plasmid pAK1900 as was decreased expression of mexCD-oprJ in the presence of CHX, indicating that PA4596 contributes to mexCD-oprJ repression in the presence of CHX.  PA4596 was found to form oligomers in solution, likely dimers and tetramers.  In the absence of NfxB, PA4596 is unable to contribute to repression of mexCD-oprJ.  However, NfxB and PA4596 interact and together form a repressor capable of regulating mexCD-oprJ expression.  Screening of transposon mutants for increased resistance to erythromycin potentially indicative of increased mexCD-oprJ expression lead to the identification of several novel genes including PA0479, cupA3, faoA, PA3259, mucD, and clpA whose loss generated a multidrug resistance profile consistent with increased production of MexCD-OprJ.  However, further studies are required to determine how each of these genes may be affecting expression of mexCD-oprJ.</description>

   <description>Coyne’s (1976) interpersonal theory of depression proposes that individuals suffering from depressive symptoms tend to engage in excessive reassurance-seeking (ERS), defined as repetitively asking for assurances from close others about one’s lovability and worth. Research has shown that ERS is associated with negative evaluations from close others and lower partner-reported romantic relationship satisfaction, specifically (Starr &amp; Davila, 2008). In a recent elaboration of Coyne’s theory, Evraire and Dozois (2011) proposed that ERS might only lead to rejection among individuals who possess core beliefs about the instability and unpredictability of relationships. The primary goal of the current study was to provide the first empirical test of this revised model. Furthermore, I sought to extend previous research in 2 important ways by: 1) employing both self-reported and behaviorally-assessed measures of ERS and 2) defining rejection in objective, behavioral terms. I recruited a sample of 118 women who attended an initial laboratory session with their male dating partners. The couple completed measures of ERS, depressive symptoms, anxious attachment (AA), rejection sensitivity (RS), and relationship satisfaction, and engaged in a laboratory task that was later coded for incidences of female ERS. AA and RS were combined to index core beliefs reflecting insecurity in relationships (i.e., “negative relationship cognitions”; NRC). Women completed a contextual interview to retrospectively assess historical romantic relationship rejection events. The women were re-contacted four months later to determine their relationship status. Consistent with hypotheses, behavioral ERS was significantly associated with concurrent male relationship dissatisfaction, but only among dysphoric women with high NRC. Surprisingly, ERS was only significantly associated with historical rejection in non-dysphoric women with low levels of NRC. In the prospective models, I found a main effect of self-reported ERS on partner-initiated rejection, but behavioral ERS was only associated with rejection among non-dysphoric women. My results were inconsistent with theory and previous research in models defining rejection behaviorally. Thus, I proposed revisions to existing interpersonal models to better capture the relationship between ERS and “real-world” rejection. My results underscore the importance of evaluating ERS in a particular relationship when predicting rejection outcomes in that specific relationship.</description>

   <description>Predicting the impacts of non-native species remains one of the greatest challenges to invasion ecologists. Because of their insularity, freshwater systems are particularly vulnerable to invasions, especially from non-native predators. The research in this thesis explores the role of abiotic and biotic factors in mediating the distribution and impact of Bythotrephes longimanus, a predatory cladoceran that has been introduced to freshwater systems in North America. Although the general impacts of this invasion have been documented, little is known about the factors that modulate them. Using a combination of field surveys and experiments, I tested several hypotheses concerning the influence of interactions with native species, as well as the role of heterogeneity in the light environment, in mediating the impact of Bythotrephes.	&#xd;
	Results demonstrated that biotic resistance by native macroinvertebrate predators does not play a limiting role in the establishment success of Bythotrephes. However, the within-lake distribution of Bythotrephes was influenced by these macroinvertebrates, suggesting that the native predator context matters when trying to understand the impacts of non-native predators. This was demonstrated with a mesocosm experiment in which the impact of Bythotrephes was constrained by the native Chaoborus larvae. In terms of the abiotic environment, in situ feeding experiments demonstrated that refuges from impact could exist for some prey taxa, as the outcome of predation by Bythotrephes was dependent on light availability and some prey taxa were more successful at evading predation under low light conditions. Finally, results show that adaptive behaviour by prey is also an important determinant of impact, as migrating Daphnia can escape predation effects by Bythotrephes. The combination of light-limited predation and a shallow distribution by Bythotrephes selects for prey that occupy relatively deeper positions during the day. &#xd;
	As a whole, this research highlights the importance of complex interactions in mediating the impact of Bythotrephes and may help to explain some of the variation that has been documented among invaded lakes. A better understanding of these complex interactions can improve our ability to anticipate impacts as Bythotrephes continues to spread, as well as provide insight on some of the long-term effects following invasion.</description>

   <title>Effects of Music on the Pain Response in the Central Nervous System Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>

   <description>The oldest procedure for pain relief has been music. There is abundant behavioural evidence to support music’s pain relieving properties, however, studies to date have yet to investigate music-induced analgesia via imaging. Our first imaging study used thermal stimulation just below pain threshold in combination with various music stimuli, to determine whether music can affect neural activity in response to heat stimuli within brainstem and spinal cord regions. Differential responses to music stimuli were found within regions known for descending modulation, and familiar classical music had a unique effect on neural activity in these regions compared to unpleasant music, reverse music, and no music. This study confirmed that the emotional valence of music affects neural activity in the brainstem and spinal cord.&#xd;
The second study used a well-defined pain paradigm applied with or without favorite music to study the neural activity responses in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord using imaging. Subjective pain ratings were significantly lower when painful stimuli were administered with music than without music. The pain condition alone elicited neural activity in brain regions consistently activated during similar pain studies. Brain regions associated with pleasurable music listening were activated including limbic, frontal, and auditory regions when comparing music to non-music pain conditions. In addition, neural regions showed activity responses indicative of descending modulation when contrasting the two conditions. These regions include the spinothalamic tract, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), periaqueductal grey (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and the dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord. The data suggest that music seems to engage mesolimbic and mesocortical brain regions to activate the descending pain modulation pathway. Lower subjective pain ratings corresponded to a greater suppression in the dorsal gray matter when listening to music. This is the first imaging study to characterize the neural response of pain and how it is mitigated by music listening, and brain and spinal fMRI are appropriate means to study pain processing and its modulation in the central nervous system.</description>

   <description>Tannins and humic substances commonly referred to as natural organic matter (NOM), constitute an important component of natural water and soil systems. These species contain numerous phenol and carboxyl functional groups whose reactivity is strongly dependent on both the quantity and location of these moieties on the aromatic ring. In the realistic environmental conditions, both phenolic and carboxylic functional groups are adsorbed on a variety of colloidal metal oxide surfaces. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of humic-based substances, experimental data involving mineral-humate interactions are difficult to interpret. &#xd;
Here, we aim to develop a more detailed understanding of mineral-NOM interactions in aquatic systems, using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of simple organic acids having functional groups similar to those found in humic substances. SAMs of 4-(12-mercaptododecyl)benzene-1,2-diol (o-hydroxyphenol-terminated), 5-(12-mercaptododecyl)benzene-1,3-diol (m-hydroxyphenol-terminated), bis(11-thioundecyl) hydrogen phosphate (monoprotic phosphate) and 11-thioundecyl dihydrogen phosphate (diprotic phosphate) were prepared and deposited on a Au(111) surface. The composition of elements present on the surface were determined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and the orientation of monolayers on the Au(111) surface was explored by Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) &#xd;
Chemical force spectrometry has been used to determine the surface pKa of the monolayers and further used to explore the role of phenolic groups in the surface complexation of NOM by monitoring adhesion forces between iron and aluminum oxide sample and hydroxyphenol-terminated Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) modified tip. The results are discussed in the context of hydrogen bonding between corresponding species. The system in which there are multiple hydroxyl groups ortho to the carboxylic groups or adjacent to one another on the benzene ring results in significantly different force-distance profiles when interacting with the hydroxyphenol tip.</description>

   <description>I read witness poetry as a model of response to suffering. Compassion is feeling together with another. Compassion is, then, opposed to empathy’s feeling as another. Compassion can be better understood through the witness poetry that privileges metonymical relationships in which readers are contiguously positioned in relationship to a speaker. This emphasis on relationship can be contrasted to the collapse of relationship in identification in which a reader reads as though he or she is the lyric I, the poetic voice, rather than a listener. I discuss this reader-as-listener in contrast to the trauma studies-influenced discourse surrounding witness poetry, a discourse which focuses on indexical poetic evidence of a poet’s wounds and the transferability of the poet’s trauma to readers.&#xd;
Compassionate response, as demonstrated by this poetry, is premised on a recognition of one’s intimacy with or distance from that which one witnesses. Distance is not synonymous with disengagement, but rather with the space of relationship through which connection and consideration is possible. All intimacy involves some distance; the two are not opposites, but a continuum. &#xd;
Witness involves waiting: response derives from the time of relation through which it might form. This waiting has reflection as its retrospective partner. Together, they form commemoration, which brings reflection into future and communal celebration and remembrance. Com-memoration is linked to com-passion in this communal element. My project engages witness poetry as a communal form inviting feeling in community, response to widespread suffering, and the establishment of relationship and connection.</description>

   <description>Muscle strength capabilities are a determinant in the ability to successfully accomplish everyday tasks.  As such, the quantification of this aspect of human performance is of interest in many settings. Currently, the validity of muscle strength test results is reliant on the notion that during testing, the participant exerted an effort that is sincere, and that consisted of maximal voluntary contractions. Therefore, the ability to differentiate between maximal and non maximal muscular exertions is of importance. &#xd;
The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and validate probability-based decision rules for differentiating between maximal and non-maximal voluntary exertions of the knee and shoulder joint musculature during isokinetic dynamometry-based testing. For development of the decision rules, healthy participants performed a series of maximal and non-maximal exertions at different testing velocities through a prescribed range of motion. Two different theory-based approaches were subsequently used for decision rule development: the first approach was based on expected better consistency in strength waveform shapes and relative magnitudes during performance of maximal efforts in comparison to non-maximal efforts.  The second approach was based on the known force-velocity dependency in skeletal muscles.  &#xd;
In terms of discriminatory performance, several of the decision rules pertaining to the knee joint markedly improve upon those previously reported. In addition, a separate investigation demonstrated that the decision rules offer excellent discriminatory performance when applied to test results of participants that have undergone surgical reconstruction of their anterior cruciate ligament. As such, clinicians and researchers may be able to ascertain voluntary maximal effort production during isokinetic testing of the knee joint musculature with a high degree of confidence, and thus be able to rely on such scores for decision-making purposes &#xd;
With regards to the shoulder musculature decision rules, several methodological issues related to test positioning and signal processing need to be addressed prior to consideration of their use in the clinical domain.</description>

   <description>Extraction of bitumen from Alberta oil sands produces 2 to 4 barrels of aqueous tailings per barrel of crude oil. Oil sands process water (OSPW) contains naphthenic acids (NAs), a complex mixture of carboxylic acids of the form CnH2n+ZOx that are persistent and toxic to aquatic organisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that aerobic biodegradation reduces NA concentrations and OSPW toxicity; however, treatment times are long. &#xd;
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of an immobilized soil bioreactor (ISBR) for treatment of NAs in OSPW and to determine the role of ammonium and ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in NA removal. ISBRs have been used to successfully remediate water contaminated with pollutants such as pentachlorophenol and petroleum hydrocarbons. A system of two ISBRs was operated continuously for over 2 years with OSPW as the sole source of carbon. Removal levels of 30-40% were consistently achieved at a residence time of 7 days, a significant improvement compared to half-lives of 44 to 240 days reported in the literature. However, similar to biodegradation experiments in the literature, a significant portion (~60%) of the NAs was not degraded.&#xd;
The role of AOB in NA removal was investigated by decreasing ammonium concentration and inhibiting AOB activity with allylthiourea, neither of which significantly affected removal, indicating that AOB did not enhance NA removal. Furthermore, high AOB populations actually inhibited the removal of a simple NA surrogate. Therefore, a moderate ammonium concentration of 0.3 g/L is recommended. NA degradation occurred with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, however, removal levels were lower than those achieved with ammonium. &#xd;
Exploratory studies involving ozonation or biostimulation were conducted with the aim of increasing NA removal. Ozonation decreased NA concentration by 94% and total organic carbon (TOC) by 6%. Subsequent ISBR treatment removed ~30% of the remaining TOC. Addition of a NA surrogate increased heterotrophic NA-degrading populations due to the increase in available carbon, resulting in a significant increase in NA removal levels. However, use of a surrogate may result in a population that is only adapted to degradation of the NA surrogate.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines how transnational gay and queer discourses conceal ongoing forms of violence against multiple subaltern populations, through the seemingly natural teleology and progressive nature assigned to gay rights and queerness.  I use the theoretical framework of necropolitics, developed by Achille Mbembe who analyzes how power is exercised through killing and death, to examine two sites of violence that are typically presented as progressive: transnational gay rights and queer tourism.  First, I demonstrate that the problem of ‘anti-gay’ violence in non-western subaltern contexts is not due to a lack of legal rights, as most western activists have framed the issue, but is rather an issue of non-controlled forms of lateral violence carried out by non-state actors against multiple groups.  Second, I reveal that the representation of queer tourism as progressive masks subjection of subaltern labourers to violence and death.  These findings suggest that relations of power constituted through necropolitics should be the lens through which violence in subaltern contexts is read.  This perspective is in opposition to most western based transnational discourses that misread and disregard forms of violence in subaltern contexts and consequently facilitate the recurrence of violence in these contexts.</description>

   <title>Investigations of a New and Improved Precataylst for Palladium Catalyzed Cross Coupling Reactions</title>

   <description>Little attention has been given to the formation of the putative PdL2&#xd;
species required for Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Active species are&#xd;
generally difficult to store due to air-sensitivity and are therefore formed in situ at&#xd;
unknown rates and in unknown yields via a variety of palladium precatalysts.&#xd;
Commonly employed Pd(0) and Pd(II) precatalysts are often relatively ineffective&#xd;
because they generate only low concentrations of the bis(phosphine) species&#xd;
PdL2 under most reaction conditions. This thesis describes the use of the easily&#xd;
synthesized and easily handled Pd(η3-1-Ph-C3H4)(η5-C5H5) (I) as a superior&#xd;
precursor than any other documented system for the in situ formation of PdL2.&#xd;
Rapid and quantitative formation of active catalyst solutions allow us to&#xd;
demonstrate that I is also the best precatalyst known for PdL2-catalyzed crosscoupling&#xd;
reactions. We discuss the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction of 4-bromoanisole&#xd;
with phenylboronic acid and demonstrate that, under mild reaction conditions,&#xd;
higher initial rates and higher conversions with I can be obtained compared with&#xd;
other common precatalysts (Pd(OAc)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd2dba3, etc.) containing a&#xd;
variety of phosphine ligands. This methodology has also been extended to other&#xd;
cross-coupling reactions, as we demonstrate that higher initial rates and higher&#xd;
conversions with I can be obtained for a variety of Mizoroki-Heck arylations and&#xd;
Buchwald-Hartwig aminations.</description>

   <title>Topics related to vector bundles on abelian varieties</title>

   <subject>Vector Bundles</subject>
   <subject>Abelian Varieties</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2013-06-24 17:14:21.687</description>
   <description>This thesis is comprised of three logically independent parts.  As the title suggests, each part is related to vector bundles on abelian varieties. &#xd;
&#xd;
We first use Brill-Noether theory to study the geometry of a general curve in its canonical embedding.  We prove that there is no $g$ for which the canonical embedding of a general curve of genus $g$ lies on the Segre embedding of any product of three or more projective spaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
We then consider non-degenerate line bundles on abelian varieties.  Central to our work is Mumford's index theorem.  We give an interpretation of this theorem, and then prove that non-degenerate line bundles, with nonzero index, exhibit positivity analogous to ample line bundles.  &#xd;
As an application, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of families of cup-product maps.  Using this result, we prove that vector bundles, which are associated to these families, are asymptotically  globally generated.  &#xd;
To illustrate our results, we consider explicit examples.  We also prove that simple abelian varieties, for which our results apply in all possible instances, exist.  This is achieved by considering a particular class of abelian varieties with real multiplication.&#xd;
&#xd;
The final part of this thesis concerns the theory of theta and adelic theta groups.  We extend and refine  work of Mumford, Umemura, and Mukai.  &#xd;
For example, we determine the structure and representation theory of theta groups associated to a class of vector bundles which we call simple semi-homogeneous vector bundles of separable type.  We also construct, and clarify functorial properties enjoyed by, adelic theta groups associated to line bundles.</description>
