   <description>Planet migration is an important part of the formation of planetary systems, both in the Solar system and in extrasolar systems. When a planet scatters nearby comet- and asteroid-size bodies called planetesimals, a significant angular momentum exchange can occur, enough to cause a rapid, self-sustained migration (change of semi-major axis) of the planet. This migration has been studied for the particular case of the four outer planets of the Solar System, but is not well understood in general.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis used the Miranda computer simulation code to perform a broad parameter-space survey of the physical variables that determine the migration of a single planet in a planetesimal disk. A simple model presented within matched well with the dependencies of the migration rate for low-mass planets in relatively high-mass disks. When the planet's mass exceeded that of the planetesimals within a few Hill radii, the migration rate decreased strongly with planet mass. Other trends were identified with the root-mean-squared eccentricity of the planetesimal disk, the mass of the particles dragged by the planet in the corotation region, and the index of the surface density power law. The issue of resolution was also addressed, and it was shown that many previous works in this field may have suffered from being under-resolved.&#xd;
&#xd;
The trends were discussed in the context of an analysis of the scattering process itself, which was performed using a large simulation of massless planetesimals. In particular, a bias in scattering timescales on either side of the planet's orbit leads to a very strong tendency for the planet to migrate inwards, instead of outwards.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results of this work show that planet migration driven by planetesimal scattering should be a widespread phenomenon, especially for low-mass planets such as still-forming protoplanets. The simple model provided here, augmented by many more subtle effects, will prove essential to any future work in this underestimated field.</description>

   <description>Accurate 3D protein structure prediction is one of the most challenging problems&#xd;
facing bioinformaticians today. This thesis develops and examines an evaluation module&#xd;
for ranking predicted super-secondary structures – specifically a-helix pairs – as part of a&#xd;
case-based reasoning system.&#xd;
The proposed module is part of the Triptych project, which aims at the accurate&#xd;
prediction of the three-dimensional structure of proteins from contact maps. Triptych is&#xd;
an advanced case-based reasoning system that utilizes a library of existing protein&#xd;
structures and motifs to help predict the structure of a known polypeptide chain of amino&#xd;
acids that represents a target a-helix pair.&#xd;
The proposed module evaluates possible solutions by integrating multiple&#xd;
strategies, learning methods and sources of knowledge in the form of expert advisors. It&#xd;
uses advisors which integrate knowledge from the fields of biology, biochemistry,&#xd;
classical physics, and statistical data analysis obtained from pre-determined structures.&#xd;
Lastly, the proposed evaluation module would allow for the integration of more&#xd;
sources of knowledge, in the form of expert advisors, as well as serve as a framework for&#xd;
evaluating other structural motifs in future.</description>

   <description>Food restriction has been shown to affect responding for reward and has been manipulated to devalue reward.  Reward density has been shown to alter responding in both first-order schedules and chain schedules.  Devaluation has differential effects in first-order schedules and the links of chain schedules.  The objective of the current study was to analyze the reward devaluation effect in a two-link chain schedule by manipulating food restriction and reward density in the proximal link; these variables had previously not been studied systematically.  The chain schedule required rats to lever press according to a random interval 120-s schedule to turn on a light conditioned stimulus (CS).  In the presence of the CS rats were rewarded for pulling a chain; the chain was active on a variable ratio (VR) 5 schedule of reinforcement for some rats, while the chain was on continuous reinforcement (CRF) for the other rats.  Food restriction protocols were either 1-hr daily free feeding (1-hr feeding) or a daily ration to maintain weight at 80% of free feed controls (ration).  Devaluing the CS while in the isolated proximal link was done by exposing trained rats to sessions of chain pulling in the presence of the CS but withholding reward.  In subsequent lever press sessions without the CS, decreased responding was seen in rats that had undergone the devaluation procedure, but only in rats on the 1-hr feeding protocol.  This devaluation effect was found in both the CRF and VR 5 schedules.  Subsequent tests of lever pressing for the CS also revealed decreased responding.  Post-test CS discrimination sessions demonstrated CS devaluation that has not been demonstrated previously.  These results demonstrate that the isolated devaluation of the proximal link in a heterogeneous two-link chain schedule can result in decreased responding in the isolated first link.  This effect is dependent on sufficient food restriction and demonstrates a measurable devaluation effect which is independent of the reward being present.  This study also demonstrated that isolated devaluation of the second link can be subsequently measured in a post-test CS discrimination re-acquisition session regardless of food restriction, which had no significant effect in the session.  The devaluation effect has not been demonstrated in a re-acquisition session before, rather responding in previous re-acquisition sessions were only affected by food restriction.</description>

   <description>Operant acquisition, operant expression, and decision-making differentially rely on brain areas that are differentially affected by antipsychotic and other dopaminergic drugs.  The purpose of this thesis was to test if the known differential pharmacological and location of action of antipsychotic and other dopaminergic drugs predict the drug effects on operant acquisition, operant expression, and decision-making.  Clozapine and to a lesser extent, risperidone but not metoclopramide or haloperidol affect the prefrontal cortex (PFC); haloperidol, metoclopramide, and to a lesser extent, risperidone affect the dorsolateral striatum (DLS).  We used amphetamine as a broadly-acting indirect dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine agonist.&#xd;
	We found that all antagonists altered operant acquisition and expression, but in different ways.  The DA D2-like receptor antagonists blunted reinforcement impact during operant acquisition and induced an extinction-like decline in expression whereas the atypical antipsychotics with high PFC 5-HT-2A affinity maintained inactive lever presses during acquisition, but produced tolerance in expression.  Curiously, risperidone and metoclopramide, but not clozapine or haloperidol, more potently suppressed lever pressing in acquisition than expression.  In contrast, amphetamine suppressed operant expression, but not acquisition, at a dose range that increased locomotion and induced conditioned place preference.  Amphetamine decreased sensitivity to reward presentation and inactive lever pressing during operant acquisition, but had the opposite effects during expression.&#xd;
A very different pattern was found in the rodent gambling task (rGT), a model of the 4- choice (deck) Iowa Gambling Task used in humans.  The rGT puts small, immediate rewards that are advantageous in the long-term due to generally fewer and shorter associated penalties in conflict with large, immediate rewards that are disadvantageous in the long-term due to generally more and longer associated penalties.  Two antipsychotics (risperidone, haloperidol) but not the anti-emetic (metoclopramide) enhanced performance by shifting preferences towards advantageous options, but the antipsychotic that induces PFC Fos (clozapine) impaired performance.  Amphetamine decreased discrimination among different decks in the rGT. &#xd;
	These data demonstrate the differential effects of clinically relevant drugs on decision-making and different stages of operant learning.  The differential effects on operant responding and decision-making of different antipsychotic drugs provide important information regarding their therapeutic and side-effect profiles.</description>

   <description>When the second Protectoral Parliament offered the crown to Oliver Cromwell, he, despite his conservative impulses, rejected it.  Why would a man who believed in the ancient constitution and hoped to stabilize the British Isles turn down a traditional title that had the potential to unify the nation?  The answer partly lies within the numerous political tracts that were printed in the 1650s.  The kingship crisis sparked the creation of many pamphlets and petitions that sought to sway Cromwell one way or the other.  Three prominent groups that wrote regarding the possibility of King Oliver I were monarchists, sects, and republicans.  Monarchists sought to illustrate the advantages of kingship, the sects wrote of the consequences of kingly rule, and the republicans were divided on the question.  An analysis of the language and arguments in both the pamphlets addressed to Cromwell and Cromwell’s own speeches reveals that the sects were the most influential group that wrote to Cromwell.  At times, sectarian criticisms of the Protectorate were able to elicit responses in Cromwell’s speeches, a feat accomplished by neither monarchists nor republicans.  Employing providential language, the sects were able to convince Cromwell that God had judged against the office of king and that any attempt to reestablish such a government would result in eternal damnation.  Cromwell’s own religious convictions rendered him susceptible to reasoning of this sort.  Once he was aware of the sects’ arguments, Cromwell believed that he had no choice but to refuse the crown.</description>

   <description>Excessive abdominal obesity, coupled with a decline in muscle mass and physical function that is exacerbated by sedentary living, contributes substantively to the disease and disability common to our aging population.  The Senior Study, a randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the health benefits associated with performing resistance exercise (RE), aerobic exercise (AE), or a combination of both exercise modalities (RAE) for six months in the absence of caloric restriction, was conducted on otherwise healthy but abdominally obese, sedentary men (n=57) and women (n=79) between the ages of 60 and 80.&#xd;
	The purpose of the first manuscript (Chapter 3) was to compare the effects of exercise modality on visceral obesity and insulin resistance in the Senior Study.  All exercise groups significantly reduced total abdominal and visceral fat (P&lt;0.05) and waist circumference (P&lt;0.001), which measure explained 30% of the variance in total abdominal fat changes (P&lt;0.001).  AE and RAE improved insulin sensitivity (P&lt;0.05), but the RE group did not (P>0.1).  The greatest insulin sensitivity increase was observed within the RAE group (48% increase, P&lt;0.001).&#xd;
	The purpose of the second manuscript (Chapter 4) was to evaluate the effects of exercise modality on cardiorespiratory and functional fitness in the Senior Study.  AE and RAE increased cardiorespiratory fitness (P&lt;0.001), whereas RE did not (P>0.1).  All exercise groups improved functional fitness performance (P&lt;0.001), but age- and sex-specific percentile ranking improvement within RAE was greater than AE (P&lt;0.01).  RE and RAE significantly increased skeletal muscle (P&lt;0.01), predominantly in the upper body, while AE did not (P=1.0).  AE and RAE reduced total fat (P&lt;0.001).  Both fat loss and muscle gain were independent predictors of improvements in functional fitness (P&lt;0.05).&#xd;
	The findings from these studies demonstrate conclusively that a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program without caloric restriction is an optimal strategy for the therapeutic reduction of health risk in abdominally obese men and women.  While each exercise modality offers distinct benefits and remains a viable option for needs-based exercise prescription, the combination was associated with the greater simultaneous improvements to body composition, insulin resistance, and cardiorespiratory and functional fitness than either resistance or aerobic exercise alone.</description>

   <description>The biological remains preserved in the sediments of Arctic lakes and ponds in the Canadian High Arctic are important indicators of environmental change, especially as long-term instrumental data are often lacking. Although recent studies have underscored variability amongst these aquatic ecosystems, data are lacking from several key ecosystems. This thesis addresses some of these critical knowledge gaps in the Canadian high Arctic, using diatom-based limnological and paleolimnological techniques.&#xd;
First, I explore the limnology and diatom ecology along a gradient of bioclimatic zones on Melville Island in the western High Arctic. Lakes and ponds located in the most lushly vegetated zone were significantly different from those elsewhere on the island, both in terms of measured limnological variables and in terms of diatom assemblage composition. Diatom species distributions from Melville Island can best be explained by differences in pH and related variables.&#xd;
Secondly, ponds and lakes located in a High Arctic oasis on northern Ellesmere Island, recorded significantly higher specific conductivity, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon than freshwater bodies from the surrounding polar desert. &#xd;
In Chapter 5, I provide an examination of long-term environmental change from Melville Island, a region of the High Arctic for which no paleolimnological data exist. The timing of diatom shifts in a dated sediment core from a small pond is consistent with the onset of climate warming in the early 20th century. &#xd;
Differences in ice cover have often been invoked to explain differences in the timing and magnitude of diatom shifts in the Arctic, but this hypothesis has not been explicitly tested. In Chapter 6, I compare two adjacent lakes with similar physical characteristics but different ice cover regimes from northern Ellesmere Island. I provide strong evidence that extended ice cover dampens diatom community responses to environmental change. &#xd;
In the final chapters, I determine that marine-derived nutrients significantly affect the limnology of ponds on Cape Vera, Devon Island, and are related to the degree of seabird influence. Although a portion of diatom species distributions can be linked to seabird influence, the most abundant taxa show little relation to the nutrient gradient. In a paleolimnological context, diatoms are not  robust indicators of seabirds in High Arctic ponds.</description>

   <description>Provoked Vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of chronic vulvar pain, affecting 12% of women in the general population. PVD is characterized by a severe burning pain in response to pressure localized to the vaginal entrance. Research examining the pain component of PVD indicates that it has much in common with other chronic pain conditions. Increased pain sensitivity has been demonstrated in other chronic pain conditions to be due in part to impairment in centrally acting endogenous pain modulation systems, such as Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC). DNIC is triggered by the simultaneous application of two painful stimuli, with pain at one body site inhibiting pain at another body site. Because DNIC consists of a feedback loop that involves the spinal cord and the brain, it is thought to be dependent upon both sensory and affective pain components. In the current study, 20 women with PVD and 24 controls underwent sensory testing to determine the integrity of DNIC function. Unexpectedly, women with PVD displayed a DNIC response of greater magnitude than controls. Participants also completed measures to assess the interplay between group, DNIC, and psychosocial functioning. Women with PVD experienced decreases in psychosocial functioning; however, this reduction was not found to mediate the relationship between group and DNIC function. Findings of intact DNIC function in women with PVD do not imply that PVD is not a chronic pain condition. DNIC is a complex and dynamic process and warrants further study using different stimuli and paradigms. This study supports previous literature, while adding to the development of a greater understanding of the interaction between psychophysical and psychosocial components of chronic pain, which will allow for the creation of better assessment and treatment strategies.</description>

   <title>Breaking Down 'Race': A Radical Retheorization of Racial Formation Theory</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-14 09:51:37.71</description>
   <description>This thesis is a retheorization of Omi's and Winant's (1986) racial formation theory,which addresses the implications, inconsistencies and limitations of the initial theory. It is argued that Omi's and Winant's theory is problematic insofar as it supports the notion of ‘race’ permanency despite being a social constructionist theory. Omi and Winant also largely ignore the naturalization of ‘race’ and ignore the role of ‘nature’ and science in knowledge production and the reproduction of ‘race’. This thesis proposes a radical extension of the theory that addresses these problems, calling itself a radical racial formation theory. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
 In this extension, the debate over the ‘race’ concept and the conundrum that the &#xd;
‘race’ theorist finds him/herself in is discussed. The role of sociologists in maintaining ‘race’ is considered. ‘Race’ is argued to be an emergent and formative feature of modernity supported by liberalism. It is argued that ‘race’ is often tied to ‘nature’ and made to seem as though both precede history. It is argued that both ‘nature’ and science need to be contested. The notion that all scientific aims are altruistic is challenged given the embeddedness of science in the social. The doctrine of essentialism is confronted &#xd;
along with the belief that essences present themselves as secure ‘knowledge’. The &#xd;
production of racial knowledge is central to this thesis as it is seen as one of the least &#xd;
critiqued arenas in which ‘race’ is reproduced. A radical racial formation theory is situated theoretically in the camps of the Frankfurt school's critical theory and Foucault's poststructuralism and a rapprochement between the two is called for. There is a discussion of the ‘present’ in Foucault's genealogical use, where it is argued that the present exists as a powerful moment where there can be a discontinuity with the present social formation and a break with the racial past. Finally, the Gramscian use of ‘hegemony’ is used to understand racial dominance. It is argued that whiteness presents itself as hegemonic in racial formation and counter-hegemonic possibilities are entertained.</description>

   <description>In the last decade processes known as living/controlled radical polymerizations (L/CRP) have been developed which permit the synthesis of high-value specialty polymers. Currently, the three processes that have demonstrated the most potential are: reverse addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and stable free radical polymerization (SFRP). While each process has their strengths and weaknesses with regard to specific polymers and architecture, the viability of these systems to industrial scale production all lie in the ability to perform the polymerization in a water based system because of process, environmental and economic advantages. &#xd;
The most effective method of controlling the polymerization of vinyl acetate in bulk has been RAFT. We have developed a miniemulsion RAFT polymerization using the xanthate methyl (ethoxycarbonothioyl)sulfanyl acetate. The miniemulsion is stabilized with 3 wt% sodium lauryl sulfate, initiated with the azo-based water-soluble VA-060.&#xd;
The main focus of this research was adapting ATRP to a miniemulsion system. It was determined that ionic surfactants can be successfully employed in emulsion-based ATRP. The cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide provides excellent stability of the latex over a range of surfactant loadings (allowing the particle size to be easily manipulated), at temperatures up to 90 C, for a wide variety of ATRP formulations. A new method of initiation was developed for reverse ATRP, using the redox pair hydrogen peroxide/ascorbic acid. This nearly eliminated the induction period at the start of the polymerization, increased the polymerization rate 5 fold and, surprisingly, enabled the formation of well-controlled polymers with a number-average molecular (Mn) weight approaching 1 million (typically ATRP is limited to ~200 000). The ability to control the particle size and the number of polymer chains (through the target Mn) over a wide range of values allowed us to determine that ATRP is influenced by compartmentalization effects.&#xd;
The knowledge gained from our work in L/CRP was used to develop the surfactant-free SFRP of styrene. A multi-stage approach was adopted starting from dilute styrene/water solutions to favor the formation of the alkoxyamine and short chain SG1-oligomers (stage one) before the addition of the majority of the styrene (stage two).</description>

   <description>Education decentralization is sweeping many developing countries, creating massive regional disparities in education access and quality. Fiji provides education through the Community Based Approach, and although it is never referred to as being decentralized, it has all the same disparities occurring. A case study was conducted in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji, to evaluate the impact on surrounding communities of a newly opened (and privately funded) Secondary school.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-14 14:36:23.511</description>
   <description>This thesis examines Kantian conceptions of freedom.   Beginning with Kant himself, I show how Kant’s response to Hume concerning the rational justification of causal judgements results in his claim that the sensible world is governed a priori by causal principles.  Kant’s moral philosophy, however, requires a robust conception of freedom for moral agency to be possible.  These two features leave Kant in an apparent contradiction, for it is unclear how we, as members of the physical, causal world, can be truly free if all events are governed by causal laws.  I show that Kant’s solution to this contradiction lies in an important aspect of his transcendental idealism: the noumenal/phenomenal distinction.  I argue, further, that his solution is problematic due to the fundamentally unknowable quality of the noumenal realm, wherein freedom is located.  John McDowell’s Mind and World is introduced as an alternative to the extreme Kantian dualism between noumena and phenomena, while remaining within a broadly Kantian framework.  Like Kant, McDowell locates our freedom in our ability to operate through reason, though unlike his predecessor, he situates “the space of reasons” within nature.  This becomes possible by extending our conception of nature to include a “second nature”, thus making our initiation into the space of reasons—into the realm of freedom—a natural process.  Remaining Kantian in spirit, however, McDowell’s account inherits a problematic Kantian feature.  He maintains the distinction between two modes of intelligibility—between naturalistic and rational modes of explanation—thus leaving room for a hard-nosed naturalist to question the autonomy of the latter.   I argue that Peter Strawson’s proposal in “Freedom and Resentment” is able to assuage this worry in McDowell’s otherwise plausible model.  In it, Strawson provides an account of why the autonomy of rational explanations can never be undermined by purely naturalistic explanations, even in the face of a theoretical conviction in determinism.  Strawson argues that our “personal reactive attitudes” (like gratitude and resentment)—attitudes that express our commitment to a moral life and are representative of our functioning within the space of reasons—could never be undermined by the truth of determinism, and this reveals the extent to which our conception of ourselves as rational agents is immune from assault by the determinist.  The result is a compelling form of compatibilism that persuasively retains the space of reasons without appeal to Kantian noumenalism.</description>

   <description>Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) play an essential role in regulating the passage of macromolecules and cells between the blood stream and underlying tissues. The second messenger 3’, 5’ cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates numerous events in VECs, including permeability. Since human VECs express several distinct cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and these are the only enzymes that catalyze the inactivation of cAMP, we investigated if selective pharmacological inhibition of PDEs could impact VEC permeability. Interestingly, we found that PDE4 inhibitors decreased human aortic VEC (HAEC) permeability and PDE4 and PDE3 inhibitors decreased human microvascular VEC (HMVEC) permeability. Consistent with a role for both protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) in regulating VEC permeability, selective activators of these enzymes significantly decreased permeability. Since neither PDE4 nor PDE3 inhibitors significantly increased cAMP in these cells, our data are consistent with the idea that PDE inhibition causes small localized increases in “pools” of cAMP that regulate permeability. In order to test if PDE4 enzymes could act locally on pools of cAMP that regulated permeability, we selectively isolated the adherens junctional protein VE-cadherin from confluent monolayers of HAECs or HMVECs, and immunoblotted these isolates for cAMPeffectors and PDEs. Briefly, we found that each PKA-II, EPAC1, and a PDE4D variant, but not PDE3 enzymes, each could be isolated in VE-cadherin-based complexes from these cells. These novel findings identify PKA-II, EPAC1, and PDE4D as members of VE-cadherin-based signaling complexes in human VECs and are consistent with the idea that localized cAMP-signaling regulates permeability in these cells.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the experiences of four single Canadian mothers of Jamaican heritage with respect to their children’s education. Four themes suggested in the literature—beliefs, practices, barriers, and supports—guided the research. The interviews with the mothers largely confirmed previous research in the field. As such, all the mothers believed that it was a shared responsibility between parents and teachers in supporting children’s education. The mothers’ practices included primarily at-home support and to a lesser extent at-school support but did not include strict discipline. The barriers most salient for these mothers were lack of time and resources. To help overcome these barriers, the mothers relied on domestic kin networks. From these findings, the thesis provides implications for both research and practice.</description>

   <description>A study of suspended sediment transport dynamics was undertaken in the West&#xd;
River at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut. Hydrometerological conditions and&#xd;
sediment transport were measured over three seasons in order to characterize suspended&#xd;
sediment transport and grain size characteristics in relation to catchment and channel&#xd;
snowpack. Catchment snow water equivalence was measured at the beginning of the&#xd;
season, and discharge, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and grain size were&#xd;
measured at high temporal resolution through the runoff period to evaluate diurnal-,&#xd;
event- and seasonal-scale discharge-suspended sediment and grain size hysteresis. In&#xd;
addition, two models of a time-integrated suspended sediment trap, modified from Philips&#xd;
et al. (2000), were deployed in both streams to assess the representativeness of the&#xd;
captured sediment.&#xd;
The West stream discharge was dominated by the snowmelt peak in all three&#xd;
seasons. From 54-96% of suspended sediment was transported during this short period,&#xd;
although hysteresis relationships indicate that delivery of sediment and water were not&#xd;
synchronous and interannual relationships suggest disproportionate increases in sediment&#xd;
discharge with increased catchment snowpack. Clockwise and counter-clockwise&#xd;
suspended sediment hysteresis relationships were apparent and associated with lesser and&#xd;
greater snowpack, respectively. Additionally, grain size hysteresis suggested variable&#xd;
sediment sources during the season.&#xd;
Assessment of the time-integrated suspended sediment trap in the East and West&#xd;
streams illustrated that the captured material was not representative of the ambient stream&#xd;
conditions. Captured mass was typically two orders of magnitude less than expected&#xd;
iii&#xd;
capture rates (&lt;1%) and that the captured sediment was significantly coarser than the&#xd;
ambient stream suspended sediment load.&#xd;
Investigations of suspended sediment transfer in this small, High Arctic&#xd;
catchment reveal that sediment transport increased with increased catchment snowpack,&#xd;
but delivery of water and sediment were not synchronous during the nival discharge&#xd;
event suggesting changing sediment accessibility during the season. An attempt to&#xd;
collect a time-integrated suspended sediment sample that would incorporate variability in&#xd;
the character and magnitude of sediment delivery provided an unrepresentative sample,&#xd;
but results indicate that a detailed examination of hydraulic relationships between the trap&#xd;
and ambient conditions could ultimately lead to the development of a more representative&#xd;
trap.</description>

   <description>Surveillance is the act of collecting, analysing, and acting upon information about specific objects, data, or individuals.  Recent advances have allowed for the automation of a large part of this process.  Of particular interest is the use of computer algorithms to analyse surveillance data.  We refer to surveillance that uses this form of analysis as *algorithmic surveillance*.   The rapid growth of algorithmic surveillance has left many important questions unasked. &#xd;
&#xd;
Counter-surveillance is the task of making surveillance difficult.  To do this, it subverts various components of the surveillance process.  Much like surveillance, counter-surveillance has many applications.  It is used to critically assess and validate surveillance practices.  As well, counter-surveillance serves to protect privacy, civil liberties, and against abuses of surveillance.  Unfortunately, counter-surveillance techniques are often considered to be of little constructive use.  As such, they are underdeveloped.  At present, no counter-surveillance techniques exist that are able to adequately address algorithmic surveillance.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In order to develop counter-surveillance methods against algorithmic surveillance, the *process* of surveillance must first be understood.  Understanding this process ensures that the necessary components of algorithmic surveillance will be identified and subverted.  As such, our research begins by developing a model of the surveillance process.  This model consists of three distinct stages: the collection of information, the analysis of that information, and a response to what has been discovered (the action).  From our analysis of the structure of surveillance we show that counter-surveillance techniques prior to now primarily address the collection and action stages of the surveillance process.  We argue that the neglect of the analysis stage creates significant problems when attempting to subvert algorithmic surveillance, which  relies heavily upon a complex analysis of data.  As such, we go on to demonstrate how algorithmic analysis may be subverted.  To do this, we develop techniques that are able to subvert three common algorithmic analysis techniques: classification, cluster analysis, and association rules.  Each of these attacks against algorithmic analysis works surprisingly well and demonstrate significant flaws in current approaches to algorithmic surveillance.</description>

   <description>The psychostimulant effects of cocaine can be associated with environmental stimuli and thus can be easily conditioned in a laboratory setting. In rats, both behavioural stimulant and reinforcing effects of cocaine have been induced by presentation of stimuli previously paired with cocaine treatment. The stimulant locomotor response evoked by contextual stimuli is termed conditioned activity. It is hypothesized that haloperidol and the specific D3 receptor antagonist ABT-127 will produce a doubly dissociable effect on acquisition vs. expression of cocaine conditioned activity.  Male rats received three 1-hr sessions of habituation to activity monitoring chambers (outfitted with infrared emitters and detectors), one session each day, over 3 days during which no drug was administered. The conditioning phase began on the next day and consisted of three 1-hr sessions, one every 48 hrs. Rats were pre-treated intraperitoneally (IP) with haloperidol (50 µg/kg) or ABT-127 (1 mg/kg) (or vehicle) 1 hr and 0.5 hr before being placed into the activity chambers, respectively, and with the indirect-acting dopamine agonist cocaine (10 mg/kg) or saline immediately before placement into the chambers. The expression phase took place 48 hrs following the last conditioning session. Animals received a single injection of haloperidol, ABT-127 (or vehicle) 1 hr or 0.5 hr prior to placement in the activity chambers and saline was administered immediately before. Analyses revealed a significant interaction of drug by phase. In agreement with my hypothesis, haloperidol given during the conditioning phase blocked the acquisition of conditioned activity but failed to block the expression of conditioning when given on the test day. In contrast, ABT-127, when given before cocaine during conditioning failed to block the acquisition of conditioned activity but blocked the expression of conditioning when administered on the test day. Results suggest that D2 receptors are necessary for acquisition but not initial expression and D3 receptors are required for expression but not acquisition of cocaine conditioned activity.</description>

   <description>The behavioral effects of drugs that act on the brain’s dopamine (DA) system change with repeated exposure to the drug. Antipsychotic drugs, that block DA receptors, produce progressively greater effects on behavior with repeated testing. For example, rats repeatedly treated with a low dose of the D2 receptor-preferring antagonist haloperidol do not initially exhibit catalepsy, a response quantified by time spent on a horizontal bar without active movement. However, with repeated drug-environment pairings animals show a reduction in exploration and increases in catalepsy. The current thesis examined the drug-environment relationship in catalepsy sensitization, and how different DA receptor subtypes control this phenomenon.&#xd;
 	Treatment with a D2, but not D3 or D1-like receptor-preferring antagonist produced catalepsy sensitization. Catalepsy sensitization developed in one test environment did not transfer to another environment. Similarly, rats with a history of haloperidol treatments outside of the test environment (unpaired group) did not exhibit significant catalepsy when given haloperidol for the first time prior to catalepsy testing. Previous exposure to the catalepsy test environment led to a more rapid development of catalepsy sensitization. Thus, drug-environment interaction is critical for the development and expression of catalepsy sensitization.&#xd;
 	Rats previously given haloperidol and tested with saline in the drug paired environment exhibited conditioned catalepsy. The acquisition of conditioned catalepsy is dependent on D1-like receptors, while its expression is dependent on D3 receptors. Conditioned catalepsy showed gradual day-to-day extinction with repeated saline treatment in the previously haloperidol-paired environment. Following extinction, the response to haloperidol in previously sensitized rats shifted from environment-specific to environment-independent suggesting that a putative haloperidol drug cue alone can elicit conditioned catalepsy.&#xd;
 	In summary, treatment with a D2, but not D1-like or D3 receptor-preferring antagonist in a particular test environment produces catalepsy sensitization, while acquisition of conditioned catalepsy is dependent on D1-like receptors, and its expression is dependent on D3 receptors. Importantly, the acquisition and expression of sensitization to haloperidol is conditional on the presence of drug-associated environmental stimuli. Our findings provide further insight into the current understanding of learning processes involved in the action of antipsychotic drugs and the dissociable effects of D1-like, D2 and D3 receptors controlling this phenomenon.</description>

   <title>Expanding the Realm of Possibility: Magical Thinking and Consumer Coping</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-19 07:33:13.701</description>
   <description>This dissertation examines how consumers cope with stress and, specifically, the role of magical thinking in consumer coping. Magical thinking is defined here as creating or invoking ‘extraordinary’ connections – symbolic relationships founded on a belief or intuition in the presence of mystical forces in the world – in order to understand, predict, or influence events. &#xd;
&#xd;
Previous research in the field of psychology has largely depicted magical thinking as a cognitive distortion or fallacious reasoning that emerges in stressful situations due to limited information-processing capacity or to provide an illusory sense of control (e.g., Zusne and Jones 1989). In contrast, I draw from research in sociology, anthropology, and religious studies to explore the cultural dimension of magical thinking. Building on Stivers’ (1999) culturally-based theory of magic, I seek to develop an understanding of magical thinking as a process of meaning negotiation whereby consumers invoke mystical forces to cope with stressful events. These themes are explored through a phenomenological investigation of consumers’ weight loss activities.&#xd;
&#xd;
Findings provide insight on the nature and conceptual domain of magical thinking in the marketplace; magical thinking emerges as a set of practices that involves imparting moral meaning to a situation, reifying and externalizing one’s control over the situation, attempting to symbolically influence this powerful, mystical entity that is vested with control, and interpreting scientific symbols as objective signs from this entity. This research also advances our understanding of consumer coping by illuminating the role of magical thinking as a resource that expands the realm of the possible to help consumers cope with the moral responsibility for a domain over which they experience limited agency.</description>

   <title>Toward a Substantive Right of Exit</title>
   <creator>Mertel, Kurt Cihan Murat</creator>
   <contributor>Kymlicka, Will</contributor>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-19 12:00:15.908</description>
   <description>This paper deals with an important problem in contemporary political thought: the&#xd;
problem of ‘minorities within minorities’. The problem lies in the fact that, on one hand, while&#xd;
illiberal cultural or religious groups may seek to impose internal restrictions on their members&#xd;
which violate their basic rights as citizens - in the name of the freedom of religion/conscience,&#xd;
and/or cultural preservation – the state has a responsibility to protect the members of such groups&#xd;
from harm. On the other hand, the state would be overstepping the boundaries of legitimate&#xd;
authority - ignoring the freedom of association and conscience - if it intervened in the affairs of&#xd;
such groups to forcibly change their internal structure to cohere with liberal values.&#xd;
The necessity of a right to exit one’s inherited religious or cultural community has been&#xd;
widely acknowledged by philosophers as a solution to the problem of internal minorities, in that,&#xd;
it is seen both as a means to protect individuals from oppressive cultural and religious practices,&#xd;
as well as, establishing the necessary threshold groups must meet in order to be immune from&#xd;
state intervention. But while there may be a broad consensus on the necessity of the right of exit,&#xd;
there is significant disagreement over the specific content of a right: some philosophers support a&#xd;
‘minimalist’ or formal conception while others endorse a more substantive formulation, which&#xd;
involves supplementation with other negative and positive rights.&#xd;
The aim of this paper is to provide an outline of a substantive right of exit. The&#xd;
conception I defend involves the provision of an array of negative and positive rights and is based&#xd;
on a consistent and unequivocal commitment to autonomy, manifested in its most important&#xd;
element: the provision of a liberal (multicultural) education for minimal autonomy. The upshot of&#xd;
the education requirement for my conception of the right of exit is that it possesses considerable&#xd;
transformative power in addition to an enhanced protective role. The distinctiveness of my&#xd;
account revolves around its emphasis on the transformative function of exit, which seeks to&#xd;
address the underlying problem by focusing on the long-term challenge of 'liberalizing' cultures.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Plant cells contain plastids, organelles dedicated to performing specific biochemical processes including photosynthesis, starch and oil biosynthesis. Fatty acid biosynthesis in oil seeds occurs in one type of plastid  termed the leucoplast. Anabolic metabolism in leucoplasts includes the production of fatty acids and amino acids that depend on the availability of reductants such as NADPH. NADPH can be generated in plastid by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) which is the chief control enzyme and first step in the Oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway (OPPP).  G6PDH catalyses the reaction of NADP+ and glucose 6-phosphate to NADPH and 6-phosphogluconate. At least two compartment-specific isoforms of G6PDH exist in plants, a cytosolic and a plastidic form.  In this study, castor oil seed (COS) (Ricinus communis L.) was used as a model enzyme system for the ongoing study of oil biosynthesis in plants.  This is the first ever report of the full-length clone of the plastidic isoform of G6PDH being isolated from a castor cDNA library using polyclonal potato plastidic G6PDH antiserum.  The full-length cDNA was sequenced and compared to other G6PDH genes from higher plants, the castor sequence reveals conserved regions and conserved cysteine residues similar to other higher plant G6PDH.  Over expression of  the recombinant cleaved fusion protein in an E. coli expression system from the isolation of the cDNA clone shows it is enzymatically active, stable and unlike other plastid G6PDH’s dithiothreitol insensitive.  In fact this G6PDH  shows increased activation in the presence of dithiothreitol.  Initial kinetic characteristics shows that it behaves in a similar fashion enzymatically when compared to other higher plant chloroplast G6PDH.  The gene sequence and initial kinetic findings for castor G6PDH concur with other higher plant, non-photosynthetic, plastidic isoforms.</description>

   <description>We report on the dynamics of interstellar dust grains above the plane of the Milky Way.  Our Galactic model closely matches its large-scale observed properties, namely &#xd;
the luminosity output, the gas content and distribution, as well as the extinction of starlight by dust.  The gravitational model is composed of a central bulge, a disk and a&#xd;
dark matter halo.  In spite of the fact that the emphasis in the results is for our Galaxy, we also discuss the effects of varying key galactic parameters, such &#xd;
as the total&#xd;
 luminosity output and gas distribution.  The parameter space of the main dust grain properties is also explored; these include the grain type (graphite and&#xd;
 silicate) and size (0.001 - 0.3 micron).  The grains were launched at various positions in the Milky Way, but always in the disk-halo connection region; namely at three&#xd;
 Galactocentric radii (5, 8 and 11 kpc) and three initial heights (150, 300 and 1000 pc).  The grains were subject to radiation pressure, a gravitational force, as well &#xd;
 as Coulomb and collisional drag with the gas.  &#xd;
 Due to the large size of the parameter space, there is a wide variety of possible grain dynamics.  Indeed, depending on the physical conditions in which the grains were launched, &#xd;
 the grains could either: (1) fall down towards the midplane, (2) stay at the same height, (3)&#xd;
rise at a more or less constant speed, (4) rise and then fall down, (5) rise and then stabilize at some height, and (6) be quickly expelled into the intergalactic medium.  In&#xd;
general, graphite grains reach greater heights than silicate grains.  The smaller grains (of radius a = 0.01 and 0.001 micron) tend to stay at the same height they started&#xd;
at.  The classical grain (a = 0.1 micron) is the most sensitive to radiation pressure and usually reaches the highest heights, even if they are modest.  The largest grain&#xd;
we have studied (a = 0.3 micron) also responds well to radiative forces, but its large mass prevents it from going as high as the classical grain, and it even falls down&#xd;
towards the midplane under some circumstances.</description>

   <description>This thesis aims to explore the rise in the consumption of bottled water and the dominant narratives of normalization that seek to explain it. Commonly understood as the cumulative result of the power of marketing and misinformation, or the gullibility of ‘irrational’ consumers, the pervasive phenomenon of drinking bottled water is explained as another instance of the commodification of everything. However, these narratives contain a rather surprising omission: while it may seem obvious to state that bottled water is about bottles and water, the role of the bottles themselves in enabling the consumption of water ‘on the go’ to become such a ‘normal’ aspect of daily life is noticeably absent. I argue, by drawing upon work in consumer culture studies, sociologies of the brand, and material culture, that we need to reconsider the role of bottled water as both a brand and material object. Following the trajectories of two major brands of bottled water – Perrier and Dasani – through a content analysis of marketing and associated materials, I illustrate some of the diverse ways in which bottles, water, marketing and consumption are interrelated in the divergent and convergent trajectories of ongoing processes of normalization. In conclusion, I consider how such theoretical and empirical observations pose difficult questions and new challenges for those seeking to alter practices of consumption.</description>

   <description>Acid-base regulation, as reflected by hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]), and the chemoreflex control of breathing were examined in healthy pre- (PRE; n=20) and postmenopausal (POST; n=15) women of a comparable age (45 ± 2.7 vs. 52 ± 1.8 years). [H+] behaviour was examined in both groups at rest and during exercise above the ventilatory threshold using Stewart’s physicochemical approach to acid-base analysis. Ventilatory chemoreflex characteristics were assessed using Duffin’s modified rebreathing protocol that includes 5 min of prior hyperventilation and maintenance of either hyperoxic (150 mmHg) or hypoxic (50 mmHg) iso-oxia. As expected, the ovarian hormones progesterone ([P4]) and estrogen ([E2]) were significantly lower in the POST group. [H+] was unaffected by menopausal status at rest or during exercise. At rest the POST group exhibited significantly higher PaCO2 and [SID] values relative to the PRE group. In general, the acidifying effects of increased PaCO2 were offset by the alkalizing effect of increases in [SID] (or vice versa) in the POST group such that [H+] did not differ between PRE and POST groups. The central ventilatory chemoreflex also differed between groups with the POST group exhibiting a significantly higher threshold and a lower sensitivity in the response to CO2 relative to the PRE group. [P4] was found to partially account for the significant group differences in acid-base and central ventilatory chemoreflex control characteristics supporting the role of [P4] as an important determinant of acid-base status and the chemical control of ventilation in healthy women. Findings of the current study may have potential relevance in understanding the increased occurrence of various health conditions such as osteoporosis and sleep disordered breathing in females following the onset of menopause.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-21 10:53:33.232</description>
   <description>The following thesis is concerned with the way we think of particular objects. More specifically, it is concerned with de re thoughts and beliefs, which are parasitic upon the objects they are about.  In ascribing and expressing de re thoughts and beliefs, we employ de re expressions, such as demonstratives and names.  There is a pervasive view in the philosophy of language, known as the direct-reference view, that claims that these expressions contribute to thoughts nothing over and above objects themselves.  I argue that not only is this view of de re expressions untenable upon reflection on its repercussions for cognitive significance and judgement, but also that the considerations that motivate its genesis rest on a mistaken understanding of the alternative, viz a Fregean understanding of thought that employs a notion of sense.  In the first chapter, I present logical difficulties that face accounts of de re belief and a quasi-Fregean response to them.  In the second chapter, I focus on two exhaustive interpretations of the cognitive significance of de re expressions on the direct-reference view, and I argue that both interpretations are untenable either because they cannot account for propositional unity, or because they isolate experience from judgement.  In the third chapter, I present a holistic interpretation of sense, and argue that it is neither faced by critiques presented by proponents of direct-reference, nor by the difficulties I articulate in the first two chapters.</description>

   <description>Five manhole models, three composed of brick and two composed of concrete, were created in the laboratory with the goal of simulating existing manholes in the field that have been deteriorated by stress and corrosion. The samples were rehabilitated using three different liners: a plastic polyurea spray-on liner applied to a brick manhole, an HDPE slip liner (grouted in place) applied to a brick and concrete specimen, and a calcium aluminate grout applied to a brick and concrete specimen. Each sample was tested under axisymmetric pressure in the hoop compression cell, simulating horizontal effective stresses that act on a manhole in a radially symmetric manner. At 500 kPa, minimal radial deflections were observed with no notable damage to any specimen. Each specimen was then tested in a diametrically opposed 2-point loading setup to test the manhole in bending which may be induced to on a structure in the field by surface activity or adjacent excavation. The sample rehabilitated with the plastic spray-on liner behaved in a ductile manner, yielding at the lowest strength. The samples rehabilitated with the calcium aluminate grout exhibited high peak strengths, but yielded in catastrophic failure at small deformations. The samples repaired with the HDPE slip liner also produced high peak strengths with the grout component yielding in brittle failure, but residual strengths mobilized in the HDPE liner prevented total collapse of the samples. Although all of the liners tested present viable rehabilitation solutions within the prescribed deformation limits, the HDPE slip liner is the preferred method of treatment solely based on considerations of strength and ductility; practical considerations of cost and constructability also need consideration.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-22 16:42:44.821</description>
   <description>Liberal neutrality is the idea that laws should not be based on religious or philosophical doctrines that not everyone accepts. The idea is closely related to the "liberal principle of legitimacy", which holds that laws are legitimate only if they are acceptable to people who are subject to them. In this thesis, I examine if the idea of neutrality meets liberalism's own requirements of legitimacy. To do so, I ask what arguments can be given to persuade evangelical Christians--a sizable minority of the U.S. population who are opposed to neutral policies on abortion, school prayer, etc.--to accept neutrality. First, I examine Ackerman and Rawls's "consensus-finding" argument, which claims generally that most comprehensive conceptions of the good are compatible with neutrality. Second, I examine Larmore, Dworkin, and Kymlicka's "consensus-building" arguments, which try to locate particular principles which non-neutralists (perfectionists) are likely to accept, and the acceptance of which is said to guarantee the acceptance of neutrality as well. I find both arguments unsatisfactory; neither is acceptable to a person who subscribes to the evangelical view of God and human nature. Third, I consider Rawls's proposal to exclude evangelicals and the like, based on the test of reasonableness which he believes is "freestanding". However, I find his test of reasonableness dependent on particular understandings of the terms "free and equal citizens", "common human reason", and "fair terms of cooperation". The test of reasonableness, I suggest, is not freestanding, and it is thus circular to use it as a criterion of exclusion. I conclude, therefore, that liberal neutrality fails to satisfy the liberal principle of legitimacy.</description>

   <description>The visual grasp reflex provides automatic orienting of gaze (the visual axis in space) to novel visual stimuli. Previous studies have demonstrated activation of neck muscles of awake monkeys appearing at a short fixed latency (55 to 95 ms) after visual target presentation, regardless of whether or when saccades are made. The purpose of these early visually-driven muscle activations may be to prime head rotation required as a part of the coordinated eye-head movement to the target. Similar orienting responses might be found for visually guided reaching. Here, we explore early visually-driven muscle activations of the human upper limb immediately preceding planar reaching movements. Subjects performed reaches towards small visual peripheral targets while upper limb kinematics were recorded and intramuscular electromyography was collected from four shoulder and elbow muscles. Subjects maintained their right hand at a central fixation marker that was extinguished for a gap period (200 ms) prior to appearance of a peripheral target. Subjects were instructed to reach to the target as quickly as possible. Some subjects exhibited a short burst of muscle activity (about 20 ms duration) time-locked to visual target onset. This burst occurred around 85 ms to 105 ms after target onset and preceded the onset of muscle activity associated with volitional arm motion by about 100 ms. Notably, this burst was dependent on target location: visually-driven muscle activity occurred in right shoulder extensor muscles for rightward targets and was absent for leftward targets. In order to better dissociate the visual burst from volitional motor activity, we employed a delay paradigm. No time-locked muscle activity was present in the delay task either after the target appeared or after the fixation marker was extinguished. This suggests that the visual burst is dependent on the imminence of voluntary movement and the laterality of the target. We conclude that the appearance of a visual target can result in short-latency activity on the arm musculature that is appropriate for orienting the arm to the target.</description>

   <description>Every aerobic organism expresses cytochrome c oxidase to catalyze reduction of molecular oxygen to water, and takes advantage of this energy releasing reaction to produce an electrochemical gradient used in cellular energy production. The protein SCO (Synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase) is a required assembly factor for the oxidase, conserved across many&#xd;
species. SCO is implicated in the assembly of one of two copper centres (ie., CuA) of cytochrome oxidase. The exact mechanism of SCO’s participation in CuA assembly is not known. SCO has been proposed to bind and deliver copper, or alternatively to act in reductive preparation of the CuA site within the oxidase. In this body of work, the strength and stability of Cu(II) binding to Bacillus subtilis SCO is explored via electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies and by calorimetric methods. An equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.5x10-12 M was&#xd;
determined as an upper limit for the BsSCO-Cu(II) interaction, via differential scanning calorimetry. In the first reported case for a SCO homolog, dissociation kinetics of Cu(II) from BsSCO were characterized, and found to be dependent on both ionic strength and the presence of free Cu(II) in solution. Further differential scanning calorimetry experiments performed at high ionic strength support a two-step model of BsSCO and Cu(II) binding. The implications of this model for the BsSCO-Cu(II) interaction are presented in relation to the mechanism of interaction between SCO and the CuA site of cytochrome c oxidase.</description>

   <description>A two-stage process is proposed that is based on the biological production of H2S from organic waste and its subsequent overall conversion to H2 via an exothermic reaction.  The current study examined the first step of this process, namely, the design and operation of a packed bed bioreactor with high volumetric H2S production (mol/m3.d) and its comparison to analogous methanogenic technology.&#xd;
&#xd;
A novel method of inoculum design was developed by evaluating the kinetics and immobilization potential of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 7757) and a sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) consortium.  The consortium’s kinetics, as measured by the specific rate of sulfate reduction (1.2 g SO42-/g CDW.h), were approximately twice as fast as those of D. desulfuricans.  The pure strain however exhibited superior immobilization potential.  Studies revealed that a mixed inoculum containing 96 % D. desulfuricans and 4 % consortium facilitated the rapid immobilization of a highly active SRB biomass and contributed to improved bioreactor performance. &#xd;
&#xd;
Diatomaceous earth (DE) pellets, porous glass beads, polyurethane foam, and bone char were evaluated as potential carrier materials for SRB immobilization.  The DE pellets immobilized the most biomass, were well suited for use at the industrial scale, and were thus employed in all continuous flow bioreactor experiments.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using the designed inoculum and DE pellets, a 615 mL bioreactor achieved a volumetric productivity of 493 mol H2S/m3.d (at D = 1.6 h-1) and a dissolved sulfide concentration of 9.9 mM.  This occurred after 8 d of operation and represents a tenfold reduction in the required start-up period compared to similar bioreactors in the literature.&#xd;
&#xd;
An N2 strip gas was later used to remove the dissolved sulfide to the gas phase and enhance sulfate conversion.  Shifting the medium pH from 7 to 6 increased the fraction of strippable sulfide and improved the strip gas composition from 3.6 to 5.8 mol % H2S. The strip gas to liquid feed ratio (G/L, m3/m3) was investigated in the range of 0-14 and was found to be a suitable basis for scale-up indicating that productivities of up to 830 mol/m3.d were readily achievable.  This represents a considerable improvement over current methanogenic bioreactor productivities.</description>

   <description>Green roofs have, in the past 15 years or so, gained increasing acceptance as a means of replacing or offsetting the lost of green space due to urban development and urban sprawl.  Green roof systems can provide numerous potential benefits, both public and private, including improved control of a building’s internal temperatures with reduced power use. The effectiveness of Green roofs at decreasing energy use in buildings in warm climates is well known. However, their thermal performance in cold climate conditions is not well known, but is of particular interest in regions such as in Eastern Ontario where Green roofs are rapidly gaining popularity. This thesis presents an initial step in understanding the thermal behaviour of currently used Green roof systems in cold climate conditions, and quantifying the thermal benefits, if any, to be gained from the installation of these systems in cold regions as compared against a typical conventional roofing system. A review of available literature is presented which discusses the various benefits of Green roofs. A novel hot box has been designed and constructed, and thermal testing of two Green roofs and a conventional flat roof using the new apparatus are presented and discussed. The data are used to estimate the potential energy savings that might be expected with the installation of a Green roof (such as those tested) on a flat roofed commercial building in the Kingston area. The data suggest that Green roofs may provide a marginal (10% to 24%) thermal benefit as compared with a conventional flat roof under cold climate conditions. This benefit could translate into a $0.09 savings per square metre of roof area in total heat energy costs on an annual basis. Recommendations for future work in this research area are provided.</description>

   <title>Time and Patterns of Development of Dunes Subjected to Sudden Changes in Flow Depth</title>

   <description>In unsteady flows, dune dimensions may vary considerably from fully-developed dimensions&#xd;
produced from a flat bed under a steady and uniform flow. Specifically, dune height&#xd;
and length are observed to lag discharge when the flow is non-steady, resulting in dimensions&#xd;
that are out of phase with the prevailing flow. This research attempts to provide&#xd;
some insight into the behaviour of dunes when the flow is suddenly changed, as well as&#xd;
the time-scale of the related dune changes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Nineteen experimental runs were carried out in the 21-m long, 0.76-m wide Sediment&#xd;
Transport Flume at Queen’s University. In ten of these runs the flow depth, h, was suddenly&#xd;
increased (h2/h1 > 1) and in nine runs the flow depth was suddenly decreased (h2/h1&#xd;
&lt; 1). In all runs, the slope of free surface was kept equal to the slope of the bed such that&#xd;
the change in flow rate is represented by the change in the flow depth. Seven ratios of the&#xd;
two flow depths, h2/h1 (varying between 0.49 and 2.29), were performed for three slopes&#xd;
(S = 1/792, 1/534, 1/341). The bed material was a coarse, poorly-graded silica sand (D50 =&#xd;
1.0 mm).&#xd;
&#xd;
Longitudinal bed profiles were taken along the centreline of the flume approximately&#xd;
every 6–8 minutes to determine the transient dune dimensions and the time at which the&#xd;
dunes acquired their new equilibrium dimensions. This time is termed the duration of dune&#xd;
development, Td.&#xd;
&#xd;
Through dimensional and physical considerations, Bielenberg (2006) established that&#xd;
the dimensionless counterpart of Td should be a function of the material number, relative flow depth, relative flow intensity, and ratio of the flow depths h2/h1.  The present experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of the relative flow intensity and&#xd;
h2/h1 on the duration of dune development.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results indicate that equilibrium dune dimensions do not depend on the initial shape&#xd;
of the bed. After the period Td, the dunes tend to be similar to those produced from a flat&#xd;
bed.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is found that Td is strongly dependent on h2/h1, and weakly dependent on the flow intensity. All&#xd;
other determining variables remaining the same, Td decreases with increasing values of&#xd;
flow intensity.&#xd;
&#xd;
Semi-empirical relations for the dimensionless duration of dune development are&#xd;
presented.</description>

   <description>Software maintenance is the lifecycle activity that consumes the greatest amount of resources. Maintenance is a difficult task because of the size of software systems. Much of the time spent on maintenance is spent trying to understand source code. Refactoring offers a way to improve source code design and quality. We present an approach to refactoring that is based on the functionality of source code. Sets of heuristics are captured as patterns of source code. Refactoring opportunities are located using these patterns, and dependencies are verified to check if the located refactorings preserve the dependencies in the source code. Our automated tool performs the functional-based refactoring opportunities detection process, verifies dependencies, and performs the refactorings that preserve dependencies. These refactorings transform the source code into a series of functional regions of code, which makes it easier for developers to locate code they are searching for. This also creates a chunked structure in the source code, which helps with bottom-up program comprehension. Thus, this process reduces the amount of time required for maintenance by reducing the amount of time spent on program comprehension. We perform case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated approach on two open source applications.</description>

   <description>George Dickie’s institutional theory of art has been subject to extensive debate over the past 30 years.  It has been both revered and deplored, garnering such attention for the seemingly controversial way in which Dickie answers the question, “What is art?”  In Dickie’s view, an object derives its existence as a work of art in the context of the informal institution of the “artworld,” a concept which was borrowed from Arthur Danto’s earlier work on the theoretical context surrounding works of art.  Another significant feature of Dickie’s institutional theory is that it provides a definition of art, a problem that philosophers of art have attempted to solve for the past few centuries.  Dickie’s theory inclines one to dismiss other candidates for definitions as implausible, such as those put forth by R.G. Collingwood and Leo Tolstoy, since, as Dickie insists, an acceptable definition of art must be able to account for the many different kinds of practices that are all referred to as “art.”  I do not wish to conclude that the task of defining “art” is no longer a viable option for philosophers, as others such as Morris Weitz and Peter Kivy have suggested.  Instead, I will provide an alternative way of philosophizing about art that is similar in some ways and yet very different from the methods Weitz and Kivy have proposed.  I will illuminate a new way of interpreting the theories of Collingwood, Tolstoy, and Danto which is different from those that have been proposed in the past, one that highlights their normative and institutional features.  On the foundations of this new interpretation, I will propose a new role for the philosopher of art, one that takes into consideration the significance of the institutional structure of the artworld and how it can be normatively constrained.</description>

   <description>Currently, therapeutic proteins and peptides are delivered subcutaneously, as they are readily denatured in the acidic, protease rich environment of the stomach or gastrointestinal track and low bioavailability results from poor intestinal absorption through the paracellular route. Encapsulation of therapeutic peptides and proteins into polymeric micro- and nano- particle systems has been proposed as a possible strategy to overcome limitations to oral protein administration.  Furthermore, it was shown that nanoparticles having diameters less than 5µm are able to be taken up by the M cells of Peyer’s patches found in intestinal mucosa . However, the current methodologies to produce particles within desired range involves organic solvents and several steps. In this study, spray drying was investigated as a microencapsulation alternative, as it offers the potential for single step operation, producing dry particles, with the potential for extending the microparticle size into the nano-range.  The particles were produced by spray drying of alginate/protein solutions. The effect of spray drying operational parameters on particle properties such as recovery, residual activity and particle size was studied. Particle recovery depended on the inlet temperature of the drying air, whereas the particle size was affected by the feed rate and the alginate concentration of the feed solution. Increase in alginate:protein ratio  increased protein stability during the process and shelf live experiments. Presence of 0.2 g trehalose/g particle increased the residual activity up to 90%. The resulting spherical micro and nanoparticles had smooth surfaces. Stable glycol-chitosan-ca-alginate particles were produced with single step operation. The resulting particles had mean diameter around 3.5μm and released 35% of the initial protein content to the simulated stomach environment within 2 hours. The protein distribution within the particle was studied by confocal laser scanning microscope with florescent labeled protein. The image showed protein deposition toward the surface of the particles. Total drying time and Peclet number was calculated for the particles and found to be 8.5 ms and 240, which indicates that particle formation was governed mainly by convection, which resulted in a hollow central region and protein distribution toward the particle surface. This study shows that stable alginate particles containing proteins can be produced in a single step by spray drying, where the particles had a mean size lower than the critical diameter necessary to be orally absorbed by M cell’s of the Peyer’s patches in the gastrointestinal tract and thus can be considered as a promising technology for oral peptide and protein delivery.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-24 17:25:22.212</description>
   <description>This thesis is concerned with hypothesis testing in models where data exhibits time dependence. The focus is on two cases where the dependence of observations across time leads to non-standard hypothesis testing techniques.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis first considers models estimated by Generalized Method of Moments (GMM, Hansen (1982)) and the approach to inference. The main problem with standard tests are size distortions in the test statistics. An innovative resampling method, which we label Empirical Likelihood Block Bootstrapping, is proposed. The first-order asymptotic validity of the proposed procedure is proven, and a series of Monte Carlo experiments show it may improve test sizes over conventional block bootstrapping. Also staying in the context of GMM this thesis shows that the testcorrection given in Hall (2000) which improves power, can distort size with time dependent data. In this case it is of even greater importance to use a bootstrap that can have good size in finite samples.&#xd;
&#xd;
The empirical likelihood is applied to a multifactor model of U.S. bank risk estimated by GMM. The approach to inference is found to be important to the overall conclusion about bank risk. The results suggest U.S. bank stock returns are sensitive to movements in market and liquidity risk.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the context of panel data, this thesis is the first to my knowledge to consider the estimation of cost-functions as well as conduct inference taking into account the strong dependence of data across time. This thesis shows that standard approaches to estimating cost-functions for a set of Canadian banks lead to a downward bias in the estimated coefficients and therefore an upward bias in the measure of economies of scale. When non-stationary panel techniques are applied results suggest economies of scale of around 6 per cent in Canadian banking as well as cost-efficiency differences across banks that are correlated with size.</description>

   <title>An Associational Model of Society Implicit to John Rawls's Theory of Justice</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-25 19:19:43.637</description>
   <description>This paper will examine John Rawls’s views regarding the make up of society and, in particular, it will investigate the question of whether or not Rawls’s theory of justice is dependent upon accepting and endorsing the view that society is, or, at least, resembles an association. The aim of the paper will be to defend the position that Rawls’s theory of justice is in fact dependent upon an associational conception of society, and that it, therefore, relies upon the idea that the individuals in a society share a common interest or purpose. Thus, far from providing a liberal conception of society, this paper will attempt to illustrate that Rawls actually presents a more communitarian outlook of society than many might expect from a purportedly liberal thinker. In order to best prove the essential link to an associational conception of society, I discuss three principles that provided Rawls with reasons for preferring the difference principle to other modes of justice, and suggest that these founding principles provide sufficient evidence for connecting Rawls’s theory of justice to an associational conception of society. By advocating such a vision of society, Rawls betrays a fundamental premise of his own political liberalism, namely, the idea that individuals do not necessarily share a common interest or purpose with one another.</description>

   <title>Chemical and biological recovery of Killarney Park, Ontario Lakes (1972-2005) from historical acidification</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Biology) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-24 22:33:35.058</description>
   <description>Forty-five lakes in Killarney Provincial Park and the surrounding area in south-central Ontario, Canada, were sampled for crustacean zooplankton and water chemistry in the summer of 2005.  For each of the lakes, we had historic data from peak-acidification in the 1970s and post-acidification periods in 1990 and 2000.  Situated among the orthoquartzite ridges of the La Cloche Mountains in and near Killarney Provincial Park, many of these lakes were acidified during the mid-1900s owing to extensive mining and smelting activities in nearby (40-60 km) Sudbury, Ontario.  There is large variation in the geochemistry of the soils and the bedrock within the park.  As a result, these freshwater lakes have varying degrees of acidification, ranging from being heavily acidified (pH &lt; 4.5) to others that were buffered from the effects of acidic deposition.  With over 90% reductions in sulphur dioxide smelter emissions over the past 30 years and the present, many lakes in the Sudbury region are starting to show strong evidence of chemical recovery.  Despite significant increases in lake water pH, there is limited evidence of biological recovery.  A variety of univariate and multivariate metrics, as well as variation partitioning, were used to examine recovery on a lake-by-lake basis and on a regional scale.  Our results revealed only moderate recovery of crustacean zooplankton communities despite improvements in water quality.  Some lakes increased in zooplankton richness while others decreased compared to richness during peak acidification.  Shifts in community composition from a damaged state toward those typical of circum-neutral lakes were observed for lakes that have chemically recovered.  The lack of chemical recovery is believed to be impeding biological recovery of many lakes.  Biological resistance and dispersal limitation do not appear to be hindering biological recovery.  Other stressors such as the invasion by the predatory zooplankton Bythotrephes and climate change may delay biological recovery in the coming years.  Future recovery of Killarney Park lakes will require further chemical recovery for biological recovery to become complete.</description>

   <description>Stroke is a condition that arises from partial or complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the brain. Upper limb impairments (sensorimotor deficits) usually occur as a result of stroke. Assessment and diagnosis of the resulting upper limb impairments is important for effective rehabilitation and proper recovery. In terms of assessment, current ordinal scale systems used are inherently subjective and incorporate coarse rating scores (Chedoke McMaster, Fugel Meyer test, etc.). These scores do not provide clinicians with information regarding the underlying impairments which is important for effective rehabilitation therapy. &#xd;
We investigated the use of a reaching task on a bi-lateral upper limb robotic device (KINARM), developed by one of our team members (Stephen Scott), to assess upper limb impairments due to stroke. Control and stroke subjects were instructed to reach with both arms on the robotic device to illuminating spatial targets as quickly and as accurately as possible. We first developed a tool that would aid in locating targets where reaching impairments are visible for stroke subjects. From the Kinematic data collected, we then selected reaction time and first peak velocity of the hand and investigated their potential for separating control and stroke subjects. Results of our analysis showed the potential of both parameters as good quantitative assessment measures. In particular results for reaction time presented symmetrical differences between both arms were of main interest in this thesis. Such differences presented the potential of sensitivity in showing subtle impairments.</description>

   <description>Le présent travail se propose d’étudier le rôle du spectateur, sa portée esthétique et philosophique, dans un mouvement qui a mené Diderot de la théorie de l’enthousiasme à la théorie du sang-froid. Jusqu’à présent, ce passage a surtout été considéré en fonction de l’acteur que les textes du philosophe présentent d’abord comme un être sensible, qui s’absorbe entièrement dans son personnage (l’« enthousiasme »), et, plus tard, comme un technicien « froid », qui construit soigneusement sa performance (le « sang-froid »).  &#xd;
	Notre analyse cherche donc à aborder cette évolution du point de vue de la réception, afin de montrer comment la pensée diderotienne du spectateur peut éclairer d’un jour nouveau ce revirement crucial pour l’esthétique théâtrale du philosophe. Nos lectures des plus importants écrits de Diderot feront voir que leur évolution théorique résulte en grande partie d’un changement de perspective critique. Diderot délaisse un projet d’obédience rhétorique pour entreprendre une recherche philosophique sur l’art de théâtre, recherche qui révèle la part de la technique (de la rhétorique) dans la création et qui situe la fonction de spectateur au centre de son enquête.  &#xd;
	En retraçant l’évolution dans son approche du phénomène du récepteur, nous allons montrer que le philosophe fait d’abord la place, dans son projet enthousiaste, au spectateur réel et transcendantal, mais que sa nouvelle vision de l’art d’imitation lui fait élaborer la notion du spectateur immanent à l’objet d’art et à la psychologie de l’artiste. Ce spectateur intérieur, en fait, cette position d’extériorité que l’artiste (poète, comédien) se doit de prendre à l’égard de sa matière, sera érigé par Diderot en pierre angulaire de la production artistique.</description>

   <description>Safety snap-hooks are a critical component of a fall-arrest system worn by individuals working at elevated&#xd;
heights. Current snap-hook technology has not evolved in many years, and as a result, the hooks are both&#xd;
heavy and conduct electricity.&#xd;
This project investigated the design and manufacture of a polymer-composite safety-snap-hook. The&#xd;
objective was to determine whether a light-weight, dielectric, composite hook can meet the safety&#xd;
requirements, while being manufactured at a competitive price.&#xd;
Several fibre arrangements were tested using current aluminium hook geometry. A research plan was&#xd;
designed and completed to maximize the hook strength by optimizing fibre architecture. These results were&#xd;
then used to design a composite hook that meets all the current CSA standards (static load, dynamic load,&#xd;
side and front load gate test). The design enables the hook to be completely non-conductive and lighter than&#xd;
the current pincer hook. Different manufacturing techniques were also considered and it was determined&#xd;
that both the net-shaped moulding and vacuum bag panel method were suitable techniques.&#xd;
It is recommended that further research be carried out to decrease the cost of the composite hook. Less&#xd;
expensive resin materials should be tested to determine how much strength is lost with lower grade resins.&#xd;
A standard test should also be developed so that hooks can be characterized for their electrical conductivity.&#xd;
In addition, research is required to find a process to cut the mats so that the cut-outs can be handled without&#xd;
falling apart, making the net-shape moulding process more suitable. Further design modifications are also&#xd;
needed to meet newly proposed gate regulatory standards. Research is required to determine whether&#xd;
increasing the thickness of the gate or embedding a metal reinforcement would provide the required gate&#xd;
strengths.</description>

   <title>PA3719-Mediated Regulation of the MexAB-OprM Efflux System of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-25 19:00:42.929</description>
   <description>Intrinsic antimicrobial resistance of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has mainly been attributed to the presence of several chromosomally-encoded multidrug efflux systems.  The MexAB-OprM system exports the largest range of structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents and its expression is modulated by multiple regulatory controls.  To develop a better understanding of mexAB-oprM overexpression in nalC mutants, which characteristically produce the effector protein PA3719 that binds and disrupts MexR transcriptional repression of mexAB-oprM, the PA3719-MexR interaction domains were investigated.  Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, the C-terminus of PA3719 was found to be sufficient to mediate MexR-binding, and the binding region was found to be distinct from the MexR DNA-binding motif.  The two-hybrid system was also used in an attempt to understand the role of PA3720, a protein of unknown function that is also overexpressed in nalC mutants.  Results from this study confirm that PA3720 does not function to bind and alleviate NalC transcriptional repression of the PA3720-PA3719 operon.  This study also attempted to identify the signals involved in overexpressing PA3720-PA3719, in the hopes to elucidate the natural function of MexAB-OprM.  Random transposon mutagenesis using a PA3720-PA3719 promoter-lacZ fusion containing P. aeruginosa strain was conducted, but failed to clearly identify any disrupted genes associated with PA3720-PA3719 overexpression.  Using the same PA3720-PA3719 promoter-lacZ fusion, expression of these genes was assessed as a function of growth in both wildtype and nalC mutant P. aeruginosa strains.  Interestingly, PA3720-PA3719 expression was found to be growth-regulated, with an increased amount of expression occurring in late log/early stationary phase, even in the absence of nalC.  This suggests that another regulator(s) is/are involved in modulating PA3720-PA3719 levels in late log/early stationary phase.  Since PA3719 ultimately influences mexAB-oprM expression, its involvement in mediating growth-phase mexAB-oprM expression was assessed by examining mexA expression in both wildtype and PA3719 deletion P. aeruginosa strains.  PA3719 was found to be involved in some, but not all, of the growth phase control of mexAB-oprM.  These results suggest that mexAB-oprM growth-phase regulation is complex, as both MexR-dependent and MexR-independent regulatory pathways seem to exist.  Overall, this study has produced a better understanding of mexAB-oprM regulation in nalC mutant P. aeruginosa strains.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-25 19:01:33.87</description>
   <description>Background/Objective: Reperfusion injury is a serious consequence of blood flow reestablishment after myocardial infarction (MI) mediated by reactive oxygen species and neutrophilic cellular damage.  Following MI, the left ventricle (LV) undergoes remodeling characterized by progressive wall thinning and cavity dilatation.  Heme-Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) dependent decrease in oxidative stress may attenuate injury in part by inhibiting transcription factor NFκB-mediated inflammation.  Hypothesis: I hypothesized that upregulation of HO-1 by hemin administration confers acute and chronic cardioprotection against I/R injury in rats and attenuates LV remodeling post-MI.  I proposed the HO-1-dependent decrease in oxidative stress attenuates post-ischemic myocardial injury in part by inhibiting NFκB-mediated inflammation.  Methods:  Six week old male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to sham, vehicle, or hemin-treated groups.  Vehicle and hemin were administered intraperitoneally once daily for 3 consecutive days prior to left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion.  Administration resumed 48 hours post-operatively and continued once every 3 days.  Infarct size was determined by H&amp;E histological analysis and fibrosis was quantified by Masson’s Trichrome staining.  Transthoracic echocardiography was used to assess LV parameters and wall motion.  Results: Hemin increased HO-1 expression, decreased infarct size and fibrosis, and attenuated LV remodeling in the short-term (4 days post-infarction).  The decrease in infarct size and area of fibrosis in the hemin group was accompanied by a decrease in NFκB activity.  No significant difference in infarct size and area of fibrosis between hemin and vehicle-treated groups was observed at 3 months.  LV diameter and cardiac function did not differ significantly between the two groups at 3 months despite an attenuation of anterior wall thinning in the hemin group.  Conclusion: HO-1 upregulation by hemin administration conferred acute cardioprotection and attenuated LV remodeling, possibly by inhibiting NFκB-mediated inflammation.  However, chronic treatment with hemin did not prevent long-term post-infarction LV remodeling.  It is possible that cardioprotection afforded by HO-1 upregulation is strong enough to curtail inflammation post-reperfusion and prevent LV remodeling acutely, but is not robust enough to protect the myocardium to the same degree in the long-term.  Future research should focus on optimal HO-1 upregulation to attenuate long-term LV remodeling due to reperfusion injury.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this microethnography was to explore and describe the rural schooling experiences of one female adolescent who lives in a one industry, non-farming rural village and attends high school in a nearby small town. The pursuit of a post-secondary education usually results in the out-migration of local youth. This study describes and explores: (a) the ways in which the school environment and the interactions between the adolescent participant and her network educators shaped the meanings she ascribed to schooling; (b) the meanings of school curriculum for the adolescent participant; (c) the meanings of academic achievement for the adolescent participant; and (d) the role of the adolescent’s parents in her education at home and at school and the ways in which interactions between the adolescent and her parents shaped the meanings she ascribed to schooling. Data collection took place on site over 12 consecutive weeks and two re-visits which each lasted one week. The methods of data acquisition included participant observation, interviewing, document analyses, and photographs of local places. The adolescent participant’s mother and father and five educators at her high school also participated in this microethnography. Through addressing the specific rural issues and concerns of the rural context in which this microethnography took place this research reveals a deeper understanding of one adolescent’s rural schooling experiences. Implications for future rural schooling practices and research are discussed.</description>

   <description>Models of speech production postulate that, in order to facilitate rapid and precise control of articulation, the predicted auditory feedback is sent to the auditory system to be compared with incoming sensory data. If this is so, an 'error' signal may be observed when the predicted auditory feedback and the sensory consequences of vocalization do not match. I used event-related fMRI to look for the neural concomitants of such an error signal. In two conditions volunteers whispered 'ted'. In one of these, voice-gated noise implemented in our real-time processing system was used to mask the auditory feedback, which should result in an error signal. Two other conditions were yoked to the production conditions (either clearly heard or masked), but were listen-only and therefore no error signal would be expected. I acquired whole-brain EPI data from 21 subjects using a fast-sparse design. Activity in the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally was significantly greater for clear than masked speech during the listen-only trials (F(1,20)≥12.84, p&lt;0.002), and significantly higher for masked than for clear speech in the production trials (F(1,20)≥6.68, p&lt;0.02). This crossover interaction indicates that speech production results in corollary discharge in the auditory system and furthermore suggests that this corollary discharge reflects expectations about the sensory concomitants of speech acts.</description>

   <description>Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Canadian youth has increased considerably over the past few decades. In spite of considerable efforts, individual-level behavioural modification strategies have not been successful at preventing and treating obesity in youth. Research is emerging that has shifted attention to the environmental-level determinants of obesity. There is some evidence that the number and types of food retailers in a given neighbourhood may impact obesity risk in the individuals living in that neighbourhood, but little is known about the impact of the food retail environment on Canadian youth.&#xd;
Objectives: 1) To describe the food environment surrounding the school neighbourhoods of Canadian youth (grades 6 to 10), and, determine whether access to food retailers around schools differs by area-level SES.  2) To determine whether the number and type of food retailers surrounding schools is related to the overweight status of the students attending those schools.  Each of these objectives was explored in a separate manuscript.&#xd;
Methods: A trend test was performed to determine if exposure to food retailers varied by neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) for 188 schools across Canada. Logistic regression was performed using a multilevel modeling approach to determine if an association existed between exposure to food retailers and overweight and obesity in the 7,281 school-aged youth attending the 188 schools, adjusting for individual- and area-level covariates. Types of food retailers considered included: full-service restaurants, fast food restaurants, sub/sandwich shops, donut/coffee shops, convenience stores, and grocery stores.&#xd;
Results: Objective 1.  Nearly 75% of schools had at least one food retailer within 1 km of schools, and over 90% had at least one food retailer within 5 km. Exposure to the different types of food retailers within 1 km of schools did not vary significantly (p&lt;0.05) across schools in low, moderate, and high SES neighbourhoods, with the exception of full-service restaurants. At the 5 km distance, the SES gradient was significant across all food retailer types, with low SES neighbourhoods exposed to the least number of food retailers. This effect disappeared when population density (number of retailers per 10,000 people) was considered, except for sub/sandwich shops and donut/coffee shops. &#xd;
Objective 2.  Increased exposure to all six types of food retailers in the neighbourhoods surrounding schools was associated with a decreased likelihood of overweight and obesity. At the 1 km distance, the total number of food retailers had the strongest protective effect, while individual types of food retailers had a stronger effect at the 5 km distance.&#xd;
Conclusions: Objective 1.  Most students in Canada have at least one food retailer within walking distance of their school.  The food retail environment surrounding schools is not significantly impacted by the neighbourhood SES.  Objective 2. Increased exposure to different types of food retailers in school neighbourhoods is associated with a decreased likelihood of overweight and obesity in Canadian youth.  This suggests that having access to a large number and variety of food choices may facilitate healthy food choices and protect against the development of overweight and obesity.</description>

   <description>This thesis addresses the potential for third parties to apply or make use of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law to protect civilians caught in the midst of civil war. A case study is presented of El Salvador, where conflict in the 1970s and 1980s took the lives of an estimated 75,000 people and caused immense human suffering. Of particular interest is how organizations under the aegis of the Salvadoran Catholic Church provided data on human rights violations, gathered with credible precision, to the international community. The Canadian public responded to the situation in El Salvador in a markedly different way than the Canadian government, whose pronouncements were at first ill-informed and uncritically pro-American. The question thus arises: do counter-consensus or public-pressure groups exert any influence over a state’s foreign policy and, if so, does this phenomenon contribute to conflict resolution? While there is disagreement over the actual success that public groups and interested parties have over government decision-making, this thesis demonstrates that, in fact, the counter-consensus in Canada did have a discernable impact on foreign policy during the Salvadoran conflict. These actions have potential contributions to make to conflict resolution and the search for a negotiated end to civil strife, which in the case of El Salvador was generated in the first place not by an alleged international communist conspiracy but by crippling geographies of inequality.</description>

   <description>The mechanisms of plant response to nutrient limitation and utilisation are of great interest for agricultural purposes.  Phosphate is a non-renewable resource and is one of the most important nutrients required for plant growth.  Recently a new family of plant protein kinases, composed of 10 members, were discovered because of their involvement in stresses and their responses to the hormone abscisic acid (ABA).  In Arabidopsis, all of these SnRK2 protein kinases have been shown to be activated by drought or hyperosmostic stress, with the exception of SnRK2.9.  Five members are also activated by ABA treatment.  Recently SnRK2.8 was linked to metabolic processes by being down regulated in low nutrient level conditions.   In the present study, SnRK2.9 was investigated and shown to play a role in metabolic pathways, but in an opposite manner.  Contrarily to SnRK2.8, transcripts level of SnRK2.9 is induced in response to phosphate, nitrogen, and sulphur deprivation.  Interestingly, opposite to most phosphate-starvation inducible genes, sucrose decreases SnRK2.9's transcripts level.  Transgenic plants that overexpress SnRK2.9 do not appear to be affected in terms of growth.  On the other hand, overexpressing antisense SnRK2.9 or mutated snrk2.9 at residue Asp-123 by conversion to Glu (D123E), showed reduced plant growth.  This phenotype was more pronounced in the absence of phosphate.  A T-DNA knockout line for SnRK2.9 showed a 45% decrease in root and shoot biomass compared to wild-type Arabidopsis when grown under phosphate deprivation.  Similar trends were observed when the Arabidopsis gene was introduced in Medicago sativa (alfalfa) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter.  Overexpressing D123E Atsnrk2.9 had a serious inhibitory effect on growth and the plants were no longer responsive to changes in phosphate levels.  In Arabidopsis, the D123E snrk2.9 overexpressors had a 66% reduction in total seed yield when grown under +Pi conditions and a 33% reduction under -Pi conditions.  These Arabidopsis transgenic lines do not share similar traits to the known phosphate metabolic mutants Pho1, Pho2, and Siz1.  SnRK2.9 appears to play a key role in biomass and seed production.</description>

   <description>This thesis challenges the view that the Republic of Mali is a model of democratization in Africa with the aim of opening the conceptual framework of democratic citizenship inherent in the democratization discourse to greater critical scrutiny.  The ‘enthusiastic’ view is held and set forth by various segments of the unity-seeking ruling class (local and foreign, State and NGO) of bringing to Mali a Western-oriented, procedurally minimal democracy, and citizen identity commensurate with international financial institutions’ and donor countries’ vision of democratization as political and economic liberalization.  Consequently, this hegemonic project co-opts selected indigenous and Islamic idioms of political and social identity, to reinvent democratization as ‘moral governance.’  Cosmopolitan upper and upper-middle class actors thus apologize for highly personalized politics at the national and local levels, and articulate these more broadly with idioms of recovering rectitude and social cohesion that preserve and reproduce hierarchical social norms.&#xd;
	In Malian political culture and in the scholarship of Malian political change, the hegemonic project of citizen identity formation becomes more evident as a construction, as discourses, norms, and practices produced and reproduced by privileged actors.  Moreover, the contested character of these constructions becomes evident only as we address the development and deployment of selectively synthesized indigenous, Islamic, and Western-democratic norms, practices, and institutions of citizenship in contemporary Mali.  Without a more embedded sense of political membership and identity, the merely procedural democratic project remains vulnerable to challenges from multiple, alternative sites of moral, social, and political authority.</description>

   <description>The E2A locus is involved in chromosomal translocations associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The most common of these involves a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 19 (t1;19), resulting in expression of the chimeric oncoprotein E2A-PBX1. A direct interaction between transcriptional activation domain 1 (AD1) of E2A and KIX domain of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) /co-activator CBP is required for E2A-PBX1-mediated leukemia induction in mice.  This thesis examines the functional consequences of the direct, physical interaction between E2A and CBP, for both proteins.&#xd;
&#xd;
We demonstrate that the interaction between E2A and CBP/p300, as well as another HAT/co-activator, p/CAF, results in acetylation of E2A. Mutagenesis-based mapping studies identify several lysine residues as substrates for acetylation. Of particular interest, a conserved lysine (K34) located within AD1 is acetylated in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of this residue to arginine impairs transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter while substitution to glutamine, mimicking the acetylation, restores E2A-mediated transcriptional activation.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Recent studies have shown that several transcription factors can modulate the intrinsic HAT activity of CBP/p300. We were surprised to find that E2A proteins enhance acetylation of histones by CBP, in vitro and in vivo, in a KIX domain-independent manner. Acetylation of E2A is also not required for stimulation of CBP/p300 histone acetylation. It appears that E2A interacts with the other CBP domains to mediate this effect, presumably through allosteric effects. &#xd;
&#xd;
In summary, we demonstrate that acetylation of E2A plays a role in mediating the transcriptional activation activity of E2A. Furthermore, acetylation of E2A enhances its interaction with CBP/p300, at least in the presence of additional nuclear factors. We show evidence that p/CAF may mediate this effect. Enhancement of CBP/p300 HAT activity by oncogenic E2A-PBX1 proteins in vivo, suggests that some of its leukemia-promoting effects may be due to E2A-induced gain of function effects on CBP/p300.  The enhanced interaction between acetylated E2A and CBP/p300, as well as the E2A-mediated stimulation of histone acetyltransferase activity might play a role in the DNA-binding-independent induction of proliferation.</description>

   <description>We present the Attentive Hearing Aid, a system that uses eye input to amplify the audio of tagged sound sources in the environment.  A multidisciplinary project, we use the latest technology to take advantage of the social phenomenon of turn-taking in human-human communication, and apply this in a new kind of assistive hearing device.  Using hearing-impaired participants, we evaluated the use of eye input for switching between sound sources on a screen in terms of switch time and the recall of audiovisual material.  We compared eye input to a control condition and two manual selection techniques: using a remote to point at the target on the screen, and using buttons to select the target.  Results show that in terms of switch time, Eyes were 73% faster than Pointing and 58% faster than Buttons.  In terms of recall, Eyes performed 80% better than Control, 54% better than Buttons, and 37% better than Pointing.  In a post-evaluation user experience survey, participants rated Eyes highest in “easiest”, “most natural”, and “best overall” categories.  We present the implications of this work as a new type of assistive hearing device, and also discuss how this system could benefit non-hearing-impaired individuals.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, novel direct-digital Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulators are proposed in low-cost Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology for radio frequency (RF) wireless applications.  Direct-digital architectures have attracted much attention recently as they potentially offer significant cost savings and performance benefits.  A new direct-digital QPSK modulator concept is introduced where the carrier is modulated directly by digital data using Pass-Transistor Logic (PTL) circuits for a small size and low power consumption.  The concept is demonstrated through the design of an L-band modulator followed by an enhanced tunable S-band version.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed L-band modulator first generates all four quadrature phases of the carrier by using a 90° resistor-capacitor, capacitor-resistor (RC-CR) phase shifter followed by two 180° active baluns.  One signal from the in-phase components and another from the quadrature-phase components are later selected by two PTL circuits according to the in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) digital data respectively.  Finally the chosen signals are subtracted by a differential amplifier.  The circuit has been experimentally demonstrated in a standard 0.18μm CMOS process, showing good performance at 1.7GHz with the data transmission rate and carrier rejection exceeding 20Mbps and 40dB respectively.  The integrated circuit (IC) measures only 425μm by 850μm and consumes less than 43mW of power.&#xd;
&#xd;
A new S-band direct-digital QPSK modulator is introduced that offers even better performance and requires fewer components.  An active balun first splits the carrier into a pair of balanced signals, which are then fed to a 90° RC polyphase network generating all four differential quadrature signals.  Voltage-controlled NMOS resistors are used in the RC polyphase network to fine-tune it after fabrication for the lowest possible phase error.  Finally, only one of the four differential quadrature signals is selected by a PTL circuit consisting of six NMOS switches, according to both I and Q digital data values.  The circuit has been experimentally demonstrated in a standard 0.18μm CMOS process showing very good performance at 2.4GHz, with the data transmission rate exceeding 56Mbps. The IC measures 720μm by 888μm with an active area of only 505μm by 610μm, and consumes less than 33mW of power.</description>

   <description>Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) followed by proteomic analysis was employed to examine the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) interactome of developing castor oil seed (COS) endosperm. Earlier studies suggested that immunologically unrelated 107-kDa plant-type and 118-kDa bacterial-type PEPCs (p107/PTPC and p118/BTPC, respectively) are subunits of an unusual ~910-kDa hetero-octameric Class-2 PEPC complex of developing COS. The current results confirm that a tight physical interaction occurs between p118 and p107 since p118 quantitatively co-IP’d with p107 following elution of COS extracts through an anti-p107-IgG immunoaffinity column. No PEPC activity or immunoreactive PTPC or BTPC polypeptides were detected in the corresponding flow-through fractions. Although BTPCs lack the N-terminal phosphorylation site characteristic of PTPCs, Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein staining, immunoblotting with phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate IgG, and phosphate-affinity PAGE demonstrated that the co-IP’d p118 was significantly phosphorylated at unique Ser and/or Thr residue(s). The co-IP of p118 and p107 was not influenced by their phosphorylation status. As p118 phosphorylation appeared unchanged 48 h following elimination of photosynthate supply due to COS depodding, the signaling mechanisms responsible for photosynthate-dependent p107 phosphorylation differ from those controlling p118’s in vivo phosphorylation. A third PEPC polypeptide of ~110-kDa (p110; RcPPC1) co-IP’d with p118 and p107 when depodded COS was used. Analysis of RcPpc1’s full-length cDNA sequence revealed p110’s identity with PTPCs, but that a pair of unique amino-acid substitutions occurs in its N-terminal sequence that may render p110 non-phosphorylatable in vivo. The plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDCpl) was identified as a novel PEPC interactor. Subcellular fractionation indicated that p118 and p107 are strictly cytosolic, but that PDCpl is targeted to both the cytosol and leucoplast of developing COS. Thus, a putative cytosolic metabolon involving PEPC and PDCpl could function to channel carbon from phosphoenolpyruvate to acetyl-CoA and/or to recycle CO2 from PDCpl to PEPC.</description>

   <description>Les mariages exogames, la mobilité de la population, la mondialisation, le bilinguisme social et l’éducation bilingue favorisent le développement du multilinguisme en Occident. La majorité de la recherche sur ce phénomène se réalise dans le cadre du bilinguisme et celui de l’acquisition d’une langue seconde. Pour les fins de cette étude, une personne qui a une connaissance de deux langues – même imparfaite – sera considérée comme étant bilingue. Une personne multilingue a une connaissance de trois langues ou plus. La recherche sur le multilinguisme n’en est qu’à ses débuts, mais elle est notamment parvenue à identifier des caractéristiques distinctes que partagent les personnes multilingues. Certains conçoivent le multilinguisme comme étant une extension du bilinguisme et considèrent que, quoique plus complexes, ses opérations lexicales restent les mêmes. D’autres estiment que la quantité de langues est un facteur qui suffit à créer une façon d’être distincte – un point de départ différent – pour une personne multilingue.&#xd;
L’une des questions importantes que l’on se pose dans le domaine du lexique multilingue est jusqu’à quel point le traitement lexical des langues d’un individu se fait de façon séparée ou conjointe.&#xd;
Cette étude se veut une contribution aux travaux de Peter Ecke, qui a étudié de façon extensive la nature des interactions translinguistiques chez les personnes bilingues et multilingues en utilisant les tests du dans un état « bout de la langue » (BDLL). Notre étude analyse le fonctionnement du vocabulaire de la L3 chez des adolescents ayant le profil suivant : L1 anglais, L2 français à un niveau débutant-intermédiare et L3 à un niveau débutant, acquis dans un contexte scolaire. En utilisant un outil d’élicitation de type BDLLL, nous tenterons d’identifier les caractéristiques des associations de mots alors que le sujet avait un mot sur le bout de la langue ou qu’il faisait une erreur lexicale, tout en étudiant la relation entre les lexiques de la  L1, de la L2 et de la L3. Nos résultats indiquent que dans la recherche et l’identification de mots de la L3, lors d’instants où le sujet cherche ses mots ou fait une erreur lexicale, l’identification de l’aspect sémantique fonctionne, alors que l’identification de l’aspect formel échoue. Pour ce qui est des influences translinguistiques, la plupart des sujets cherchaient d’abord dans la L3 et passaient ensuite à une recherche dans la L2. L’influence de L1 s’est avérée faible. Nous attribuons la cause de l’influence translinguistique à la psychotypologie, la compétence, et la récence.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the western world, multilingualism is a growing phenomenon as a result of exogamous marriages, population mobility, globalization, social bilingualism and bilingual education. Most of the research in the field of multilingualism is carried out within the framework of research into bilingualism and second language acquisition. For the purposes of our study a bilingual speaker has knowledge, however imperfect, of two languages. A multilingual speaker has knowledge of three or more languages. Research into multilingualism is still in its early stages but has come far enough for researchers to identify distinct characteristics of the multilingual speaker. Some conclude that multilingualism is an extension of bilingualism, in that lexical operations are the same but more complex. Others believe that the quantity of languages alone creates a distinct state of being - a different starting place - for the multilingual speaker. &#xd;
One key question in the field of the multilingual lexicon to what degree is the lexical processing of the individual’s languages is separate or integrated. &#xd;
This study is a contribution to the research of Peter Ecke who has extensively studied the nature of cross-linguistic interaction in bilingual and multilingual speakers using tip of the tongue (TOT) tests. Our study analysed the processing of L3 vocabulary in adolescents with the following profile: L1 English, L2 French at a low-intermediate level and L3 Spanish at the beginner level in a school setting. Using a TOT elicitation tool, we sought to identify specific characteristics of word associates in TOT states and in lexical errors, as well as the relationship between the L1, L2 and L3 lexicons. Our results indicate that in the search and retrieval of L3 words in TOT states and in lexical errors, the retrieval of the semantic aspect succeeds while the retrieval of the form aspect fails. With regard to the source of cross-linguistic influence, most subjects searched initially within the L3 and failing that, proceeded to a search within the L2. L1 influence was weak. We attribute the cause of cross-linguistic influence to psychotypology, proficiency and recency.</description>

   <title>Tax Policy Challenges Facing Developing Countries: A Case Study of Uganda</title>

   <description>Developed countries have had commendable success in improving their taxation policy systems over the years. However, developing countries face numerous tax policy challenges when they attempt to establish efficient tax systems.  Ugandaâs tax structure has been greatly improved in recent years, and it appears to mirror the tax system in other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, in terms of the types of taxes and rates. Nevertheless, growth in domestic revenue mobilization after various reforms has not significantly improved as demonstrated by the increase in overall budget deficits. The persistence of budget deficits makes it clear that Ugandaâs tax policies urgently need to be reviewed to increase tax revenues. This thesis reviews the pros and cons of changes made to the tax system and assesses the extent to which they can solve the deficit dilemma. In particular, this thesis demonstrates that Ugandaâs approach to tax policy does not take into consideration prevailing domestic social phenomena like the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the ongoing civil war in Northern Uganda, the expanding informal sector, and barriers to effective tax administration, all of which are rapidly eroding the tax base. Policy solutions that address these systemic problems are suggested.</description>

   <description>In South Africa one of the strongest influences on domestic indoor air quality is the type of energy used for heating, cooking and other household purposes.  Emissions from fuel combustion, along with housing factors, can result in respiratory infections, a leading cause of death in the country.  In this study I examine the relationships between energy types, patterns of use, housing conditions such as improper ventilation and overcrowding, indoor air quality and respiratory health in poorer communities of Msunduzi Municipality, South Africa.  These variables were examined using an ecohealth perspective through the integration of data concerning individual time-activity budgets, housing materials and structure, energy sources used for heating, cooking and lighting, respiratory symptoms and continuous real time monitoring of indoor air pollutants (particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)).  A total of 20 dwellings, displaying large variability in housing structure and energy patterns, were sampled for 24 hours (hr) over a period of 60 days.  The mean 24-hr average indoor concentrations measured were as follows:  PM2.5= 16 ± 11 µg/m3, PM10= 78 ± 46 µg/m3, CO= 5 ± 6 ppm and SO2= 0.18 ± 0.27 ppm.  Mean indoor concentrations measured were significantly greater than mean outdoor concentrations (p&lt;0.0001 (PM2.5), p=0.017 (PM10), p&lt;0.0001 (CO), p&lt;0.0001 (SO2)). Although PM concentrations increased with the use of increasingly inefficient-burning fuel types (gas &lt; paraffin &lt; wood), no significant differences in the means were found across these fuel types.  It is thought that the high degree of variability among dwellings and the small sample size in this study obscured any statistically significant relationships.  No significant differences in mean concentrations were found across different housing types either.  Indoor exposures were, on average, highest among very young children (ages 0-5) and elders (ages 51+).  All age groups reported experiencing high levels of respiratory symptoms, with the elder group (ages 51+) reporting the highest percentages for each symptom.  This study will be used to inform local governments and NGOs of local indoor air pollution and exposure risks, so that policy and resources can be allocated accordingly to improve physical environments.</description>

   <description>The Semantic Web is the future of the Internet. It is the extension to the Internet in which information will be given well-defined meaning, enabling not only humans but also machines to find, share and combine information more easily. In the Semantic Web documents are not merely pages containing a set of words that form their content. They also encode the meaning and structure of those words. This enables various information retrieval techniques to be performed on the documents in addition to the ones restricted to keywords. The goal of this research is to explore a method for querying the Semantic Web using relational database theory and source transformation techniques. We take as input, documents annotated with XML mark-up and the information tags that we are interested in. We then extract and populate a relational view on the annotated XML documents using these tags and the implicit relations in the XML documents. We evaluate the feasibility of our system by testing on a variety of input and we also explore the kinds of queries that can be made on the extracted relational view.</description>

   <title>Analysis of N-linked glycosylation of flagellin proteins in the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-27 11:14:57.497</description>
   <description>N-linked glycosylation is a posttranslational modification involving the attachment of a carbohydrate to an asparagine (Asn) residue located within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus sequence. This process is well understood in Eucarya and, more recently, in Bacteria. However, information about the equivalent process in Archaea is limited. This lack of knowledge includes data on glycan structures, assembly, and attachment. Assembly is believed to involve the sequential addition of monosaccharides to a membrane-embedded lipid carrier using a series of glycosyltransferases. Once the glycan is completed, it is transported across the membrane via a flippase and transferred to the protein using an oligosaccharyltransferase (Stt3p homolog). Working with the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis, a novel glycan N-linked to the flagellin proteins of this organism was identified. Mass spectrometry has identified the glycan to have a mass of 1036.4 Da and secondary fragmentation pattern analysis of the intact glycan indicates that in addition to an N-acetylglucosamine residue (203 Da) and a di-N-acetylhexosamine (258 Da), there is an additional terminal mass of 575 Da suggesting that the glycan may be a tetrasaccharide. Genes suspected to be involved in flagellin glycosylation were targeted for in-frame deletion. The deletion of a number of these genes resulted in mutants that had a downward shift in flagellin molecular mass as evidenced by immunoblotting with anti-flagellin antisera. The annotation of these genes indicates that they are involved in the assembly of the glycan and its subsequent transfer to the target protein. Mutants that carried a deletion of an oligosaccharyltransferase (MMP1424) had flagellins that appeared completely unmodified by immunoblotting. Furthermore, mutants that had deletions in one of two glycosyltransferase genes (MMP1080, MMP1079) produced flagellins of intermediate molecular mass. Subsequent complementation of these glycosyltransferase mutations partially or fully restored flagellins to wild-type mass. Examination by electron microscopy showed that two mutants (ΔMMP1424, ΔMMP1079) were unable to assemble flagellar filaments while one glycosyltransferase mutant (ΔMMP1080) still produced flagellar filaments. Collectively, these data begin to reveal the pathway and requirement of N-linked glycosylation in archaea using M. maripaludis as a model.</description>

   <description>Proteins modularity enhances the multi-functionality and versatility of proteins by providing such properties as multiple and various ligand-binding sites, increased ligand affinity through the avidity effect, and the juxtaposition of ligand-binding modules near catalytic domains. An NMR-based "dissect-and-build" approach to studying modular protein structure and function has proven very successful, whereby modules are initially characterized individually and then correlated with the overall function of a protein. We have used the dissect-and-build approach and NMR to study two modular protein systems.&#xd;
Chapter 2 details the NMR solution structure of the weak-lysine-binding kringle IV type 8 (KIV8) module from the apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) component of lipoprotein(a) was determined and its ligand-binding properties assessed.  In vitro studies have demonstrated the importance of the apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 modules in mediating specific lysine-dependent interactions with the apolipoproteinB-100 (apoB-100) component of LDL in the initial non-covalent step of lipoprotein assembly.  Notable differences identified in the lysine binding site (LBS) of the KIV8 were deemed responsible for the differential modes of apoB-100 recognition by KIV7 and KIV8.  In addition, the KIV8 structure has brought to light the importance of an RGD sequence at the N-terminus of the apo(a) KIV8 module, which may mediate important apo(a)-integrin interactions.&#xd;
In Chapters 3-6, structure-function studies of the CpGH84C X82 and the CpGH84A dockerin-containing modular pair were conducted to understand how the varying modularity unique to the C-terminal regions of the secreted multi-modular family 84 glycoside hydrolases influences the spreading of Clostridium perfringens. Identification of a CpGH84C cohesin module (X82), and the structural characterization of a dockerin-containing modular pair provides the first evidence for multi-enzyme complex formation mediated by non-cellulosomal cohesin-dockerin interactions.  The formation of large hydrolytic enzyme complexes introduces a novel mechanism by which C. perfringens may enhance its role in pathogenesis.</description>

   <title>Probing Immune Function During Aging in Adult Drosophila</title>

   <description>Virtually all multicellular organisms rely on a highly conserved innate immune system for defense against foreign microorganisms.  Innate immunity consists primarily of a humeral response that culminates in the expression of antimicrobial peptides.  In contrast to adaptive immunity seen in high order organisms, the innate immune response is not specific to the invader.  &#xd;
In aging organisms, some of the most dramatic transcriptional changes take place within the innate immune system.  In aging mammals, innate immune reorganization coincides with declining immune function, which often manifests itself as chronic inflammation.  Similar to this state of chronic inflammation in mammals, Drosophila exhibit a marked upregulation of many innate immunity related genes.  However, it remains unclear if this upregulation results in a similar decrease in immune function to that seen in mammals.  If Drosophila is to be considered as a model organism in which to study the relationship between immunity and aging, it must first be determined whether it too undergoes declining immune function with age.&#xd;
By examining the response to quantifiable injections of bacteria, we were able to deduce that adult Drosophila do indeed undergo immune senescence.  Elderly wildtype flies infected with various doses of bacteria showed a decreased ability to survive infection.  Moreover, because the ability to clear the infection remains intact despite decreased survival following infection, it is believed that a bacterially produced factor is responsible for immune senescence in adult Drosophila.</description>

   <title>A novel TAFIa assay and its use to measure TAFI activation in vivo in primate models and the determination of the kinetics of TAFIa-catalyzed release of bound plasminogen from soluble fibrin degradation products</title>

   <subject>TAFIa assay</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Biochemistry) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-27 13:08:29.462</description>
   <description>Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), also called procarboxypeptidase U (proCPU), is a plasma zymogen that can be activated by thrombin, the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, or plasmin.  The activated form of TAFI (TAFIa, CPU) removes C-terminal lysine residues of plasmin-modified fibrin (FN’) that mediate positive feedback in plasminogen (Pg) activation, thereby attenuating fibrinolysis.  The plasma concentration of TAFI is ~75nM.  Since the half-maximal effect of TAFIa occurs at 1nM, only about 1.3% of TAFI needs to be activated to exert an effect on clot lysis.&#xd;
The first objective of this work was to design a novel assay that can measure functional TAFIa levels in plasma.  We have successfully developed a reliable TAFIa assay that is sensitive to TAFIa concentrations as low as 12pM.  This assay is not confounded by endogenous levels of Pg or by a naturally occurring polymorphism at position 325 that affects the half-life of TAFIa.&#xd;
The second objective was to measure TAFI activation in vivo in primates in response to thrombin generation, E. coli-induced sepsis, or post-surgical stress.  It was found that chimpanzees generated substantial amounts of TAFIa in a transient manner which had a half-life of ~8 to 10 minutes in response to thrombin generation.  Baboons generated very high levels of TAFIa transiently in response to sublethal or lethal doses of E. coli.  Interestingly, baboons generated less TAFIa when infused with thrombin followed by the blocking of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) than when the baboons were infused with only thrombin.  Human patients that underwent hip replacement surgery showed sustained, elevated levels of TAFIa for up to 42 days after surgery. &#xd;
The third objective was to determine the kinetics of TAFIa-catalyzed release of bound plasminogen from soluble fibrin degradation products.  The kinetics conformed to the Michaelis-Menten equation, which allowed the determination of Km, kcat and Vmax values for varying concentrations of TAFIa.  In addition, the enzymatic activity of TAFIa appeared to saturate, probably because at a high concentration of TAFIa, the kinetics of plasminogen release were rate limiting.</description>

   <description>In order to effectively and efficiently hydroform new automotive components, the formability of new tubular steels must be evaluated. Standard forming limit diagrams have been used for decades to evaluate and predict the formability of sheet steel formed along linear strain paths. However, tube hydroforming can present a problem since the pre-bending stage used in many hydroforming operations causes multiple non-linear strain paths. &#xd;
	This thesis has modified a formability test method that deforms small-scale sheet steel samples in a single plane. The sample geometries were designed such that the strain paths achieved at the center of the samples were very near the plane strain condition. The four steels chosen for this study were: a deep drawing quality (DDQ), a high strength low alloy (HSLA) and two dual phase steels (DP600 and DP780). The plane strain formability for each of the four steels was tested in both the rolling and transverse directions. &#xd;
	Three objective criteria were employed to evaluate and directly compare the formability of the four steels tested: difference in strain, difference in strain rate and local necking. The DDQ steel showed the highest formability followed in order by the HSLA, DP600 and DP780 steels. The repeatability in determining the forming limit strains using the difference in strain, the difference in strain rate and the local necking criteria for a 95% confidence interval was ± 1.5%, ± 1.2% and ± 3.2% engineering strain, respectively. &#xd;
	The forming limit data collected for this thesis has been compared to results from full-scale tube hydroforming operations and free expansion tube burst tests carried out by researchers at the University of Waterloo on the same four materials. It was found that local necking results could be used to predict failure of hydroformed HSLA steel tubes with low levels of end-feed. However, this same method could only predict the failure of hydroformed DP600 steel tubes at higher levels of end-feed. The three objective criteria were not found to be suitable for predicting failure of free expansion tube burst tests.</description>

   <description>The texts and records of the household performances of early modern women collected and examined in this thesis, which together have not yet been the subject of any extended scholarly work, reveal that women performed in the household far more often and in many more ways than is yet acknowledged in scholarship.  These texts and records also show that the household could be an amenable performance space for early modern women, both amateur and professional, aristocratic and not.  This reconceptualization of the place of women’s performances in the household, I argue, necessitates an adjustment of received ideas of the ethical and moral status of those performances as well as a reevaluation of the household itself.  I reassess the equation between theatrical performance and immorality and interrogate the “inheren[t] subversive[ness]” that one critic argues is found in all women’s household plays.  While I maintain that women’s household performances could have multiple significations, this thesis focuses on performances that permitted women to shape their own reputations positively in household space, where women were agents influencing domestic life through their theatre.  Chapter 1, the Introduction, outlines the critical field, positions women within the performance tradition of the household, and discusses the status of their performances, centering on the relationship between theatrical performance, agency, and feminine virtue.  Chapter 2 focuses on royal progress entertainment, discussing the performances of domestic virtue of Queen Elizabeth’s female hosts which not only had the capacity to be received as virtuous, but worked to promote familial and class legitimacy.  Chapter 3 talks about the banquets created and served by women, identifying those banquets as a form of theatre, and linking women’s creativity with their embodiment of domestic ideals through the performance of hospitality.  Chapter 4 discusses touring women performers as accepted, acknowledged, and skillful theatre professionals who were licenced by the state to perform and who were permitted to perform in households and towns across England.</description>

   <description>ABSTRACT&#xd;
&#xd;
	Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is considered the primary service-delivery vehicle for integrating individuals with severe mental illness into the community.  Research on the model suggests that it has been helpful in aiding service users to achieve basic levels of integration including stabilized housing and maintaining financial and social security (Bond, Drake, Mueser &amp; Latimer, 2001; Mueser, Bond, &amp; Drake, 2001).  However, critics of the model emphasize its limited success in enabling higher-order aspects of integration such as mainstream employment, recreation and socialization (Estroff, 1981; Gomory, 1998, 2001, 2002a, 2002b).  These are fundamental criticisms given the significant investment in the model by policy makers.  The rationale for the failure to promote higher-order integration typically rests on two central assumptions:  a) service users are incapable of realizing full integration; and b) practitioners lack the training, skills, and philosophical base required to foster full integration.  By focusing on the personal and professional characteristics of practitioners and service users, these views serve to obscure organizing structures operating at organizational, systemic, and social levels that encourage common ways of thinking about and carrying out community integration practice.&#xd;
	The concern of this thesis is to explicate the impact of these organizing structures on the everyday practices engaged in by individual practitioners.  In particular this thesis focuses on how practice becomes shaped by external structures that overrule both personal and professional values and intentions.  The current study used the method of institutional ethnography to examine the impact of organizing structures of ACT in shaping how community integration practice is conceptualized, carried out, and accounted for on an everyday basis.  The study findings are threefold.  First, they suggest that organizing structures foster goals associated with protection as opposed to empowerment.  Second, they reveal that organizing structures advance an individual-level focus over a social-level focus, prohibiting the community capacity building and environmental change necessary for fostering social autonomy and empowerment.  Third, they show that organizing structures encourage practices discordant with integration, resulting in contradictory and therefore inconsistent attempts to facilitate higher-order aspects of integration.  The power of these organizing structures is such that the personal and professional intentions of providers to facilitate broad community integration are consistently overruled within the context of everyday practice.  The results of this study highlight the powerful role played by organizing structures in shaping community integration practice and provide an important theoretical model for planning, implementing, and evaluating models of service delivery for individuals with severe mental illness.</description>

   <title>Properties and foaming behaviour of thermoplastic olefin blends based on linear and branched polypropylene</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-27 16:07:44.202</description>
   <description>The recent commercial availability of branched polypropylenes (PPs) combined with the advent of single-site metallocene catalysts has ignited interest in thermoplastic polyolefin blends (TPOs) with controlled melt strength.  These blends have potential applications in a variety of industries including foam processing and extrusion foaming.&#xd;
&#xd;
     The main objective of the thesis is to provide a detailed investigation on the rheological, morphological, thermal, mechanical and foaming properties of isotactic polypropylene / high melt strength branched polypropylene homopolymer blends, and of thermoplastic olefin blends using these polypropylenes as matrices.&#xd;
&#xd;
     Initial research on the polypropylene blends consisted of a linear high melt flow rate PP and two branched PPs with different melt flow rates.  Blends containing branched PPs display evidence of miscibility in the melt state and exhibit high melt elasticity together with significant strain hardening in extensional deformation while retaining good flow properties. Of the two blend systems examined, the blends containing linear and branched PPs with similar melt flow rates have better mechanical properties, higher crystallization temperatures, and higher crystallinities.&#xd;
&#xd;
     An investigation into the mechanical, thermal, rheological, morphological, and microcellular foaming behaviour of TPO blends consisting of a blended matrix of linear and branched PP with a dispersed phase of an ethylene-octene copolymer was performed.  Blends containing branched PP showed improved stiffness and flexural properties.  Given that the morphology and interfacial tension of the blends remain virtually unaffected, these improvements are attributed to the increased crystallinity in the presence of a branched component with higher molecular weight. Varying the amount of branched PP into linear PP during foaming experiments in a batch foaming simulation apparatus caused slower cell growth rates and decreased cell densities, while TPO foams showed polydispersity in the cell sizes, possibly due to the different foaming characteristics of the immiscible components.  &#xd;
&#xd;
     The addition of talc to TPO blends aims at improving the stiffness and dimensional stability of the material, while lowering material costs.  Blends of linear and branched PP with an ethylene-octene copolymer dispersed phase and uncalcinated talc showed similar trends, as well as an expected drop in the elongation at break.  There was an increase in the viscosity and crystallinity of the blends, and optimum gains were seen in blends containing 20 wt% branched PP.  Increasing the levels of branched PP did not significantly affect the bubble growth rate, or the final cell density during foaming experiments.</description>

   <description>The present study examined developmental changes in the prevalence, stability, and developmental pathways associated with Bully/Victim status in order to increase our understanding of this high-risk group. In addition, this study investigated changes within individuals and their social context that are associated with moving into, or out of, the Bully/Victim group. This study was guided by the theory of developmental contextualism, which suggests that bullying involvement is likely to change over the course of development and that these changes are likely related to changes within individuals and their social contexts. One thousand six hundred seventy-seven elementary school students and 1402 high school students participated in this longitudinal study. Data were collected three times from each sample. Developmental changes in Bully/Victim status were assessed through a series of log-linear analyses and changes in individual and their peer relationships associated with transitions in bullying status were assessed through a series of multinomial logistic regression analyses. The results supported developmental contextual theory. Bully/Victim status became less prevalent over the course of development and was particularly unstable over three points of time in both elementary and high school. Individuals who became part of the Bully/Victim group were likely to have a history of involvement in bullying, and those who recovered from the Bully/Victim group usually maintained some sort of bullying involvement. When youth transitioned between types of bullying, they became more similar to the bullying status group that they entered in terms of individual characteristics. In addition, changes in bullying status were associated with changing peer groups.</description>

   <description>This study was conducted to investigate the processes underlying the relation between executive functioning and false belief knowledge. We explored the hypothesis that children with advanced executive functioning skills are better equipped to capitalize on the experiences that are necessary to learn how to reason about others’ mental states. To examine this possibility, we recruited 3.5-year-old children with age-appropriate variability in executive functioning skills to participate in a training study designed to promote their performance on false belief tasks. We found that individual differences in executive functioning task scores strongly and consistently predicted the extent to which children benefited from false-belief training. Importantly, the relation between executive functioning and false belief improvement remained significant after controlling for age, initial performance on mental state reasoning tasks, language skills, and executive functioning improvement across the testing period. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that executive functioning skills influence the extent to which children are able to capitalize on relevant experience to better predict and understand others’ false-belief-based behaviour. This claim is discussed with respect to possible alternative explanations for our findings, and ensuing implications for understanding the interplay between neuromaturational factors and experience.</description>

   <title>Rethinking Environmental Responsibility: Heidegger, Profound Boredom, and the Alterity of Nature</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-27 17:11:17.45</description>
   <description>Beginning with an overview of the appropriation of Heidegger’s thought to environmental philosophy, I proceed to identify two themes as holding a prominent place within the current literature: Heidegger’s conception of primordial nature or physis as well as the notion of “poetic dwelling”. Drawing on both of these themes, I argue that a prominent implication of Heidegger’s thought for environmental philosophy concerns the conservation of the natural world’s “natural otherness”—its differences from and indifference to humanity. However, within the current discussion concerning the conservation of nature’s otherness little is said concerning nature itself. The question arises as to whether or not non-human natural beings compel us to protect and conserve their differences. How does nature “call” us to protect its otherness?&#xd;
Following this, Chapter Two seeks to establish the relevance of Heidegger’s theory of moods for answering the question at hand. In particular, I illustrate the potential of moods by comparing the occurrence of an “equipmental breakdown” with the mood of “anxiety” (Angst). While the former experience exposes Dasein to nature’s “ownness”—its Being outside of the worldhood—its potential insight is easily re-subsumed into the world of work and projects. In contrast, the experience of anxiety avoids such a shortcoming while simultaneously disclosing Dasein as responsible for what it makes of its existence. These features, or so I argue, demonstrate the relevance of moods in answering the question of this project.&#xd;
Having established the relevance of moods I return, in Chapter Three, to the question posed at the outset of this thesis. Specifically, I investigate the nature of nature’s call by exploring the phenomenology of “profound boredom” as Heidegger presents it in The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World, Finitude, Solitude. Significantly, profound boredom discloses nature in a distinctly primordial manner, while simultaneously revealing Dasein to be responsible for its own there-being. In light of this disclosure, I argue that within the experience of profound boredom primordial nature can be interpreted as calling Dasein towards responsibility, not by demand or challenge, but through its ambiguous indifference towards Dasein and its choices.</description>

   <description>Juvenile hormones (JHs) are key regulators of both metamorphosis and adult reproductive processes.  The role of two key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of JH were examined: Farnesoic Acid O-Methyltransferase (FAMeT) and Juvenile Hormone Acid Methyltransferase (JHAMT). In crustaceans, FAMeT has been found to methylate farnesoic acid  (FA), producing methyl farnesoate (MF) prior to epoxidation at the penultimate stage of JH biosynthesis. JHAMT was discovered more recently in the silkworm Bombyx mori and converts epoxidated FA (JHacids) to active JH through methylation using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). The aim of the proposed research is to examine the influence of a) decreasing the amount of FAMeT produced using an enhancer trapping P-element and b) increasing the levels of JHAMT and FAMeT in specific tissues using GAL4 overexpression techniques. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to confirm the presence of FAMeT in the CA of D. melanogaster ring glands.  Analysis of MF, JHIII and JHB3 release in wild type and mutant stocks in the presence and absence of Drome AST (PISCF-type) suggest that Drosophila FAMeT has little if any effect on the sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. Drome-AST appears to have a select effect on JHB3 biosynthesis and not MF or JHIII. Analysis of JHB3 release from larval and adult flies ubiquitously overexpressing JHAMT showed a significant increase when compared to wildtype (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.0001 respectively).  No significant difference was seen in JHB3 release in flies ubiquitously overexpressing FAMeT. A significant increase in hatching success was seen in flies overexpressing &#xd;
&#xd;
FAMeT in the larval ring gland and oocytes (p&lt;0.05) whereas no significant decrease was seen in JHAMT-overexpressing flies during development. A significant extension of lifespan was also seen when FAMeT was overexpressed in the border and follicle cells of the oocyte (p&lt;0.0001).&#xd;
	The direct role of JHAMT in JHB3 synthesis has been demonstrated. The involvement of FAMeT and JHAMT in development and longevity may require other interacting proteins to elicit an effect, which is a limiting factor in overexpression experiments of the two enzymes.  Additionally, this is the first example of AST action within D. melanogaster.</description>

   <description>A pre-test, post-test, randomized control study (n=78) was conducted to test whether participation in Stay on Your Feet (SOYF), a falls prevention program for community-dwelling older adults, improved participants’ falls-related self-efficacy and balance.  The Activities Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale (Powell &amp; Myers, 1995) was used to measure falls-related self-efficacy and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991) was used to measure balance.  Participants in both the intervention and control groups scored at the higher end of the ABC Scale (range 0-100) at baseline (mean 76.78 ± 18.91 and 82.46 ± 18.27 respectively) and at follow-up (mean 75.01 ± 19.51 and 84.10 ± 12.49 respectively), suggesting participants in this study were already fairly confident in their ability to manage daily activities without losing their balance.  TUG times at baseline and follow-up testing were low suggesting participants had good balance.  The SOYF program did not meet its intended objectives of improving falls-related self-efficacy and balance for participants who received the program.  Recommendations for changes to future SOYF programming include targeting older adults with a history of falls or identified falls risk factors.  The SOYF program was not effective for this study group; however, it may work for older adults at higher-risk for falls.</description>

   <description>The province of Ontario is the primary focus of a growing body of research discussing migrant agricultural labour in Canada.  This thesis shifts the focus of inquiry to Quebec, a province that has not received the attention it warrants, given that it is “home” to the second largest temporary migrant population in Canada.  Currently, Mexicans constitute the bulk of labourers contracted through the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP).   With the establishment in 2003 of the Foreign Worker Program (FWP), however, the number of Guatemalans on the Quebec scene has increased significantly.  The situation of workers from both countries is addressed in the form of a case study of St. Rémi.  The thesis argues that the migrant experience in St. Rémi is characterized by a struggle to cope with: (1) an “unfree” labour status; (2) social and geographical isolation; and (3) lack of social assistance and community acknowledgement.  An attempt is made to give migrant workers a voice, since their contribution for the most part is either unknown or unappreciated.  The support system now in place in St. Rémi affords migrants some minimal rights, but much remains to be done, in Quebec and across Canada, to make the plight of workers better known and their situation improved.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 04:54:46.819</description>
   <description>Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWNs) are composite networks made of different wireless access technologies, possibly with overlapping coverage. Users with multi-mode terminals in HWNs will be able to initiate connectivity in the access technology that best suits their attributes and the requirements of their applications. The true potential of HWNs, however, is only realized through allowing users to maintain their sessions when toggling from one access technology to another. Such inter-technology handoffs, called vertical handoffs, will enable users to persistently select the most appropriate network, and not just at session initiation. For operators, HWNs pave the road to higher profitability through more capable networks where the complementary advantages of individual access technologies are combined. However, the characteristics of HWNs challenge traditional arguments for designing Radio Resource Management (RRM) frameworks. Managing the resources of an access technology in an HWN independently of other networks with which its overlaid risks underutilization and resource mismanagement. The dynamic nature of user demands in HWNs also calls for RRM modules with controlled operational cost. More importantly, the unique characteristics of HWNs call for non-traditional solutions that exploit the ``complementarity" of the individual networks.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we address these issues through proposing a framework for RRM in HWNs. Our framework comprises three key components. The first component is aimed at improving allocation policies in HWNs through joint allocation policies involving provisioning and admission control. In addition, we outline the basis for achieving robust provisioning that accommodates variability in user demands, but also in network capabilities. The second component is concerned with controlling the operational cost of RRM modules. As a case study, we choose bandwidth adaptation algorithms and optimize their performance. We also introduce the notion of stochastic triggers which enables operators to direct the operation of a RRM module based on the operator's objectives and network conditions. In the third component, we introduce a new module that exploits vertical handoffs to the benefit of network operators. Such operator motivated vertical handoffs can be utilized in instances of congestion control. They can also be used proactively to achieve long-term objectives such as load balancing or service delivery cost reduction.</description>

   <description>Consistently researchers have demonstrated that marital interactions of couples with and without a depressed partner differ. Given the high comorbidity of depression and marital distress, it is unclear whether observed communication patterns are due to marital distress or depression. Recent investigations suggest that, after controlling for marital satisfaction, marital communication behaviours may not be specific to depression. However, depressed groups in these investigations may have consisted of individuals with a wide range of acute mood states, thus minimizing differences between depressed and non-depressed mood states. Consistent with cognitive vulnerability models of depression, depressed individuals’ dysfunctional behaviours may manifest only during negative mood states. The first purpose of the present study was to use a mood induction procedure (MIP) to examine whether any marital communication were specific to depression, after controlling for marital satisfaction. The second purpose of the study was to examine whether communication behaviours predicted depressive symptoms at 6-month follow-up. The hypotheses were tested in a sample of 69 couples characterized by a wide range of wife depressive symptoms and couple marital satisfaction. Results of the current study showed that women who endorsed higher depressive symptoms were more likely to use high-level negative demands (e.g., use of angry, belligerent tone) and indirect demands (e.g., use of flirting, whining, or nagging tone) after they received a sad MIP, but depressive symptoms were not related to these behaviours when there was no MIP. Interestingly, depressive symptoms were positively correlated with low-level negative demands (attempts to influence one’s partner in a frustrated, defensive manner) regardless of whether or not wives received a sad MIP. Results also showed that when wives were induced with a sad mood, husbands of wives who endorsed higher levels of depressive symptoms engaged in more positive demands (e.g., use of warmth and understanding). Additionally, preliminary longitudinal data suggest that, wives who engaged in higher levels of high-level negative demands report lower levels of subsequent depressive symptoms. These findings are discussed in light of interpersonal theories of depression.</description>

   <description>The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily consists of 49 members, to which both Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (MRP1/gene symbol: ABCC1) and MRP4 (ABCC4) belong.  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug metabolizing genes have been shown to affect individual responses to drugs and toxins.  However, the role of SNPs in modulating the activity of drug transporters, such as MRP1 and MRP4, is poorly characterized.  The overall goal of my thesis was to determine the effects of SNPs in the promoter regions of human ABCC1 and ABCC4.  For MRP1/ABCC1, two proximal promoter SNPs (-275A>G, -260G>C) were identified in the literature and recreated in vitro, and the activity of the mutant ABCC1 promoter constructs was measured in five human cell lines using a dual luciferase assay.  The activity of the -275A>G promoter was comparable to the wild-type ABCC1 promoter.  On the other hand, the -260G>C substitution decreased ABCC1 promoter activity in HepG2, MCF-7 and HeLa (40 - 60%) cells.  A 1706 bp fragment containing the 5’-flanking and untranslated regions of ABCC4 were isolated from two bacterial artificial chromosome clones and six serially deleted ABCC4 promoter reporter constructs generated.  Luciferase assays of the basal promoter constructs of ABCC4 in HEK293T cells revealed the presence of one or more negative regulatory regions between -1706 and -876, between -876 and -641, and one or more positive regulatory regions between -641 and -356, and between -356 and -17.  Also, the ABCC4 promoter displayed differential activity in MDCKI and LLC-PK1 cells than in HEK293T cells.  One SNP (-523G>C) was identified from an online database and its activity tested.  However, -523G>C SNP did not cause any significant change in the ABCC4 promoter activity in both HEK293T and HepG2 cells (80 – 130%).  In summary, the data obtained suggest that the promoter SNPs studied may affect the transcriptional activity of ABCC1 or ABCC4, but it seems likely that this is not true in all cell types.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents the design and theoretical modeling of an aluminum gallium arsenide/gallium arsenide heterostructure from which suspended nanoscale mechanical resonators with embedded two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) can be made. The mechanical characteristics of the resonator and the piezoelectric actuation scheme are investigated using finite-element modeling. For a 836 nm-long,  250 nm-wide and 164 nm-thick beam with gold electrodes on top, out-of-plane flexural vibrations are verified to be piezoelectrically excited at the beam's fundamental frequency of 925.6 MHz.&#xd;
&#xd;
Fabrication recipes for the making of ohmic contacts to the 2DEG, Hall bars and suspended structures are developed using the designed crystal structure.  Electrical properties of the 2DEG are evaluated in both large, unsuspended structures as well as in sub-micron size suspended structures.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is found that the 2DEG has a reasonable electron density of 7.04E11 cm^-2 and electron mobility of 1.72E5 cm^2/(V s).</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Urban &amp; Regional Planning) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 11:25:12.401</description>
   <description>Urban and regional planning, from a professional standpoint, is built on a history of preservation, with the backdrop of a perennial quest to define itself for the benefit of both laypeople and its own members. Consequently, different stages of planning throughout the twentieth century relate to simultaneous cultural changes that have caused the re-definition and re-focusing of professional efforts. From the original concentration on rational thought that coincided with the planner as objective expert with the ability to identify and promote the public interest, to the civil rights movement of the late twentieth century that embodied postmodern ideas such as advocacy, collaboration, and communication, the concept of who the planner is and what role he or she plays has developed over time. In parallel, the structures planners use to deliver their services have altered. While the shift from the traditional concept of the public sector to quasi-public and private applications has been well documented, the structures of the twenty-first century such as multinationals, public-private partnerships, and multi-disciplinary arrangements are less studied and understood. Multi-disciplinary practices (MDPs), in particular, garner little attention from the academic or professional planning spheres. While the legal and accounting professions are scrambling for a clear policy direction on cross-discipline collaboration, planners do not seem to have diverted much attention to whether or not they have a future. Indeed, the existence of MDPs provokes the return of the question of what role planners should play, and whether they should be a distinct specialized profession, or an entity with a mandate to coordinate other professions with an eye to long-term planning for the public good. This analysis attempts to qualitatively assess whether MDPs should be supported or rejected by the planning discipline, and how the profession should be addressing the answer.</description>

   <description>Major Depression (MD) currently affects over 17 million individuals in North America (Greenberg et al., 2003). Identifying factors predictive of MD treatment response is important for developing more efficacious treatments and better understanding MD vulnerability. The goal of the present study was to examine the main and interactive effects of personality and stressful life events as predictors of MD treatment response. One hundred and thirty-one clinically depressed participants were randomly assigned to either 16-weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), or pharmacotherapy (PT). Personality in the form of trait self-criticism, neediness, and connectedness was assessed at pre and post-treatment using the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ; Blatt et al., 1976). Stressful life events experienced during treatment were assessed using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS; Bifulco et al., 1989). Results revealed that amongst individuals scoring lower in pre-treatment self-criticism, higher pre-treatment connectedness predicted superior treatment response. As well, amongst individuals scoring lower in pre-treatment neediness, higher pre-treatment connectedness predicted superior treatment response. In terms of personality change, both a reduction in neediness and a reduction in self-criticism over the course of treatment predicted superior treatment response. A personality × stressful life event interaction was also found such that amongst those experiencing a stressful life event during treatment, higher scores on pre-treatment self-criticism predicted poor treatment response. These results suggest that personality and stressful life events play an important role in the treatment of MD. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.</description>

   <description>In previous studies on heartbeat series, it has been proposed that the healthy heartbeat pattern represents complex nonlinear dynamics, and such cardiac nonlinearity may be used as a clinical indicator for the diagnosis of certain types of heart disease. However, it is still not quite clear whether there is any difference among the heartbeat series of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), or whether cardiac nonlinearity represents a severe heart disease situation. In the present study, parallel cascade identification (PCI), which frequently requires only short stretches of data to obtain highly promising results, is used to distinguish severe congestive heart failure, a clinical situation associated with a high-risk of sudden death, from low-risk CHF.&#xd;
Parallel cascade identification is an accurate and robust method for identifying dynamic nonlinear systems. The PCI algorithm combined with a specified statistical test may be used as a severe congestive heart failure marker by comparing a nonlinear model with a “linear” model (more precisely, a first-order Volterra series). In this thesis, PCI is applied to distinguish R-R wave intervals of CHF patients who died from those of patients who survived in a 5-year study.&#xd;
The detection accuracy of the PCI detector is evaluated over a first set of 49 patients, and then over a larger set of a further 352 patients, and consistent results are obtained between the two sets. Over the larger set, Matthews' correlation coefficient of nonlinearity with unfavorable outcome (death) is  , sensitivity for predicting unfavorable outcome  is  , while the specificity is  .&#xd;
The R-R wave interval exhibits nonlinearity in patients who died during the 5-year study. However, typically nonlinearity cannot be detected in patients who survived during the study. These findings show that for patients with congestive heart failure, nonlinearity is associated with unfavorable outcome (death), while patients for whom nonlinearity cannot be detected overwhelmingly have good outcomes. This is significant for clinical diagnosis and prognosis of severe congestive heart failure.</description>

   <description>In the Theaetetus, Socrates proposes that knowledge is true belief that is accounted for or justified. The question that intuitively follows is what the proper structure of a justifying account of true belief is. Answers to this question are available throughout the history of philosophy and are generally vulnerable to the Agrippan trilemma of justification that originates with Pyrrhonian skepticism. I trace the influence of Pyrrhonism on the search for the proper structure of justification as it plays out in the current debate between coherentists and “contemporary” foundationalists. I expose their principal concerns—normative and naturalist, respectively—as descendants of ancient skeptical challenges. Illuminating this lineage shows that currently competing forms of justification are locked into a dilemma that is circumscribed by the Agrippan trilemma. Immanuel Kant and Ludwig Wittgenstein grapple with precursors to the current debate, which sets an interesting precedent for John McDowell’s attempt to resolve it with what I think is a conceptualist interpretation of contemporary foundationalism. I argue that a genetic story heuristically reinforces McDowell’s interpretation in a way that frustrates normative and naturalist concerns and leaves open the threat of skepticism. I in turn portray Kant and Wittgenstein as capable of domesticating these threats with a unique structure of justification that I argue is non-epistemically foundationalist. Such a structure meets the Socratic challenge that justifying true belief itself requires true belief as to the soundness of this justification. My central aim is to show how non-epistemic foundationalism is a matter of grounding, which depicts an asymmetrical relationship between empirical belief and pre-cognitive or transcendental awareness. I conclude that a grounding model satisfies normative and naturalist concerns and thereby offers a way out of the contemporary dilemma and an escape from the Agrippan trilemma.</description>

   <title>Wisdom in practice: Socrates' conception of technē</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 12:27:20.415</description>
   <description>The word ‘technē’ frequently appears in the argument and discussions of Socrates and his interlocutors in Plato’s early dialogues; the concept of technē as well as instances thereof often play a crucial role in effecting and rendering plausible Socrates’ argument and discussion. It is curious, therefore, that there are so few studies devoted entirely to examining Socrates’ conception of technē; this is a deficit that this thesis aims to play some role in correcting. &#xd;
&#xd;
The first chapter is concerned with elaborating some of the problematic questions connected to the philosophical integrity and originality and the historical actuality of Socrates as he appears in Plato’s dialogues. Part of this project involves responding to questions regarding which dialogues count as ‘early’ and ‘Socratic’ – and what these designations mean; part involves elaborating and articulating the character of Socrates’ person and methods in the dialogues and here the importance of the concept of technē to Socratic reflection is introduced. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second chapter examines the connection in Socratic thought between the concepts of wisdom, knowledge, and technē, and aims to bring out both their close connection as well as how they serve to illuminate each other. In this chapter, a difficulty connected with the ordinary philosophical concept of wisdom or knowledge is examined in light of the curious Socratic thesis of the sufficiency of virtue. &#xd;
&#xd;
The third chapter discusses a controversy between two ways of understanding the significance of technē in Socratic thought and attempts to avoid the controversy by suggesting a third way of understanding the concept. &#xd;
&#xd;
The fourth chapter develops and examines Socrates’ own explicit account of technē in Gorgias. &#xd;
&#xd;
The fifth, and final, chapter connects Socrates’ own account to the controversy discussed in the third chapter and the difficulty examined in the second chapter and suggests a way of overcoming these controversies.</description>

   <description>Residential schools for Aboriginal children were a primary site of negotiations between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous subjects. These schools, and the records of peoples who occupied them, provide opportunities to better understand colonialism in British Columbia. Residential schools were places created to transform Aboriginal children, through assimilation, into a modernizing and colonial society. They are simultaneously places that offer access to Indigenous articulations of self and Indigeneity, expressions of resistance, and exertions of agency. Cultural products created by children in residential schools, particularly creative art products, allow us to visualize and understand Indigenous response to and evasions of colonial education. When taken together with Aboriginal peoples’ testimonies about the residential school experience, and with colonial records of the schools’ intents, children’s creative materials and expressions allow some access to the complex places that constituted the cultural geography of colonialism in British Columbia.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemistry) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 12:26:06.486</description>
   <description>Ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) exhibit a bulk electric polarization (PS) that can be coupled to an electric field to produce an ON-OFF light shutter, and are being investigated as an alternative to nematic liquid crystals in display applications.  Commercial FLC mixtures normally consist of a small amount of chiral dopant in an achiral smectic C (SmC) liquid crystal host.  Because the switching time of FLC display is inversely proportional to the induced polarization, the design of chiral dopants with high polarization powers (p) is a key aspect of FLC research.  Such work requires an understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and polar order in the chiral SmC* phase.&#xd;
            Previous work in the Lemieux group focused on 2,2’-spirobiindan-1,1’-diones dopants, and a conformational model was proposed to explain the observed host dependence of the polarization power (p) of these dopants.  In order to test this model, the 2,2’-spirobiindan-1,1’-dione core has been modified by introducing polar substituents and by modifying the functional groups linking the core to the alkyl side-chains.  Specifically, this thesis focuses on implementing this approach via the synthesis and characterization of chloro- and methyl-substituted 2,2’-spirobiindan-1,1’-dione dopants.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
            Four chiral dopants (2.1a, 2.1b, 2.2a and 2.2b) were synthesized, resolved and their absolute configurations assigned by CD spectroscopy.  Their polarization powers were measured in four SmC hosts with different core structures.  For both the ether-linked and ester-linked dopants, the addition of a substituent at the 6-position of one indanone ring results in lower polarization powers regardless of the size and polarity of the substituent, which is contrary to the original conformational distribution model. &#xd;
            A comparative study of the data suggests that the ester-linked dopants exert much stronger perturbations on the host environment than the ether-linked dopants, especially when the 6-position is substituted.  We postulate that this perturbation is chiral in nature, and that the feedback effect of chirality transfer causes a shift in the conformational distribution of the dopant favoring conformers with negative polarity. Probe experiments were performed to detect the effect of chirality transfer feedback (CTF) in the case of the chloro-substituted diester dopant (2.1b), showing consistent results with the postulate.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 16:15:23.077</description>
   <description>The Ergonomics Research Group at Queen’s University, supported by the Workplace and Safety Insurance Board, has been developing an on-line system to estimate peak and cumulative joint loading in the workplace. This study will aid the project by examining the muscle activation levels (MALs) in upper extremity and trunk muscles during a manual lifting task using both hands. It was hypothesized that MAL’s are correlated with the magnitude of the load in the hands and thus could be used to predict the load which in turn will be used to predict the lower back moments. Alterations in the muscle activation patterns due to lifting different loads were examined.&#xd;
Electromyographic signals (EMG) and kinematic data were recorded from different sites on the trunk and upper limb as subjects lifted a load from the floor to a shelf using squat, stoop and freestyle lift techniques. All raw EMG data were processed to obtain the linear envelopes (LE) which provides estimates of the MAL’s. The peak, mean and area of the linear envelopes were calculated. Using regression analysis, a relationship between the parameters and load lifted was found to exist. A non-linear parallel cascade type architecture was used to develop a model to predict the load in the hands. The model uses the EMG parameters as inputs and fits the data via linear and non-linear cascades to the output, i.e. the load in the hands. &#xd;
A model was successfully developed for the squat lift posture using the area, peak and mean of the zero-normalized EMG LE recorded from the erector spinae (L4 level), with a prediction error of ± 1.03kg and for the stoop posture, a prediction error of ± 2.34kg. Given the predicted loads, moments in the lower back were computed using the method of Hof (1992).</description>

   <description>Archaeal protein trafficking is a poorly understood process that is only beginning to unfold. Integral to this process are the various signal peptidases. Two types of archaeal signal peptidases are identified thus far: signal peptidase I (SPI) and the preflagellin peptidase. &#xd;
SPI is responsible for processing the majority of secreted proteins. Sequence analysis of archaeal SPI enzymes indicates a Sec-11 type enzyme with two conserved Aspartic acid and a Histidine in place of the conserved Lysine in bacteria. Site directed mutagenesis and in vitro assays identified three conserved residues (Ser52, His122 and Asp148) critical for M. voltae SPI activity, distinguishing the archaeal enzyme from its bacterial and eukaryal counterparts.&#xd;
The archaeal preflagellin peptidase is a type IV prepilin peptidase-like enzyme, initially characterized for its essential role in preflagellin processing prior to flagellar filament assembly. Unusual substrates have been proposed for this enzyme, including preflagellins of peculiar signal peptide lengths in certain archaeal species, as well as sugar binding proteins with extremely short signal peptides in S. solfataricus. In this thesis, in vitro comparisons of the signal peptide length requirements for the two different preflagellin peptidases, FlaK in M. voltae and PibD in S. solfataricus, are presented. While a signal peptide length cut-off of 5 amino acids was found for FlaK below which preflagellins remained unprocessed, substrates with shorter (4 and 3 aa) signal peptides were recognized and properly cleaved by PibD, suggesting a diversification of the preflagellin peptidases among the archaeal species. The ability of FlaK and PibD to complement FlaK activity in an M. maripaludis flaK mutant was evaluated.  &#xd;
M. maripaludis flaK is a markerless, stable mutant displaying pili as the sole cell surface appendage, providing the unique opportunity to closely study this structure without the interference of flagella. Here, purification and characterization of the archaeal pili is described for the first time in any archaeon. A putative pilus gene cluster with characteristics of type IV pilus genes was identified in M. maripaludis.  In-frame deletion of the putative major pilin gene, MMP0237, resulted in a nonpiliated phenotype that could be restored by complementation, providing a direct link of this gene to piliation.</description>

   <description>A turbulent diffusion flame that is typically used in a thermal spray coating system was analyzed in this study, as part of a diagnostic and development program undertaken by a research group at Queen’s University. Contributions made by this researcher were to numerically and experimentally investigate velocity and turbulent fields of the gaseous phase of the jet. Numerical and experimental analyses have been further developed upon previous research, with improved numerical methods and advanced experimental instrumentation. Numerous numerical simulations were performed in both two dimensional axisymmetric and three dimensional wedge geometries, while testing the dependence of the final solution on various physical models. Numerical analyses revealed the requirement for simulating this problem in three dimensions and improved turbulence modeling to account for relatively high levels of anisotropy. Velocity and turbulent measurements of non-reacting and combusting jets were made with a laser Doppler anemometer to validate numerical models. Excellent agreement was found between predicted and measured velocity and turbulent quantities for cold flow cases. However, numerical predictions did not agree quite as well with experiments of the flame due to limitations in modeling techniques and flow tracking abilities of tracer particles used in experimentation.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this dissertation is to anticipate changes in the international system by examining changes in Western defence industries.  The defence industries are a mechanism for producing power.  In an anarchic international system, power is the means by which states find security.  To produce power through a defence industry, a state must possess a range of attributes of power.  The investment needed to produce an array of defence equipment is considerable, and so a state must possess appropriate economic resources.  The cost also necessitates acts of political will, to direct resources away from other ends which might be more readily enjoyed.  Finally, the defence industry must produce equipment that is strategically relevant—which requires a high level of technology derived from domestic research and development.  The structure of the international system is fundamentally a question of the nature of the distribution of power, and the factors that make up state power are all to be found in defence industries.  The question posed here is “to what extent is change in the system predictable through looking at trends in the defence industrial base?” &#xd;
&#xd;
After establishing the theoretical perspective, this paper goes on to look at the changes that are taking place in the strategic environment.  This is followed by an analysis of the forces that act upon the defence industrial base, and of the implications of the adverse trends that they generate.  From these, the indicators which signal change in the international system are derived.  Then the responses of both state and industry are examined to test for the presence of these indicators.  Finally, the conclusion is an assessment of how changes in the defence industrial structures of the West reflect and may be able to anticipate change in the international system.</description>

   <title>Hamstring Activity and Lower Extremity Loading in Knee Osteoarthritis: The Effect of Foot Rotation</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 14:31:23.908</description>
   <description>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) causes more disability in community dwelling older adults than any other condition.  The high costs associated with treating this disability suggest that research needs to focus on ways of preventing the development and progression of knee OA using low cost interventions such as exercise and modifications to certain activities of daily living.  One such activity of daily living that has been implicated in the OA disease process is normal level walking or gait.	&#xd;
Those with medial compartment knee OA are known to make certain modifications in their gait patterns in an attempt to unload the diseased compartment of their knee.  Two of these modifications include the tendency of those with knee OA to walk with an externally rotated foot, and to increase the activity of their lateral hamstrings, while decreasing the activity of their medial hamstring during gait.  Therefore, this work attempted to clarify this relationship between foot position, lower extremity loading and hamstring muscle activation patterns during both level walking and lower limb exercise.&#xd;
First, the changes in lower extremity loading with both internal and external rotation of the foot during gait were investigated in a group of young healthy subjects.  It was discovered that internal rotation increased the magnitude of both the adduction moment and the medial-lateral shear force at the knee; while external rotation decreased both these measures.  This suggests that external foot rotation may be an effective compensation strategy for those with medial knee OA and internal foot rotation may be an effective compensation strategy for those with lateral knee OA.  &#xd;
Second, the same study was then repeated in a group of knee OA subjects and age matched healthy normal subjects; but in this work, hamstring EMG was also collected along with the external knee loads.  Hamstring EMG data was used to calculate the medial-lateral (M-L) hamstring activation ratio.  An increased M-L activation ratio would indicate an internal muscle moment tending to load the medial compartment more than the lateral; while a low M-L activation ratio would tend to unload the medial compartment.  Those with knee OA had an increased late stance knee adduction moment and a decreased M-L hamstring activation ratio as compared to the healthy control group.  Also, external foot rotation decreased the late stance knee adduction moment, lateral-medial shear force at the knee, and M-L hamstring activation ratio for both groups; but, internal foot rotation did not increase these measures.&#xd;
Lastly, since it is apparent that the hamstring may play a role in unloading the diseased knee compartment, the M-L activation ratio was calculated with changes in foot position during lower limb exercise in young healthy subjects to determine if selective activation of the medial or lateral hamstrings was indeed possible.  It was discovered that internal foot rotation increases the M-L hamstring activation ratio and external rotation decreases it.  &#xd;
Foot rotation has the ability to shift the external loads on the knee to one side of the joint or the other, and it also has the ability to alter internal knee loads created by hamstring muscular activation.  Therefore, foot rotation during gait and lower limb exercise may be an effective intervention that could be used to delay the onset and progression of knee OA, keeping older adults active and healthy much longer.</description>

   <description>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) is a basal forebrain cluster of several distinct nuclei.  It has been proposed that the BST coordinates autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral functions through the integration and organization of homeostatic responses necessary for survival.  Dysfunction of the BST contributes to pathophysiological states such as addiction, anxiety and aggression.  Based on anatomical and behavioral studies, the BST could be a key contributor to descending modulation of nociception as well as the physiological responses related to the affective aspect of the pain experience.&#xd;
The objective of the present study was to further understand the neurophysiological bases underlying the involvement of the 7 anterior nuclei of the BST in pain.  Using c-Fos as an indicator of neuronal activation, the results demonstrate that acute noxious stimulation produced an increase in the number of c-Fos immunoreactive cells (c-Fos-IR) in the dorsal anteromedial (dAM) and fusiform (FU) nuclei, while non-noxious stimulation did not increase c-Fos-IR in any of the nuclei examined.  Chronic neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) did not alter basal c-Fos-IR in the FU or dAM.  Unlike in the naïve condition, the number of c-fos-IR cells in the FU induced by acute noxious stimulation was attenuated in animals with either CCI or sham surgery compared to naive rats.  In contrast, c-Fos-IR induced by acute noxious stimulation in the dAM was not affected by CCI or sham surgery.  Acute noxious stimulation in animals that received CCI exhibited increased c-Fos expression in the ventromedial (vAM) nucleus of the BST, a finding not evident in naïve or sham control groups.  Finally, there was an increase in c-Fos-IR in the oval (OV) nucleus of sham-operated, but not naive or CCI rats.&#xd;
This study reveals for the first time that pain induces neuronal activity in the BST in a nuclei- and condition-specific way.  Given the efferent projection patterns from the BST, this system may relay supraspinal information to the periphery to produce physiological responses related to the affective pain experience.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 15:07:27.322</description>
   <description>The increasing demand on multimedia communication over wired and wireless networks imposes a continuous pressure on developing more robust coding schemes. Recently, joint source-channel coding with multiple description codes has become an attractive solution to ensure robust communication over noisy channels. In this thesis, we conduct analysis and design of multiple description codes for wired and wireless communication channels. First, a multiple description quantizer (MDQ) design method based on channel optimized quantization is developed. The proposed multiple channel optimized quantizer design scheme does not require index assignment and offers the benefit of resilience to both symbol and erasure errors. Low complexity MDQ is further explored and used to build a multiple description audio coder. Next, the advantages of employing multiple description coding over multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels are investigated. Information theoretical analysis is conducted and practical MDQ codes are designed. Finally, a new E-model based performance measure accounting for both rate-distortion performance and delay impairment is proposed to compare multiple description coding and layered coding for communication over packet networks.</description>

   <description>Purpose: The overall aim of this thesis is to contribute new knowledge by examining psychosocial factors and return-to-work profiles of occupational low back pain patients in a rehabilitation clinic. Outcome measures for injured workers with subacute low back pain included: change in measures, program utilization, pain profiles and return-to-work.  Methods: A total of 147 patients who met the eligibility criteria and consented, participated in a clinic-based, individualized, exercise-based treatment that included patient education and reassurance. A before-and-after design was used, with data collection on admission to and discharge from the program.  Results:  Pre-to-post analyses revealed that statistically significant improvements had occurred. However, subgroup analyses revealed differences in responses to treatment among the subgroups. Specifically, two sets of cluster analyses were conducted; each yielded two distinct subgroups of patients, one set with different lengths of time in the program, and another showing two pain intensity profiles. Furthermore, return-to-work rates varied between the groups although the overall return-to-work rate appeared high. Conclusion: Significant improvement was achieved following participation in the return-to-work rehabilitation program. However, participants with subacute nonspecific low back pain do not form a homogenous group in terms of their clinical presentation and responses to rehabilitation. Therefore, special attention might be warranted for subgroups within the sample, whom are at an increased risk for prolonged disability.</description>

   <description>after vibration endurance testing involves manual inspection only after the test is completed. An adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and&#xd;
diagnostic system that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure is&#xd;
desired. This thesis describes accelerometer based, microphone (single and dualmicrophone)&#xd;
based and acoustic emission sensor based monitoring systems for&#xd;
automotive light assembly failure detection during endurance testing. Preliminary results&#xd;
from accelerometer based and dual-microphone based diagnostic systems show that&#xd;
significant differences between healthy and faulty fog light assemblies can be detected.&#xd;
Based on these initial testing results, subsequent testing and data analysis were conducted&#xd;
for accelerometer based and dual microphone based systems. Four data analysis methods&#xd;
have been used: (1) Averaging signals in the time domain, (2) FFT of time domain&#xd;
waveforms over a specified time, (3) Averaging frequency spectra, and (4) Statistical&#xd;
methods for time domain signals. Individual frequency spectra (from FFT) and the&#xd;
average of multiple frequency spectra have shown potential to distinguish between&#xd;
signals from faulty and healthy light assemblies. Statistical measures, such as, Arithmetic&#xd;
mean (μ) and Kurtosis (K) can also be used to differentiate healthy and faulty light&#xd;
assemblies. In general, this work has shown the good potential to develop methods for&#xd;
adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic systems that would&#xd;
interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure.</description>

   <title>Engaging Communities in Health Geography? Assessing the Strategy of Community-Based Participatory Research</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-28 16:24:40.67</description>
   <description>Community-based participatory research (CBPR) positions community members on an equal footing with their academic colleagues and makes them responsible for the decisions which shape the direction and substance of research. The approach is founded on ideals of empowerment and the raising of critical awareness amongst stakeholders while contributing to social and community change.&#xd;
This thesis examines the practice of CBPR; specifically, the inconsistencies between its ideals and the achievement of meaningful outcomes, and its relative absence within health geography. While the thesis relies most heavily on theories of social capital for its conceptual framing, it also draws on three key concepts stigma, and critical and oppositional consciousness. Three CBPR case studies were initiated to uncover the challenges, benefits, and shortcomings of the approach involving people living with HIV/AIDS, persons with disabilities, and residents of social housing. The projects were evaluated using a range of strategies including participant observation, interviews with key stakeholders, questionnaires, and focus group discussions. The implementation of these projects ranged in success from being sidelined by managerial difficulties, community mobilization efforts proving unsuccessful, to a fully realized CBPR case study.&#xd;
ii&#xd;
The case studies illustrate the tenuous position of a researcher engaged in grassroots community mobilization and the need for core levels of social capital to precede the researcher’s intervention. Interviews with CBPR stakeholders exposed the sense of purpose and value of being united against a given cause and even the social benefits of connecting with others. The interviews brought into question the imposition of stringent research expectations upon community members who may face multiple barriers to carrying out research and gain little benefit from the practice. I conclude by suggesting that CBPR is a long way from being the perfect marriage of academia and community, failing adequately to meet the needs of both parties. In particular, the third case study demonstrates that stakeholders are critically aware of issues that affect their lives, their capabilities to carry out research and the roles that the researcher might play. Ultimately, this raises questions about what role CBPR might play in community mobilization, especially when the resources of groups are limited socially, economically and politically.</description>

   <description>Wireless networks are less reliable than wired networks because channels are “exposed” to the surrounding environment that is susceptible to interference and noise. To minimize losses of data due to collisions, wireless networks need a mechanism to regulate the access on the transmission medium. Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols control access to the shared communication medium so that it can be used efficiently.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we first describe the collision-controlled Dual Prohibition Multiple Access (DPMA) protocol [45]. The main mechanisms implemented in DPMA, such as binary dual prohibition, power control, interference control, and support for differentiated services (DiffServ), are presented in detail. We conducted a thorough simulation study on DPMA protocol from several aspects. First, we conduct simulations to observe the effects of binary competition number (BCN), unit slot length and safe margin on the performance of DPMA. Secondly, the DiffServ capability of DPMA is demonstrated through simulation results. Finally, we compare the DPMA protocol with the CSMA/CA protocol and find that DPMA with optimal configuration has better performance than CSMA/CA under both low and high network density.</description>

   <description>Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been acknowledged to have&#xd;
superior performance over separate source-channel coding in terms of&#xd;
coding efficiency, delay and complexity. In the first part of this&#xd;
thesis, we study a hybrid digital-analog (HDA) JSCC system to&#xd;
transmit a memoryless Gaussian source over a memoryless Gaussian&#xd;
channel under bandwidth compression. Information-theoretic upper&#xd;
bounds on the asymptotically optimal mean squared error distortion&#xd;
of the system are obtained. An allocation scheme for distributing&#xd;
the channel input power between the analog and the digital signals&#xd;
is derived for the HDA system with mismatched channel conditions. A&#xd;
low-complexity and low-delay version of the system is next designed&#xd;
and implemented. We then propose an image communication application&#xd;
demonstrating the effectiveness of HDA coding.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second part of this thesis, we consider problems in&#xd;
information hiding. We begin by considering a single-user joint&#xd;
compression and private watermarking (JCPW) problem. For memoryless&#xd;
Gaussian sources and memoryless Gaussian attacks, an exponential&#xd;
upper bound on the probability of error in decoding the watermark is&#xd;
derived. Numerical examples show that the error exponent is positive&#xd;
over a (large) subset of the entire achievable region derived by&#xd;
Karakos and Papamarcou (2003).&#xd;
&#xd;
We then extend the JCPW problem to a multi-user setting. Two&#xd;
encoders independently embed two secret information messages into&#xd;
two correlated host sources subject to a pair of tolerable&#xd;
distortion levels. The (compressed) outputs are subject to multiple&#xd;
access attacks. The tradeoff between the achievable watermarking&#xd;
rates and the compression rates is studied for discrete memoryless&#xd;
host sources and discrete memoryless multiple access channels. We&#xd;
derive an inner bound and an outer bound with single-letter&#xd;
characterization for the achievable compression and watermarking&#xd;
rate region. We next consider a problem where two correlated sources&#xd;
are separately embedded into a common host source. A single-letter&#xd;
sufficient condition is established under which the sources can be&#xd;
successfully embedded into the host source under multiple access&#xd;
attacks. Finally, we investigate a public two-user information&#xd;
hiding problem under multiple access attacks. Inner and outer bounds&#xd;
for the embedding capacity region are obtained with single-letter&#xd;
characterization.</description>

   <description>This dissertation investigates representations of bureaucracy in early modern drama and culture.  Focusing on a group of plays that feature bureaucratic figures among their characters, and reading those plays in the context of contemporary discussions of administration, this project attempts to understand the role played by the increasingly bureaucratic state in developing conceptions of individual subjectivity.  Specifically, this dissertation seeks to show that bureaucratic administrative structures and the methods deployed to maintain them provide a conceptual space in which early modern writers could conceive of themselves as possessing a private, inscrutable interiority.&#xd;
Chapter Two argues that whereas the binary relationship of secretary and master is often characterized in contemporary accounts as intensely, and problematically, intimate, the multivalent bureaucratic relationship is characterized, for the most part, as impersonal.  Chapter Three links bureaucratic labour with one product of that labour, the bureaucratic document, in order to analyze the way in which early modern representations and discussions of bureaucratic documents constitute a medium through which a form of bureaucratic identity is conceptualized.  Chapter Four examines a problem inherent to the bureaucratic delegation of authority – the combination of a desire to see everything and an inability to trust in the observations of others to aid you in fulfilling that desire – and seeks to find a solution to that problem in the way in which Much Ado About Nothing presents a vision of a disciplinary surveillance that is diffused throughout society, rather than residing in one privileged figure.  Chapter Five shifts the focus of inquiry from the bureaucracy and those in its employ to the subject of bureaucratic authority.  The chapter reads Hamlet’s claims to inscrutable interiority in the context of the state’s desire to see, and document, its subjects.  In it, I argue that, rather than deflecting questions, Hamlet’s assertions serve to align him with other targets of disciplinary surveillance.  The dissertation ends by considering links between the representational crisis engendered by the growth of the early modern bureaucracy and the representational practices of the early modern theatre.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2007-09-30 22:47:33.394</description>
   <description>Integrative behaviours in professional medical practice are those actions taken by a physician to better coordinate practice with other physicians to ensure that the most appropriate care is offered to patients. It has long been argued that the nature of differentiation measured between collaborating physicians affects such integrative activities and integrative success.  This research employs professional identity as a basis for describing the nature of differentiation between members of two medical specialists – general surgeons and anesthesiologists – and then examines the impact of such differentiation on integrative behaviours in medical practice. A qualitative approach, employing an embedded case design, was used to observe the practice of anesthesiologists, general surgeons, and their respective residents over a period of eight months. &#xd;
A model of identity-in-use comprising three co-mingled and overlapping identities (professional, role, personal) is developed, and then used to describe the implications for  Integrative practice. The demands of medical practice experienced by the general surgeons and anesthesiologists are powerful, almost factory-like in the value placed on speed of action and efficiency of patient throughput. These demands shaped and increased the strength of the contribution role identity made to each participants’ identity-in-use.&#xd;
Personal identity appears to play an important role in blunting the harshness of role demands in at least some of the participants. Personal identity also appears to draw out elements of the professional identity in some individuals, fed by curiousity, empathy, and the ability to be self-reflective. &#xd;
Despite observing little successful integrative behaviour, there are indications that differences in identity are associated with participants’ willingness to collaborate and possession of the skills necessary to collaborate. Potential implications for both the training and development of medical practitioners and the design of hospital work are outlined.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2007-10-01 13:12:33.096</description>
   <description>Purpose:  This thesis addresses feasibility issues of conducting a descriptive study of pain and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in women after Cesarean section (c-section).&#xd;
Objectives:  Feasibility issues surrounding population access, chart completeness for review, and preference for online data collection were investigated.  Prevalence and prediction of postoperative pain and HRQOL at six-weeks was addressed to generate hypotheses for future study.  &#xd;
Methods:  A descriptive pilot design was used, collecting a convenience sample of 41 women recruited two hours prior to a planned c-section at Kingston General Hospital.  Consenting women completed preoperative questionnaires via computerized tablet or paper and pen.  Preoperative data included pain, HRQOL, anxiety, depression, somatization, HCU, and demographics.  Six weeks postoperatively, women completed pain, HRQOL, and HCU questionnaires through the internet, postal mail, or telephone.  A chart review was used to collect health and obstetrical history, and acute postoperative pain.  &#xd;
Results:  An average of two participants per week were recruited, with a participation rate of 83.7%.  Online questionnaires were preferred by 34 women (83%) preoperatively, and 15 women (48.4%) postoperatively.  Almost 40% of patient charts were incomplete, missing symptoms reported in the immediate postoperative period.  Twenty-four percent of the sample was lost to follow-up.  &#xd;
Mild postoperative pain was reported by seven women (23) within 24 hours of completing the questionnaire.  Bodily pain and the physical component of HRQOL were worse both pre- and post-operatively than age- and sex-matched norms.  Postoperative pain at six weeks was predicted by tubal ligation, pain expectancy, and severe postoperative acute pain.  Postoperative HRQOL scores were correlated with preoperative HRQOL score, depression, somatization, and preoperative pain.  HRQOL physical composite score, bodily pain scores, and trait anxiety were predictive of healthcare use.&#xd;
Conclusion:  The planned c-section population is accessible for research purposes, however timing and mode of follow-up should be carefully considered due to the demands of newborn care.  A larger study evaluating the prevalence of chronic pain after c-section is needed, in which the role of depression, anxiety, somatization, and pain expectancy in pain outcomes and the impact on healthcare use is investigated.</description>

   <description>Hsp22 has been implicated in stress tolerance and longevity in various organisms though its role in Drosophila melanogaster larval thermal tolerance has not yet been investigated. I undertook this project to determine if over-expression of hsp22 in either muscle or motor neurons could alter locomotor ability at high temperature in third instar larvae of D. melanogaster. A combination of the UAS-gal4 and tet-On promoter systems was used to over-express transgenic hsp22 in the larvae. A β-galactosidase assay was used to determine the level of gene expression following administration of different amounts of tetracycline. A concentration of 100 μg/ml of tetracycline was found to elicit appreciably higher expression of the reporter gene than 0 and 0.1 μg/ml of tetracycline. Locomotor ability of larvae was assessed at a temperature of approximately 400C by measuring the time to movement failure (TMF). Larvae that were fed 100 μg/ml of tetracycline showed a significant decline in the TMF, which could be attributed to the presence of tetracycline at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Possible reasons behind the lack of a noticeable effect of hsp22 over-expression on the TMF are discussed. The detrimental effect of tetracycline could be attributed to the decline in mitochondrial translation or a decline in the population of endogenous bacteria, which are known to exert positive effects on the development and function of Drosophila larvae.</description>

   <description>For a short period during the 1960s Toronto’s Yorkville district was found at the centre of Canada’s youthful bohemian scene. Students, artists, hippies, greasers, bikers, and “weekenders” congregated in and around the district, enjoying the live music and theatre in its many coffee houses, its low-rent housing in overcrowded Victorian walk-ups, and its perceived saturation with anti-establishmentarian energy. For a period of roughly ten years, Yorkville served as a crossroads for Torontonian (and even English Canadian) youth, as a venue for experimentation with alternative lifestyles and beliefs, and an apparent refuge from the dominant culture and the stifling expectations it had placed upon them. Indeed, by 1964 every young Torontonian (and many young Canadians) likely knew that social rebellion and Yorkville went together as fingers interlaced. Making the Scene unpacks the complicated history of this fraught community, examining the various meanings represented by this alternative scene in an anxious 1960s. Throughout, this dissertation emphasizes the relationship between power, authenticity and identity on the figurative stage for identity performance that was Yorkville.</description>

   <description>In an immediate serial recall task, participants are asked to recall lists of items in order.  In the Hebb repeating-list variant of the task, subjects are read a series of lists, and every third list is repeated. Performance improves across repetitions but is stable for the non-repeated trials. The repetition advantage—the increased accuracy for the repeated list—is known as the Hebb effect.&#xd;
Several models have been advanced to explain how participants order successive items, but how participants take advantage of the repetition has largely been ignored. Although the task is usually discussed in terms of recall of verbal items, the Hebb effect has been observed with sequences of visuo-spatial positions.&#xd;
The present work assesses whether immediate serial recall of verbal material benefits&#xd;
from visuo-spatial context. Sequences of letters were presented in different spatial positions in a visual version of the Hebb task. Presenting lists in random spatial positions on the periphery of an&#xd;
imaginary circle did not boost performance, but if the sequence was predictable, overall accuracy increased. The spatial path of successive items influenced the Hebb effect. When the distance between successive positions was minimized, participants were able to exploit the repetition early&#xd;
in practice. The results deny an account based on item distinctiveness. I discuss the results in terms of contemporary models of ISR.</description>
