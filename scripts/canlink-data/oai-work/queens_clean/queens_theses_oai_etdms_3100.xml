   <description>Socially produced risks – ranging from financial crises to climate change – are of fundamental importance to contemporary economic, political, and social life.  Given the central importance of these risks, the development of frameworks that analyze the relation between risk, power, and inequality is a key task for sociology.  Ulrich Beck’s theory of risk society is a leading and powerful framework for analyzing the growing social production and distribution of risk, but it has fundamental problems in its understanding of the relation between risk and class.  Beck has argued that class relations will be dissolved due to the increasingly equal and catastrophic nature of risks, while, in response, his critics have shown that increasing risk does not undermine class.  This thesis explores the important, but as yet unasked, question: if class does continue to be a central factor, will it become even more important due to the changes associated with risk society?  In pursuing this question, this study shows how the theory of risk society has conceptual resources and explanatory implications that both Beck and his critics have misapprehended.  Firstly, it is argued that the processes associated with risk society tend to exacerbate class inequalities rather than simply dissolving or reproducing them.  Secondly, it its argued that the theory of risk society is not antithetical to class analysis, but can actually make an important contribution to theorizing the dynamics of existing class relations.  By analyzing how the distribution of environmental bads and the social production and distribution of financial risk tend to intensify class inequalities, this thesis substantiates this re-theorization of risk society and class.  It thereby makes a fundamental intervention into contemporary understandings of the relation between risk, inequality, and power in the twenty-first century.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-26 13:02:50.837</description>
   <description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors, which affect insulin release and stability in simulated gastrointestinal fluid that ultimately will reduce the bioavailability of insulin in a nanoparticulate oral delivery system. The focus was on nanoparticulate carriers developed by C. Reis, which have the highest level of bioavailability reported in the literature thus far. &#xd;
Particles observed by TEM were spherical and particle analyzer data showed that the peak of the distribution was 10 nm. Entrapment efficiency of insulin was 85%. Insulin retention/release was evaluated in both enzymatic and enzyme-free simulated digestive ﬂuids. HPLC measurement showed that insulin was stable in acid condition in presence and absence of pepsin. By changing the pH to 6.8 in an intestinal simulation, the amount of insulin decreased such that at the end of the 5 h simulation, 71% of the insulin was measureable in simulated GI fluid in presence of enzymes.  &#xd;
Insulin release profile from nanoparticles was low in gastric condition. After changing the pH to 6.8, an initial release of insulin occurred in the first 1h followed by plateau state in the remaining 2h. After a total of 5h in acidic followed by neutral pH medium, the formulation retained 48% of the insulin in the particles in simulated GI fluid in presence of enzyme. As confirmation of the amount of retained insulin, after 5h, particles were dissolved and the formulation was shown to fully retain up to 45% of the insulin in extended simulated gastrointestinal condition in the presence of enzymes.&#xd;
 Insulin release behavior was investigated in different simulated small intestinal media by incorporating phosphate buffer or bicarbonate buffer and physiological electrolytes. The release rate from particles in the phosphate buffer was faster compared to bicarbonate buffers. KBB-C showed a release profile that was very different from other media, with about 10% released in the first 30 min and 70% of the insulin remaining entrapped within the particles at the end of the experiment. Release in this buffer was reduced due to the decreased sodium to calcium ratio compared to the other KBB media.</description>

   <description>In a domain with diverse multi-disciplinary views of what a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is, tracking progress and developing efficient WSNs is inherently a complex process. The main motivation of this work is advancing state-of-the-art WSNs by adaptively utilizing their components, and enlisting the utility of resources in network vicinity. As WSNs increase in density and expand in scale, we continue to witness an increase in overlapped deployments that serve independent applications. In most scenarios, new networks are deployed for new applications without considering previous or neighboring WSNs. &#xd;
This thesis presents the resource reuse (RR-WSN) paradigm. Adopting a generic framework for resource utilization, we achieve synergy between heterogeneous sensing systems. We abstract the view of a WSN in terms of functional capabilities, and offer a component-based view to boost sensor node (SN) potential and contribution to WSN operation. Thus SNs provide resources. On the other hand, we formally derive a set of functional requirements per application. The design and deployment of WSNs thus converges to an optimal assignment of functional requirements to resources.&#xd;
Two mainstream designs of WSNs are addressed in this thesis. The first involves WSNs with static deployments of nodes, whereby multiple applications run on networks in a given vicinity, yet the resources and applications share an owner (e.g., on a University Campus). We then present a Binary Integer Programming formulation to find the optimal assignment of resources to these functional requirements, while minimizing the energy impact of running each functional request. &#xd;
We further extend our scope to include WSNs that depend on transient nodes, such as smartphones, in a dynamic (DRR-WSN) paradigm, which could contribute significantly to the resource pool. Intuitively, multiple-owners are involved as resource providers and require different applications. Thus, we address the valuation of resources as they are shared across network owners. We finally present a maximal matching problem of finding the lowest cost for running each application, based on the available resource pool in the vicinity required. Extensive performance evaluation depicts the impact of RR-WSN design on WSN operation and longevity in various scenarios.</description>

   <description>Mammalians process their photoreceptions through lateral eyes; however, non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates possess additional extraretinal photoreceptors over their bodies to detect light stimuli. Chromatophores, i.e. dermal specialized pigment cells, play important roles in the regulation of body patterns. Since chromatophores derive from neural crest, they share the common embryonic origin with retina. Recent evidence shows that they are light-sensitive due to opsin expression. In the present study, the expression of seven cone opsins was detected in tilapia caudal fin tissues. Moreover, distinct photoresponses were found in two chromatophore types. Regardless of stimulating wavelengths, melanophores tend to disperse and maintain cell shape at dispersion stage by shuttling pigment granules. Conversely, erythrophores respond to light in a wavelength-dependent manner. The opsin expression profiles of melanophores and erythrophores imply SWS1 and RH2 group genes may play important roles in chromatophore photoresponses. Through measuring photosensitivity, I suggest the two opsins play opposite roles in light-induced translocations of pigment granules within erythrophores: SWS1 for aggregations at UV and short wavelength regions and RH2b for dispersion in middle/long wavelengths. An antagonistic interaction occurs in the overlapping of the absorbance spectra of the two opsins. I also found that the photoresponses take place along with the occurrence of the change of cell membrane potential. In addition, the effect of different light backgrounds (broad spectrum, short wavelength-rich, and red-shifted light conditions) on the photosensitivity of tilapia erythrophores was investigated. I found that the major opsin classes (SWS1 and RH2b) responsible for photoresponses remain constant in three groups of erythrophores. Together, I postulate that melanophores may serve as a light filter in integumentary tissues, and the chromatically antagonistic mechanism enables tilapia erythrophores to sense the subtle change of environmental photic condition and to fine-tune pigmentation. I also investigated the ontogenetic change of photoresponses of rainbow trout melanophores. Distinct photoresponses were found in parrs and smolts. Furthermore, smolt melanophores responded to light in a wavelength-dependent manner. Since the change of coloration and visual system during smoltification of salmonids is regulated by thyroid hormone (TH), I suggest that the development of melanophore photosensitivity is associated to TH as well.</description>

   <description>In the past decade, society has become increasingly dependent on portable electronic devices that are almost exclusively powered by batteries. The performance and duration of operation of these devices are constrained by the limited energy per unit mass of batteries. Recent advances in the field of energy harvesting have led to the development of efficient and sustainable technologies that are capable of collecting mechanical energy from human motion, and producing the electrical power required to operate portable devices. This thesis focuses on the design and evaluation of a motion-based biomechanical energy harvester that collects energy from the user’s lower limbs. Two lower-limb energy-driven harvesting backpacks, a belt-driven prototype and a gear-driven prototype, were developed. Human treadmill walking testing showed that the belt-driven prototype was able to produce 19.3-12.2W of electrical power with a device efficiency of 34.4-48.4%. The belt-driven prototype had a low metabolic cost of carrying the device, approximately 18W, but had a large metabolic cost of producing electrical power, approximately 188W. This large metabolic cost of energy production is likely a consequence of the large mechanical power required to drive the device, namely to overcome the moment of inertia and the frictional loss of the device. Preliminary testing of the gear-driven prototype showed that the device was able to produce 7-11.2W of electrical power with a device efficiency of 58-78%. A theoretical model was developed that was able to predict the harvester0s electrical power output and the respective load on the user, from a given input motion wave-form. This model was able to predict the peak voltage and peak force with a percent difference of 2% ± 2% and 6.4% ± 4% respectively. Further reduction of the volume, weight, and number of parts of the energy harvester is essential in making the harvester a viable commercial product for powering portable devices.</description>

   <description>Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a prevalent, refractory pelvic pain condition characterized by pain in the pelvic area and urinary frequency, largely unresponsive to medical interventions. This study used multiple mediations to test the associations of validated pain appraisal and behavioural coping strategies between pain and quality of life. Patients (N = 175) were recruited from tertiary care urology clinics and completed questionnaires. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted on four individual measures (Chronic Pain Coping Inventory, Survey of Pain Attitudes – Control subscale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale), then on the empirically derived factors that produced four factors to be used in regression and multiple mediation models: illness-focused behavioural coping, catastrophizing, wellness-focused behavioural coping, and depression. In regressions, CP/CPPS patient symptoms (p &lt; .01), illness-focused behavioural coping (p &lt; .01) and wellness-focused behavioural coping (p &lt; .05) predicted physical quality of life, while catastrophizing (p &lt; .01) and illness-focused behavioural coping (p &lt; .05) predicted mental quality of life. Mediation analyses showed that illness-focused behavioural coping strategies partially mediated the relationship between pain and physical quality of life, whereas catastrophizing and illness-focused behavioural coping strategies both fully mediated the relationship between pain and mental quality of life. These results identify catastrophizing and illness-focused coping as key psychosocial targets for interventions for patient quality of life in CP/CPPS.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
The purpose of this study is to provide a descriptive account of the experiences of two teachers with disabilities in order to report how disability influences them both personally and professionally. My research questions were as follows. Firstly, how do participants understand themselves as adults, adults with disabilities, and as adults with disabilities who are teachers? Secondly, how does disability contribute to their pedagogy and how do their experiences as educators contribute to their understanding of disability? Thirdly, for these teachers with disabilities, what is the nature of their relationships in both educational and workplace contexts? Fourthly, what is their perspective on accommodations? Finally, what is their advice to aspiring teachers who have disabilities, including myself? I conducted interviews that addressed these research concerns with two participants, both experienced teachers with self-identified disabilities. For data analysis, I used the method of constant comparison to create codes and find themes within the data collected from the interview, based on disability identity and self-advocacy theories. It is discussed that individuals with disabilities face unique identity-related challenges aside from the physical and mental aspects of having a disability. A key finding is  that participants were shaped by prior experiences in childhood and in the education system that were related to their disability which now influence their teaching. Other findings include: their independence, resilience and ability to strategize led to their creation of their own accommodations: they found an environment that honoured their own strengths. Both teachers found that disclosing their own disability helped their students to better relate to them. However, at the same time, they were not as aware of accommodations for themselves as they were for their students. Teachers with disabilities serve an important role in schools as they are not only representatives of what inclusive societies can achieve: they also have unique experiences and skills that are an asset to their students. Recommendations to expand upon Gill’s (1997) disability integration model as well as to create more inclusive environments for teachers with disabilities are also discussed.</description>

   <description>In utero exposure to benzene, a known environmental contaminant, is associated with&#xd;
increased risk of childhood leukemia. We have previously shown that in utero benzene exposure can alter the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, which is up-regulated in leukemia. We hypothesize that this is through benzene-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production&#xd;
interfering with the signalling pathway involving NF-κB, p38-MAPK and c-Myb. The objectives were to determine if ROS and p38-MAPK mediate benzoquinone (BQ) induced changes in NF-κB activity, and if downstream targets of NF-κB are altered after BQ exposure. HD3 chicken erythroblast cells were transfected with either a c-Myb or an NF-κB luciferase linked reporter plasmid and exposed to 25 μM BQ for 2-24 hours. C-Myb and NF-κB activities were determined using luciferase transcription factor activity assays, Western blotting was conducted to assess changes in protein levels in non-transfected cells, immunofluorescence was used to determine nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the presence of ROS was determined via DCFDA assays. A TaqMan qRT-PCR kit was used to assess mRNA changes of c-myc and bcl-2, two targets of NF-κB. NF-κB activity was significantly increased following 16 and 24 hours of BQ exposure in&#xd;
HD3 cells. DCFDA assays and pre-treatment with antioxidants indicated that BQ-mediated ROS production was responsible for increased NF-κB activity. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting indicated that NF-κB translocates into the nucleus after BQ exposure. P38-MAPK was activated through a ROS dependent pathway after 8-24 hours of BQ exposure, and pre-treatment with the p38-MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, attenuated BQ-mediated increased NF-κB activity,&#xd;
partially due to increased IκB-α protein expression. At this point, the chosen downstream targets were not significantly different compared to control. Future studies should continue to evaluate&#xd;
the role of p38-MAPK in this pathway as well as look at epigenetic changes in key signalling proteins. Evaluating the effects of toxicant exposure on cell signalling pathways is vital for understanding mechanisms of xenobiotic-induced toxicity.</description>

   <description>Knowledge mobilization has been described as putting research in the hands of research users.  Few studies have examined knowledge mobilization within community-based organizations (CBOs).  To address this research gap, this dissertation examines knowledge mobilization within a CBO that supports people with spinal cord injury (SCI).  Research suggests that communication channels, or the means by which a message is delivered, may affect knowledge mobilization.  This dissertation presents four manuscripts examining how communication channels were used by the CBO to disseminate physical activity guidelines and intervention strategies to people with SCI.&#xd;
	Manuscript 1 investigated reach and effectiveness of an event-based knowledge mobilization initiative delivered by the CBO using interpersonal communication channels to disseminate the guidelines to people with SCI.  Results indicated that the event-based knowledge mobilization initiative was effective for initial dissemination of the guidelines.  However, further long-term efforts are needed.  &#xd;
	Manuscript 2 describes how the event-based knowledge mobilization initiative was implemented by the CBO.  Recognizing that support personnel are important messengers, the reach and effectiveness of the initiative for persuading support personnel to disseminate the guidelines was examined.  Results indicated that an event-based knowledge mobilization initiative can be implemented by a CBO and may be an effective strategy for CBOs to disseminate information to support personnel.  &#xd;
	Manuscript 3 further examined the role of communication channels in the process of knowledge mobilization within the CBO using network analysis.  Results indicated that CBO staff and volunteers’ integration within interpersonal communication channels was associated with greater knowledge of evidence-based physical activity resources and engagement in physical activity promotion behaviours.  &#xd;
	Manuscript 4 examined the feasibility of training peers with SCI to learn an evidence-based approach to physical activity promotion called Brief Action Planning.  Findings indicated that Brief Action Planning is a tool that can be feasibly learned and potentially used by peers to promote physical activity to their mentees through interpersonal communication channels.&#xd;
Overall this dissertation contributes to a small but emerging body of literature examining knowledge mobilization in CBOs. Findings indicate that through a community-university multidisciplinary partnership and appropriate communication channels, a CBO can effectively and feasibly disseminate evidence-based physical activity information.</description>

   <description>The REarranged in Transfection (RET) tyrosine kinase is an important signalling protein for the development of neural crest-derived tissues such as the enteric and sympathetic nervous systems. RET is constitutively activated in multiple human tumour types, such as thyroid carcinomas and some non-small cell lung cancers. RET has 3 distinct isoforms, RET9, RET43 and RET51, which are named after the lengths of their unique C-terminal tails. Here, we investigate the role of RET in the TT thyroid carcinoma cell line, where it is a driver of tumourigenesis, and in the MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma cell line, where RET is not driving tumour initiation, but may nonetheless have a profound effect on tumour progression. We generated lentiviral constructs for shRNAs that target either RET9 or RET51 specifically, or a common region shared by all RET isoforms. TT and MiaPaCa-2 cells were transduced using these lentiviral particles to create stable cell lines containing knockdowns of total RET, RET9, or RET51. Using a variety of morphological and biochemical assays, we found that RET expression is critical for TT cell survival, and that both RET9 and RET51 play significant roles in driving cell proliferation in TT cells. Conversely, RET is not critical for MiaPaCa-2 cell survival, and RET knockdown had no effect on MiaPaCa-2 proliferation. MiaPaCa-2 cells instead underwent dramatic morphological changes, from their normal spindle-like mesenchymal appearance to an increasingly flattened and epithelioid character, in response to RET9, RET51 or total-RET knockdown. The observed morphological changes were coupled with significantly reduced invasiveness through matrigel towards a source of chemoattractant, suggesting a critical role for RET in mediating cell invasiveness. These results suggest that RET may not only drive tumourigenesis, but can also enhance disease progression when expressed in other tumour types. We predict that RET may play critical roles in perineural invasion in pancreatic cancers, a process where cells invade along peripheral nerve fibers by following an increasing concentration of chemoattractants secreted by nerve and glial cells. Thus, RET may be a valuable target to slow, or stop this process, which would have significant clinical implications in a wide variety of cancers.</description>

   <title>Automated Analysis of Load Tests Using Performance Counter Logs</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-28 23:04:58.774</description>
   <description>Load testing remains the most integral part of testing and measuring the performance of Large Scale Software Systems (LSS). During the course of a load test, a system under test is closely monitored, resulting in an extremely large amount of logging data, e.g., Performance counters logs. The performance counter log captures run-time system properties such as CPU utilization, disk I/O, queues, and network traffic. Such information is of vital interest to performance analysts. The information helps them to observe the system’s behavior under load by comparing it against the documented behavior of a system or with expected behavior. In practice, for LSS, it is impossible for an analyst to skim through the large amount of performance counters to find the required information. Instead, analysts often use ‘rules of thumb’. In a LSS, there is no single person with complete system knowledge. In this thesis, we present methodologies to help performance analysts to 1) more effectively compare load tests to detect performance deviations, which may, lead to Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations and 2) provide them with a smaller and manageable set of important performance counters to assist in the root cause analysis of the detected deviations.&#xd;
We demonstrate our methodologies through case studies based on load test data obtained from both a large scale industrial system and an open source benchmark system. Our proposed methodologies can provide up to 89% reduction in the set of performance counters while detecting performance deviations with few false positives (i.e., 95% average precision).</description>

   <description>Non-consequentialists agree that Luke may not kill Lorelai in order to prevent Kirk from killing Richard and Emily. According to this view, Luke faces a deontic constraint: he is forbidden from killing Lorelai, even though doing so will bring about fewer killings overall. The justification of constraints, in my view, faces two challenges. First, constraints must meet the Irrationality Challenge: it needs to be demonstrated that there is nothing inconsistent about the claim that Luke should allow more killings to come about. And, secondly, a successful explanation of constraints must meet the Authority Challenge: we need to know why Luke’s reason not to kill Lorelai is normatively categorical. &#xd;
This dissertation takes up different aspects of Authority Challenge. The first introductory chapter aims to motivate the question of authority as a pressing challenge to non-consequentialism. I argue that the violation of constraints is not just motivated by the thought that they are rationally inconsistent, but by the claim that their intuitive importance cannot be explained. &#xd;
Chapters two and three take up the connection between the authority of constraints and their interpersonal character. In chapter two, I argue that Stephen Darwall’s account of the second-person standpoint cannot yield an account of constraints that satisfies the Authority Challenge and that T.M. Scanlon’s contractualism offers us a better way of accounting for the interpersonal significance of constraints. Chapter three argues that Frances Kamm’s inviolability approach cannot be reconciled with the intuitive distinction between acting wrongly and wronging someone. The arguments of this chapter are meant to demonstrate that in order for wronging to carry any normative significance, it must play a foundational role in our account of permissibility. &#xd;
The fourth chapter argues that Moderate deontologists—those who posit a threshold on the killing of the innocent—cannot make sense of the intuitive authority of deontic constraints. The failure of Moderate deontology, I argue, reveals the overlooked appeal of Absolutism. The fifth chapter argues that the authority of restrictions extends to a prohibition on killing non-responsible threats. I argue that a prohibition on killing non-responsible threats accords with the demands of fairness.</description>

   <description>The ability to walk and negotiate stairs is an important predictor of independent ambulation. The superposition of mobility impairments to the effects of natural aging in persons with stroke render the completion of many daily activities unsafe, thus limiting individuals’ independence within&#xd;
their communities. Currently however, no means exist for the monitoring of mobility levels during daily living in survivors after the completion of rehabilitation programs. The application of inertial sensors for stroke survivors could provide a basis for the study of gait outside of&#xd;
traditional laboratory settings. The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate the performance of inertial sensors in measuring gait of hemiparetic stroke survivors through the completion of three studies. The first study explored the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) for the measurement of lower limb joint kinematics during stair ascent and descent in both stroke survivors and healthy older adults. Results suggested that IMUs were suitable for the measurement of lower limb range of motion in both healthy and post-stroke subjects during stair ambulation. The second study evaluated the measurement of step length and spatial symmetry during overground walking using IMUs. A systematic error resulting in the underestimation of step lengths calculated using IMUs compared with those measured using video analysis was found, however results suggested that IMUs were suitable for the assessment of spatial symmetry between affected and less-affected limbs in stroke survivors. The final study evaluated the automatic classification of gait activities using inertial sensor data. Findings revealed that the use of a classifier composed of frequency-features extracted from IMU accelerometer and gyroscope data from both the affected and less-affected limbs most accurately identified gait activities from&#xd;
post stroke gait data.&#xd;
This thesis provides a first attempt at applying IMUs to the study of gait post-stroke.  Future work may extend the findings of these studies to provide a better understanding to rehabilitation professionals of the demands of everyday life for stroke survivors.</description>

   <description>Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of fatigue on quality of life (QOL), physical function, and participation in social, recreational, and daily living activities (ADLs) in women living with HIV.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: HIV-infected women (n=15; age 44±8 years) were recruited from the Clinical Immunological Outpatient Clinic (CIOC) and the HIV/AIDS Regional Services (HARS) in Kingston. Four questionnaires were completed to obtain information on demographics, fatigue (HIV-Related Fatigue Scale, HRFS), QOL (Medical Outcomes Survey HIV Healthy Survey (MOS-HIV), and valued social, recreational and daily living activities. Participants then performed the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess their physical function. Assessments were conducted in the CIOC or in a gymnasium at another location. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Mean length of HIV infection was 12±5 years and 14 of the 15 women were on anti-retroviral therapy.  Seven of the 15 women did not have significant issues with fatigue on the HRFS. The other 8 reported that fatigue severely interfered with ADLs, socialization and mental functioning. QOL scores were significantly lower in the fatigued group compared with the non-fatigued group in 8 of 11 sub-scales of the MOS-HIV; the values being approximately 50% of  those in the non-fatigued group. Socializing with friends, walking, grocery shopping and cleaning were listed as activities in which participants experienced limitations. No significant differences were found between the fatigued and non-fatigued groups for the distance walked in the 6MWT or for the percent of predicted distance walked.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions:  Half of the women with HIV in this study reported that fatigue interfered with daily functioning and participation in day to day activities, impacting their QOL. These findings suggest that fatigue can be a major issue impacting QOL in this population; therefore, fatigue reduction should be one of the priorities of HIV-related medical management.</description>

   <description>On Valentine’s Day, 1933 the citizens of Blairmore, Alberta elected a Communist town council and school board. “Alberta’s Red Democrats: the Challenges and Legacy of Blairmore Communism, 1921-1936” seeks not only to understand the Red administration that governed here during the mid-thirties, but also the community that elected it. It will be shown that the election of Mayor Bill Knight and his colleagues was neither a knee-jerk reaction to the protracted poverty of the Great Depression nor an alignment with the Communist Party of Canada as an act of desperation. The Red movement at Blairmore was deeply rooted in past experience, and as it came to fruition challenged what it meant to be a Communist in Canada.</description>

   <description>Much research about the adaptation of Chinese international students focuses on challenges and stresses they experience in their adjustment to the host country, a perspective that is largely negative and pessimistic (Yeh &amp; Inose, 2003). Although resilience, highly congruent with positive psychology and broadly defined as successful adaptation to adversity, has been studied among several populations, it has not been widely applied to these students. This study employs the cultural-contextual theoretical framework of resilience to gain an understanding of the resilience of 16 Chinese international students by examining: (1) How do these Chinese international students view challenges? (2) What resources do these Chinese students view as helpful in overcoming challenges? (3) How have their individual identities been negotiated and transformed? (4) What are their subjective views of success? The interviews revealed four leading challenges for these Chinese international students across different contexts: English, loneliness, relationships, and academic challenges. The participants identified intrinsic and extrinsic, cultural, and contextual resources they perceived helpful and important for them in overcoming challenges. They additionally described their transformed identities in personal, social, and cultural dimensions. The study revealed students’ patterns of navigation and negotiation, and their personal views on success, views that were dramatically different from what they saw as traditional Chinese success. This study expands the conceptualization of resilience from a cross-cultural to a more contextual understanding. This understanding might be helpful to provide more efficient assistance, build more effective intercultural communication, or even design more updated intervention programs for Chinese international students.</description>

   <description>The Helping Students Read Words website is an online tool to assist teachers in remediating students’ weak word reading skills. The website has four key sections: Phonological Awareness, Phonics, Fluency, and From Research to Remediation. The phonological awareness section provides teachers with an overview of this reading component which has been identified as one of the strongest foundational skills necessary to learn to read (Cain, 2010; Goswami &amp; Bryant, 1990; Kirby, Roth, Desrochers &amp; Lai, 2008; Stanovich 1993). This section also provides a review of additional research evidence for phonological and phonemic awareness as well as information on how to assess this skill in struggling readers. Similarly, the sections on phonics and fluency also provide teachers with overviews for these reading components, reviews of research that lend support to their importance in reading, and information on how to assess phonics and fluency skills in students who struggle with word reading. The final section From Research to Remediation draws upon the information presented in the Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and Fluency sections and provides teachers with guidelines on how to create a remedial word reading program for their struggling word readers. Embedded throughout the Helping Students Read Words website are definitions for reading terminology and active links to other websites that offer easy-to-access videos, online reading games and activities and lesson plans for teachers to use.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2013-08-30 02:57:55.312</description>
   <description>Florentine artist Neri di Bicci (1418-1492) was one of the most prolific and financially successful artists of the fifteenth century.  The hundreds of extant paintings from his workshop are a testament to his industry, which is further underlined by a close examination of the 798 entries he wrote between 1453 and 1475 in his account book, his Ricordanze.  The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse the monetary and social history in Neri’s Ricordanze in order to provide a framework for an exploration of the way that paintings were constructed in Neri’s workshop, and a close examination of the evidence concerning collaboration between Neri and his contemporaries.&#xd;
This thesis determined that the repeated use of full-size paper patterns, known as cartoons, was a key aspect of Neri’s painting procedure.  Cartoon usage was established by overlaying scaled images of paintings in Photoshop, which demonstrated that the outlines of many of Neri’s figures and architectural designs were identical.  Analysing the price of Neri’s paintings also revealed trends which suggested that he used cartoons.  Half of the 224 objects described in the Ricordanze cost 30 lire or less, and the average of the 40 paintings between two and four square meters was 151 lire, less than half the regional average for paintings of comparable size.  Neri likely increased his profits by working faster than his contemporaries, since 15 of the 36 paintings with available completion times were finished in less than four months, and the overall average was seven and a half months.  Cartoons were also shared between Neri, his contemporaries (including Fra Filippo Lippi and Pesellino), and former assistants such as Cosimo Rosselli, Giusto d’Andrea, and Francesco Botticini, since similarities in figure size were discovered using Photoshop.&#xd;
As a result of this study, we are left with a better understanding of fifteenth-century production methods and the movement of designs between workshops.  Furthermore, we know that Neri ran his business in a highly organized manner, and that cartoons were used extensively in order to produce a large volume of affordable paintings in order to meet the growing quattrocento demand for devotional objects.</description>

   <description>Children have the intrinsic drive to play and be outdoors, as well as the curiosity to explore the world around them (Louv, 2008). Connections and interactions with nature tend to be beneficial for children’s cognitive development, with outcomes ranging from improved cognitive functioning (Wells, 2000) to the development of important academic skills (Miller, 2007). Perhaps more significant though are the positive outcomes among nature, health, and wellbeing (e.g., Taylor &amp; Kuo, 2009), along with the cultivation of environmental appreciation, empathy, and stewardship (e.g., Ewert et al., 2005). Many nature-based early years programs have been developed and adopted around the world, placing emphasis on fostering children’s experiences, interactions, and connections with the natural world. As this global early years phenomenon continues to build momentum, the need to investigate how children are experiencing these nature-based early years programs becomes more pertinent.&#xd;
The purpose of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of four children’s experiences at a nature-based early years program located in a small town on the outskirts of an Eastern Ontario urban centre. Data were collected using qualitative methodology (observations, photographs, semi-structured interviews, and photo elicitation) and took place over a five-week period in the winter term. Data were analyzed using conventional qualitative means, through open coding and identifying categories and overarching themes (McMillan &amp; Schumacher, 2010). Using Place-Based Education as the theoretical guide, data were explored using three main themes: lived experience; connections to place and to community; and learning, growth, and development. The findings from this research not only illuminate the children’s experiences at a nature-based early years program, but also provide the fertile ground upon which further examination and discussion can grow—an examination and discussion of the significance of nature-based learning as it relates to contemporary education.</description>

   <description>Marked differences have been found in men’s and women’s sexual response patterns, contingent upon their sexual orientation; opposite- and same-gender attracted men demonstrate greatest genital and self-reported arousal to their preferred stimulus type, whereas other-gender attracted women do not, and findings of same-gender attracted women have been mixed (e.g., Chivers, Seto &amp; Blanchard, 2007; Chivers, Bouchard, Timmers, &amp; Haberl, 2012). Given the complex nature of sexual stimuli that are used in research paradigms involving category-specificity of sexual arousal, however, it is often unclear to what extent contextual cues (cues other than the sexual actor’s sex characteristics; body movement, level of sexual activity, etc.) influence participants’ sexual response patterns. As such, the current study attempted to parse contextual cues from sexual stimuli and examined genital, self-reported, and continuous self-reported responses of same- and other-gender attracted men and women to prepotent sexual features (stimuli believed to elicit automatic sexual arousal: erect penises and vasoengorged vulvas), nonprepotent sexual features (flaccid penises and pubic triangles) and neutral stimuli (clothed men and women). All samples were found to exhibit a category-specific pattern of genital, self-reported, and continuous self-reported sexual arousal. Similarly, genital, self-reported, and continuous self-reported arousal was generally found to be greatest to “prepotent” sexual conditions. Limitations and implications are discussed.</description>

   <title>Acquiring and maintaining second-language skills: An examination of Canadian federal public service programs</title>
   <creator>Cléroux, Dolorès</creator>
   <subject>Second-Language</subject>
   <subject>Acquisition</subject>
   <description>Research has shown that although it takes time and effort to acquire additional languages, they are valuable assets. Both teachers and learners have to be motivated, and active participation is required to succeed. Unfortunately, when active training is completed, the acquired skills seem to be easily lost.&#xd;
In this project, I describe specific programs used for the purpose of language training and the goals that are set for the military and civilian second language (L2) learners within the Ministry of National Defence bilingual Canada. I also review relevant literature in order to identify ways to maintain the acquired L2 skills after active learning has ended.&#xd;
During my literature research, I examined areas that pertain to language acquisition from both teachers’ and learners’ points of view. Teaching methods, testing within the government program, motivation, aptitude, and computer-assisted learning technologies were explored with respect to their use and educational value. Most of the studies that I found in my research indicate that teachers’ and learners’ motivation is an essential factor for success, that L2 is still a developing field where research is insufficient, and that many questions remain concerning retention of acquired L2 skills. &#xd;
Even if little research has been conducted on the question of language retention and maintenance to find out the rate at which an L2 is lost, the impression is that to maintain the acquired (L2) skills, teachers’ energies must be focused on ways to promote ongoing maintenance habits right from the beginning.</description>

   <description>Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled enzyme situated at a pivotal branchpoint of plant C-metabolism. Two physically and kinetically distinct oligomeric  classes of PEPC exist in the endosperm of developing castor oil seeds (COS). Class-1 PEPC is a typical homotetramer composed of 107-kDa plant-type PEPC (PTPC) subunits, whereas the 910-kDa Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex arises from a tight interaction between Class-1 PEPC and distantly related 118-kDa bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC) subunits. BTPC functions as both a catalytic and regulatory subunit of the allosterically-desensitized Class-2 PEPC, which has been hypothesized to support massive PEP-flux to malate for leucoplast fatty acid synthesis. Previous studies established that BTPC: (i) subunits of COS Class-2 PEPC are subject to inhibitory phosphorylation in vivo, and (ii) at Ser425 and Ser451 within an intrinsically disordered region. This study focuses on characterization of the COS protein kinase (BTPC-K) that phosphorylates BTPC at Ser451. BTPC-K, having a native molecular mass of 63 kDa, was purified ~500-fold from developing COS endosperm. Its activity was absolutely dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ (Ka= 2.7 μM) and millimolar Mg2+. BTPC-K phosphorylated BTPC subunits of Class-2 PEPC strictly at Ser451 (Km= 1.1 μM), as well as histone type III-S (Km= 1.7 μM), but did not phosphorylate a BTPC S451D phosphomimetic mutant, native COS PTPC or sucrose synthase, or α-casein. BTPC-K displayed a broad pH-activity optima of pH 7.3, a Km for Mg2+-ATP of 6.6 μM, and marked inhibition by 3-P-glycerate and PEP. The possible control of BTPC-K by disulfide-dithiol interconversion was suggested by its rapid inactivation and subsequent reactivation when incubated with oxidized glutathione and then dithiothreitol. BTPC-K activity was insensitive to exogenous calmodulin, but potently inhibited by 100 µM trifluoperazine (a calmodulin antagonist). BTPC-K-mediated Ser451 phosphorylation of BTPC subunits of Class-2 PEPC inhibited BTPC activity by ~50% when assayed under suboptimal conditions (pH 7.3, 1 mM PEP with 10 mM L-malate). Overall the results of this study have led to the hypothesis that in vivo phosphorylation of COS BTPC at Ser451 is mediated by a dedicated calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK).</description>

   <description>Hybridization between species has the potential to exert pleiotropic effects on metabolism. Reduced fitness in hybrids may arise through incompatibilities between nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the enzyme complexes of oxidative phosphorylation. In my thesis, I examined metabolic properties and hypoxia tolerance of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus), and their unidirectional F1 hybrids (male bluegill x female pumpkinseed). Electron transport system (ETS) complex activities were examined in isolated mitochondria of bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrids. The specific activities (units per mg mitochondrial protein) of complexes I, II, and V were indistinguishable between groups; however, both complex III and IV showed indications of depressed activities in hybrid mitochondria. The nature of sequence differences in complex IV catalytic subunits (CO1, CO2, CO3) were minor, however the mtDNA-encoded subunit of complex III (cytochrome b) showed 8 differences between bluegill and pumpkinseed, several of which could have structural consequences to the multimeric enzyme and contribute to the depressed complex III catalytic activity in hybrids. I next examined hypoxia tolerance in bluegill, pumpkinseed and hybrids to see if metabolic disruption in hybrids would lead to a reduced ability to cope with this stress. Though no difference in critical oxygen concentration (Pcrit) was noted, the time to loss of equilibrium (LOE) in 0.8 mg O2 /ml suggests that hybrids and bluegills have a lower hypoxia tolerance than pumpkinseeds. Hybrids showed a unique independence between size and LOE time. Analysis of tissue metabolite levels during normoxia, after LOE, and after a short-term hypoxia exposure suggest that differences in hypoxia tolerance are not due to differences in starting metabolite levels or differential metabolite use during hypoxia exposure.</description>

   <description>Global citizenship education is becoming increasingly appreciated in Ontario as an important component of formal schooling. Although all disciplinary areas have a role to play in global citizenship education, geography, which is primarily concerned with the study of people, places, and environments at home and around the world, provides an especially important context in which to foster the values and attitudes often cited as important for global citizenship. The purpose of this qualitative study is to describe how seven secondary students in the province of Ontario make meaning of global citizenship through geography education. More specifically, this study investigates the way that Grade 12 students, who had recently completed the course titled, “Canadian and World Issues: A Geographic Analysis”, conceive of the concept of global citizenship, value its importance, and experienced its values within this course.  Qualitative data was collected through an analysis of the course curriculum and though interviews with seven students.  The interviews revealed four themes that were most apparent in how the students conceptualized global citizenship: global awareness, belonging, caring, and commitment to action.  It was revealed that the students’ personal involvement with the issues being studied helped them learn to be global citizens, as did the rich discussions of global issues they experienced in class.  Careful analysis of both the students’ conceptions of global citizenship and how they experienced global citizenship in the curriculum revealed an uncritical perspective – one which emphasizes acts of charity and volunteerism rather than a commitment to social justice.  In examining the participants’ perceptions of the value of global citizenship education as part of the curriculum, it was clear participants felt this was an important feature of geography education. In fact, since their perception was that they experienced global citizenship in this course exclusively, they attributed great value to the course and to geography education more generally. Overall, the findings are valuable to both teachers and teacher candidates seeking to better engage their students in global issues and equip them with global thinking strategies, and to curriculum developers wishing to effectively incorporate issues and topics concerning global citizenship within school curricula.</description>

   <description>In the emerging field of knowledge translation (KT) evaluation is typically assigned the role of quality control, constructing judgments about the merit and worth of knowledge translation activities. To date however, there has been little, if any, record of attempts to use evaluation to facilitate knowledge translation. The purpose of this research was to examine the potential role of evaluation as a mechanism for integrated knowledge translation (IKT). &#xd;
	This study was completed in two phases and employed a prospective multiple methods case study design. Phase one explored the context of primary care, the setting in which phase two was conducted. Phase two involved the implementation of an evaluation designed to facilitate knowledge translation; an evaluation of a Memory Clinic within a primary care setting in Ontario, Canada served as the case. The evaluation was participatory and used intentional strategies to support knowledge translation. A framework from the evaluation literature, Pathways of Influence, was used to examine the influence of the evaluation at the level of the individual, interpersonal and collective. &#xd;
	This research provides the first known description of a KT-informed evaluation. At the level of the individual, a KT-informed evaluation influenced the individuals’ knowledge about the program, attitudes towards practice-based knowledge and clinical practices and processes.  At the team/interpersonal level the evaluation was seen to influence the team’s social norms, supporting the team in thinking beyond their disciplinary boundaries and to develop a shared vision and common language. The evaluation did not have influence at the level of the broader organization, however had diffuse impact on two external organizations.  Results of this study suggest that adding knowledge translation to the repertoire of evaluation purposes is a natural extension of the field.&#xd;
	 Integrated knowledge translation is designed to engage individuals in the synthesis, exchange and ethically sound application of knowledge and the results of this study demonstrate that a collaborative evaluation approach promotes this interest in a potentially powerful way.</description>

   <title>The Exclusionary Rule in Canada: Trends and Future Directions</title>

   <description>The purpose of the research work outlined in this thesis is to determine what impact the new test for exclusion developed in Grant and Harrison has had on exclusionary trends in Canada, to assess this new three-factor approach and to provide recommendations for improvement. To this end, I conducted an empirical survey of section 24(2) cases rendered in 2012 across Canada. Based on the results of this survey, I describe the current trends for exclusion in relation to the three lines of inquiry and the Charter right at issue. I also examine the application of the test to varying types of evidence. The survey found a high rate of exclusion in the 73% range.&#xd;
&#xd;
The survey results show that developing trends do not match the predictions made by the SCC in Grant about how exclusion would operate in relation to different types of evidence. For example, there was a higher than expected rate of exclusion for breath sample results. Moreover, there was a low exclusion rate for guns as compared to the high exclusion rate for other types of non-bodily physical evidence. The rate of exclusion for section 10(b) breaches was lower than expected given the importance of the Charter interests that section 10(b) protects. &#xd;
&#xd;
The Grant rationale and the discretionary approach to exclusion are, in my view, generally satisfactory. However the test could be improved. As regards the first Grant factor, there was considerable variation in the assessment of the seriousness of the violation given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry. For greater consistency and transparency, the test, in future, should not incorporate the good faith doctrine. Police conduct should be assessed on the basis on a scale of intentionality ranging from negligent to deliberate conduct, rather than the current process of labeling police conduct as good or bad faith. Moreover, the doctrine of discoverability should be abandoned. The focus should be placed on the events that actually occurred rather than on whether police could have obtained the evidence by legal means.</description>

   <description>Contemporary Western feminist scholarship fails to explore the backdrop to the naturalization of feminine subjugation.  By analyzing the structures, histories, and theories of gender relations, this study dislocates femininity from its ascribed Otherness and, in doing so, demonstrates how empowered femininities have been overlooked or rendered invisible within gender studies.  Femme, as the failure or refusal to approximate the patriarchal norms of femininity, serves as the conceptual anchor of this study and is used to examine how femmephobic sentiments are constructed and perpetuated in contemporary Western feminist theory.  In part, this perpetuation is achieved through the pedagogical and theoretical exclusions from the texts chosen for gender studies courses, revealing a normative feminist body constructed through the privileging of identities and expressions.  Privileging of identities is demonstrated through the designation of literary space and in an overview of dominant theories, such as how the feminine subject is maintained as the object of critique and as not able to be “properly” feminist. This assessment of gender studies course texts reveals a limited understanding of femme and femininity that maintains these identities as white, middle-class, normatively bodied, and without agency.  Feminist theory demonstrates an embedded normative feminist subject, one marked by whiteness and body privileges.  By deconstructing the privileging of theories of the normative feminist subject, this study argues that gender studies has replicated feminist histories in which the politics and concerns of the white socially privileged subject are the first to be addressed.  While white femininity is present in hir Otherness and in critiques of hir femininity, the racially marked femme does not exist, even in absence.  The femme—as a queer potentiality—offers a way of thinking and re-thinking through the limitations of contemporary Western feminist theory and the paradoxical preoccupations with the absented femme.</description>

   <description>Duplications and changes made on code segments by developers form code clones. Cloned code segments are exactly the same or have a particular similarity. A set of cloned code segments that have the same similarity with each other become a clone group. A clone genealogy contains several clone groups in different revisions and time periods. Based on different textual similarities, there are three clone types, i.e., Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. Clone mutation contains the changes of clone types in the clone evolutions. Clone migration is known as moving cloned code segment to another location in the software system.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we build clone genealogies by clone groups in two empirical studies. We conduct two studies on clone migration and clone mutation in clone genealogies. We use three large open source software systems in both studies.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the first study, we investigate if the fault-proneness of clone genealogies is affected by different patterns of clone mutation and different evolution patterns of distances among clones in clone groups. We conclude that clone groups mutated between Type-1 and Type-2 and between Type-1 and Type-3 clones have higher risk for faults. We find that modifying the location of a clone increases its risk for faults.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second study, we study if the fault-proneness of migrated clones is affected by clone mutation with different changes on clone types. We examine if the length of time interval between clone migration and the last change of the cloned code has an impact on the faultiness of migrated clones. Our results show that the clone migration associated with clone mutation is more fault-prone than the clone migration without clone mutation. We find that a longer time interval between clone migration and the last change makes the migrated clones more fault-prone.</description>

   <description>The t(1;19) chromosomal translocation is present in 5% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and leads to expression of the oncogenic transcription factor, E2A-PBX1. Although t(1;19) is exclusively associated with pre-B ALL in clinical cases, murine models produce myeloid or T-lymphoid leukemias, which are not representative of the clinical disease. In this work, we have advanced progress towards the development an E2A-PBX1-driven experimental leukemia model. We initially determined that lineage-negative (lin-) hematopoietic progenitors expressing E2A-PBX1 expression fail to repopulate the B-lymphoid lineage when transplanted into irradiated recipient mice. Furthermore, E2A-PBX1 expressing, lin- fetal liver progenitors (FLPs) fail to differentiate into B-lymphocytes ex vivo. The majority of E2A-PBX1-expressing FLPs manifested an immature phenotype and displayed stem cell factor (SCF)-dependency and enhanced self-renewal. Additionally, these cells retained myeloid potential upon transplantation or stimulation with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). DNA binding was required for the differentiation block, suggesting that E2A-PBX1 target genes are incompatible with B-lineage specification. E2A-PBX1 FLPs had a stem cell like gene expression profile, including up-regulation of the leukemic transcription factors, Hoxa9 and Meis1. These findings explain why E2A-PBX1-driven bone marrow transplant models fail to generate B-lymphoid disease and suggest that future efforts in developing a model of E2A-PBX1-driven pre-B ALL leukemia should focus on expressing E2A-PBX1 subsequent to B-lymphoid commitment.&#xd;
In an attempt to override the B-lymphoid differentiation block, we next expressed E2A-PBX1 in primary pre-B cells. E2A-PBX1 induced an apoptotic response in pre-B cells, which was consistent with previous observations. Since pre-B ALL induction requires secondary genetic events, we attempted to abrogate these E2A-PBX1-mediated effects by modulating expression of the Cdkn2a locus. Loss of Cdkn2a through deletion or Bmi1 overexpression failed to ameliorate the apoptotic response, suggesting that E2A-PBX1 mediated apoptosis occurs independently of Cdkn2a in murine pre-B cells. However, in the absence of Cdkn2a, co-expression of constitutively active MerTK or Ras attenuated the E2A-PBX1 mediated apoptosis. &#xd;
Cumulatively, these results support the notion that t(1;19) occurs subsequent to B-lymphoid commitment and requires multiple secondary genetic lesions. Data presented in this thesis represents crucial initiating steps towards the development of a pre-B ALL model mediated by E2A-PBX1.</description>

   <description>Mobile service provisioning is intended to serve interoperable functionality from mobile devices over the network.  The mobile service paradigm shifts the role of mobile devices from consumers to providers, opening up new opportunities for a multitude of collaborative services and applications ranging from sharing personal information to collaborative participatory sensing. Although many basic principles of the standard Web service approach continue to apply, the inherent limitations of mobile devices and broadband wireless access render the deployment of standard architectures in mobile environments inefficient. This research introduces two concepts that revolutionize mobile service provisioning: personal and cloud-assisted service provisioning. Personal services are intended to offer a range of user-centric data services to a limited set of consumers that are explicitly authorized by the user providing the service. Personal services facilitate prevailing trends such as social networking and mobile healthcare services, without compromising personal privacy. Cloud-assisted service provisioning bridges the gap between limited resources of mobile devices and increasing resource demands of mobile applications. This approach provides reliable and efficient mobile services, while alleviating the burden on limited mobile resources. Both approaches take advantage of the device's mobility and real time access to various context information. Experimental results reveal that personal services offer personalization based on the user's context and preferences, while cloud-assisted service provisioning, in addition to optimizing the consumption of mobile scarce resources, offers significant improvement to the reliability and availability of mobile services.</description>

   <description>The objective of my MSc thesis is to study the self-assembly process of macrocyclic complexes, as well as the properties that affect the obtained supramolecular architectures. The possibility of substrate recognition within the cavity of these complexes is also of interest. Preparation of three new ligands based on the triazole-pyridine chelating units connected through variable spacer groups, as well as the complexes formed with octahedral metal ions, are described herein.  &#xd;
The first ligand contained a naphthalene spacer region, which was longer than the previously examined xylene spacer. This extension increases the distance between metal ions in the complex, as well as the size of the cavity. More work is required to obtain the unsaturated double-stranded complex, which could potentially bind substrate molecules within its cavity. The triple-stranded saturated complexes with [Fe(H2O)6](BF4)2 and [Ni(H2O)6](BF4)2 both gave insight into the process of self-assembly.&#xd;
The next two ligands were designed to probe the effect that increasing the length of an aliphatic spacer had on complex self-assembly. Both ethyl and propyl spacer units had been previously studied, so butyl and pentyl spacer groups were the natural next step to analyze. The length of the alkyl spacer was found to be very important in the nature of the obtained complex. As the length of the alkyl chain, and the corresponding flexibility increased, so too did the complexity of the resulting supramolecular architectures.</description>

   <description>In these experiments, we primarily investigate the role and source of nerve growth factor (NGF) in peripheral tissues undergoing chronic inflammation.  It has been previously determined that there is a significant increase in the levels of NGF following prolonged inflammation of the urinary bladder or the colon, and the first of two projects discussed here mimics this increase with transgenic mice which ectopically produce NGF under control of the smooth muscle alpha-actin promoter.   It was determined by this increase that a p75-sensitive increase in sympathetic innervation occurs when an abundance of NGF is produced locally in the descending colon.  Sensory innervation in the colon was found to come from two unique populations, one of which increased following heightened NGF levels.  The urinary bladders of NGF overexpressing mice were determined to have an increase in sensory axonal density.  The second project described here features chemically induced colonic inflammation and observes the nervous and growth factor changes as a response.  Transgenic reporter mice are used to observe the cellular source of NGF in the descending colon, which unexpectedly was determined to be Dogiel type II (DgII neurons) based on morphological and chemical characteristics.  We report the increase in NGF mRNA and protein observed following a brief 5-day colonic inflammation, and note that there is no increase in axonal density observed.  The chemical inflammation did, however, induce an increase in axonal varicosities, used as a measure of axon damage.  Finally, a heterozygous null-mutation of NGF was made in a line of transgenic mice to observe changes in local sensory neurons, sympathetic innervation or NGF protein production, but no differences between the heterozygous null mutants and age-matched wild-type siblings were observed.</description>

   <description>Childhood adversity is often associated with devastating physical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes, and is a major public health problem in terms of its prevalence and economic cost. Childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for psychopathology, as well as with dysregulation of the neurobiological stress response. An additional factor known to alter neuroendocrine functioning and increase psychopathology risk is polymorphisms within the FKBP5 gene. The goal of the current study was to examine the gene-environment interaction of childhood adversity and variation in the FKBP5 gene on the cortisol response to a psychosocial stress task (i.e., the Trier Social Stress Test). The final sample consisted of 90 depressed and non-depressed adolescents and young adults (11 - 21 years). Childhood adversity was assessed using the Childhood Experience and Abuse Scale (CECA; Bifulco et al., 1994), and was defined as the presence versus absence prior to 18 years of age of severe physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect, witness to domestic discord/violence, or peer-perpetrated bullying. Participants were genotyped at the rs1360780 site of the FKBP5 gene and grouped according to whether they had at least one risk T allele (i.e., TT or TC genotype versus the CC genotype). Controlling for depression and anxiety psychopathology, I found a significant interaction of FKBP5 and childhood adversity status such that individuals with the FKBP5 risk allele (i.e., TT or TC genotype) and a history of childhood adversity showed a distinct cortisol response pattern characterized by decreasing cortisol from baseline and less cortisol output compared to individuals without childhood adversity. This relationship was specific to the experience of severe adversity and appeared to be strongest when adversity was defined as witnessing domestic discord/violence. These results are consistent with a diathesis-stress model in which the FKBP5 risk allele leaves individuals vulnerable to neurobiological dysregulation in the face of severe adverse experience in childhood. The implications of this research for understanding stress-related psychopathology and the limitations of this gene-environment interaction design are discussed.</description>

   <description>In image-guided surgical navigation, instruments tools are tracked by a position sensor and their locations rendered along with the patient's anatomy. Conventional methods require an invasive, time-consuming and potentially uncertain process of intra-operative registration of the images to the patient. In a direct navigation system, such an intra-operative registration is replaced with pre-operative patient-independent calibration in a process that determines the relationship between the coordinate frame of imaging equipment and the coordinate frame of the position sensor.&#xd;
&#xd;
This dissertation presents a method for pre-operatively calibrating a direct navigation system that used an optical position sensor and a mobile gantry CT scanner. A custom bi-local calibration device was designed and manufactured, after which existing navigation software was augmented with components that used the pre-operatively determined transformation to provide image-guided surgical navigation. The resulting system was tested in an image-guided operating suite using plastic bone models. In the validation stage, the inherent error was less than 0.4 mm and the target registration error was approximately 1.6 mm for a ceiling-mounted position sensor and 0.7 mm for a portable position sensor.  This accuracy is consistent with the best intra-operative registrations reported in the literature and this calibration method may be useful in future surgical systems.</description>

   <description>This dissertation contributes to the existing literature on aging and health in human geography by exploring the relationships among homelessness, stable housing, and opportunities for healthy aging. Over the last 30 years, various social, economic, spatial, and political trends have reshaped Canadian society. These trends have resulted in a more complex, individualized life course in the 21st century, characterized by a greater number of delays and divergences as people adapt to the societal changes that have unfolded. Outcomes of such trends have been increasing rates of household financial problems, a greater incidence of absolute poverty, and growth in the homeless population. At the same time, Canada is undergoing demographic changes as the population ages and by 2030, it is estimated that approximately 25 percent of Canada’s population will be 65 years of age or older (Moore and Rosenberg, 2001). In this context, it is likely a greater proportion of the older population will have experienced homelessness in their life compared to previous generations (McDonald et al., 2006). Presently, academic research and public policy have failed to consider how people with histories of homelessness will fare in older age.&#xd;
This dissertation addresses this unexplored area of research through the achievement of three broad objectives. First, the research contributes an original conceptualization of the long-term effects of homelessness on health and aging. Second, it explores how stable housing can improve homeless people’s opportunities for healthy aging. Third, the research provides a better understanding of how being homeless in earlier life can affect experiences of health and aging in later stages of the life course. The fieldwork to achieve these goals involved a structured survey (N=50) and interviews (n=29) with a sample of formerly homeless older people in Toronto, Canada. The findings reveal that older people with histories of homelessness are aging in a more disadvantaged context than the general older population. Various aspects of stable housing can improve health and offer a better opportunity for positive experiences of aging. However, formerly homeless people continue to face barriers to affordable, quality housing and other determinants of a healthy lifestyle in older age.</description>

   <description>Inconel alloys are commonly used as structural materials in nuclear reactors. One of these alloys, the Inconel X-750, is a γ’ Ni3(Al, Ti) strengthened superalloy extensively used in the cores of reactors, such as spacers in CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) fuel channels. Prior to their application in commercial reactors, accelerated irradiation tests had been conducted in liquid metal fast reactors. Results did not indicate any problem stemming from significant fast neutron irradiation. However, recently it has been found that the ex-service CANDU Inconel X-750 spacers became severely brittle after a lengthy exposure to reactor environment. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and thus forms the focus of this current investigation, predominantly through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This dissertation unfolds with the literature review in Chapter 2, followed by presentation of novel techniques in Chapter 3 on the preparation of TEM samples from small reactor components, namely the spacers. Chapter 4 presents TEM characterizations of ex-service spacers removed from the reactors. To simulate neutron irradiation over wide temperature range in an effort to understand the damage mechanisms, heavy ion irradiations were conducted and reported in Chapter 5 and 6. Irradiations are found to significantly alter the stability of the primary strengthening phase γ’, a systematic experimental study of which is presented in Chapter 7. To fully understand the effects of transmutation produced helium on irradiation induced cavity and dislocation microstructures, TEM in-situ heavy ion irradiations with hot/cold pre-injected helium were conducted and reported in Chapter 8 and 9. Helium was found to play an important role in the irradiation-induced instability of γ’ in nickel-based superalloys, the discussion of which is presented in Chapter 10. As one of the most important defect structures induced from irradiation, the stacking-fault-tetrahedra, were dynamically observed and are described in a journal manuscript in Appendix A. In addition to broadening current understanding of material degradation mechanism for in-service CANDU spacer, this study also provides comprehensive information on irradiation damage in nickel based superalloys, irradiation induced lattice defects and phase instability in face centered cubic alloys, as well as helium’s effects on cavity formation, dislocation evolution, and phase transformation.</description>

   <description>The production of ATP is of the utmost importance to cell survival.  To maintain energy homeostasis, cells regulate mitochondrial content through the control of degradative and synthetic processes. Mitochondrial biogenesis is primarily controlled through a small number of transcriptional regulators, primarily nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), NRF-2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). DNA-binding proteins regulate genes encoding the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation.  In addition to these DNA-binding proteins, the coactivator PPAR gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) is central to control of mitochondrial genes, so much so that it has been dubbed a “master controller” of energy homeostasis in mammalian muscle tissues. Though well studied in mammals, previous studies suggest that this NRF-1-PGC1α axis may be disrupted in fish. The response to treatments such as temperature and diet cause reciprocal effects on NRF-1 and PGC-1α. A serine-rich insertion into the NRF-1 binding domain of PGC-1α most likely disrupts this interaction. &#xd;
	In this study I looked at the ability for the goldfish PGC-1α gene to interact with the PGC-1α binding domain of NRF-1. I have found that goldfish PGC-1α does not physically bind NRF-1, which would suggest that the PGC-1α-NRF-1 axis in fish is disrupted. To further explore the role of PGC-1α in fish we looked at the role of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) to phosphorylate goldfish, zebrafish, and human PGC-1α. The results from this analysis show that AMPK in a zebrafish embryonic cell line (ZEB2J) have their AMPK activated by the AMPK activator AICAR. This response was shown to be both dose and time dependent. Transcript data was generated looking at typical AMPK responsive targets in the mammalian system. The target of ramapamycin (TOR) gene responded with a decrease as is expected in mammals. Hexokinase 2 (HK2), PGC-1α, and NRF-1 all decreased which is opposite of the typical mammalian response. COX7C a downstream target of the PGC-1α-NRF-1 axis did not respond to treatment. Indicating a disruption in the AMPK- PGC-1α-NRF-1 pathway.</description>

   <description>Post-secondary education is an aspiration for many students; however, students with intellectual disabilities are provided few opportunities to pursue this dream.  Current practices in the Ontario system of education frequently segregate and exclude students with intellectual disabilities from participation in the educational opportunities that are provided to non-disabled students.  These educational practices ultimately limit opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities, and as such, fail to provide sufficient credentials to these students so they can participate in post-secondary education or employment.  In recent years, alternative routes through post-secondary education across Canada, and in Ontario, have been emerging for students with intellectual disabilities.  Yet, these opportunities are not enshrined in government policies or post-secondary practice, and are only provided at the discretion of a handful of post-secondary institutions across Ontario.  The purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of the inclusive post-secondary education experience from the perspectives of students who were participating in inclusive college programs in Ontario.  Seven participants were recruited from two colleges in Ontario that provide an inclusive post-secondary experience for students with intellectual disabilities.  Through a disability studies framework, a qualitative phenomenological methodology was employed in this study to empower the participants to share their stories and hear their voices.  Three in-depth individual interviews using photo-elicitation were used to invite participants to offer a rich, detailed, first-person account of their experiences in inclusive post-secondary education.  Each participant’s unique story of their college experience is highlighted as a Student Portrait.  The main themes that emerged from the participants combined experiences were academic growth and development, interpersonal relationships and social networks, career development and employment potential, and self-determination.  Findings from this study provide evidence of the positive outcomes of participation in post-secondary education for students with intellectual disabilities, including an anticipated positive impact that would extend well into the futures of each participant.  This study highlights the need for post-secondary education reform to increase such opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities.</description>

   <description>One common vector of malware is JavaScript in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files. In this thesis, we investigate using near-miss clone detectors to find this malware. We start by collecting a set of PDF files containing JavaScript malware and a set with clean JavaScript from the VirusTotal repository. We use the NiCad clone detector to find the classes of clones in a small subset of the malicious PDF files. We evaluate how clone classes can be used to find similar malicious files in the rest of the malicious collection while avoiding files in the benign collection. Our results show that a 10% subset training set produced 75% detection of previously known malware with 0% false positives. We also used the NiCad as a pattern matcher for reflexive calls common in JavaScript malware. Our results show a 57% detection of malicious collection with no false positives. When the two experiments’ results are combined, the total coverage of malware rises to 85% and maintains 100% precision. The results are heavily affected by the third-party PDF to JavaScript extractor used. When only successfully extracted PDFs are considered, recall increases to 99% and precision remains at 100%.</description>

   <description>Inconel alloys are commonly used as structural materials in nuclear reactors. One of these alloys, the Inconel X-750, is a γ’ Ni3(Al, Ti) strengthened superalloy extensively used in the cores of reactors, such as spacers in CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) fuel channels. Prior to their application in commercial reactors, accelerated irradiation tests had been conducted in liquid metal fast reactors. Results did not indicate any problem stemming from significant fast neutron irradiation. However, recently it has been found that the ex-service CANDU Inconel X-750 spacers became severely brittle after a lengthy exposure to reactor environment. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and thus forms the focus of this current investigation, predominantly through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This dissertation unfolds with the literature review in Chapter 2, followed by presentation of novel techniques in Chapter 3 on the preparation of TEM samples from small reactor components, namely the spacers. Chapter 4 presents TEM characterizations of ex-service spacers removed from the reactors. To simulate neutron irradiation over wide temperature range in an effort to understand the damage mechanisms, heavy ion irradiations were conducted and reported in Chapter 5 and 6. Irradiations are found to significantly alter the stability of the primary strengthening phase γ’, a systematic experimental study of which is presented in Chapter 7. To fully understand the effects of transmutation produced helium on irradiation induced cavity and dislocation microstructures, TEM in-situ heavy ion irradiations with hot/cold pre-injected helium were conducted and reported in Chapter 8 and 9. Helium was found to play an important role in the irradiation-induced instability of γ’ in nickel-based superalloys, the discussion of which is presented in Chapter 10. As one of the most important defect structures induced from irradiation, the stacking-fault-tetrahedra, were dynamically observed and are described in a journal manuscript in Appendix A. In addition to broadening current understanding of material degradation mechanism for in-service CANDU spacer, this study also provides comprehensive information on irradiation damage in nickel based superalloys, irradiation induced lattice defects and phase instability in face centered cubic alloys, as well as helium’s effects on cavity formation, dislocation evolution, and phase transformation.</description>

   <description>Software components are meant to be reusable and flexible by design. These characteristics and others continue attracting software developers to adapt a component (typically designed elsewhere) into their systems. However, software components are also vulnerable to reliability and security problems due to existence of non-obvious faults. We believe that a systematic approach to detect failures of a component and prioritize components using such failures can help developers decide on appropriate solutions to improve reliability. In this thesis, we present a framework that can help developers in detecting and ranking component failures systematically so that more reliable software can be achieved. Our proposed framework can allow monitoring critical components within a system under instrumentation, detecting failures based on specifications and using failure data and input from developers to rank the components. The proposed approach provides information for developers who could decide if the reliability could be improved by trivial code modification or require advanced reliability techniques. A prototype is designed along with a number of failure scenarios to detect specific failure types within a component. Four major failure types (value, timing, commission, and omission) are detected and used to rank software components. We conducted an experimental evaluation using two subject systems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework and to measure its performance overhead. Our experimental results show that the approach can benefit system developers by prioritizing components for effective maintenance with a minimal overhead.</description>

   <description>Indigenous societies discuss the importance of Mother Earth for their well-being and many are working to regain control of their lands and waters and how they are used. Critically, many state that land access strengthens culture and traditional (ecological) knowledge. In this research I tried to determine if the reality reflects the rhetoric, looking particularly at how the concepts of economic development and traditional knowledge interact with each other, and impact Indigenous resource management. The case study focused on the Nova Scotia Mi’kmaq, examining the process of management implementation at a macro level. Sixteen semi-structured interviews took place in nine of thirteen communities. The results illustrated that economic development is necessary for Mi’kmaq sustainability and community sustenance, but also economic development is a needed political tool to gain power with the state. Further, traditional knowledge is connected to land management. With the loss of this knowledge due to colonialism and a greater influence of mainstream western liberal thought, respect for the land is reduced and this impacts Indigenous resource management practices. These factors also negatively impact relations between individuals and within the community as a whole. For true (Mi’kmaq) sustainability, resource management strategies should be based on Mi’kmaq values and practices and be wary of capitalist tendencies.</description>

   <description>The Jurassic Tilje Formation located on the Norwegian continental shelf contains many thick (>10 mm) and macroscopically homogenous mudstone layers. These mudstone layers are interpreted to have accumulated rapidly from “fluid-mud,” a highly concentrated aqueous suspension of fine-grained sediment. Fluid muds in the Tilje are recognized in tidal-fluvial channel, mouth-bar and distal delta-front environments. From detailed thin-section work it is clear that these mudstone layers are not homogenous. Three facies are observed: unstratified mudstone (UM), some of which contain “floating” coarse grains, planar-laminated mudstone (PLM) and cross-laminated mudstone (CLM). Each facies represents deposition at differing suspended-sediment concentrations (SSC) (UM−high SSC, PLM−low-moderate SSC and CLM−low SSC).&#xd;
The thickest mudstone layers are always associated with underlying dune-scale cross-bedding, which has led to a proposed model where fluid mud can accumulate and is protected from the over-riding flow in the troughs of large dunes. This model is most relevant to tidal-fluvial channels where large dunes occur in the deepest water and in terminal distributary channels in mouth bars.&#xd;
The vertical stacking of facies within a single mudstone layer allows reconstruction of changes of the near-bed SSC values and current velocities that reflect deceleration and acceleration of the tidal currents over the tidal cycle or waning wave energy following a storm. Based on repeating patters termed “vertical successions” and “succession combinations,” individual tidal cycles can be observed within single mudstone layers and the relative strength of subordinate and dominant currents can be&#xd;
ii&#xd;
inferred.&#xd;
To aide in the understanding of how mud can accumulate over the complete range of SSCs, current velocities and grain sizes, a preliminary three-dimensional bedform phase diagram has been constructed for fine-grained sediment based on recent flumes studies. The phase diagram can be applied to mudrocks beyond the Tilje Formation.</description>

   <description>The “seeds of disease” theory that emerged in Europe during the Renaissance period was not an entirely novel concept at the time.  Humans were aware of the contagious properties of certain afflictions long before it was possible for them to observe the microorganisms responsible for disease transmission, and ancient authors had already speculated about the existence of imperceptible creatures as a cause of illness.  This thesis will show that through ancient literary works of every type permeates the recognition of disease contagion not only between humans, but also between animals of the same species, animals of different species and between humans and animals.  Chapter One will examine cases of intra-species infection, beginning with those that do not specify precisely the manner in which the illness in question is passed from one being to another.  Instances in which particular factors are noted as contributing to the spread of disease will also be presented, followed by examples highlighting the recognition of intra-species infection in animals.  Chapter Two will address the three varieties of inter-species infection of which ancient people were evidently aware: zoonosis, anthroponosis, and xenoosis.  Chapter Three will explore the prevalent belief among the ancients that uninterred corpses incited pestilences.  Chapter Four will discuss ancient views concerning the contamination of drinking water, as well as cases of deliberate infection with disease— ancient precursors to bioterrorism.  Chapter Five will feature numerous theories of ancient authors regarding the presence of disease-causing microorganisms in the air.  A variety of literary evidence will be examined throughout this paper and will prove that there was indeed a pervasive knowledge of disease contagion in the ancient world.</description>

   <description>Children’s rapid word learning skills has been the focus of many studies over the last three decades. These studies indicated that children are not only expert word learners, but they are also very selective when learning new words (Sabbagh &amp; Henderson, 2013). Although many studies have shown children’s selectivity when learning words, still little is known about the motives behind children’s selectivity or the mechanisms by which this selectivity works. The major aim of the present dissertation is to advance the current understanding on children’s selective learning. In four studies, we explored whether preschoolers would learn new words or facts from speakers who violated a familiar non-linguistic socio-cultural convention. In Study 1, thirty-six 4-year-olds heard novel words either from a boy puppet who wore a skirt or a boy puppet who wore pants. When then tested for their memory of the words, children who heard the words from the skirt-wearing boy puppet were less likely to produce and remember the word-referent link after a brief delay. Study 2 showed that children learned new words from a skirt-wearing boy puppet equally well when the puppets presented the words slowly; thereby suggesting that violation of a well-established socio-cultural convention affects children’s learning especially under high cognitive load. By replicating the design of Study 1, Study 3 showed that children learned new words from a skirt-wearing boy puppet when the boy puppet gave an excuse for wearing the skirt, suggesting that it was the conventional violation and not simply the anomaly of a skirt-wearing boy that affected children’s learning in Study 1. Study 4 showed that children’s bias against learning from the skirt-wearing boy puppet did not extend to facts about the origins of the toys. Taken together, these results suggested that when acquiring conventional knowledge in learning situations in which their processing capacities are taxed, young children show selective learning from a speaker who follows the socio-cultural conventions of their community.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the use of two coupled loops as an alternative method of connection for high frequency signals between passive elements on microwave laminates and integrated circuits; replacing traditional interconnect methods such as wire bonds and solder bumps which require costly back end of line processing. The loops harness both electric and magnetic fields in order to create the interconnection, and can be placed around the perimeter of the IC; here they do not interfere with placement of the existing electronics on the chip, or occupy space which may be required for large components such as spiral inductors.&#xd;
A parametric model for these coupled loops was developed in this thesis. This model allows for rapid initial dimension choice when provided a variety of different parameters such as the IC process geometry, and loop stack geometry. Once initial dimensions are obtained from the model, full-wave simulation can be used to finalize the design and examine effects of process design rules such as metal density requirements.&#xd;
Following model development a prototype system, consisting of a two metallic loops (one located on a low-loss microwave laminate, the other on a 0.13 u m CMOS IC), was fabricated. These loops were then stacked in order to couple the signal from a planar antenna array (printed on the laminate) onto the IC. This antenna-to-chip system was simulated and measured to have center frequencies of 25 GHz and 23 GHz respectively, with a peak gain greater than 5 dBi at the beams broadside (8 dBi in simulation). These results agree quite well, with discrepancies arising primarily from the presence of adhesive between the loops. This adhesive wicked underneath the IC during assembly, which was not accounted for during simulation, but can easily be done so. The radiation pattern from the antenna was measured to have a HPBW of 16 degrees  in the elevation plane and 100  degrees in the azimuth plane. These correspond nicely with simulated results and produce a suitable system for automotive radar application; where harsh environments present difficulties to current interconnects such as wire bonds.</description>

   <title>Evaluating the Role of the Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 UL21 Protein in Early and Late Events of the Viral Replication Cycle</title>

   <description>The herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) UL21 protein is conserved between all members of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although UL21 is essential for virus propagation in HSV-2, its function in viral replication is poorly understood. Cells infected with HSV-2 strains lacking UL21 exhibit an approximate two-hour delay in viral gene expression that cannot be explained by a defect in virus entry or capsid engagement with, or movement along, microtubules. However, we noted a defect in the ability of UL21 knockout (KO21) capsids to associate with the nucleus after infection. We found that the delay in viral gene expression was not directly due to the absence of UL21 insofar as cells stably expressing UL21 could not complement the delay in gene expression. We suggest that the KO21 delay in gene expression is due to alterations in virion composition and that in the absence of UL21, a key virion component required for the timely delivery of capsids to the nucleus fails to be packaged into virions. Interestingly, at late times after infection, levels of viral proteins in KO21 infected cells reach wild-type levels, indicating that a secondary function is responsible for the essential nature of UL21. We found that at late times post-infection KO21 infected cells accumulated capsids in the nucleus but these fail to reach the cytoplasm and mature into infectious virions. Thus, we hypothesize that the essential function of UL21 is to facilitate capsid trafficking from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Moreover, the viral glycoproteins gD and gC were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and were under-glycosylated in KO21 infected cells. It is therefore possible that the absence of UL21 prevents the targeting of glycoproteins to the inner nuclear membrane, preventing the formation or function of the nuclear egress complex.</description>

   <title>Realism and the Background of Goodman's Worldmaking</title>

   <subject>worldmaking, Goodman, realism, anti-realism, ontological relativism</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-11 13:59:52.292</description>
   <description>The work of Nelson Goodman has significantly impacted the philosophical landscape of the latter half of the twentieth century. In this thesis I critically assess Goodman’s later metaphysics, particularly his ontological relativism and multiple worlds hypothesis. I argue that, while Goodman’s view is interesting and important to philosophic thought, it critically fails as a tenable metaphysical position. This failure is twofold: first, Goodman’s argument for ontological relativism rests on the representational fallacy and is therefore unsound; and second his position, when considered as a self-standing metaphysical doctrine, is incoherent. My conclusion is that Goodman must admit some mind-independent structure of reality, otherwise his view should be rejected. However, while I do not argue for any specific form of realism, once some mind-independent structure is admitted, a general realist position becomes preferable to Goodman’s anti-realist, relativist, and constructivist view.</description>

   <description>Text messages can encourage people to carry out their plans, but it is unknown if text messages can encourage people to form plans. The primary objective of our study was to determine whether text messages could promote physical activity plan formation. We determined if text messages about planning increased planning more than text messages about physical activity. We examined whether messages tailored to suit the individual message recipient were especially effective in encouraging planning. Furthermore, we determined if planning was maintained over time. The secondary objective of the study was to determine whether text messages about planning could promote physical activity and strengthen the physical activity intention-behaviour relationship. Participants were inactive adults (n=239, Mage=30.7±4.8yrs) with access to email and text messaging. Participants received generic messages about physical activity, generic messages about planning, or tailored messages about planning. Each week for two months, participants were emailed a tool to plan their physical activity. Whether participants used this tool was assessed at baseline (T0), after one month of receiving text messages (T1) and after an additional month without text messages (T2). There were no differences in planning between groups that received messages about planning or physical activity at T1 or T2, ps>.05. More participants who received tailored text messages about planning made at least one plan by T1 than participants who received generic messages about planning, χ2(1)=3.889, p&lt;.05. This difference did not persist at T2, p>.05. For all groups, planning was maintained from T0 to T1, ps>.05, but decreased from T1 to T2, McNemars χ2(1)>17.455, ps&lt;.001. Physical activity increased over the intervention, ps&lt;.05, but there were no differences in physical activity between groups over time, ps>.05. The strength of the intention-behaviour relationship did not differ between participants who planned and those who did not, p>.05. There seems to be little advantage to sending messages about planning relative to messages about physical activity for persuading planning behaviour. Regardless of content of the messages, planning may not be sustained over time.</description>

   <description>Millions of dollars are spent annually in Canada providing school health support services (SHSS) to children with developmental delays and disabilities (DD) as an important support for inclusive education. However, there is limited information about how allied health professionals (AHP) work together with educators to integrate therapy strategies into educational programming for children with DD. This study examines the strategies AHPs, in Ontario perceived to be successful and are implementing with educators to support participation outcomes for children with DD in the primary grades. This study also describes AHPs’ vision for the future in order to improve their work practices to support participation of children with DD at school.&#xd;
Recognizing that the literature on SHSS has emphasized challenges to providing services to children with DD and collaboration with educators; this study actively employed appreciative inquiry (Preskill, &amp; Catsambas, 2006). Individual in-depth interviews with 15 AHPs (11 OTs, 1 PT, 3 SLPs) were conducted via face-to-face, telephone or video conference. Participants were asked to describe how they viewed participation at school for children with DD, their role in supporting it, the strategies they used to work with educators to support this participation and their vision for the future. &#xd;
AHPs in this study viewed participation of children with DD at school as&#xd;
 (a) being in the classroom to provide the opportunity for meaningful engagement with peers and (b) working on similar activities as peers to promote membership and belonging at school. Participants implemented their role to support participation of children with DD by providing equipment, modifying or adapting activities, educating and providing resources to educators. Successful strategies AHPs used to work with educators to facilitate participation of children with DD at school included: finding a key person, developing trust and rapport with an educator, engaging in shared planning with an educator, seeking feedback from educators about their recommendations and listening to educators regarding information about the child with a DD. AHPs also identified their vision for the future in supporting participation of children with DD. Their vision included being a resource to teachers, by consulting to a whole class and being a member of the educational team.</description>

   <description>A polygon mesh, or a 3D mesh, consisting of a collection of vertices, edges, and polygons in three-dimensional space, is the standard way of representing 3D objects. In practice, polygon meshes acquired from the 3D scanning process fail to meet the quality requirements for most practical applications. Mesh defects like holes, duplicate elements, non-manifold elements are introduced during the scanning process, which lowers the quality of the output meshes. In this thesis, we describe a complete mesh-repairing process that fixes all defects within a polygon mesh. This process is divided into two parts: the mesh-cleaning part and the hole-filling part. In the mesh-cleaning part, we describe the ways of repairing different types of mesh defects. In the hole-filling part, we discuss two main hole-filling approaches: the surface-based method and the volumetric. In addition, we present a hybrid algorithm by combining the surface-based approach and the volumetric approach. We compare the meshes created by different hole-filing algorithms and show that the new algorithm is a good alternative to the existing ones.</description>

   <description>In Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitosis is initiated when Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates Cdc2 (Cdk1) and in turn Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates mitotic targets. Cdc2 is thought to phosphorylate and further activate Cdc25, forming a positive feedback loop between the two for robust entry into mitosis. Pyp3 tyrosine phosphatase is essential in the absence of Cdc25. Its role is thought to be in directly dephosphorylating Cdc2 under these conditions. Pyp3 also presents a link between cell division and growth. It interacts physically and genetically with the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E and is thought to play the same role as mammalian 4E-binding proteins. Pyp3 has a consensus TOS motif potentially enabling nutritional input from the TOR pathway into translation regulation. Since known 4E-BPs are not phosphatases, Pyp3 may act as a 4E-binding protein independently of its phosphatase activity.&#xd;
Evolutionarily conserved Cdc2 phosphorylation sites in Cdc25 were substituted to non-phosphorylatable Ala, or to Glu as a phosphomimic. The T89E phosphomimic mutation creates an activated allele of Cdc25, cdc25-89w. It has a dominant semi-wee phenotype due to accelerated entry into mitosis. Pyp3 was mutagenized to remove the function of the phosphatase active site and also the putative TOS motif. The Pyp3 active site is essential for its role in cell cycle initiation. It is also essential for the genetic interaction with eIF4E, tif1. Removal of a putative Pyp3 TOS motif affects the Pyp3 localization to cytoplasmic foci following co-overexpression of eIF4E. Similar localization occurs in response to heat stress. These results make important contributions to the understanding of mitotic initiation, and link between cell growth and division.</description>

   <description>This thesis considers the relationship between the ontology of time and the passage of time, and concludes that the best way to understand this relationship is found in the combination of eternalism with the view that the passage of time is an objective, irreducible fact about the spatio-temporal world.  The steps I take to reach this conclusion are as follows: first, I propose that eternalism is the best ontological basis from which to consider temporal passage; second, I argue that the moving spotlight theory, which attempts to reconcile eternalism with temporal passage, is an inadequate representation of the relationship between eternalism and temporal passage; third, I suggest that temporal passage is best understood as a mind-independent phenomenon.  I argue that eternalism is preferable to presentism insofar as presentism suffers from inconsistencies that eternalism both avoids and easily solves.  I then defend the rejection of the moving spotlight theory by an appeal to the incoherency of the moving now.  Finally, I dismiss mind-dependent temporal passage in favour of mind-independent temporal passage based on the irreducibility of temporal passage in and of itself.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-13 10:51:34.585</description>
   <description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel neurotransmitter that has been shown to influence cardiovascular function as well as other autonomic and endocrine functions by targeting a wide range of ion channels. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, I have investigated the potential role of H2S in the regulation of neuronal excitability in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which is a central relay centre for autonomic and endocrine function.&#xd;
In current-clamp recordings, sodium hydrosulfide hydrate (NaHS), when perfused onto PVN slices at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 50 mM),  elicited a concentration-dependent response relationship from the majority of recorded neurons, with almost exclusively depolarizing effects. Input resistance differences from baseline, and during the NaHS-induced depolarization, uncovered a biphasic response, implicating both a potassium (K+) and non-selective cation conductance.&#xd;
In order to further investigate H2Ss effects on K+ conductances, we used both voltage- and current-clamp techniques to examine the effects of NaHS at either 1 or 10 mM on both the transient and sustained voltage-activated K+ currents in these neurons. We applied TEA+ (10 mM) to isolate the transient/rapidly inactivating current (IA) and 4-AP (5 mM) to isolate the sustained/delayed rectifier current (IK), and were able to show that both of these conductances were significantly reduced by H2S.  Finally, we were able to demonstrate, using current-clamp, that when 4-AP and TEA+ were applied together with NaHS, they were able to completely eliminate the previously observed NaHS-induced depolarization, and the effects on membrane potential reversed to show a small hyperpolarization. &#xd;
These data highlight the potential role of H2S as a critical modulator of the voltage-gated repolarizing conductances, IA and IK, which in turn regulate neuronal excitability within the PVN. This can have a large impact on the way neurotransmitters and hormones such as vasopressin, oxytocin, corticotrophin-releasing hormone, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone are released from the PVN, which influence a wide range of neuroendocrine and autonomic functions such as cardiovascular function, fluid balance, and food intake.</description>

   <title>Three Studies on Counterintuitive Effects of Organizational Status</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-13 14:12:57.107</description>
   <description>This dissertation examines some counterintuitive effects associated with having high status. Whereas much literature focuses on benefits associated with holding high status, in this dissertation, I highlight some negative outcomes that can come from having status. Study 1 examines marital costs that can emerge when women hold high job status relative to their spouses. I propose a conditional process model such that when women experience job status leakage, a construct referring to contempt that women feel towards their husbands’ lower job status, this will positively predict marital instability, mediated through decreased relationship satisfaction. The model is tested in a cross-sectional field study on women in high job status positions, and the model is supported. &#xd;
	The second study of this dissertation examines potential costs when in high status positions to CEOs longevity. I argue that despite the benefits accrued at the highest level of organizational status; CEOs will compare their status to other CEOs, which influences their longevity. Using a retrospective cohort analysis on award winners from Financial Word Magazine’s “CEO of the Year” contest, I test four competing models, which suggest that the ways CEOs interpret their status can predict longevity. The results of this study are largely unsupported, though post-hoc analyses and theorizing suggest that status maintenance comes at a cost to longevity for this group of CEOs. &#xd;
	In the third study of this dissertation, I examine the relational costs associated with holding high status. Given the relational nature of status, for some individuals to have high status, there must be lower status referents. The emotions and behaviors of those lower status others are the focus of the third study. I propose that in the presence of status differences, lower status individuals will feel envious of others’ higher status positions, and I quantify how much status dispersion must be present in order for envy to be triggered. I also suggest that when individuals are envious of others’ status positions, they are more likely to ostracize high status targets and perceive themselves as ostracized in social interactions. The results suggest that there is a curvilinear relationship between status dispersion and envy, where only minimal status differences need be present in order for envy to emerge, and envy then predicts feeling ostracized in social situations. &#xd;
	The dissertation closes with a general discussion of the studies, and suggests areas for future research.</description>

   <title>Canopy Height Modeling for Improved Forest Biomass Inventory</title>

   <description>In Ontario, an up-to-date forest biomass inventory is critical for forest management decisions and to ensure sustainable development.  Due to recent pressures of climate change, economic downturns, and rising energy prices, inventory users are demanding increasingly accurate, timely, and spatially explicit biomass data from producers.  This study focuses specifically on the inventory measurement of forest height, as height is an important yet elusive variable for determining biomass quality and quantity, along with a myriad of other forest and ecological attributes. &#xd;
Two types of remote sensing methods are used to model height, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Semi Global Matching (SGM), at the privately owned Haliburton Forest in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence.  The modeled heights are then compared to height data found in Ontario’s Forest Resource Inventory (FRI), collected using stereo-photogrammetry and ground surveys by Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources.  Three different stand scenarios, representing various plot characteristics, are used to determine if correlations between LiDAR, SGM and the FRI increase as plot variables are constrained.  &#xd;
Throughout the study, height values modeled by LiDAR and SGM are strongly correlated (R2 up to .88 for maximum height, .73 for average height).  As there is no additional cost to producing SGM when aerial imagery is flown, it is an attractive method for Ontario to incorporate when producing its forest inventory.  Unfortunately, remote sensing values and the FRI values do not correlate as plot variables are constrained.  This suggests a disconnect between traditional inventory methods and emerging remote sensing technologies.   It is recommended that a field-based study in the Haliburton Forest take place to validate the results of this study, and that further research should incorporate the modeled heights from this report to examine biomass volume.</description>

   <description>Inorganic phosphate (Pi) plays a critical role in many biological structures and processes. However, Pi typically occurs at low concentrations, particularly in marine environments. In comparison, naturally occurring organophosphonates, which are characterized by a stable carbon-phosphorus (CP) bond, are frequently present at higher concentrations. Accordingly, bacteria have evolved different mechanisms for cleaving the CP bond of organophosphonates to liberate Pi for metabolic use. Two prominent enzyme pathways for catabolic cleavage of a CP bond are examined in this thesis.&#xd;
The first, called CP-lyase, is encoded by the phn operon that consists of 14 genes (phnCDEFGHIJKLMNOP). CP-lyase has long been of interest for its ability to degrade a wide array of organophosphonates through a homolytic CP bond cleaving reaction. A soluble protein complex consisting of PhnGHIJK was isolated from E. coli, suggesting that protein-protein interactions are important for CP bond cleavage. Intermediates of organophosphonate catabolism by E. coli CP-lyase were also detected and isolated, including -D-ribosyl-1,2-cyclic phosphate and N-acetylated aminoalkylphosphonates, 2-N-acetamidoethylphosphonate and 5’-phospho--D-ribosyl-1’-alkylphosphonates. The former compound was shown to be converted by the phosphodiesterase PhnP to -D-ribosyl-1-phosphate. It was also shown that PhnO is an aminoalkylphosphonate N-acetyl transferase and that N-acetylation by this enzyme is necessary for CP bond cleavage of 1-aminoalklyphosphonates. These results demonstrated that in addition to forming protein complexes, CP-lyase also comprises a catabolic pathway, with ribosylation of organophosphonates playing a key part in setting up the CP bond cleaving reaction.&#xd;
The second pathway examined in this thesis is comprised of marine bacterial enzymes PhnY and PhnZ and is specific for 2-aminoethylphosphonate. PhnY was shown to be an -ketoglutarate / Fe(II) dependent dioxygenase that hydroxylates the -carbon of 2-aminoethylphosphonate to form (R)-2-amino-1-hydroxyethylphosphonate. PhnZ was shown to be a novel Fe(II) dependent oxygenase that converts (R)-2-amino-1-hydroxyethylphosphonate to glycine and Pi. Site directed mutagenesis, kinetic analysis, reactions with substrate analogues, and X-ray crystallography examined the roles of active site residues and the di-iron active site. Additionally, a unique induced-fit mechanism was discovered which appears to synchronize substrate binding with activation of molecular oxygen. Overall these results show that PhnZ represents a new mechanism for catabolic cleavage of a CP bond.</description>

   <description>This thesis consists of work conducted in two separate studies, evaluating the performance of passive systems for treating wastewater effluents. The first study involved the characterization of three wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) providing secondary and tertiary treatment for municipal wastewater at a facility in Amherstview, Ontario, Canada. Since 2003, the WSPs have experienced excessive algae growth and high pH levels during the summer months. A full range of parameters consisting of: pH, chlorophyll-a (chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, alkalinity, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), conductivity, nutrient species, and organic matter measures; were monitored for the system and the chemical dynamics in the three WSPs were assessed through multivariate statistical analysis. Supplementary continuous monitoring of pH, chl-a, and DO was performed to identify time-series dependencies. The analyses showed strong correlations between chl-a and sunlight, temperature, organic matter, and nutrients, and strong time dependent correlations between chl-a and DO and between chl-a and pH. Additionally, algae samples were collected and analyzed using metagenomics methods to determine the distribution and speciation of algae growth in the WSPs. A strong shift from the dominance of a major class of green algae, chlorophyceae, in the first WSP, to the dominance of land plants, embryophyta – including aquatic macrophytes – in the third WSP, was observed and corresponded to field observations during the study period. The second study involved the evaluation of the performance and chemical dynamics of a hybrid-passive system treating leachate from a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill in North Bay, Ontario, Canada.  Over a three year period, monitoring of a full range of parameters consisting of: pH, DO, temperature, alkalinity, ORP, conductivity, sulfate, chloride, phenols, solids fractions, nutrient species, organic matter measures, and metals; was conducted bi-weekly and the dataset was analyzed with time series and multivariate statistical techniques. Regression analyses identified 8 parameters that were most frequently retained for modelling the five criteria parameters (alkalinity, ammonia, chemical oxygen demand, iron, and heavy metals), on a statistically significant level (p &lt; 0.05): conductivity, DO, nitrite, organic nitrogen, ORP, pH, sulfate, and total volatile solids.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the significance of toy production, distribution, marketing and consumption to Canadian understandings of childhood. Drawing on Patrick J. Ryan’s concept of the discursive landscape of modern childhood and Daniel Thomas Cook’s commercial persona of the child consumer, it explores the effect of toy controversies on a number of social, political and economic issues between the arrival of manufactured toys in Canada in the mid-nineteenth century and the rise of postindustrial capitalism. The toy industry, the social sciences, consumer activists and the Canadian state all played a pivotal role in raising the social significance attached to toy consumption. In the end, debates about toys highlighted popular manifestations of complex political and social issues by placing children and their material culture at the symbolic centre of “adult” conflicts.</description>

   <description>When it comes to potential children, is to love them to leave them be (nonexistent)? I examine the possibility of virtuous reproduction, as well as some more basic theoretical issues surrounding the nature of moral goodness and obligation generally. Currently, there is a large body of literature in the field of reproductive ethics on questions of what considerations and practices ought to guide reproductive decision-making. The appropriate use of testing technologies to inform such decision-making, for instance, has been widely debated. Much smaller and less visible is the debate surrounding the prior question of whether reproduction itself is morally appropriate or desirable. I am particularly interested in how consequentialist strategies for including considerations of beneficence in reproductive decision-making have shaped moral approaches to reproduction. The principle of procreative beneficence (PPB), which mandates potential reproducers to select the best possible child, highlights the problematic nature of these strategies. The limited conceptual resources and problematic normative foundations of such strategies have stymied the development of a robust discussion on the ethics of reproduction itself. Other types of ethical approaches, loosely defined as deontological, offer superior accounts of what is at issue in reproduction, but also draw on some flawed background assumptions regarding, for instance, the nature of the moral agent and the scope of the moral sphere. The question of the morality of reproduction itself thus leads to an examination of far more basic issues in ethical theory: namely, the significance of meta-ethical commitments, and the desirability of a normative framework that offers a rich and agent-focused account of moral goodness and badness. I argue that a virtue-centred ethics, grounded in neo-Aristotelian naturalism,&#xd;
accomplishes just that. And it is well-equipped to provide a meaningful and helpful analysis of the morality of reproduction, both holistically, in terms of the potential virtuousness of reproduction generally, and in terms of how the virtues of courage and benevolence may be expressed in reproduction. I conclude that a virtue-centred assessment of reproduction offers a sound and practical form of evaluation and that a virtuous character may indeed be expressed through reproduction.</description>

   <description>We investigated age-related differences in neural activation associated with recognition of familiar melodies, a process that requires retrieval from musical semantic memory and leads to a feeling of familiarity.  We used sparse sampling fMRI to determine the neural correlates of melody processing and familiarity by comparing activation when listening to melodies versus signal-correlated noise, and to familiar versus unfamiliar melodies, respectively.  Overall, activity in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus correlated well with melody processing.  Familiarity was associated with several frontal regions (bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus; left insular cortex), right superior temporal gyrus; left supramarginal gyrus and cingulate gyrus; bilateral putamen and thalamus; cerebellum and brainstem.  No significant differences were found between younger and older adults for either melody processing or familiarity based activation.  Assessment of familiarity-related group differences using less stringent criteria identified plausible areas; greater activation was seen bilaterally in the superior temporal gyrus in younger adults and in some left parietal regions in older adults.  This study adds to the knowledge of musical semantic memory with results based on a large sample (N = 40) that includes older adults.  Our findings for activation associated with melody processing and familiarity support some, but not all, previous results of related studies.  We were unable to find conclusive evidence of age-related differences in neural correlates of musical semantic memory, while also being the first study (to the best of our knowledge) to search for these differences.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-17 14:02:39.23</description>
   <description>South Africa is considered food secure yet, depending on the source used, it is estimated that food insecurity exists in 20-52% of households. Many factors, such as differing livelihood strategies, play significant roles in determining food security and this project attempted to explore these issues, using Cape Town as a case study. In particular, we compared two types of urban agricultural interventions:home and community gardening as facilitated by two urban agriculture NGO’s (Soil for Life and Abalimi, respectively).&#xd;
Semi-structured interviews were conducted amongst 91 participants living below the poverty line in two ‘townships’ in Cape Town: Langa and Khayelitsha. Twenty-five home-gardeners in Langa and 21 community-gardeners in Khayelitsha were interviewed and compared with equal numbers of non-gardeners in both areas. Data analysis showed that participants who cited community gardening as a food source were most food secure (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale [HFIAS] = 13.04), followed by Langa’s home gardeners (HFIAS = 18.88), Langa’s non-gardeners (HFIAS = 21.84) and finally non-gardeners in Khayelitsha (HFIAS = 22.25). Food Security for non-gardeners in Langa and Khayelitsha was correlated with income (r=0.78; 0.48, respectively), as compared to both gardening groups. The gardeners in Langa and Khayelitsha also showed more diversified diets and lower Months of Inadequate Household Food Provisioning Scores (MIHFP), indicating fewer months of inadequate food provisioning.&#xd;
These data suggest that food security may be positively affected by gardening practices as well as by increased diversity in food sourcing. Community gardening appeared to be more effective than home gardening, perhaps due to greater accessibility to inputs such as land space, manure and water, as facilitated directly by the associated NGO.</description>

   <description>Despite the superior properties of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials, the use of FRPs in buildings is limited. A key cause of concern for their use in buildings arises from their poor performance in fire occurrences. This thesis presents the results of fire performance of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams and slabs strengthened with externally bonded FRP sheets. The performance and effectiveness of insulation materials and techniques are also investigated in this thesis. Two full-scale reinforced concrete T-beams and two intermediate-scale slabs were strengthened in flexure with carbon and glass fibre reinforced polymer sheets and insulated with a layer of spray-on material. The T-beams and slabs were then exposed to a standard fire. Fire test results show that fire endurances of more than 4 h can be achieved using an appropriate insulation system. Tests were performed in order to understand the behaviour of FRP concrete bond at high temperatures.  An empirical model was then formulated to describe the bond strength deterioration due to temperature rise.  Innovative measurement techniques were employed throughout the experiments to measure important observables like strain and temperature. Meanwhile, the effectiveness and practicality of techniques such as Fibre Optic Sensing (FOS) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for high temperature applications were investigated.&#xd;
A numerical finite-volume heat transfer model was developed to simulate the heat transfer phenomenon. The validity of the numerical model was verified by comparing the results with the results from the fire tests. By using this model, parametric analyses were performed to investigate the effect of different fire scenarios on the performance of the insulated beams.  To simulate the structural performance of the T-beams a numerical model which was capable of predicting stresses and strains and deflections of a heated beam was developed. The model is capable of incorporating the effects of axial forces in the response of a restrained beam. This model was verified and used in combination with the thermal model to simulate the deflections of T-beams in fire.</description>

   <description>We examine a class of planar area preserving mappings and give a geometric condition that guarantees the existence of homoclinic points.  To be more precise, let $f,g:R \to R$ be $C^1$ functions with domain all of $R$.  Let $F:R^2 \to R^2$ denote a horizontal reflection in the curve $x=-f(y)$, and let $G:R^2 \to R^2$ denote a vertical reflection in the curve $y=g(x)$.  We consider maps of the form $T=G \circ F$ and show that a simple geometric condition on the fixed point sets of $F$ and $G$ leads to the existence of a homoclinic point for $T$.</description>

   <description>The first part of the thesis addresses the fatigue performance of concrete bridge decks with GFRP stay-in-place structural forms replacing the bottom layer of rebar. The forms were either flat plate with T-up ribs joined using lap splices, or corrugated forms joined through pin-and-eye connections. The decks were supported by simulated Type III precast AASHTO girders spaced at 1775mm (6ft.). Two surface preparations were examined for each GFRP form, either using adhesive coating that bonds to freshly cast concrete, or simply cleaning the surface before casting. For the bonded deck with flat-ribbed forms, adhesive bond and mechanical fasteners were used at the lap splice, whereas the lap splice of the unbonded deck had no adhesive or fasteners. All the decks survived 3M cycles at 123kN service load of CL625 CHBDC design truck. The bonded flat-ribbed-form deck survived an additional 2M cycles at a higher load simulating a larger girder spacing of 8ft. Stiffness degradations were 9-33% with more reduction in the unbonded specimens. Nonetheless, live load deflections of all specimens remained below span/1600. The residual ultimate strengths after fatigue were reduced by 5% and 27% for the flat-ribbed and corrugated forms, respectively, but remained 7 and 3 times higher than service load.&#xd;
The second part of the thesis investigates the performance of bridge deck overhangs reinforced by GFRP rebar. Overhangs of full composite slab-on-girder bridge decks at 1:2.75 scale were tested monotonically under an AASHTO tire pad. Five tests were conducted on overhangs of two lengths: 260mm and 516mm, representing scaled overhangs of 6ft. and 8ft. girder spacing, respectively. The 260mm overhang was completely reinforced with GFRP rebar while the 516mm overhang consisted of a GFRP-reinforced section and a steel-reinforced section. The peak loads were approximately 2 to 3 times the established equivalent service load of 24.3kN, even though the overhangs were not designed for flexure according to the CHBDC but rather with lighter minimum reinforcement in anticipation of shear failure. The failure mode&#xd;
of each overhang section was punching shear. The steel-reinforced overhang section exhibited a greater peak load capacity (13.5%) and greater deformability (35%) when compared to the GFRP-reinforced overhang section.</description>

   <title>Application of reliability methods to the design of underground structures</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geological Sciences &amp; Geological Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-18 10:35:26.265</description>
   <description>Uncertainty in rockmass and in situ stress parameters poses a critical design challenge in geotechnical engineering. This uncertainty stems from natural variability (aleatory) due to the complex history of formation and continual reworking of geological materials as well as knowledge-based uncertainty (epistemic) due to a lack of site specific information and the introduction of errors during the testing and design phases. While such uncertainty can be dealt with subjectively through the use of conservative design parameters, this leads to a lack of understanding of the variable ground response and the selection of an over-conservative design that can have a negative impact on both the project cost and schedule.&#xd;
Reliability methods offer an alternative approach that focuses on quantifying the uncertainty in ground conditions and utilizing it directly in the design process. By doing so, a probability of failure can be calculated with respect to a prescribed limit state, providing a measure of design performance. When multiple design options are considered, reliability methods can be paired with a quantitative risk analysis to determine the optimum design on the basis of safety and minimum cost rather than subjective conservatism.&#xd;
Despite the inherent benefits of such an approach, the adoption of reliability methods has been slow in geotechnical engineering due to a number of technical and conceptual challenges. The research conducted pertaining to this thesis aims to address these issues and remove the perceived “cloak of mystery” that surrounds the use of reliability methods. The scientific and engineering research in this thesis was divided into four sections: (1) the assessment of uncertainty in geotechnical input parameters, (2) a review of reliability methods in the context of geotechnical problems, (3) the development of a reliability-based, quantitative risk approach for underground support design and (4) the application of such a method to existing case studies. The completion of these areas is critical to the design of underground structures and may bring about a shift in design philosophy in the geotechnical industry.</description>

   <description>According to the 2008 Statistics Canada report on the extracurricular activities of Canadian children and youth, approximate 76% of Canadians under the age of 17 participate in sport. As such, sport represents a significant developmental experience in many young peoples’ lives. Whether this experience is positive or negative depends on a number of factors related to the specific context in which sport participation occurs. In particular, interpersonal interactions are known to be a significant influence on athlete development and may vary greatly across sport contexts. In youth sport, there are two primary contexts of participation: coach-driven organized sport and youth-driven informal sport play. The purpose of the present program of research was to examine the predominant interpersonal interactions occurring in organized sport and informal sport play contexts and their relationship to athlete development. &#xd;
Study 1 was methodological and presents the development and validation of an observational coding system designed to capture the motivational tone of youth sport coaches’ interactions with their athletes. Motivational tone represents a theoretically relevant but previously unexplored dimension of coaches’ interactive behaviour. &#xd;
Study 2 used the newly developed coding system from study 1 to examine the motivational tone of coach-athlete interactions in competitive youth volleyball, an organized sport context. Using a person-centred analysis approach, these coach-athlete interaction were then linked to athletes’ longitudinal development trajectories over the course of the competitive season. Results revealed significant differences in the coach-athlete interaction profiles of athletes on a negative developmental trajectory compared to athletes on a positive developmental trajectory. &#xd;
Study 3 was an exploratory observational examination of peer interactive behaviour in an informal sport play context. These interactive behaviours were examined with respect to athletes’ developmental outcomes. Results pointed to the social nature of participation in informal sport play contexts and the critical relationship between athlete competence and peer interaction tendencies. &#xd;
Overall, the results of the three studies comprising this program of research offered new information to further our understanding of interpersonal interactions and athlete development in different youth sport contexts but also identified several avenues requiring further research.</description>

   <description>The war against Germany was perceived by the majority of English Canadians as a necessity to defend the British Empire, democracy and justice. However, it became increasingly evident to the public that some individuals were being permitted to prosper, while others — particularly those of the working class — endured immense hardship. These individuals who prospered at a level judged excessive became known as "profiteers." Initial criticisms of profiteering were connected to graft, jobbery and patronage apparent in government military purchases. However, as public sacrifices intensified, the morally acceptable extent to which individuals and businesses could profit came to be more narrowly defined. Criticisms of profiteering expanded to challenge the mainstream liberal notions of private wealth and laissez-faire policies as being inequitable and undemocratic. The federal government's unwillingness to seriously implement measures against profiteering led to rising discontent. Consequently, working-class English Canadians aspired to form a 'new democracy' that was worth the sacrifices of the war.</description>

   <description>Chemical detection, including analysis of gases and liquids, is a large field in environmental research and industry. It requires sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive chemical sensors. Many industrial materials such as coatings and adhesives readily absorb chemical analytes, which may result in changes of their chemical, mechanical, and optical properties. This uptake of volatile organic compounds either from the gas phase or from an aqueous solution into a thin film is frequently accompanied by a change in material refractive index and film thickness. While the undesired swelling of thin film coatings and their refractive index changes affect their use in harsh environments, the sensitivity of some polymers to solvent vapours can also be exploited for sensing applications.&#xd;
In this project, a method is reported for real-time monitoring of vapour uptake by simultaneous detection of the refractive index, n, and thickness, d, of thin transparent films with a precision of 10-4 for refractive index and 100 nm for thickness. The setup combines a total internal reflection refractometer with an interferometric imaging method. Two setups using 1550 nm and 635 nm measurement wavelengths were developed, with a detection rate of 1 second per measurement.&#xd;
Two processing methods using a fast Fourier transform algorithm to calculate n and d are applied to the experimental results and compared. Both methods could extract n and d simultaneously from each image captured by the refractometer. The results show that the setup is capable of monitoring film RI and thickness change in real-time.&#xd;
The partitioning of volatile organic compound vapours into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and PDMS-polydiphenylsiloxane (PDPS) copolymers is described. The system is also suited for characterization of other solid and liquid films like SU-8 photoresist and crude oil. It shows great potential in commercial applications of thin film characterization.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I explore the phenomena of cheese production in Ontario, Canada. I initiated this project after learning that some cheese producers in Ontario that were struggling to stay in business, in part because of whey management issues, especially as they relate to the Ontario Nutrient Management Act O. Reg 267/03 (OMAFRA 2002). In this thesis, I utilize the Actor-Network Theory (Latour 2005) approach to examine how certain elements of cheese production in Ontario are organized, with an emphasis on whey management and utilization. Of interest are tensions that threaten to destabilize these relations, such as controversies over how whey should be handled, how identities such as “artisan” or “industrial” cheese producers are constructed and maintained, and how smaller producers sustain themselves in a market in which they compete with large- scale industrial cheese production were examined. Interviews took place with seven participants involved in government, agriculture, and cheese production. Participant/observation data were collected in six field sites (cheese factories, farms). I found that humans and nonhumans perform significant work in holding cheese production and whey management together, even in situations commonly understood as under human mastery or control. In particular, I found that the manner by which relations between entities both human and nonhuman are governed, through law or through informal expectations (e.g., "protocol"; Galloway and Thacker 2007), is responsive to, and emergent from, these relations.</description>

   <description>The major focus of this thesis involves a new approach to spin-crossover (SCO) in iron(II) dinuclear complexes. In order to acquire SCO properties, a series of novel ligands (L1M, L2M, L3M, L4M), together with the corresponding iron(II) and/or nickel(II) complexes were synthesized and characterized. Beyond the successful synthesis and characterization of these ligands, some interesting aspects of their synthesis are discussed. The reported ligands are methyl-derivatives from ligands previously studied in the group. The methyl group in the position 6 of the pyridine group is introduced to induce steric hindrance in the complexes and decrease the ligand field strength. As a result, the influence of the methyl group may induce SCO in low spin (LS) complexes, or tune the SCO properties (such as transition hysteresis or transition temperature) in complexes with SCO. Ligands were divided into three different types according to their spacers: a ligand with an aromatic spacer (L1M), ligands with aliphatic spacer (L2M, L3M) and a ligand with no spacer (L4M). The difference between their structures helped us to better understand the coordination chemistry of the corresponding complexes. The nickel(II) complexes formed provided useful background information on the coordination chemistry of iron(II), such as the crystal field stabilization energy (10Dq) value. An approximation of 10Dq value of iron(II) was calculated based on the 10Dq value of analogous nickel(II) complexes using an empirical rule, to provide a prediction of SCO property.</description>

   <description>In the early days of HIV/AIDS in North America, those most directly affected by the crisis created a social movement to respond to the virus when no one else would. The legacy of activists’ efforts can be seen in the more than seventy-five AIDS service organizations (ASOs) that provide prevention, support, and education to communities across Ontario today. While these organizations were once an important site of advocacy and resistance for people living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), ASOs are now often viewed as professionalized, bureaucratic and impersonal spaces. Linking theoretical understandings of public pedagogy and the pedagogical potential of space with HIV/AIDS scholarship, I offer a conception of ASOs as more than simply impersonal service providers, but vibrant spaces of community learning.  Drawing on interviews with people who work, volunteer, and use services at a small ASO in Kingston, Ontario called HIV/AIDS Regional Services  (HARS), I identify three pedagogical assets within the agency’s space that tend to go unrecognized as such. The agency’s drop-in space, artworks created by PHAs that decorate the walls of the office, and HARS’ storefront design are not usually counted as elements of the kind of formal “HIV/AIDS education” that ASOs provide. However, by exploring the learning experiences that are incited by these assets, I argue that we may broaden our understandings of what counts as HIV/AIDS education and of the value of ASOs in their communities. These unacknowledged assets not only enhance peoples’ understanding of issues related to HIV/AIDS, they also work to develop a sense of community and belonging for visitors to the space.  In conclusion, I reiterate that while today’s ASOs are surely different than the organizations that activists created in the 1980s, the learning experiences that arise in agencies like HARS demonstrate that community-building and mutual support can remain as integral aspects of ASOs.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-20 21:17:33.868</description>
   <description>Social entrepreneurship, which can be described as the application of market-based approaches to societal and/or environmental problems, represents a collision between good intentions and the pursuit of profitability. Nearly two decades ago, the democratically elected African National Congress inherited a country in crisis. Neoliberal policies have since promoted the role of the private sector in economic and social development in South Africa. Entrepreneurship is seen as a tool to stimulate poverty alleviation, address staggering unemployment rates and integrate blacks into the mainstream economy. Municipalities are increasingly turning to alternative service delivery, privatization and public-private partnerships to address service delivery crises. Moving beyond traditional methodological approaches of individual case studies, this research adopts a holistic analysis of the recycling sector, which allows reflections on the state and implications of (social) entrepreneurial approaches. Particularly, this research is concerned with the opportunities and limitations afforded by entrepreneurial approaches, including the extent to which contextual variables are acknowledged and unequal power dynamics are challenged or further entrenched. Grounded in entrepreneurship and business theory, this research also pulls from waste management literature, global development, critical and gender studies. Various methodological inquires are undertaken, including structured and semi-structured interviews of participants of recycling initiatives and management of sector organizations, content analysis, and the facilitation of a Recycling Forum. Findings suggest that while there are some opportunities, (social) entrepreneurial approaches are significantly hindered by a lack of acknowledgement of contextual variables and critical investigation into the institutional structures and biases that create particular gendered entrepreneurial spaces. Initiatives risk entrenching apartheid-era inequalities and further disadvantaging the most vulnerable through the creation of competition. The emphasis on recycling deflects efforts from more immediate or hazardous challenges and is insufficient to challenge market inequalities. Moving beyond a guise of good intentions, social entrepreneurship is suggested as a reflective and iterative process that promotes greater self-awareness of one’s impact on the existing value chain, power dynamics and social justice.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Rehabilitation Science) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-20 23:22:16.695</description>
   <description>Background: Sit-to-stand is a challenging task as it requires the transition from a large 3-point base of support to a small 2-point base of support while simultaneously controlling anteroposterior and vertical body acceleration. Age-related morphological changes in both the visual and vestibular system could impair the ability to extract and interpret sensory information necessary for motor control in older adults, which can increase instability and the risk of falls. The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of aging on visual-vestibular interaction for maintaining stability during sit-to-stand.&#xd;
Methods: Fifteen younger (age=22.5±1.1) and fifteen older (age=73.9±5.3) healthy adults were asked to stand from a sitting position as quickly as possible. Vestibular input was manipulated using percutaneous bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation where threshold intensity was individually calculated for each participant during quiet stance with eyes closed. Galvanic vestibular stimulation was applied at both threshold (1xGVS) and 2-times the participant’s threshold intensity (2xGVS). Visual conditions included eyes opened, wearing custom-made vision blurring goggles, or eyes closed. Outcome measures included a global measure of performance (transition phase duration), mediolateral stability (peak-to-peak trunk roll angle, mediolateral center of mass displacement, mediolateral center of pressure displacement) and anteroposterior stability (peak braking force, peak-to-peak trunk pitch angle, and peak anteroposterior center of mass velocity).&#xd;
Results: When vision was suboptimal (blurring goggles), older adults had significantly longer transition phase duration than younger adults (p&lt;0.05). Older adults demonstrated greater mediolateral instability than younger adults. When vision was absent, trunk roll angle was significantly greater with 1xGVS than 2xGVS (p&lt;0.05). Mediolateral center of mass displacement was greater when vision was absent than when vision was available, irrespective of age (p&lt;0.05). No effects of age, vision or galvanic vestibular stimulation were seen in peak braking force, trunk pitch angle, and peak anteroposterior center of mass velocity (p>0.05).&#xd;
Conclusion: Regardless of age, visual inputs were more critical to maintain stability during sit-to-stand than vestibular inputs. Differences between younger adults and older adults were only seen in the mediolateral direction. Despite having greater mediolateral instability, older adults utilized similar strategies as younger adults to overcome sensory perturbations during sit-to-stand.</description>

   <description>This thesis extends Tate’s conjectures from the smooth case to quotient varieties. It&#xd;
shows that two of those conjectures hold for quotient varieties if they hold for smooth&#xd;
projective varieties. We also consider arbitrary product of modular curves and show&#xd;
that the three conjectures of Tate (in codimension 1) hold for this product. Finally we&#xd;
look at quotients of the surface V = X1(N)×X1(N) and prove that Tate’s conjectures&#xd;
are satisfied for those quotients.</description>

   <description>This dissertation explores a family of theoretical models of humanitarian military intervention. A number of recent theorists, including Tesón, Caney, Buchanan, Orend, Moellendorf, and Wheeler, build their models from a perspective called ‘cosmopolitanism.’ They offer arguments based on the moral supremacy of human rights, the arbitrary character of territorial boundaries, and the duty to protect individual human beings exposed to serious and systematic violence by their own governments. I develop a model of intervention that recognizes the moral significance of political self-government. To the extent that international society should countenance a ‘duty to protect’ human rights, the duty ought to be constrained by a commitment to the values of self-government. The model developed in this dissertation also recognizes the significance of international law enforcement. Insofar as we should permit a role of enforcement for international human rights, that role should be constrained by formally accepted global principles and in particular by positive obligations to prevent and punish actions regarded as international crimes. &#xd;
These other global values are viewed with suspicion by cosmopolitan theorists, who tend to construe them in stark contrast to the vision of global responsibility for human rights protection. But I will show how these other values emerged simultaneously with cosmopolitanism and share many of its underlying intuitions. Because self-government and law enforcement are linked politically to the cosmopolitan vision, these two distinctive global values can be utilized as tools to fortify or expand cosmopolitanism by enlarging the global sense of responsibility for human rights. The aim of this project is to explain how these other values came to be neglected by cosmopolitan theorists, and why they should not be forgotten.</description>

   <description>This transnational study of the first-wave South Asian immigrant experience in British Columbia and the Pacific coast states shows how elected officials at all levels of government, bureaucrats, union leaders, physicians, members of the press, and the general public utilized purported public health concerns to justify South Asian exclusion and disenfranchisement.   While all Asian groups living along the Pacific coast faced opposition to their immigration and settlement, India’s subordinate status within the British Empire, and a sustained western association of South Asians with disease, uniquely positioned North American discourse on South Asians at the intersection of colonial theory, Orientalism, and medicalized nativism in the first two decades of the twentieth century.</description>

   <description>Rapid advances in the smart grid technology are making it possible to tackle a lot of problems in the aged power systems. High-speed data acquisition system, high-voltage power electronic equipment, advanced utility and customer interaction technologies, as well as distributed renewable generation are enabling the revolution in the electric power generation, delivery and distribution. Through the implementation of ubiquitous metering and communication networks, the customers would no longer be a passive receiver of the electrical energy, but instead, an active participant in the power system and electricity market. They can not only sell their own energy to the utility, but also take part in the emergency restoration in the power grid. Nonetheless, some technical barriers are encountered during this revolution, such as difficulties in integrating home automation, smart metering, customer interaction and power system operation into the whole system.&#xd;
	This thesis proposes a customer involved load shedding algorithm for both the power system frequency control and the micro-grid islanding.

   <description>This thesis investigates the application of ultra-high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates to strengthen damaged reinforced concrete beams and slender columns.  In the first phase, two different pre-repair loading histories were simulated in seven 3000x300x150 mm reinforced concrete beams, namely cracking within the elastic range, and overloading in the plastic range. After unloading, the beams were repaired with either high- or ultra-high modulus (210 or 400 GPa) CFRP plates, or a hybrid system, and then reloaded to failure. It was shown that the level of pre-existing damage has an insignificant effect on the strengthening effectiveness and the failure mode at ultimate. The 210 and 400 GPa CFRP of reinforcement ratio ρf = 0.17% increased the ultimate strength by up to 29 and 51%, respectively, despite the 40% lower tensile strength of the 400 GPa CFRP, due to the change in failure mode from debonding to rupture.  Doubling ρf of the 400 GPa CFRP to 0.34% resulted in a 63% overall gain in flexural strength, only 8% increase in ultimate strength over ρf = 0.17%, due to change in failure mode from rupture to concrete cover delamination. The beam retrofitted by hybrid CFRP showed remarkable pseudo ductility and warning signs before failure.  However, a parametric study revealed a critical balance in proportioning the areas of hybrid CFRP to achieve reliable pseudo ductility. In the beam with ρf =0.34%, this was achieved using a maximum of 30% ρf of the 400 GPa CFRP. The second phase of this thesis presents an analytical model developed by modifying the provisions of the ACI 318-08 code and employing the computer software Response 2000, to predict the performance of CFRP strengthened slender reinforced concrete columns.  Response 2000 is used to establish the interaction curve while the modified ACI 318-08 code is used to acquire the slender column loading path to failure including the second order effects.  The model predicts that the effectiveness of the FRP strengthening system increases as the slenderness ratio and FRP reinforcement ratio increase.</description>

   <description>Background: While the provision of adequate nutrition support in critically ill patients has been shown to have an impact on short-term clinical outcomes, relatively little is known about subsequent long-term outcomes. We aimed to examine the association between nutritional adequacy and long-term outcomes including survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in critically ill patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. &#xd;
Methods: The study was conducted as a retrospective cohort study on data collected prospectively in the context of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) in critically ill patients. Randomized patients who stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and were mechanically ventilated for >8 days were eligible for the study, but only six-month survivors were considered for the assessment of HRQoL. Nutritional adequacy was obtained from the average proportion of prescribed calories received during the first eight days of mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Survival status and HRQoL as assessed using Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) were obtained prospectively as part of the RCT protocol at three-months and six-months post ICU admission. &#xd;
Results: Of the 1223 patients enrolled in the randomized controlled trial, 475 met the inclusion criteria for this study. At six-month follow-up, 302 of the 475 patients were alive. Among critically ill patients with >8 days of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, survival time in those who received low nutritional adequacy was significantly shorter than for those who received high nutritional adequacy after adjusting for important covariates. Among six-month survivors, clinically meaningful and statistical significant associations between increase in scores of Physical Functioning (PF) and Role Physical domains (RP) of the SF-36 and 25% increase in nutritional adequacy were observed at three-months follow-up. No significant associations were observed at six-months. &#xd;
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nutritional adequacy received as early as the first week in the ICU seems beneficial to longer survival time and faster physical recovery post ICU discharge in critically ill patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to provide stronger assessment of the causal impact of nutrition therapy on long-term outcomes.</description>

   <description>All organisms require rapid and flexible signaling mechanisms in order to effectively respond to biotic and abiotic stress. Calcium ions (Ca2+) have proven to be important components of signaling networks. Observations of stimulus-specific oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ during signal transduction suggest that Ca2+ signals directly encode information. These stimulus-specific oscillations, known as Ca2+ signatures, can be interpreted by an array of Ca2+-binding sensors and effectors, which subsequently regulate appropriate cellular responses. While progress has been made regarding the classic Ca2+-sensor calmodulin (CaM), less research has been directed towards the CaM-like family of Ca2+-sensors (CMLs). This family – unique to plants – is suspected to regulate a multitude of stress and developmental pathways; however, to date very few members of this family have had their functions elucidated by the identification of downstream targets and upstream regulators. In the present study, I investigate the regulation of CML39, which has previously been shown to strongly respond to the stress hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in Arabidopsis. Bioinformatic tools predict a large number of putative JA-responsive cis-elements within the CML39 promoter. Deletion analysis of CML39 promoter fragments in planta reveals that some cis-elements respond in a tissue-specific manner. Analysis of transgenic MYC2 loss-of-function (myc2) mutants demonstrates that MYC2 – the preeminent JA-responsive transcription factor – is not necessary for CML39 promoter activity. Collectively, these data reveal a complex tissue-specific pattern of CML39 regulation and provide a foundation for the future identification of relevant transcription factors.</description>

   <description>The sustainability of publicly funded Canadian health care services is an ongoing debate. Timely access to services and the availability of qualified health care professionals are vital to the survival of emergency health care services in rural and small towns.  One of many factors threatening sustainability is the lack of qualified professionals.  The current nursing shortage and the aging nursing workforce present rural hospitals with recruitment and retention challenges that threaten the sustainability of emergency services and thus have the potential to compromise the health of Canadians living in rural communities. &#xd;
Health care decisions are primarily based upon economics without consideration of the diversity of rural communities.  Challenges in health care delivery including access to emergency services affect Canadians living in rural communities.  These challenges need to be highlighted in the context of rural health as a unique entity in order to build awareness in policy makers to ensure appropriate health care service delivery to rural communities.  It is important for researchers and policy makers to recognize that rural hospitals are not mini-urban centres and thus have differing needs. &#xd;
This two phase study focused on the sustainability of emergency health care services in rural and small town Ontario. Using a mixed methods approach, this study explored a descriptive analysis of emergency departments in rural Ontario and concluded with in-depth case studies of three rural emergency departments with varying travel distances to tertiary care facilities.  These findings have validated pre-existing frameworks and can be used to assist policy makers at all levels to develop recommendations for sustaining emergency health care services in rural Ontario including ways to recruit, train, retain, and maintain resources that are vital to the survival of rural emergency services.</description>

   <description>Rapid advances in the smart grid technology are making it possible to tackle a lot of problems in the aged power systems. High-speed data acquisition system, high-voltage power electronic equipment, advanced utility and customer interaction technologies, as well as distributed renewable generation are enabling the revolution in the electric power generation, delivery and distribution. Through the implementation of ubiquitous metering and communication networks, the customers would no longer be a passive receiver of the electrical energy, but instead, an active participant in the power system and electricity market. They can not only sell their own energy to the utility, but also take part in the emergency restoration in the power grid. Nonetheless, some technical barriers are encountered during this revolution, such as difficulties in integrating home automation, smart metering, customer interaction and power system operation into the whole system.&#xd;
	This thesis proposes a customer involved load shedding algorithm for both the power system frequency control and the micro-grid islanding. This new algorithm possesses the features of centralized load control and distributed load control, which fully utilizes the advantages of hierarchical communication networks along with the home automation. The proposed algorithm considers the reliability of the power grid as well as the comfort of the electricity users. In the power distribution system, the high-level control centre is responsible for coordinating the local load controllers, whilst the local controller takes charge of frequency monitoring and decision making. In the micro-grid, a centralized control strategy is adopted to better serve the system with the wide set of information available at the micro-grid control centre. The simulation results have demonstrated the correctness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the hardware implementation further tests the validity of the wireless sensor networks serving as the system’s monitoring and communication technology.</description>

   <description>Background: Epidemiologic evidence supports the association between shiftwork and the development of cardiovascular disease. Sleep disturbances are associated with a variety of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes and they may lie on the causal pathway between the exposure to shiftwork and cardiovascular disease. &#xd;
Objectives: 1) To describe sleep quality in a group of shift-working and day-working female hospital employees; 2) To determine the association between shiftwork status and sleep disturbances in this group and to determine the effect of lifetime exposure to shiftwork on current sleep disturbances; and 3) To explore whether sleep disturbances mediate the relationship between shiftwork and cardiometabolic risk. &#xd;
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among female hospital employees: participants were 132 women working only during the day, and 98 women who worked a shift schedule of two 12-hour days, followed by two 12-hour nights and five days off. Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire.  The primary outcome of interest was the metabolic syndrome defined in accordance with the 2009 Joint Interim Studies consensus statement. &#xd;
Results: Shiftwork was associated with poor sleep latency (odds ratio (OR)= 2.08 95% CI: 1.11-3.92), poor sleep efficiency (OR=2.35 95% CI: 1.21- 4.54), and poor global sleep quality (OR=1.88 95% CI: 1.02-3.49), while the impact of past shiftwork history was inconclusive. The OR for the association of shiftwork with the metabolic syndrome was 2.00 (95% CI: 0.89-4.51), and there was no evidence of mediation by sleep disturbances in the relationship of shiftwork and the metabolic syndrome. &#xd;
Conclusion: In this study, a rapid forward rotating 2-shift system is associated with self-reported poor sleep quality, while the long-term effects of sleep disturbances on cardiometabolic risk requires further study.</description>

   <description>Background: Socioeconomic factors and gender may influence the quality of care received by patients with diabetes. Millions of people are diagnosed with diabetes and rates are expected to increase. The management of diabetes in primary care is important in optimizing health for all.  &#xd;
Objectives: To investigate whether the selected diabetes quality of care indicators (haemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, abumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), and prescribed medication) are significantly different between those persons living in least and most materially and socially deprived neighbourhoods.&#xd;
Methods: A cross-sectional study design with a population sample of patients with diabetes from a primary care practice in Southeast Ontario. De- identified patient data from electronic medical records were retrieved from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. Combined material and social deprivation scores were based on the Pampalon Deprivation Index.      &#xd;
Results: The patients with diabetes largely resided in either the most or the least deprived neighbourhoods. Patients with diabetes living in the most deprived neighbourhoods were less likely than patients with diabetes living in the least deprived neighbourhoods to have their low-density lipoproteins within normal range (RR=0.84; CIs 0.73-0.98; p-value=0.026). There was no difference in management of diabetes between least and most deprived patients with diabetes regarding haemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, ACR, and medication prescribed; these were positive result for the clinical practice. Women with diabetes were less likely than men with diabetes to have their low-density lipoproteins under control (RR=0.71; CIs 0.62-0.81; p-value &lt;0.001) and be prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs (RR=0.79; CIs 0.69-0.90; p-value &lt;0.001). However, women with diabetes were more likely to have their most recent haemoglobin A1c within normal range (RR=1.24; CIs 1.10-1.40; p-value &lt;0.001) and have their most recent ACR within normal range (RR=1.25; CIs 1.05-1.50; p-value=0.015).&#xd;
Conclusion: This study found that the quality of care for patients with diabetes was not influenced by whether a person lived in a deprived neighbourhood or not. However, the study identified some important gender differences related to whether a person’s diabetes was under control. The reason for these differences is unknown.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we investigate the existence and stability of  periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems with a discrete symmetry.  The global existence of periodic motions can be proven using the classical techniques of the calculus of variations; our particular interest is in how the  stability type  of the solutions thus obtained can be determined analytically  using solely the variational problem and the  symmetries of the system  --  we make no use of numerical or perturbation techniques.  Instead, we use a method introduced in [41] in the context of a special case of the three-body problem.  Using techniques from symplectic geometry,  and specifically the Maslov index  for curves of Lagrangian subspaces along the minimizing trajectories, we verify conditions which preclude the existence of eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix on the unit circle.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
We study the applicability of this method in two specific cases.  Firstly, we consider another special case from celestial mechanics:  the hip-hop solutions of the 2N-body problem.  This is a family of Z_2-symmetric, periodic orbits which arise as  collision-free minimizers of the Lagrangian action on a space of symmetric loops [14, 53].  Following a symplectic reduction,  it is shown that the  hip-hop solutions are  brake orbits which are  generically hyperbolic on the reduced energy-momentum surface. &#xd;
&#xd;
Secondly we consider a class of natural Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom with a homogeneous potential function.  The associated action functional  is unbounded above and below on the function space of symmetric curves, but saddle points can be located by minimization subject to a certain natural constraint of a type first considered by Nehari [37, 38].  Using the direct method of the calculus of variations, we  prove the existence of symmetric solutions of both prescribed period and prescribed energy. In the latter case, we employ a variational principle of van Groesen [55] based upon a modification of the Jacobi functional, which has not been widely used  in the literature. We then  demonstrate that the (constrained) minimizers are again hyperbolic brake orbits; this is the first time the method has been applied to solutions which are not globally minimizing.</description>

   <description>It is crucial to understand the factors that influence the health of Canada’s rapidly aging population. This thesis examines social and material deprivation among the older population in Canada, focusing on a case study of Kingston, Ontario, as well as the intersections between indicators of deprivation and health. A Canadian area-based deprivation index developed by Robert Pampalon was used to measure deprivation. Data were obtained from the Institut national de santé public de Quebec, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, the Canadian Community Health Survey, and the Canadian Census. Firstly, these data were used to examine relationships between deprivation indicators, aging and health. The percentage of the population in fair or poor health increases with age, as does the likelihood that this group will experience one or more indicators of deprivation. Secondly, the spatial patterns of deprivation were compared to the areas where the older population is living in Kingston. Social deprivation is positively correlated with areas with a higher percentage of those 75 years of age or more, whereas material deprivation is negatively correlated with these areas. Collectively, these results indicate that the older population in Kingston is facing a triple jeopardy of declining health, declining resources, and living in areas that are socially deprived. This population seems to be asset-rich, in that they own their own homes, but cash-poor. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of aging and the burden of deprivation faced by the older population. In order to facilitate healthy aging, it is important to take into account the social and material environments where the older population resides as part of an effort to maximize the health and wellbeing of this vulnerable population.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-25 11:36:58.882</description>
   <description>A study of downstream suspended sediment transport dynamics in the West River at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut, was undertaken in 2012. The first component of the research quantified the sediment mobilized in the West River during the 2012 season. A nival bed-contact survey was undertaken to identify areas of the river in which stream flow was isolated from the bed, and was combined with a reach-based sediment budget approach to assess sediment entrainment and downstream movement. This analysis revealed the propensity of the West River to store suspended sediment through much of the season. Permafrost disturbances in 2007 inundated the West River with fine sediments, the majority of which are progressing from the headwaters as a sediment slug that is subject to substantial downstream storage. Diurnal and event hysteresis analysis from 2004-2012 demonstrate the change in sediment delivery inter-annually, transitioning from a system characterized by clockwise hysteresis prior to the 2007 disturbances, to counter-clockwise hysteresis post 2007.  The latter is reflective of the important contribution of the headwater sediment slug from disturbance to downstream sediment transport and common net sediment storage in the lower reaches of the river.&#xd;
The second project studied the delivery of suspended sediment following late season major rainfall events (MRE) and the control antecedent catchment conditions prior to rainfall exert on the magnitude of stream runoff and suspended sediment transport. Two MREs on July 9 and July 23, totalling 35.4 and 10.6 mm, respectively, resulted in exceptionally low discharge response and sediment mobilization. Analysis of synoptic level pressure patterns and catchment soil moisture revealed low volumetric water content preceding both MREs, a result of sustained exceptional early summer warmth under stable regional high pressure. Compared to similar MREs in 2007-2009, the soil in 2012 did not become saturated, and substantial runoff did not occur. &#xd;
These studies contribute to an understanding of the processes of sediment transport in response to disturbances, rainfall, and antecedent catchment conditions, all of which are becoming important components of the Arctic fluvial systems but have had limited study due to the emphasis on snow melt processes and hydrological fluxes.</description>

   <title>Self-Management of Chronic Pain:  Interventions, Strategies, Barriers, and Facilitators</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Nursing) -- Queen's University, 2013-09-25 12:57:58.59</description>
   <description>Background &amp; Purpose:  &#xd;
Chronic pain is a prevalent chronic condition for which the best management options rarely provide complete relief.  Individuals with chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics (NC) report more severe pain and experience less relief from interventions.  Little is known about current self-management practices.  The purpose of this dissertation was to inform self-management of chronic pain with and without NC at the individual, health system, and policy levels using the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework.&#xd;
Methods:&#xd;
The study included a systematic search and review and cross-sectional survey.  The review evaluated the evidence for chronic pain self-management interventions and explored the role of health care providers in supporting self-management.  The survey was mailed to 8,000 randomly selected Canadians in November 2011, and non-respondents were followed-up in May 2012.  Screening questions were included for both chronic pain and NC.  The questionnaire captured pain descriptions, self-management strategies, and self-management barriers, and facilitators.&#xd;
Results: &#xd;
Findings of the review suggested that self-management interventions are effective in improving pain and health outcomes.  Health care professionals provided self-management advice and referred individuals to self-management interventions.  The questionnaire was completed by 1,520 Canadians.  Those with chronic pain (n=710) identified primary care physicians as the most helpful pain management professional.  Overall, use of non-pharmaceutical medical self-management strategies was low.  While use positive emotional self-management strategies was high, individuals with NC were more likely to use negative emotional self-management strategies compared to those without NC.  Multiple self-management barriers and facilitators were identified, however those with NC were more likely than those without NC to experience low self-efficacy, depression and severe pain which may impair the ability to self-management.  &#xd;
Conclusions:  &#xd;
Health care professionals have the opportunity to improve chronic pain outcomes by providing self-management advice, referring to self-management interventions, and addressing self-management barriers and facilitators.  Individuals with NC may require additional health services to address their greater self-management challenges, and further research is needed to identify non-pharmaceutical interventions effective in relieving chronic pain with NC.  Public policy is needed to facilitate health systems in providing long-term self-management support for individuals with chronic pain.</description>

   <description>In geotechnical engineering, granular flows are often studied as a means to further the understanding of the mechanisms that drive landslide motion. High quality experimental data is essential in providing evidence for the development and verification of new theoretical methods that link complex grain interactions to the extended mobility of some landslide events. At present, limited experimental data is available that captures the full range of landslide mobility. In an attempt to add to the present data sources, high quality experimental data was obtained through the use of high speed cameras and physical modelling using a geotechnical centrifuge and a large scale landslide flume. These modelling techniques allow for landslide motion, representative of field scale events, to be observed in a well-defined and controlled setting. A series of nine tests were performed in a geotechnical centrifuge under varying slope inclinations and Coriolis conditions. The effects of Coriolis on landslide mobility were evident when comparing final deposit shapes and total runout. The effects of Coriolis were more pronounced for higher velocity situations and when material was travelling on the horizontal base section opposed to the sloped section of the physical model. A series of thirty tests were performed using a large scale flume under varying source volumes and basal friction conditions, capturing the grain scale interactions and overall runout behaviour. The grain interactions and ultimately the flow behavioural regimes developed were a function of material source volume and boundary roughness. The dimensionless inertial number was used to classify flows into behavioural regimes, but was found to break down when describing transitions to the granular gas behavioural regime.  The runout-time results and final deposit shapes showed significant variation between test configurations, indicating the effects of volume and basal friction on overall mobility. Using the depth averaged numerical model, DAN, it was found that a single set of empirically derived frictional parameters (i.e. specific to internal and basal friction conditions) was appropriate for matching the overall mobility of the experimental flows over a range of flow volumes and slope inclinations.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I argue that within Canadian society, mainstream environmentalism has been constructed as a consumer-based activity that fundamentally excludes low income households and serves to support a capitalist economy.  Historically, humans’ relationship to the environment has been based on economic benefit and so people readily accept this construction of environmentalism as it conforms to established social norms.  Contemporary research has shown that eco-labeling is one of the primary marketing tools that give the impression of social structural change while keeping capitalism intact.  &#xd;
This thesis critically examines documents from three Canadian sources: the Toronto Star newspaper, the David Suzuki Foundation website, and the Canadian Government.  By applying the theories of social constructionism and representation, I show that these documents and articles have multiple levels and meanings about environmentalism that favour the capitalist agenda. This analysis also identifies four main ways in which these sources contribute to and reinforce the exclusion of low income families from Canadian mainstream environmentalism: 1) sources primarily promote ‘green’ consumables and disregard the associated cost of these goods, 2) sources do not acknowledge the constraints associated with level of access to non-consumable green resources, 3) sources shape environmental problems as economic issues by focusing on corporations, and 4) increased time commitments associated with green behaviour are not acknowledged.  These three sources would suggest that the current form of environmentalism, as a consumer based construct, exclude low income household in mainstream Canadian society.  By illuminating some of the problems with the current construction of environmentalism, it becomes possible to construct new perspectives on environmentalism that are both effective and inclusive.</description>

   <description>In consideration of the rising prevalence of obesity and its effect on metabolic health and disease, this study was conducted to examine mechanisms involved in adipose tissue function following an acute bout of exercise in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Sedentary, overweight/obese women (n=10, BMI=30.6±6.0 kg∙m-2, VO2peak=30.3±5.4 mL•kg-1•min-1) completed 2 visits to the lab in which they either exercised for 1 hour or a rested in bed for the equivalent time (control). Experiments were executed randomly using a randomized cross-over study design. Gas exchange measures were measured at three time points before biopsies and subcutaneous adipose biopsies were obtained pre-condition, immediately after condition (0hr), two hours post (2hr), and four hours post (4hr). Acute exercise had significant effects whole body fat oxidation and phosphorylation of insulin signalling proteins, but had no effect on the phosphorylation of proteins regulating the expression of glyceroneogenic genes. In combination, these results suggest that acute exercise can transiently decrease insulin signalling although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Additionally, acute exercise had no effect on the phosphorylation of proteins that are thought to regulate glyceroneogenic gene expression, suggesting that there are either alternative mechanisms involved or that time since the consumption of a meal is a greater stimulus for the activation/upregulation of glyceroneogenesis.  Our findings suggest that acute exercise may acutely alter function of adipose tissue such that it contributes to elevations in whole body fatty acid metabolism, however, whether or not chronic adaptations are induced remains an important area for future study.</description>

   <description>As Cloud services become more commonplace, recent works have uncovered vulnerabilities unique to such systems. Specifi cally, the paradigm promotes a risk of information leakage across virtual machine isolation via side-channels. Unlike conventional&#xd;
computing, the infrastructure supporting a Cloud environment allows mutually dis-&#xd;
trusting clients simultaneous access to the underlying hardware, a seldom met requirement for a side-channel attack. This thesis investigates the current state of&#xd;
side-channel vulnerabilities involving the CPU cache, and identifi es the shortcomings&#xd;
of traditional defenses in a Cloud environment. It explores why solutions to non-Cloud cache-based side-channels cease to work in Cloud environments, and describes&#xd;
new mitigation techniques applicable for Cloud security. Speci cally, it separates&#xd;
canonical cache-based side-channel attacks into two categories, Sequential and Parallel attacks, based on their implementation and devises a unique mitigation technique&#xd;
for each. Applying these solutions to a canonical Cloud environment, this thesis&#xd;
demonstrates the validity of these Cloud-specifi c, cache-based side-channel mitigation techniques. Furthermore, it shows that they can be implemented, together, as a&#xd;
server-side approach to improve security without inconveniencing the client. Finally,&#xd;
it conducts a comparison of our solutions to the current state-of-the-art.</description>

   <description>Overweight and obesity in Mexican children substantiates the need to identify effective strategies and policies to address this problem.  Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica (INSP) designed and implemented a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess an ecologically-based intervention program to modify the school environment to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours in children. The objectives of this thesis are to describe the design and impact of this RCT, to examine the program content through an ecological approach, and to examine policy activities that have been informed by the RCT findings. Four manuscripts address these objectives. Manuscript one is Promoting a Healthful Diet and Physical Activity in the Mexican School System for the Prevention of Obesity in Children:  Rationale, Design and Methods. It describes the rationale, design, and methods of the two-year INSP-Secretaria de Educacion Publica (Secretary of Public Education, SEP) RCT. Manuscript two is Impact of a School-based Intervention Program on Obesity Risk Factors in Mexican Children. It reports on the environmental impact of the INSP-SEP intervention by comparing 16 intervention schools with 11 non-intervention schools.  Results showed increased availability and food intake of healthy foods with a concomitant decrease in unhealthy food availability in intervention schools/children. Manuscript three is An Ecological and Theoretical Deconstruction of a School-based Obesity Prevention Program in Mexico. It reports on an assessment of the integration of ecological principles and theoretical constructs in the school-based behavioural change/obesity prevention intervention carried out by the INSP-SEP. Results showed that 32 intervention strategies were implemented in the school setting to engage target-groups; the most used SCT construct was Reciprocal Determinism. Manuscript four is titled Quality and Implementation of the Nutrition and Physical Activity School Policy Guidelines in Mexico City. It assesses the quality and implementation conditions of a policy and reports on the implementation and the uptake of the national school policy to prevent obesity in Mexico city through a policy analysis, WHO School Policy Framework (SPF) and indicators informed by the national policy. Findings showed that not all of the 10 implementation pre-conditions were met; School Guidelines mostly complied with SPF but were not fully implemented within our sample.</description>

   <description>Climate change and anthropogenic activities have been known to change the rate of productivity and physical characteristics of temperate lakes. This paleolimnologcial study examines the effect of recent climate change and watershed land-usage activities in nine lakes in the North Frontenac/Addington Highlands region of Ontario, and aims to predict future lake changes based on recent trends. Despite this region being identified as an area highly susceptible to the effects of climate change, no scientific studies have examined the effects of these changes on lakes of the region. Lake sediment analysis for chlorophyll-a concentration, and organic carbon and nitrogen deposition indicate that production has increased in the majority of study lakes in the approximate past century. Water column sampling for dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, conductivity, and turbidity found the majority of lakes to be thermally stratified and hypoxic in the bottom waters during the ice-covered and ice-free seasons. Climate records also indicate mean annual air temperatures have been increasing since the early 20th century. It was concluded that climate change is increasing production in the lakes of the North Frontenac/Addington Highlands region, and that future increases may increase the zone of hypoxia within the study lakes, or cause anoxia in the lakes. Additionally, it was also found that individual watershed land-usage events (i.e. logging, road construction) affected some of the study lakes, and possibly amplified the increase in production found in some. These findings assist in developing future lake mitigation methods, and preventing future increases in productivity.</description>

   <description>Voice disorders affect up to 9% of the population, and can be caused by vocal fold scarring. They can reduce the ability of a person to participate in the workplace and can also cause depression in individuals. Vocal fold scarring changes the organization and composition of the lamina propria, and affects the biomechanical properties of the tissue. These changes cause an inability of the lamina propria to produce a normal mucosal wave during speech, resulting in hoarseness or complete voice loss. Currently there is a clinical need for treatment options for vocal fold scarring. &#xd;
This work focuses on developing a novel, elastomeric electrospun biomaterial to be used as a model system to evaluate the response of immortalized human vocal fold fibroblast cells (HVFF) to scaffold architecture and to the presence of an elastin polypeptide. The scaffold was developed by electrospinning Tecoflex™. Electrospun scaffolds were successfully made with aligned and unaligned fibers, and they were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and uniaxial tensile testing. The aligned scaffolds had initial elastic moduli of ~14 MPa and ~0.3 MPa in the preferred and cross-preferred direction respectively. The unaligned scaffolds had initial elastic moduli of ~5 MPa and ~0.6 MPa in the preferred and cross-preferred direction respectively. An elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) developed in the Woodhouse lab, ELP4, was successfully adsorbed onto the scaffolds to investigate the effect of ELP’s on the HVFF cells. HVFF cells were seeded onto the scaffolds and their viability, proliferation, morphology, and gene expression were characterized. Over the culture period the cells remained viable, and showed signs of proliferation. The scaffold topography had a significant impact on the orientation of the cells, with very aligned cultures on the aligned scaffold, and randomly oriented cells on the unaligned scaffold. The scaffold alignment and the ELP4 coating impacted the extracellular matrix gene expression. The ELP4 coating, and the aligned scaffolds promoted elastin synthesis when tested on day 7, and may also reduce collagen-3 expression on day 3. These results signify that aligned electrospun scaffolds, as well as an ELP4 coating, may be promising to use in future biodegradable vocal fold constructs.</description>

   <description>Myocardial infarction (MI) is primarily caused by blockade of the coronary circulation, resulting in ischemic insult. The only available remedy is reperfusion, which induces oxidative stress and activates inflammatory responses at the site of injury. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are potent pro-inflammatory mediators that exert their effects through two classical receptors: cysLT receptor 1 (CysLT1R) and cysLT receptor 2 (CysLT2R), the latter of which is prevalent in the heart and circulatory system and has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. However, although endothelial CysLT2R overexpression exacerbates MI damage and induces vascular hyperpermeability, understanding of CysLT2R activation-induced mechanisms is poor, as isolating CysLT2R-specific effects has proven difficult due to a lack of appropriate pharmacological agents. We investigate herein the role of CysLT2R activation in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We have characterized a novel CysLT2R-selective antagonist BayCysLT2 in both in vitro and in vivo systems, and establish that CysLT2R-selective antagonism attenuates exacerbated MI injury, adhesion molecule gene regulation, and myocardial neutrophil presence observed in CysLT2R overexpressing (EC) mice. We also examined effects of CysLT2R antagonism in long-term cardiac remodeling post-myocardial infarction, and found that blockade of CysLT2R post-reperfusion, regardless of whether CysLT2R is overexpressed or not, elicits a mild pathological cardiac hypertrophic response despite mitigating infarction damage to the apical ventricular wall. Finally, we created a novel mouse model (EC/KO) that expresses CysLT2R predominantly in vascular endothelium in order to identify tissue-specific mechanisms of CysLT2R activation. Surprisingly, MI injury was attenuated in EC/KO mice, indicating that both endothelial and non-endothelial CysLT2R expression subsets have roles in mediating infarction injury. Indeed, EC/KO mice demonstrated hyperpermeability in cremaster venules only when leukotrienes are applied, in contrast to EC mice. In addition, endothelial CysLT2R activation facilitates leukocyte transmigration, whereas non-endothelial CysLT2Rs regulate basal rolling leukocyte flux in microvasculature. Although much work remains to be done, the characterization of a CysLT2R-selective antagonist provides a vital tool for CysLT2R research moving forward, and our investigation of CysLT2R activation reveal the existence of a complicated and multi-faceted pathway resulting in activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms.</description>

   <description>Cyclododecane (CDD) is a waxy, solid cyclic hydrocarbon (C12H24) that sublimes at room temperature and possesses strong hydrophobicity. In paper conservation CDD is used principally as a temporary fixative of water-soluble media during aqueous treatments. Hydrophobicity, ease of reversibility, low toxicity, and absence of residues are reasons often cited for its use over alternative materials although the latter two claims continue to be debated in the literature. The sublimation rate has important implications for treatment planning as well as health and safety considerations given the dearth of reliable information on its toxicity and exposure limits. This study examined how the rate of sublimation is affected by fiber type, sizing, and surface finish as well as delivery in the molten phase and as a saturated solution in low boiling petroleum ether. The effect of warming the paper prior to application was also evaluated. Sublimation was monitored using gravimetric analysis after which samples were tested for residues with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) to confirm complete sublimation. Water absorbency tests were conducted to determine whether this property is fully reestablished. Results suggested that the sublimation rate of CDD is affected minimally by all of the paper characteristics and application methods examined in this study. The main factors influencing the rate appear to be the thickness and mass of the CDD over a given surface area as well as temperature and ventilation. The GC-FID results showed that most of the CDD sublimed within several days of its disappearance from the paper surface regardless of the application method. Minimal changes occurred in the water absorbency of the samples following complete sublimation.</description>

   <description>The study of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has been hindered by the absence of animal models of late-onset/age-related AD (also termed sporadic AD) (95% of AD cases) since current transgenic mouse models exhibit pathological changes dependent on overexpression of mutant human genes linked to early-onset, familial AD (5% of cases). Oxidative stress is considered to be a causative factor in age-related AD, and we have found that aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Aldh2) null mice exhibit not only oxidative stress, but also display many AD-like pathologies. The current study used behavioral analysis to assess whether Aldh2-/- mice also exhibit memory and cognition deficits. Male and female wild type and Aldh2-/- mice were tested monthly beginning at three months of age, using the open field novel object recognition test (a measure of recognition memory), as well as spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze (a measure of spatial working memory). In both tasks, significant decreases in performance occurred in Aldh2-/- mice by 3.5-4 months of age, and this progressively declined over the next three months compared to wild type mice. Sex-related differences in memory impairment were not observed. These results, together with the findings that AD-like pathologies are also present, suggest that Aldh2-/- mice represent a new, oxidative stress-based model of age-related cognitive impairment and AD. This model may prove useful both for assessing AD therapeutics and for gaining better insight into the pathogenesis of AD.</description>
