   <description>The ability to exercise for more than a short period requires energy to be supplied by using oxygen (aerobic energy supply).  How quickly we can supply energy depends on how much oxygen we can deliver to muscles. Similarly, delivery of oxygen (O2 del) to the brain is important as brief, transient disruptions can cause nausea or fainting.  Therefore, regulation of O2 del so that the O2 supply matches the metabolic requirement (O2 del matching metabolic demand) is essential to exercise tolerance and brain function. O2 del to the brain is often researched in response to orthostatic stress, however little is known about vascular responses protecting O2 del.  In muscle, use of a forearm exercise model is common as measuring O2 del is difficult in other exercise modalities.  Unfortunately, it is also difficult to measure/test metabolism in the forearm. Hence, measuring O2 del response to exercise at a known metabolic intensity is difficult.  Purpose:  To investigate O2 del matching metabolic demand in the following manner: 1) develop a repeatable and reliable critical power (CP, highest sustainable rate of aerobic metabolism) test for the forearm exercise model 2) discover if individual differences in O2 del account for differences in forearm CP (fCP) 3) determine if fCP is sensitive to changes in O2 del 4) characterize cerebral vascular response to an orthostatic challenge Methods:  Echo and Doppler ultrasound measured blood flow through the brachial artery.  Venous blood samples were used to measure hemoglobin and O2 content for calculations of O2 del and consumption. Middle cerebral blood velocity measured via transcranial Doppler ultrasound.  Blood pressure was measured using finger photoplethysmography.  Results: 1) fCP can be accurately estimated from a maximal effort handgripping test 2) Inter-individual differences in O2 del account for most of the variance in fCP 3) fCP is sensitive to changes in O2 del 4) cerebral vascular responses blunt cerebral hypoperfusion in response to initial orthostatic hypotension.  Conclusions: CP is an exercise characteristic of aerobic metabolism which is dependent on and sensitive to O2 del.  Therefore, fCP can be used in the forearm exercise model to research O2 del-metabolism matching.</description>

   <description>Music is often used by its advocates as a vehicle to promote positive changes in students, academically, emotionally, and socially (Catterall, Chapleau &amp; Iwanaga, 1999; Fiske 1999). In this study, I examined the implementation, in my own public elementary classroom, of a five-month Character Really Matters! songwriting program that I developed. The study is designed to provide insight into the potential impact of such songwriting music programs on students’ character development. The study examined the connections students made between the songwriting program and their lives. The data for this study were derived from a guided student reflection form used as a normal part of teaching. To provide further elucidation of the impact of the songwriting program on students’ character development, I supplemented the reflection-form data with my direct classroom observations using field notes and a character-tracking checklist. Findings from the research revealed connections between songwriting and its impact on developing children’s work habits in collaboration, cooperation, commitment to quality work, and in turn, character development. By writing songs, students were able to tell stories and reflect on their learning from their songwriting experiences. The findings from this study inform the justification and improvement of the program and contribute to the school board’s body of evidence used to examine its character education program.</description>

   <description>The development of small-diameter artificial blood vessels that mimic the properties of natural blood vessels has proven to be a clinical challenge. While autologous vessels are the standard, they can be difficult to obtain and require invasive surgeries. Synthetic materials have been successful in large diameter applications, but they have been unsuccessful in small-caliber environments due to a number of factors including thrombus formation, intimal hyperplasia, and infection. Intimal hyperplasia, of particular interest in this study, involves the build up of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the intimal layer of the artery due to abnormal migration and proliferation. This work focuses on the development of a new polymer that has the potential to function as an intimal/medial component of a small-diameter blood vessel. Using recombinant elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) developed by the Woodhouse laboratory, as well as chondroitin sulphate-specific binding sequences (CSBD1 and CSBD2) determined by the Panitch laboratory, a new elastin-like polypeptide-chondroitin sulphate binding domain (ELP-CSBD) block copolymer has been developed and characterized. The expression of the ELP1-CSBDs was accomplished using E. coli BL21 cells in a bioreactor or shaker flask systems. The polypeptides were purified using dialysis and ion exchange chromatography and expression and purity were characterized using mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Both ELP1-CSBDs were successfully expressed using these methods and ELP1-CSBD1 was produced to high purities. ELP1-CSBD1 was able to undergo coacervation in vitro, suggesting that ELP1-CSBD1 is able to self-assemble in a manner similar to native elastin. In the presence of the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulphate (CS), the temperature of coacervation of ELP1-CSBD1 is increased, the rate and extent of coacervation is decreased, and aggregates remain in solution even at higher temperatures. The influence of heparin was also explored as previous studies indicated that the CS binding domains were shown to also bind to heparin. Studies completed in the presence of heparin showed that there were no significant changes to the coacervation characteristics of ELP1-CSBD1. It is anticipated that when combined with CS, ELP1-CSBD1 will gel, forming a basis for an intimal/medial layer of a TEBV that will modulate SMC response and increase graft integrity.</description>

   <description>Solar power is a clean, renewable source of energy. There is a growing demand for cheap, high efficiency photovoltaic cells. Of the many emerging solar harvesting technologies, a concept that has not been widely explored is that of optical antennas.&#xd;
In 1972 Bailey et al.[1] explored scaling down of antenna technology to match the solar spectrum. A recent review was given by Lukas Novotny et al.[2], in which they outline the major hurdles as being the lack of reliable nano-fabrication and an inability to rectify into the Tera-hertz frequencies band.&#xd;
Presently we aim to fabricate photovoltaic cells that incorporate an array of vertically aligned metallic nano-rods (MNR). Porous aluminum oxide (PAO) is used as a nano-structured template for growth of the MNR. PAO exhibit vertically aligned pores (D = 20 - 200nm) in a densely packed hexagonal arrangement. MNR fabrication is achieved through templated electrochemical deposition, and investigated with SEM and VIS-IR spectroscopy.&#xd;
MNR samples have been specifically designed to be incorporated as a photoactive material for a novel photovoltaic cell. Through fine control of their length, the&#xd;
MNR excitation energy can be tuned to the visible spectrum. Excitation of the MNR leads to energy transfer with localized acceptor molecules, creating a rectification of the field. The fabrication of MNR helps progress the development of the proposed antenna photovoltaic device.&#xd;

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to examine the photophysical and structural properties of Ru(II)/Re(I) based bimetallic complexes based on p-[N-2-(2’-pyridyl)benzimidazolyl]-[N-2-(2’-pyridyl)indolyl]-benzene (L1) ligand, as well as the photophysical and photochemical properties of N^C-chelate 4-coordinate organoboron compounds that contain a metal acetylide group.&#xd;
Ligand L1 was synthesized and fully characterized. Due to the incorporation of two distinct chelating sites, an N^N-chelate site and an N^C-chelate site, L1 has been found to be very effective in selective binding to two different metal ions. &#xd;
Two new heterobimetallic complexes Ru(II)-Pt(II) and Ru(II)-Pd(II) using L1 as the bridging ligand were prepared and fully characterized. All Ru(II)-containing complexes have been found to be luminescent. The Pt(II) unit appears to enhance phosphorescent efficiency of the Ru(II) unit while the Pd(II) unit has little influence.&#xd;
Using L1 as the bridging unit, two new Re(I) based heterobimetallic complexes Re(I)-Pt(II) and Re(I)-Pd(II) were also successfully synthesized. Results indicate that there is communication between the two different metal centers. The preliminary results indicated that the mononuclear Re(I) complex based on L1 is a promising candidate for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. &#xd;
Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes were synthesized with an atropisomeric bis-pyridyl chelate ligand bis{3,3’-[N-Ph-2-(2’-py) indolyl]} (L4). To examine the potential use of the trans-chelate L4 ligand in oxidative coupling reactions catalyzed by Pd(II) compounds, acetoxylation of arenes by PhI(OAc)2 using PhI(OAc)2/L4 (2:1) as the catalyst was examined and found to accelerate the reaction, but lower the overall yield.&#xd;
Finally, to examine the impact of metal ions on photochromic properties of N^C-chelate organoboron compounds, three metal acetylide compounds that contain a photo-active N^C-chelate BMes2 unit (B(ppy)Mes2) were prepared and fully characterized. The studies indicated that by taking advantage of different heavy metals the photoisomerization quantum efficiency of the boron chromophores can be readily tuned through the adjustment of 3LC state localized on the chelate backbone or the involvement of MLCT state in the lowest energy electronic transition.</description>

   <description>In a public cloud computing environment, consumers cannot always just depend on the cloud provider’s security infrastructure. They may need to monitor and protect their virtual existence by implementing their own intrusion detection capabilities along with other security technologies within the cloud fabric. Also, cloud consumers may want to collect network traffic and log them for further analysis. This can help them in writing tailor-made attacking scenarios specifically designed based on the nature of the application they want to protect. Furthermore, consumers’ applications can be distributed among different regions of the cloud or in non-cloud locations. The need to protect all these assets from a centralized location is fundamental to many cloud consumers.&#xd;
&#xd;
We provide a framework and implementation for an intrusion detection system that is suitable for the public cloud environment. The Intrusion Detection as a Service (IDSaaS) targets security of the infrastructure level for a public cloud (IaaS) by providing intrusion detection technology that is highly elastic, portable and fully controlled by the cloud consumer. These features allow cloud consumers to protect their cloud-based applications from security threats and unauthorized intruders. We developed a proof-of-concept prototype on Amazon EC2 cloud and performed different experiments to evaluate its performance. After examining the experimental results, we found that IDSaaS can provide the required protection in a reasonable and effective manner.</description>

   <description>The morphology and mechanical properties of foams made out of ethylene-α-olefin copolymers (EC) having well-characterized rheological properties were investigated. The polymers differed in the amount of comonomer contained, type of comonomer and molecular weight, resulting in variable thermal properties and different rheological responses under shear and extensional flow. All of the octene-based copolymers with comparable rheological properties had similar foam morphology. However grades with low extensional viscosity and low crystallization points resulted in poor foams. Increasing density resulted in a higher secant modulus of the foamed samples. To further investigate the effects of material properties, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA) and triallyl trimesate (TAM) coagents were used to generate a series of PP derivatives through radical mediated melt state reactive modification. Coagent modification resulted in pronounced effects in the molecular weights and viscosities of the derivatives. However, evidence of long-chain branching (LCB) was only present in TAM modified PPs. Significant increases in the crystallization temperature, heat of fusion and crystallization rate were attributed to the formation of nanoparticles, which resulted in a heterogeneous nucleation effect, both for crystallization and foaming. Generally lower viscosities, coupled by strain hardening, enhanced nucleation and increased crystallization temperatures induced by the nanoparticles resulted in foams with higher expansion ratios and smaller cells, due to higher rates of cell growth, coupled with suppressed coalescence. Nanocomposites based on isotactic PP and nanosilica (SiO2) were prepared using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder (TSE) in order to investigate foaming on a larger scale. High shear stress, sufficient residence time, and high fill ratio in the melting section of the screw were the most important factors in achieving good nanosilica dispersion. Well-dispersed surface-modified hydrophobic SiO2 particles were effective nucleating agents for foaming, when used at loadings below 1 phr.</description>

   <description>Morton’s syndrome is a foot condition where the 1st metatarsal does not protrude as far distally as the 2nd metatarsal.  Clinicians believe that short 1st metatarsal protrusion affects foot mechanics and leads to painful conditions of the foot.  Normal protrusion ratio of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal has not been delineated in scientific literature, and little is known about the mechanics of feet with short 1st metatarsal protrusion beyond anecdotal clinical evidence.  In the first part of this two-part study, a novel tool was developed to guide metatarsal measurement and reduce measurement error so values for normal metatarsal protrusion ratios could be established.  In the second part, subjects were divided into those with shorter and longer than average 1st metatarsal protrusion ratio and we measured if there were any differences in the foot-floor forces between the two groups. &#xd;
In Part 1, the feet of 65 healthy subjects were measured with a novel measurement tool and it was determined that the average ratio (1st metatarsal/2nd metatarsal) was 0.902, suggesting a 1st metatarsal that does not protrude as far distally as the 2nd metatarsal.  For Part 2, participants were divided into two groups: the short 1st metatarsal group had a ratio of more than one standard deviation below the mean (0.866 or lower) while the control group had a metatarsal ratio of more than one standard deviation above the mean (0.938 or higher).  &#xd;
We hypothesized that short 1st metatarsal protrusion would cause an imbalance across the forefoot because the 1st metatarsal would not be able to carry the required load on the medial side of the foot; however, the results of the gait study did not show this as only forces in the walking direction near toe-off correlated with metatarsal protrusion ratio.  We can only speculate as to the relationship between the metatarsal protrusion ratio and increased shear force in the walking direction, but it is possible that to compensate for the diminished stabilizing capacity of the shorter 1st metatarsal, the foot must push off with more force to propel the body forward.</description>

   <description>Through an exploration of Toronto-based artist Allyson Mitchell’s craft-art, this thesis investigates the complexities surrounding the functions and roles of public and private spaces; particularly the home and the fine art museum within Canadian society.  I propose a reading of Mitchell’s art practice, activism, scholarship, and curatorial activities that focuses on a queering of both private domestic space and public social space through a conflation of the two.  Mitchell’s textile installations make intimate and cozy the otherwise impersonal space of the public art museum, while Mitchell queers the heteronormative space of the family home by turning it into a public art institution, an archive and a classroom.  &#xd;
Mitchell’s bright textile enclosures, "Hungry Purse: The Vagina Dentata in Late Capitalism" and "Menstrual Hut, Sweet Menstrual Hut," for example, visibly disrupt the sanitized and impersonal space of the art museum, disrupting the dominant ideological framework that privileges normative assumptions of sexuality and sexual identity, and exclusionary hierarchies of class, able-bodiedness and access.  While Mitchell’s theatrical textile installation, "Ladies Sasquatch," has predominantly been theorized as a queer critique of the myths of femininity, gender, sexuality, and the detrimental treatment of the female body within popular media; I present a reading of "Ladies Sasquatch" as a radical decolonizing spectacle that has the potential to interrupt larger nationalistic and colonial narratives reproduced by museums.  Through these powerful interventions in public and private space, I suggest that Mitchell’s crafty installations offer playful acts of resistance that create counter narratives which function to decolonize our physical, psychic and emotional space, while also creating new imaginings that undermine the status quo.</description>

   <description>Environmental and physical conditions are considered primary drivers of fish community assemblages. The anthropogenic alteration of aquatic ecosystems is implicated as a primary threat to fisheries worldwide. In riverine ecosystems, river-wide barriers may alter natural fluvial processes and hinder fish movement through the system. In this study, I use data collected from two successive years (2008 and 2009) of intensive quantitative electrofishing Casselman and Marcogliese (2008, 2009) performed in different seasons (late fall and late summer) on the lower Ottawa and Mississippi River systems, Ontario, to investigate the effects of sampling season, distance from the river mouth, water temperature, conductivity, rank of velocity and dams on fish abundance, species richness and the Shannon-Weiner Index (SWI) as a measure of species diversity.  Sampling in late summer, compared with late fall, resulted in greater species richness and diversity.  Colder water temperature affected community composition, and species richness decreased upstream, while diversity did not change. In both seasons, the distance from the river mouth influenced fish community composition, whereas dams appeared to have no effect. This suggests that the continuous gradient model of the River Continuum Concept (RCC) would be applicable in these fragmented systems, which are not heavily altered by fractionation. To effectively manage cost and accuracy when collecting fish community data in large rivers, it is essential to sample strategically during seasons likely to maximize diversity and richness. Sampling intensively during warm water months in various river reaches would likely provide the most complete representation of fish assemblage.</description>

   <title>Characterization of the Alphaherpesvirus Tegument Protein US2</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2013-01-21 01:25:54.103</description>
   <description>Members of the Herpesviridae are large enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, whose virions are comprised of a viral genome-containing icosahedral capsid, a layer of tegument and a glycoprotein-embedded envelope. The tegument contains numerous viral proteins and cellular proteins. Most of the tegument proteins are poorly understood and require further investigation. This study focuses on one of the tegument proteins, Us2, and utilizes two model alphaherpesviruses: pseudorabies virus (PRV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). &#xd;
Us2 is conserved among all alphaherpesvirus with the exception of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The amino acid sequence of all Us2 orthologs share three N-terminal conserved regions whereas the C-terminal sequences are highly variable. PRV Us2 contains a C-terminal prenylation motif that targets Us2 to the plasma membrane. Although it is indispensable for virus growth in cell culture, deletion of Us2 gene in PRV caused an accumulation of virions in the cytoplasm of infected primary cells. Furthermore, PRV Us2 spatially regulates MAPK ERK activity by sequestering it to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of ERK kinase activity caused a delay in the release of extracellular viruses and the defect was more profound in PRV Us2-null virus infected cells. Altogether, these data suggest a requirement for ERK activity and significance of PRV Us2-ERK interaction in virus egress. To understand the mechanism of Us2-ERK interaction, PRV Us2 determinants for ERK interaction were mapped. Our data revealed that the N-terminal 214 residues are the minimal sequence of Us2 required for interaction with ERK. In addition, PRV Us2 oligomerizes and forms complexes with ERK via the ERK common docking (CD) domain that facilitates the interaction of ERK with many of its substrates.&#xd;
Unlike PRV Us2, HSV-2 Us2 does not have any putative membrane targeting signals. However, our data revealed that HSV-2 Us2 localizes to the plasma membrane and is lipid raft associated. In addition, HSV-2 Us2 interacts directly with ubiquitin. As ubiquitination is responsible for proteasomal degradation and is involved in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, these findings suggest that Us2 may be involved in proteasomal degradation pathways that counteract host defenses, or participate in final envelopment in endocytic compartments by facilitating the endocytosis of viral envelope proteins.</description>

   <description>Enabled by advanced communication and information technologies, the smart grid represents a major transformation for the electricity sector. Vast quantities of data and two-way communications abilities create the potential for a flexible, data-driven, multi-directional supply and consumption network well equipped to meet the challenges of the next century. For electricity service providers (“utilities”), the smart grid provides opportunities for improved business practices and new business models; however, a transformation of such magnitude is not without risks. &#xd;
&#xd;
Three related studies are conducted to explore the implications of the smart grid on utilities’ demand-side activities. An initial conceptual framework, based on organizational information processing theory, suggests that utilities’ performance depends on the fit between the information processing requirements and capacities associated with a given demand-side activity. Using secondary data and multiple regression analyses, the first study finds, consistent with OIPT, a positive relationship between utilities’ advanced meter deployments and demand-side management performance. However, it also finds that meters with only data collection capacities are associated with lower performance, suggesting the presence of information waste causing operational inefficiencies. In the second study, interviews with industry participants provide partial support for the initial conceptual model, new insights are gained with respect to information processing fit and information waste, and “big data” is identified as a central theme of the smart grid. To derive richer theoretical insights, the third study employs a grounded theory approach examining the experience of one successful utility in detail.  Based on interviews and documentary data, the paradox of dynamic stability emerges as an essential enabler of utilities’ performance in the smart grid environment. Within this context, the frames of opportunity, control, and data limitation interact to support dynamic stability and contribute to innovation within tradition.&#xd;
&#xd;
The main contributions of this thesis include theoretical extensions to OIPT and the development of an emergent model of dynamic stability in relation to big data. The thesis also adds to the green IS literature and identifies important practical implications for utilities as they endeavour to bring the smart grid to reality.</description>

   <description>JavaScript is the most widely used client-side scripting language, and has become&#xd;
increasingly popular as a crucial component of the AJAX technology. JavaScript&#xd;
is a dynamic, weakly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that supports&#xd;
object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. Many di erent programmers&#xd;
appreciate this &#xd;
exibility when implementing complex and interactive web&#xd;
applications. This wide range of possible styles can hinder program comprehension&#xd;
and make maintenance di cult, especially in large projects involving many di erent&#xd;
programmers. A particular problem is the several di erent ways in which objectoriented&#xd;
classes can be expressed in JavaScript. In this work we aim at enhancing&#xd;
the maintainability of object-oriented JavaScript applications by automatically normalizing&#xd;
the representation of classes to a single model. We begin by analyzing the&#xd;
di erent ways that JavaScript programmers have represented the class concept, identifying&#xd;
and cataloguing the di erent class patterns used in the language. We choose&#xd;
one of these, and show how it is possible to automatically migrate JavaScript applications&#xd;
from any mix of class styles to the chosen one, making it easier to understand&#xd;
and maintain object-oriented JavaScript programs.</description>

   <title>Joint Modelling of Longitudinal Quality of Life Measurements and Survival Data in Cancer Clinical Trials</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2013-01-23 14:04:14.297</description>
   <description>In cancer clinical trials, longitudinal Quality of Life (QoL)&#xd;
measurements on a patient may be analyzed by classical linear&#xd;
mixed models but some patients may drop out of study due to&#xd;
recurrence or death, which causes problems in the application of&#xd;
classical methods. Joint modelling of longitudinal QoL&#xd;
measurements and survival times may be employed to explain the&#xd;
dropout information of longitudinal QoL measurements, and provide&#xd;
more efficient estimation, especially when there is strong&#xd;
association between longitudinal measurements and survival times.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Most joint models in the literature assumed classical linear mixed&#xd;
model for longitudinal measurements, and Cox's proportional&#xd;
hazards model for survival times. The linear mixed model with&#xd;
normal-distribution random effects may not be sufficient to model&#xd;
longitudinal QoL measurements. Moreover, with advances in medical&#xd;
research, long-term survivors may exist, which makes the&#xd;
proportional hazards assumption not suitable for survival times&#xd;
when some censoring times are due to potential cured patients.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose new models to analyze longitudinal QoL&#xd;
measurements and survival times jointly. In the first part of this&#xd;
thesis, we develop a joint model which assumes a linear mixed tt&#xd;
model for longitudinal measurements and a promotion time cure&#xd;
model for survival data. We link these two models through a latent&#xd;
variable and develop a semiparametric inference procedure. The&#xd;
second part of this thesis considers a special feature of the QoL&#xd;
measurements. That is, they are constrained in an interval&#xd;
(0,1). We propose to take into account this feature by a&#xd;
simplex-distribution model for these QoL measurements. Classical&#xd;
proportional hazards and promotion time cure models are used&#xd;
separately to the situations, depending on whether a cure fraction&#xd;
is assumed in the data or not. In both cases, we characterize the&#xd;
correlation between the longitudinal measurements and survival&#xd;

   <description>Our increasing reliance on mobile devices has given rise to a new class of software applications (i.e., mobile apps).  Tens of thousands of developers have developed hundreds of thousands of mobile apps that are available across multiple platforms.  These apps are used by millions of people around the world every day.  However, most software engineering research has been performed on large desktop or server applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
We believe that research efforts must begin to examine mobile apps.  Mobile apps are rapidly growing, yet they differ from traditionally-studied desktop/server applications.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we examine such apps by performing three quantitative studies.  First, we study differences in the size of the code bases and development teams of desktop/server applications and mobile apps.  We then study differences in the code, dependency and churn properties of mobile apps from two different mobile platforms.  Finally, we study the impact of size, coupling, cohesion and code reuse on the quality of mobile apps.&#xd;
&#xd;
Some of the most notable findings are that mobile apps are much smaller than traditionally-studied desktop/server applications and that most mobile apps tend to be developed by only one or two developers.  Mobile app developers tend to rely heavily on functionality provided by the underlying mobile platform through platform-specific APIs.  We find that Android app developers tend to rely on the Android platform more than BlackBerry app developers rely on the BlackBerry platform.  We also find that defects in Android apps tend to be concentrated in a small number of files and that files that depend on the Android platform tend to have more defects.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our results indicate that major differences exist between mobile apps and traditionally-studied desktop/server applications.  However, the mobile apps of two different mobile platforms also differ.  Further, our results suggest that mobile app developers should avoid excessive platform dependencies and focus their testing efforts on source code files that rely heavily on the underlying mobile platform.  Given the widespread use of mobile apps and the lack of research surrounding these apps, we believe that our results will have significant impact on software engineering research.</description>

   <description>Spilled heavy fuel oil (HFO) sinks within the water column and accumulates in sediments, affecting aquatic organisms that are not typically exposed to oils that float. Previously, the 3-4 ring alkyl substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified as the major toxic components in crude oil. Since HFO is comprised of higher concentrations of 3-4 ringed alkyl PAH and an abundance of 5-6 ringed PAH relative to crude oil, it is predicted to be more toxic to the early life stages of fish. An effects-driven chemical fractionation (EDCF) of HFO 7102 was undertaken to establish the toxicity relative to crude oil, and to identify the compounds that are bioavailable and chronically toxic to the early life stages of fish. In this EDCF, the complex HFO 7102 mixture was separated by low temperature vacuum distillation into three distinct fractions, 2, 3 and 4. Each fraction was assessed using a chronic bioassay to determine whether it contained components that caused toxicity to rainbow trout embryos similar to that of the whole oil. Acute bioassays with juvenile trout demonstrated the presence of compounds that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, an indicator of exposure to PAH. Fraction 3, the fraction more toxic than the parent mixture, was further separated by cold acetone extraction into fraction 3-1 (PAH-rich extract) and fraction 3-2 (wax residue), and assessed with the same bioassays. Simultaneous chemical analysis with bioassays guided the fractionation, and identified compounds abundant and consistently present in toxic fractions.  Due to resistance to dispersion of HFO, a chemical dispersant was used with vigorous mixing to drive the maximum amount of oil into solution to minimize the potential for false negatives and the volume of test material used. The potency of HFO 7102 and its fractions were also measured using water accommodated fractions (WAFs) produced by a continuous flow system of water flowing through oil coated gravel. Both exposure methods traced the toxicity from whole oil into fractions containing higher concentrations of 3-4 ring alkyl PAH, similar to crude oil. This research is the first toxicological assessment of HFO 7102, which is essential for determining the risk of spills of HFO to fish, and whether the risk of oils can be predicted from their alkyl PAH composition.</description>

   <description>Metalloproteins represent a large portion of the total proteome. When bound to a protein a metal ion influences both protein stability and function through structural, catalytic or regulatory roles. Discovery of a metal ion cofactor presents new insight into both the structural and functional aspects of a protein and can be essential for the elucidation of the functional and mechanistic details of a protein of interest. The cupin, 2-oxoglutarate/Fe2+-dependent oxygenases (2OG oxygenases) and the di-iron oxygenase families of metalloproteins exemplify the diversity and catalytic potential of a metal ion cofactor, as well as the conservation of 3-dimensional fold and structural features in proteins with similar functions. The structural and biochemical characterization of three novel microbial metalloenzymes are presented; two Escherichia coli hypothetical proteins of previously unknown function, E. coli cupin sugar isomerase (EcSI) and a 2OG oxygenase, YcfD, and the novel microbial carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond cleavage enzyme, PhnZ, are presented. In each case the identification of a metal ion cofactor and structure determination led to important functional insights. EcSI is encoded by a gene that is highly conserved among pathogenic bacteria. It has been identified as a sugar isomerase with specificity for the rare sugar D-lyxose as well as D-mannose based on structural homology to the cupin phosphoglucose isomerases, suggesting a role for EcSI in metabolism of alternative carbon sources. Structural homology of YcfD, the second metalloenzyme, to the 2OG oxygenase family, particularily human proteins involved in ribosome assembly, combined with evidence that YcfD interacts with the essential ribosomal protein L-16 provides the first evidence of translational regulation by a 2OG oxygenase in E. coli. The third metalloenzyme, PhnZ, was previously identified as an iron dependent oxygenase. Structural characterization revealed that PhnZ possesses a di-iron cofactor and shows significant structural homology to a di-iron oxygenase, providing structural evidence for its novel mechanism of C-P bond cleavage. Combined, these three structures also highlight several features of metal ion-enzyme interaction and regulation mechanisms employed by metalloenzymes as well as the importance of structure in the elucidation of functional and mechanistic characteristics of a protein.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we examine 360 degree curvilinear displays and their potential for the display of 3D information. We present two systems: a spherical display prototype and a cylindrical display. Our spherical display prototype used the lack of set user position and natural visibility constraints of a spherical display to create a 3D display system that treated the sphere as a volumetric display through the use of 360 degree motion parallax and stereoscopy. We evaluated these properties by examining how our use of stereoscopy and 360 degree motion parallax, might aid in the preservation of basic body orientation cues and in pose estimation tasks in a telepresence application with our final cylindrical display. Results suggest the combined presence of 360 degree motion parallax and stereoscopic cues within our cylindrical display significantly improved the accuracy with which participants were able to assess gaze and hand pointing cues, &#xd;
and to instruct others on 3D body poses. The inclusion of 360 degree motion parallax and &#xd;
stereoscopic cues also led to significant increases in the sense of social presence and telepresence reported by participants.</description>

   <description>Guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences can fold, in the presence of alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, into G-quadruplex structures. These alkali metal ions are necessary for the stabilization of G-quadruplex structures. However, little is known about the ion dynamics in G-quadruplex structures. In this thesis, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the energetics of ion transport in G-quadruplex DNA channels. In particular, we applied, for the first time, adaptive biasing force (ABF) and umbrella sampling (US) methods to obtain potential of mean force (PMF) profiles for Na+, K+, and NH4+ ion movement along [d(TG4T)]4 and [d(G3T4G4)]2 channels. We found that the ABF and US methods produce very similar PMF profiles, in qualitative agreement with the very limited experimental data in the literature. &#xd;
We found that, within a G-quadruplex channel, K+ and NH4+ ions experience significant energy barriers (13-17 kcal/mol) to cross a G-quartet, whereas the Na+ movement encounters minimal resistance (5-7 kcal/mol). All ions are nearly fully dehydrated inside the channel but quickly become hydrated after exiting the channel. Our simulations suggested that the free energy landscapes for ion movement between the channel exit points and bulk solution are quite flat (ca. 2-4 kcal/mol) regardless of the loop topology in the region. We discovered that the directional symmetry of the ion movement within any G-quadruplex channel depends critically on both the DNA sequence and the folding of the G-quadrupelx structure. While the ion movement inside the [d(TG4T)]4 channel shows the same free energy barrier in either direction, the [d(G3T4G4)]2 channel exhibits a free energy difference of 3-4 kcal/mol for NH4+ ions exiting from the two ends. We hypothesized that the mode of base-stacking is the determining factor for the G-quartet stiffness and this stiffness then contributes to the free energy barrier for any ion to across it. This hypothesis appears to be consistent with all currently available experimental observations. When a G-quadruplex channel contains multiple ions, we found that the ion-ion repulsion is an important factor that must be considered in order to have a complete understanding of the ion movement within G-quadruplex DNA channels.</description>

   <description>Many software systems must be load tested to ensure that they can scale up under high load while maintaining functional and non-functional requirements. Studies show that field problems are often related to systems not scaling to field workloads instead of feature bugs. To assure the quality of these systems, load testing is a required testing procedure in addition to conventional functional testing procedures, such as unit and integration testing. Current industrial practices for checking the results of a load test remain ad-hoc, involving high-level manual checks. Few research efforts are devoted to the automated analysis of load testing results, mainly due to the limited access to large scale systems for use as case studies. Approaches for the automated and systematic analysis of load tests are needed, as many services are being offered online to an increasing number of users. This dissertation proposes automated approaches to assess the quality of a system under load by mining some of the recorded load testing data (execution logs). Execution logs, which are readily available yet rarely used, are generated by output statements which developers insert into the source code. Execution logs are hard to parse and analyze automatically due to their free-form structure.  We first propose a log abstraction approach that uncovers the internal structure of each log line. Then we propose automated approaches to assess the quality of a system under load by deriving various models (functional, performance and reliability models) from the large set of execution logs. Case studies show that our approaches scale well to large enterprise and open source systems and output high precision results that help load testing practitioners effectively analyze the quality of the system under load.</description>

   <description>Emotional intelligence (EI) encompasses abilities (ability EI; AEI) and self-perceptions (trait EI; TEI) related to the expression, understanding, and management of emotions. Research on its developmental dynamics remains heavily weighted by the AEI perspective, whereas TEI has received virtually no attention in the developmental literature. This is a major oversight, as the two EI components are conceptually distinct and contribute independently to the prediction of important outcomes. Using multi-wave data from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, this project examined rank-order stability (Study 1) and mean-level change (Study 2) in TEI over a 6-year period from late childhood (age 10-11) to adolescence (age 16-17). Longitudinal measurement invariance of the TEI assessment was also tested (Study 1). Longitudinal mean and covariance structures models (Study 1) and latent growth curve models (Study 2) were fitted to the data from 773 children (51% girls) who completed the Emotional Quotient Inventory–Youth Version Brief form at four biannual waves. Principles from the self-concept literature were used to outline an integrative theoretical framework within which the developmental dynamics of TEI could be studied and understood. Study 1 found that three of the four TEI domains could be measured consistently and reliably over time, and that individual differences in these domains became progressively more stable with age. Contrary to the maturity principle guiding the development of AEI, Study 2 found that mean-level changes in TEI followed a curvilinear trajectory characterizing the development of self-concepts: EI self-perceptions declined between late childhood and early adolescence and then increased later in adolescence. These findings provide, for the first time, important validity evidence for the TEI construct as developmentally distinct from AEI and developmentally similar to self-concept. From an applied standpoint, this implies that enhancing EI abilities alone may not necessarily result in concomitant increases in EI self-concepts, and vice versa. Instead, both AEI and TEI may need to be targeted to maximize the effectiveness of intervention efforts. From a theoretical standpoint, the conceptual link between TEI and self-concept theories suggests that other properties of self-concepts might also generalize to TEI – an important avenue for future research.</description>

   <description>Haul truck drivers frequently have difficulties spotting beside shovels. This is typically a combination of reduced visibility and poor mining conditions. Based on first-hand data collected from the Goldstrike Open Pit, it was learned that, on average, 9% of all spotting actions required corrective movements to facilitate loading. This thesis investigates an automated solution to haul truck spotting that does not rely on the use of the satellite global positioning system (GPS), since GPS can perform unreliably. This thesis proposes that if spotting was automated, a significant decrease in cycle times could result. &#xd;
&#xd;
Using conventional algorithms and techniques from the field of mobile robotics, vehicle pose estimation and control algorithms were designed to enable autonomous shovel-truck spotting. The developed algorithms were verified by using both simulation and field testing with real hardware. Tests were performed in analog conditions on an automation-ready Kubota RTV 900 utility truck. When initiated from a representative pose, the RTV successfully spotted to the desired location (within 1 m) in 95% of the conducted trials. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is a strong candidate for an auto-spot system.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
A model for free recall of words is presented and applied to representative free-recall experiments. According to the model, a subject's lexicon contains a representation for each word and for the association between each pair of words. Studying a word in a list strengthens that word's representation in the lexicon, but reduces the strength of previously studied words. In addition, while studying the list, the subject associates pairs of items and, thereby, strengthens the corresponding associations in the lexicon. A subject's efficiency at forming associations drops off as the number of pairs increases. Retrieval is initiated with a report cue. Selection of an item for report is based on its strength in the lexicon plus the strength of its association with the retrieval cue. Selecting an item for report changes the strength of its association with the cue in the lexicon. To test the model, parameters were obtained by fitting it to serial-position curves taken from the archival literature. The model predicted three additional dependent measures: order of report, items correct per trial, and the number of intrusions per trial. In addition, I applied the model to phenomena associated with the free-recall task and showed that it captures the list-strength effect, interference in part-list cuing, clustering with categorized lists, and distraction effects. The model itself does not change to capture these experimental data. Word lists are presented to the model according to the experimental protocol used in the original experiments, and the model captures output measures derived from the experimental data. The model demonstrates that simple mechanisms can capture a wide range of apparently complex behaviour if we allow for a large enough knowledge base. In effect, the complexity of behaviour in free-recall paradigms lies in the interactions in the lexicon, not in the complexity of the recall mechanisms.</description>

   <description>Poly-proline-based chiral stationary phases are relatively new stationary phases and have shown to be competitive to other commercially available chiral stationary phases for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The conformational studies, solvation properties and enantio-selective mechanism of this chiral stationary phase are the main focus of this thesis. Semi-flexible models are developed based on an extensive series of ab initio calculations for proline selectors from di- to hexa-proline and a series of six chiral analytes. Then molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the solvation, conformational preferences at the interface, and the selectivity.&#xd;
The solvation and conformational preferences of poly-proline selectors at the interface are examined in a normal phase n-hexane/-2propanol and a reverse phase water/methanol solvent. We noticed a significant difference between conformational preferences of poly-proline chains in these solvents indicating the effect of solvent polarity and hydrogen bonding on the relative stabilities of poly-proline conformers. Solvent partitioning occurs at the interface and this creates a polarity gradient between the stationary phase and the bulk that encourages analyte docking at the interface. Hydrogen bonding to the poly-proline selectors is shown to be a function of solvent composition and poly-proline conformation at the interface.&#xd;
The selectivity of the poly-proline chains was studied by molecular dynamics simulations of chiral analytes docking into the interface. The selectivity factors for a set of enantiomers were predicted successfully. Enantio-resolution has been shown to mostly happen with hydrogen bonding to poly-proline carbonyl oxygens located close to the interface. Steric interactions and conformational flexibility of the analytes are also contributing factors for enantio-resolution.</description>

   <description>Global climate change is one of the defining issues of the 21st century. The phenomenon of natural climate variation being pushed beyond normal ranges has been fueled largely by industrial activities and those which support them (i.e. land-use change and the over-exploitation of natural resources). The urgency is well established with reports demonstrating an increased occurrence of rare, highly damaging weather events, and shifts in the natural range of species.  The necessity of action on climate change has resulted in the development of novel global initiatives designed to address the problem across global and regional scales. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is emblematic of this new wave of conservation strategy. It brings together parties which are often seen as opposed on environmental issues in collaborative environmental practise. &#xd;
	This thesis explores the development of REDD+ as an effective and equitable solutions to this problem. REDD+ is a policy architecture designed for global deployment, the success of which will depend largely upon the engagement and involvement of local community groups. Community forest management (CFM) may inform the REDD+ design process, and enhance both land-use strategies by way of synergy. The pathway to that point is, however, uncertain and marred with potential pitfalls. This thesis uses the instructive and critical lens of political ecology to assess the potential for integrating greater CFM elements into the REDD+ policy structure. It explores how the narratives of CFM and REDD+ clash at discursive levels, while also identifying elements of each which may make them mutually beneficial. The thesis finds that much of the conflict between positions on REDD+ are the result of contrasting environmental understandings, some of which are informed by negative experiences with past environmental conservation initiatives. Greater community-centric attributes may assist in improving the local and regional acceptability of REDD+ projects by appealing to the “alternative” values of forest-dependent peoples. Some suggested policy modifications are made to improve the overall design of REDD+ to be inclusive of the concerns of forest user groups, and potential areas for future research projects are discussed.</description>

   <description>Failure Theatre: An Artist’s Statement, is an invitation to a rumination on failure. The project is divided into four discreet offers that combine together to form a portrait of failure. A full play text, a manifesto and a choreographed response to research as well as an Artist Statement merge into a pastiche that sheds light on failure’s possible position(s) within the Canadian theatrical milieu. Basing the overall approach on work by Judith Halberstam, Sara Ahmed, Ann Bogart plus several other Feminist, Queer and Performance authors, this thesis examines failure as a force for resistance and change.</description>

   <title>Structural Insights Into Dictyostelium Discoideum Myosin Light Chain Specificity</title>

   <description>Myosins are molecular motor proteins involved in cell movement, vesicle and organelle transport by moving along the cytoskeletal actin filaments.  They include a myosin heavy chain and at least one myosin light chain (LC). The latter are typically bilobal proteins like calmodulin, where each lobe comprises a pair of EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs. The LCs bind to ~25-residue IQ motifs that loosely conform to an IQXXXRGXXXR consensus sequence, and impart rigidity that is crucial for myosin function.   &#xd;
The highly motile amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum expresses seven class I myosins, two of which (MyoD and MyoB) recruit the specific LCs MlcD and MlcB, with MlcB being the first observed single-lobe LC. However, the LCs for the remaining D. discoideum class I myosins are unknown. Identifying and characterizing these LCs is one focus of this thesis, with an overall goal of understanding their role in myosin function and regulation.    &#xd;
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and computational modeling were used to determine the solution structure of apo-MlcB and identify the MyoB IQ motif-binding site.  Apo-MlcB differs from the typical closed conformation of an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein in the apo-state as helix 1 in its structure is splayed from the remaining helices. The MyoB IQ motif-binding surface is not altered by Ca2+, involves residues from helices 1 and 4, and from residues in the N-terminal canonical EF-hand Ca2+-binding loop, and represents a unique mode of IQ recognition by a myosin LC.&#xd;
Calmodulin was identified as the LC for MyoA and MyoE while another single-lobe LC, MlcC, bound to two of three IQ motifs in MyoC. The solution structure of MlcC was more similar to the C-terminal lobe of apo-calmodulin than to apo-MlcB. Chemical shift perturbation studies suggest that like apo-CaM, MlcC undergoes a global MyoC IQ motif-induced conformational change. Computational modeling of the MlcC-MyoC IQ complex indicates that this is a feasible mode of IQ recognition.  The structures of MlcB and MlcC, with their different modes of IQ motif binding, provide novel insights into IQ motif binding specificity and begin to illustrate their role in myosin function and regulation.</description>

   <description>The Problems of Protest and the Persistence of Domination: Social Movement Theory and Bourdieu’s Economy of Practice is a normative intervention into social movement theory and debates about social movement goals, strategies and tactics. The project asks: what normative implications derive from incorporating Pierre Bourdieu’s sociological framework into social movement research? My core arguments are that Bourdieu’s framework has the potential to sensitize activists and analysts to the tension between conformity and failure and that escaping radical/reformist debates requires working through this tension.&#xd;
The dissertation intervenes in social movement theory from within the critical theory tradition by refusing to separate empirical and normative questions. I develop my argument using two strategies. First, I undertake a close reading of Bourdieu’s most important works and the debates they have provoked. Second I apply the conceptual tools this close reading offers to reconsider the logic behind two key social movement theory concepts: collective identity and repertoires of contention. &#xd;
Following a general introduction and literature review, I undertake a close consideration of habitus and an argument for how attention to the suffering produced by symbolic power constitutes grounds for normative justice claims. I then consider how collective identity formation in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer mobilization indicates the presence of symbolic violence, primarily in the form of epistemic violence. Next I argue that the nature of neoliberal symbolic power creates political antinomies for representation and affinity-based segments of the alterglobalization movement. Finally I argue that Bourdieu needs to be balanced by Nietzsche and that an orientation toward ‘overcoming’ offers a way out of the tension between conformity and failure. My findings point to the need for more sophisticated instruments for understanding the relationship between objective interests and subjective perception, impositions of, and challenges to, ‘logical consensus’, and strategies for counter-training and other mechanisms to support activists in resisting symbolic violence.</description>

   <description>Standing at a workbench is required for manual work including sorting and assembly. When work heights and reach distances are not matched to stature or arm length, the trunk assumes a partially bent position, which increases the postural effort required to stand or to reach to far distances. As a result, the biomechanical load on the lumbar spine is raised, which contributes to a higher risk for back pain. In ergonomics, assistive devices are being developed to counter this effect.  &#xd;
A new leaning device was tested in the laboratory with forward-bent standing and reaching where the trunk was bent forward and twisted to reach to a far target 45° from the center. This device supported the trunk at the upper chest. With leaning, back muscle activity decreased by ~ 60% with forward-bent standing and ~ 23-30% with the off-center reach, depending on reach height. Because leaning changed how standing remained balanced, ~12° less bending was required to reach the target. Therefore, upper-trunk support may be helpful for benchworkers when ergonomic design is not possible; some product development and testing is still needed to provide the right amount of support at the right time and to ensure there is no rib joint irritation.&#xd;
An interesting outcome from these previous studies was related to workers’ posture when they leaned against a workbench that was adjusted for heavier work (hip height). Low back muscle activity was unchanged with forward-bent standing, but decreased by ~ 23-30% with the off-center reach. This reduction was accompanied by greater twist at the mid back as a way of compensating for a loss of hip rotation. &#xd;
Three different heights for bench leaning were compared in a third study: elbow height, hip height and below hip height.  The results showed that leaning at elbow height lowered the work demand by ~16-24% for far reach, partially due to changed motions consistent with greater mid back movement and coincided with ~ 8% increase in work demands at the mid-back and greater scapular recruitment. Therefore, more research is needed to establish work height guidelines for use when leaning against a workbench.</description>

   <description>The systematic evaluation of effective health behavior interventions is critical for addressing overweight and obesity. Process evaluation assesses whether critical intervention components are delivered as intended and can enhance our understanding of program effects by linking participant program exposure to outcomes. The purpose of this study was to conduct a process evaluation of PROACTIVE, an intervention program to prevent and reduce obesity in clinical settings, and to explore associations between measures of dose, fidelity, and session quality with participant outcomes in an effort to explain gender differences in PROACTIVE program response observed at 24 months. Overweight and obese men (n = 74) and women (n = 175) were randomized into the 24-month health behavior counselling intervention. Outcomes of waist circumference (WC) and physical activity (PA; 7-Day PA Recall) were measured at 12 and 24 months. Process outcomes were distilled from Session Summary Forms completed by Health Educators after each session. Dose was a significant predictor of WC (β = -.12, p &lt; .01) and PA (β = -.16, p &lt; .05) at 24 months. Fidelity predicted 12 month WC (β = -.11, p &lt; .05) and PA (β = .21, p &lt; .05). Quality was significantly associated with 12 month (WC: β = .07, p &lt; .05; PA: β = -.18, p &lt; .01) and 24-month outcomes (WC: β = .10, p &lt; .01; PA: β = -.15, p &lt; .05). No gender differences were found for complete program adherence (dose; p = .51) or treatment implemented (fidelity; p = .06). Men and women were exposed to a similar amount of PROACTIVE session content and maintained similar levels of adherence throughout the 24-month intervention, therefore the difference in program success between men and women could not be attributed to unequal program exposure between the two groups. Insight yielded into the relationship between program exposure and participant outcomes via this process evaluation can help guide and refine future program implementation along with providing areas for future research.</description>

   <description>Provoked Vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of chronic vulvar pain, affecting 12% of women in the general population. Research has demonstrated that women with PVD display both allodynia and hyperalgesia to pain at vulvar and non-vulvar sites, as well as reduced psychosocial functioning. The goal of this study was to use a multi-method approach (interview, questionnaires, sensory testing, and fMRI) to examine group differences between women with PVD (N=15) and healthy control women (N=15). Results will allow for improved understanding of the interaction between psychosocial and neurobiological underpinnings of this disorder, which can contribute to the creation of better treatment strategies. Variables included psychophysical and psychosocial measures, as well as neural activations associated with painful pressure, painful words, and psychosocial functioning. Differences between subgroups of PVD, based on temporal onset, were also examined. There were no robust group differences in neural activation during the application of pain or pain words. This finding is consistent with many studies that match groups on pain intensity ratings, as opposed to amount of pressure applied. Painful pressures and painful words resulted in greater neural activation than neutral words or touch; however, there were no group differences for the word conditions. Women with PVD reported increased psychosocial dysfunction, including higher levels of anxiety and catastrophizing. Significant correlations were found between these psychosocial variables and areas of the brain associated with pain modulation and attention (e.g., PFC). Examination of PVD subgroups revealed differences in neural correlates of anxiety and catastrophizing during painful stimulation. This finding adds to the literature suggesting that women with primary PVD experience greater dysfunction than women with secondary PVD. Overall, these studies support findings of pain processing in the general pain literature, as well as supporting PVD as a chronic pain condition. They also add to the development of a greater understanding of the interaction between psychophysical and psychosocial components of chronic pain by examining their relationship with neural activations. Future research should examine brain functioning in PVD women pre- and post-treatment as well as examining neural correlates of other psychosocial variables that contribute to the pain experience (e.g., somatization).</description>

   <description>Global production of soybeans continues to increase, reflecting the value of soybeans in food products, soil amendments, and petroleum replacements. While the N2O aspect of the legume greenhouse gas (GHG) budget has been given substantial, and mostly negative, attention, the CO2 side needs to be explored. During nitrogen fixation, hydrogen is produced. As a result of hydrogen-coupled CO2 fixation, legume soils have the ability to increase the amount of atmospheric carbon fixed into the soil. However, the amount and fate of this fixed carbon has yet to be determined. Therefore, two experiments were conducted. The first experiment explored the methods of 13C labeling of four soil treatments over a period of 28 days. Results showed that most of this carbon uptake was through biotic processes, and that the pattern of carbon uptake was similar for all four soil treatments. The ideal labeling time for both ‘root’ and ‘nodule’ soil was determined to be between 7 and 14 days. The second experiment incubated four 13C labeled soil treatments in a continuous soybean field for 11 months. Throughout this time, bags of soil were removed and separated into three soil organic matter (SOM) fractions; the microbial biomass fraction (MBF), the light fraction (LF), and the acid stable fraction (ASF). These fractions were then measured for δ13C, providing a time series showing carbon movement through the soil which enabled an estimation of the MRT of fixed carbon in the soil. Results showed that the MBF was responsible for the initial flux of carbon uptake in all soil treatments, and that the ‘nodule + H2’ MBF continued to fix carbon at the end of the 11 months. While the LF was not ideal at representing the intermediate SOM pool, the ASF did increase in enrichment at the end of the experiment, showing the movement of newly fixed carbon into long-term carbon storage. Therefore, hydrogen-coupled CO2 fixation does contribute to long-term carbon storage in legume soils, however, longer study times with focus on different legume plants and soil types are required to determine the mean residence time (MRT) of fixed carbon in the ASF.</description>

   <description>The goal of this thesis is to develop more effective quantitative procedures to evaluate the stability of deteriorated metal culverts and a better understanding of the deteriorated culverts' behaviour through non-destructive testing, full scale experiments and numerical analyses. First, three design cases were examined using numerical analysis to study the effects of corrosion, burial depth and staged construction on the capacity of deteriorated steel culverts. Then, a method to measure the remaining wall thickness of two 1.8 m diameter corroded metal culverts using ultrasonic device was developed. Both culverts were then buried in the test pit at Queen's University and tested under nominal and working vehicle loads at 0.9m cover and 0.6m cover. The more heavily corroded structure (CSP1) was tested up to its ultimate limit state, inducing local bending across the crown, as well as local buckling of the remnants of the corrugated steel wall between perforations at the haunches. The results suggest that the single axle pads interact to influence the culvert's behaviour despite the shallow cover used in these experiments. CSP1 was able to carry the working load and did not fail until reaching 340 kN, which was equal to 90% of the fully factored load. The experiment suggests that less deteriorated metal culverts (as compared to CSP1) may have the required capacity. Two finite element packages, CANDE and ABAQUS, were used to perform the numerical investigation and the AASHTO and CHBDC approaches were then used to calculate the thrust force in the culverts. Although the numerical analysis produced conservative values for the thrust forces, it failed to capture the non-linear behaviour of both specimens in the experiments. Both the AASHTO and the CHBDC approaches produced unconservative thrust forces compared to experimental results while numerical analysis using Moore's spreading factor produced the most conservative results in terms of thrust. The analysis suggests that CANDE could be used to predict thrust forces in less deteriorated metal culverts. A procedure to assess the stability of deteriorated corrugated metal culverts based on quantitative data was developed using the numerical analysis and experimental results.</description>

   <description>Numerous anthropogenic disturbances have occurred in large lakes over recent decades.  These may alter concentrations of the biomagnifying contaminant mercury (Hg) in fish, but long-term impacts of disturbances on Hg trophodynamics are poorly understood.  Elemental analyses of archived museum ichthyology specimens could be used to study historical, pre-disturbance fish food webs, but there is uncertainty about effects of chemical preservatives on the results of such analyses.  In this thesis, long-term preservation effects were studied, and archived fish were used to reconstruct historical food webs and Hg trophodynamic patterns in three large North American lakes, Nipigon, Simcoe and Champlain.  After 24 months of formalin/ethanol preservation, fish muscle delta-15N and delta-13C had average changes of +0.4 ‰ and -0.9 ‰, respectively. Shifts in mean Hg concentration was +5 % after 12 months.  A suite of 26 other elements analyzed over 24 months showed consistent responses to preservation, usually involving an increase in concentration immediately following preservation. In the second phase of the thesis, stable isotope and Hg analyses were performed on archived and modern fish from the study lakes, dating to the 1920s-60s and 2006-7, respectively.  Trophic relationships were often relatively stable over time, but stable isotope metrics revealed a decrease in Lake Nipigon delta-15N range and less pelagic feeding among Lake Simcoe pumpkinseed and yellow perch.  In Lake Champlain, the re-introduction of lake trout in recent decades did not have a major effect on overall food web dimensions.  Significant Hg biomagnification factors were found in 1920s and 2006-7 Lake Nipigon (which were not statistically distinguishable from each other) and 2006 Lake Champlain. These biomagnification factors ranged from 0.09 to 0.17, which is within the range found in other studies globally. Archived fish and government monitoring records indicated that fish Hg concentrations decreased in Lakes Simcoe and Champlain since historical periods, but remained similar or increased in Lake Nipigon.  This thesis confirms the utility of archived fish for elemental analyses. It highlights the risks of Hg contamination and food web change that may be faced by remote lakes, and it provides evidence for relatively stable Hg biomagnification rates in large lakes.</description>

   <title>Predictive Wireless Antenna Selection for High Mobility Conditions</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-01-30 16:47:06.057</description>
   <description>Accurate channel knowledge is indispensable to the practical success of channel-aware wireless communication technologies. However, channel estimates obtained from pilot symbols rapidly become outdated due to fast time variations of multipath fading channels.&#xd;
To reduce system cost, antenna subset selection reduces radio frequency (RF) chain components. For systems selecting a subset of a plurality of antennas for reception, this outdated channel information is a significant impediment to selection and data decoding reliability.&#xd;
In this thesis, training-based schemes for antenna selection (AS) for time-varying channels which account for practical constraints such as training, packetization and antenna switching time are proposed based on discrete prolate spheroidal sequences. They only operate with knowledge or estimates of the Doppler frequency and the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but do not require detailed statistical correlation knowledge.&#xd;
&#xd;
A pilot-based AS scheme for time-varying frequency-flat channels for single input-multiple output (SIMO) systems selecting one of a plurality of antennas using packet or symbol-rate antenna switching is first proposed. It is demonstrated that the presented scheme provides significant performance gain over AS methods using Fourier-based orthogonal training as well as over single antenna systems with perfect channel knowledge. Analytical expressions for the symbol error probability (SEP) of M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) for systems employing the suggested techniques are provided. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second part of this thesis investigates the more general case of selecting a subset of a plurality of receive antennas. A new pilot-based receive antenna subset selection algorithm for time-varying frequency-flat channels is presented. The proposed AS algorithm is shown to outperform AS methods based on Fourier prediction/estimation as well as SIMO systems with perfect channel knowledge. Analysis of MPSK and quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) SEP for systems with receive AS is provided.&#xd;
&#xd;
The combination of AS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) over the more realistic time-varying and frequency-selective fading scenario is examined in the final part. Training schemes for receive AS using packet-rate antenna switching for SIMO and multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) OFDM systems are developed. The suggested schemes exhibit a superior performance over AS methods using either linear interpolation/extrapolation or Fourier prediction/estimation techniques.</description>

   <description>In the context of location, large amounts of information are available on the Internet to be accessed by people via different devices. However, at times people have to manually search and access it. If the space where location-based services are available can be identified by hand-held devices, people can be prompted with services available around them. This thesis explores the use of ultrasound as a communication medium to tag such spaces and access location-based services with the related information; and demonstrates the indoor implementation of the prototype of a location-based services enabling system for hand-held devices. This system allows users to search and access the available services in their surroundings through their hand-held devices. A beacon generator placed in the service location broadcasts a service code mappable to the services particular to that location encoded in an ultrasound signal. The hand-held device can identify this signal and prompt the user with available services. System design and architecture is demonstrated and the viability of the system is tested through a variety of environments and scenarios showing that potentially this has both a wide range of applications and can enhance the way people access location-based services.</description>

   <description>Clustered failure time data often arise in biomedical and clinical studies where potential correlation among survival times is&#xd;
induced in a cluster. In this thesis, we develop a class of marginal models for right censored clustered failure time data and&#xd;
propose a novel generalized estimating equation approach in a likelihood-based context. We first investigate a semiparametric proportional hazards model for clustered survival data and derive&#xd;
the large sample properties of the regression estimators. The finite sample studies demonstrate that the good applicability of the proposed method as well as the substantial efficiency improvement in comparison with the existing marginal model for clustered survival data. Another important feature of failure time data we will consider in this thesis is a possible fraction of cured subjects. To accommodate the potential cure fraction, we consider a&#xd;
proportional hazards mixture cure model for clustered survival data with long-term survivors and develop a set of estimating&#xd;
equations by incorporating working correlation matrices in an EM algorithm. The dependence among the cure statuses and among the survival times of uncured patients within clusters are modeled by working correlation matrices in the estimating equations. For the parametric proportional hazards mixture cure model, we show that&#xd;
the estimators of the regression parameters and the parameter in the baseline hazard function are consistent and asymptotically&#xd;
normal with a sandwich covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. A numerical study presents that the proposed estimation method is comparable with the existing parametric marginal method. We also extend the proposed generalized estimating equation approach to a semiparametric proportional hazards mixture cure model where the baseline survival function is nonparametrically specified. A bootstrap method is used to obtain the variances of&#xd;
the estimates. The proposed method is evaluated by a simulation study from which we observe a noticeable efficiency gain of the proposed method over the existing semiparametric marginal method for clustered failure time data with a cure fraction.</description>

   <description>Background: Cervarix is a prophylactic vaccine used in preventing cervical cancer associated with human papillomavirus types 16/18. A previous study that investigated the risk of miscarriage associated with this bivalent vaccine by pooled analysis of data from two clinical trials, showed a numerically higher but statistically insignificant miscarriage rate in the HPV arm for pregnancies that began within three months following the vaccination. We explored this issue using an alternative statistical approach.&#xd;
Objectives: To develop a hierarchical Bayes model to identify the potential time-dependent risk window of miscarriage rate associated with the bivalent HPV vaccine. &#xd;
Methods: This study comprised the development of a hierarchical Bayes Model with its model inference and the application of this model to a real-world question. A multivariate logistic model was proposed that involved an indicator variable to accommodate a risk window with lower and higher cut-off points. Gibbs Sampling algorithms were used for the inference on the parameters of interest. Over ninety sets of simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and estimate the power in detecting the risk effect. The Bayesian approach was then compared to the existing traditional approaches (e.g. the permutation test). The proposed model was applied to the subpopulation of pregnant women from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial. &#xd;
Results: In simulation studies, the Bayesian model demonstrated a better performance over the traditional approaches. It showed higher power than the traditional hypothesis testing in detecting the risk effect; it was more informative than the permutation test because it provided both the point estimates and the corresponding credible intervals for the cut-points and the ratio of odds ratios. In the analysis of the CVT data, we observed an effect of 1.13 (95% credible interval: 0.49 to 2.75), implying no significant evidence to support the hypothesis that HPV is associated with a higher miscarriage rate.&#xd;
Conclusions: The hierarchical Bayes model can be applied to investigate the time-dependent risk of adverse events in clinical trials. Using the new Bayesian method, no significant risk of miscarriage in the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial was established, which is consistent with previous report.</description>

   <description>The control of object manipulation tasks involves the close interplay of predictive and reactive control mechanisms. For example, when lifting an object, people typically predict the weight based on object size and material as well as sensorimotor memory obtained from previous lifts of the object. When lifting objects with a precision grip, people increase vertical load force to a target level that slightly exceeds the predicted weight. When the object is heavier than expected, the mismatch between expected and actual tactile signals associated with lift-off triggers a corrective action within ~100 ms, that involves probing increases in load force that continue until the object is lifted. Here we investigated whether this correction action can be adaptively influenced by experience. Participants repeatedly lifted an object that was instrumented with force sensors to measure the forces applied by the fingertips, with weight that could be varied without the knowledge of the participant. In 80% of trials, the weight was set to 2 N and, in different blocks of 110 trials, the remaining 20 % of trials (2 trials randomly selected from each successive 10 trials) was set to either 4 or 6 N. We found that the rate of change of the reflexively triggered increase in load force that occurred in the 4 or 6 N trials, scaled with the additional weight. That is, following the initial increase in load force to ~2 N, the subsequent increase in load force was more rapid for the 6 N object than the 4 N object. In contrast, the onset time of the reactive increase in load force was independent of the additional weight. Finally, this adaptation of reactive load force control took place quickly and was evident after only a few lifts of the heavier weight. These results indicate that the reactive increases in load force that occur when a lifted object is heavier than expected can be adapted and tuned, to refine behavior. This further suggests that multiple predictions can be generated about object weight when lifting.</description>

   <description>In this thesis we report on the design and evaluation of interfaces to support crowdsourced programming tasks. We present WordMatch and SnipMatch: two programming tools that can incorporate crowdsourced source code. The design of these tools is informed by an investigation of crowdsourcing; specifically, Crowdsourced Human-Based Computation (CHC) systems, which organize tasks performed by humans. Recommendations include methods to obtain and maintain users who are highly motivated to participate and methods to improve task performance. WordMatch, a novel programming environment for specifying direct answers for search queries, builds on this work by introducing a parameterized search interface that can be easily understood by end users. In a laboratory study, we found that people with basic computer literacy could be taught to create complex direct answers with minimal training. Finally, evaluations of SnipMatch, a search interface for curated source code snippets, demonstrate that features from WordMatch are applicable to general programming tasks. Participants in our longitudinal study reported that SnipMatch was an effective tool for reducing context switching and as a memory aid.</description>

   <description>Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are a low cost solution for moderate reach systems due to their small footprint, low power dissipation and high output optical power.  However, commercial 10-Gb/s on-off keying DMLs have been limited by an inherent modulation of the optical phase that accompanies the desired modulation of the optical intensity, which reduces their transmission distance to below 20 km. Furthermore, the ability to generate bit rates beyond 10-Gb/s with advanced modulation formats has been limited by the strict requirements on the laser drive current. The primary objective of this research is to dramatically enhance the capability of DML based systems through precise control over the drive current. This is achieved by digital signal processing (DSP) combined with a single digital-to-analog converter (DAC).&#xd;
&#xd;
In this research, a novel method to pre-compensate dispersion for metro and regional networks is demonstrated at 10.709-Gb/s. A look-up table (LUT) for the driving current is optimized for dispersion mitigation. Experimental results show a 25 fold increase in the transmission reach of a DML from 10 km to 252 km. A similar approach applied to a directly modulated chirp managed laser reveals a remarkable increase in the achievable transmission reach from 200 km to 608 km.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the context of access networks the DSP and DAC configuration is utilized for directly modulating a passive feedback laser (PFL) to generate differential phase shift keying (DPSK) signals at bit rates of 10.709-Gb/s, 14-Gb/s and 16-Gb/s. The quality of the DPSK signals is assessed using both noncoherent detection for a bit rate of 10.709-Gb/s and coherent detection with DSP involving a LUT pattern-dependent distortion compensator.&#xd;
&#xd;
For very short reach optical links, a 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signal is generated using subcarrier modulation with a subcarrier frequency of half the symbol rate, Nyquist pulse shaping, and a directly modulated PFL at bit rates up to 56-Gb/s. Using polarization multiplexing emulation, a pre-amplified direct detection receiver and DSP, loss margins of 12.6 dB and 8 dB are achieved for a 112-Gb/s dual polarization signal within a 33 GHz optical bandwidth at back-to-back and after 4 km transmission, respectively.</description>

   <description>The joint may be considered a weak point along the pipe and can have a major impact on pipe performance. However, little research has been conducted in regard to joint design. To improve current structural design criteria, this thesis presents the findings and conclusions of experimental and computational studies of the effects of longitudinal bending on joints in rigid (reinforced concrete) and flexible (corrugated steel and thermoplastic) pipes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Solutions for expected shear force, longitudinal bending moment and rotation across the joint for rigid and flexible pipes are formulated for use in structural design of pipe joints. Exact algebraic solutions for rigid pipes are derived using the beam-on-elastic-spring approximation. The formulations for flexible pipes are developed assuming that the two pipes are very long, and that the response is not affected by either the location or characteristics of those other joints. The flexible pipe design equations are developed using various closed form solutions for beams on elastic foundations developed by Hetényi (1948). Parametric studies are then presented where the key factors controlling the behaviour are examined, and the comparisons to recent experimental measurements show that the joint rotation calculated using the equations and a value of soil stiffness proposed for use in design are generally reasonable and conservative compared with the laboratory tests.&#xd;
&#xd;
To measure the capacity of the joint to accommodate the demands, a pipe joint testing frame has been designed to facilitate joint characterization experiments. Shear tests and articulation (rotation) tests have been conducted using this testing frame to examine the shear force capacity, longitudinal bending moment capacity of moment-transfer joints, and rotational characteristics of joints. The shear test results show that the joints of PVC pipe and corrugated steel pipe have similar shear stiffness while the reinforced concrete pipe joint is significantly stiffer. The results of the articulation testing indicate that the rotational capacities of the three joint systems are similar in general. Design of rotational capacity of these joints is likely dominated by considerations of assembly in the field, rather than the rotational capacity that is needed once the pipes are installed.</description>

   <description>The global mobile application market is booming in all directions and business giants, viz. Google and Apple, have acknowledged the huge expansion in their Application Market and App Store. There is a demand though for a system that can elevate the momentum of context-aware mobile applications, where an application’s behavior is customized according to context information. This thesis proposes a context-aware system that provides mobile Applications as a Service (AppaaS). AppaaS handles various context information including location information, user profile, device profile, user ratings, and current time to provision the best relevant mobile application to such a context. AppaaS also supports state preservation, where application-specific data that is relevant to a user is stored for future reference.&#xd;
Our prototype demonstrates a seamless system performance with respect to finding relevant applications to a specific context and controlling the applications functions according the users requirements and access privileges. We also demonstrate how AppaaS can preserve an applications state when a user is to reuse the same application again.</description>

   <description>Background: In 2007, the Canadian federal budget provided $300 million over three years to the provinces and territories to implement publicly-funded HPV immunization programs.  Current estimates indicate that HPV vaccine uptake varies significantly across Canada and is reported to be lowest in Ontario at 53%.  There is a paucity of literature on the determinants of HPV vaccine uptake in the Canadian context, therefore further research is needed.&#xd;
Objectives: To describe the patterns of HPV vaccine non-uptake across health units in Ontario, and identify the individual- and health unit (ecologic)-level factors that influenced HPV immunization decision-making between 2007 and 2011.&#xd;
Methods: The study linked administrative health and immunization databases to identify a retrospective population-based cohort of 144,047 girls eligible for Ontario's school-based HPV immunization program between 2007 and 2011.  In this study a girl was considered vaccinated if she received at least 1 dose, otherwise she was considered unvaccinated.  Ecologic or health unit-level factors that may have influenced HPV vaccine decision-making were assessed, as well as individual-level predictors including clinical characteristics and sociodemographics.  A population-average model based on generalized estimating equations was used to identify determinants associated with non-uptake.&#xd;
Results: In all, 49.3% of girls from 21 public health units refused HPV immunization between 2007 and 2011.  Non-uptake varied across health units, from 41.82% to 60.30%.  In multivariate analyses, non-uptake was strongly associated with a history of autism (OR=1.60; 95% CI 1.34, 1.90) and Down's syndrome (OR=1.37; 95% CI 1.16, 1.63), refusal of mandatory and optional vaccines (OR=2.23; 95% CI 2.07, 2.4, and OR=3.96; 95% CI 3.87, 4.05, respectively), and infrequent physician visits (OR=1.45; 95% CI 1.35, 1.55).  Contextual or health unit-level characteristics appeared to have a weak influence on vaccine decision-making.&#xd;
Conclusions: HPV immunization could lead to a lower risk of developing and dying from HPV-related cancers; however, non-uptake of this vaccine is high.  Concerted efforts are needed to reduce missed opportunities during medical consultations, to refine communication strategies and activities to address the information needs of special groups, as well as to develop cross-sectoral collaborations to support the delivery of publicly-funded HPV immunization to schools across Canada.</description>

   <description>Fe(III)-As(III) bearing precipitates have been successfully used for arsenic immobilization in copper smelter weak acid effluents. However, knowledge on their precise characteristics is very limited compared to ferric arsenate precipitates which are the preferred disposal option. As(III) is the dominant arsenic species in the weak acid effluents, and high costs are incurred in oxidizing As(III) to As(V) prior to ferric arsenate precipitation. Detailed characterization of Fe(III)-As(III) bearing residues is fundamental for accurate prediction of their long term stability. Synchrotron-based analysis of the Fe(III)-As(III) bearing precipitates from the effluent treatment plant (ETP) at Xstrata’s Horne Copper Smelter in Quebec identified ferric arsenate and gypsum as the major phases, and other minor phases including zinc hydroxide and franklinite. The predominant As species was As(V) which accounted for 49 to 84% of the total As in the Horne ETP sample. The high As(V) levels detected in the Horne ETP co-precipitates may be due to the partial oxidation of As(III) during prolonged storage, prior to synchrotron analysis.&#xd;
Tooeleite was investigated as an alternative potential disposal option for As(III) immobilization from copper smelter weak acid effluents. Lime neutralization of an equimolar Fe(III)-As(III) bearing weak acid solution resulted in about 85% As being removed at pH 2.7 and the formation of gypsum-bearing tooeleite at pH 2 to 3.5. At >pH 4, the rapid transformation of tooeleite occurred to form a poorly crystalline equimolar ferric arsenite which was stable at pH 6 to 10. Co-precipitation tests also showed that equimolar ferric arsenite was precipitated at pH>4. US EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) analysis indicated that both tooeleite and ferric arsenite have relatively high As solubilities. Calcination of tooeleite was explored as a method for improving the stability of tooeleite, and calcination of tooeleite in air at 600˚C produced a ferric arsenate calcine with a TCLP solubility of &lt;5 mg/L As. The calcine&#xd;
iii&#xd;
produced from the lime-precipitated tooeleite at 600 ˚C was found to contain an iron arsenate (Fe7As6O24) which had a slightly higher TCLP As solubility of 13.1 mg/L. The precipitation of tooeleite from an As(III)-bearing weak acid and calcination of the resultant precipitate may offer a new process for As(III) fixation from copper smelter weak acid effluents.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-02-01 10:33:47.733</description>
   <description>Geomembranes (GMB) are normally used as part of the liner system in heap leach pads. There is a need to quantify tensile strains in the geomembrane that could affect short-term puncture and long-term performance of the GMB.  In this thesis, short-term tensile strains arising from indentations caused from the material placed both below and above the geomembrane are quantified, and the potential for puncturing is investigated. Experiments were conducted on 1.5 mm high-density (HDPE) and liner low density polyethylene (LLDPE) geomembranes for applied pressures up to 3000 kPa. The geomembrane punctured from underliner material having gravel and sand placed directly beneath the geomembrane and a peak tensile strain of 40% was induced.  Increasing the sand fraction to obtain a well graded gravel and sand underliner resulted in peak tensile strains of 14% in the geomembrane and caused no puncture.  When geomembrane is underlain by geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and compacted clay liner, the tensile strains increased with increasing deformability (due to higher water content) of the underlying material. Experiments were also conducted to examine the implications of overliner material and pressure on geomembrane strains. It was found that the overliner having gravel and some sand resulted in 18% tensile strain in the geomembrane at 2000 kPa and 27% for 3000 kPa. A gravelly sand overliner with some silt induced tensile strains of 9% and 12% at 2000 kPa and 3000 kPa respectively. None of the overliners was able to limit stains in the geomembrane to less the maximum recommended geomembrane strain proposed in the literature. A 150-mm-thick silty sand layer placed above coarsest overliner examined reduced the geomembrane strains to 2%, even when subjected to pressures of 3000 kPa.</description>

   <description>As much of the scholarly literature shows, gender has served as a central organizing force for knowing and theorizing about sexuality. The governmentality of sexuality in Western societies over the last 200 years has led to sex being discursively implicated with reproduction, and this has had a profound effect on the ways sexuality has been theorized and understood in terms of gendered desire. The aim of this dissertation is to theorize an alternative approach to sexuality that decenters gender and gives attention to the materiality of sex and the body. Using existentialism and phenomenology, this dissertation offers a particular challenge to heteronormative conceptions of “sexual orientation” and “sexual identity” for their ostensibly timeless and enduring quality, or being. The research presented herein theorizes sexuality through an ontology of becoming that takes into account the diverse, multi-faceted nature of sexuality as a series of temporal experiences, attractions, desires, sensations, practices, and identities – that is, as a phenomenon. &#xd;
	A genealogical methodology is used to trace the discursive history of sexuality and demonstrate how modernist discourses of sexuality have influenced how sexuality is known and experienced. This research emphasizes the discursive constraints on knowledge about sexuality. In considering an alternative framework, the principles of existentialism and phenomenology are critically examined through the works of Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Attention is then turned toward a non-classical paradigm of science to elaborate on an ontology of becoming and its significance for understanding the development of sex and sexuality. In conjunction, contemporary biological research is introduced to expand upon de Beauvoir’s (1996) analysis of “the data of biology” on sexual difference and to help situate the sexed body as dynamic and developmental. An existential phenomenological approach theorizes sexuality as a self-project and the dialectical becoming between the sexed body and the sexual self. Because both the body and the self are contingent becomings that are open to instability and change, so too is sexuality. This alternative approach offers particular attention to the body in sexuality and considers the materialities of sexual desire.</description>

   <description>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an important technology that can be used to provide new data sets for many applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to military surveillance. Due to the increasing popularity of WSNs, user demands have evolved as well. To achieve the end-to-end goals and requirements of the applications, managing the resources of the network becomes a critical task. Cognitive networking techniques for resource management have been proposed in recent years to provide performance gains over traditional design methodologies. However, even though several tools have been considered in cognitive network design, they show limitations in their adaptability, complexity, and their ability to consider multiple conflicting goals. Thus, this thesis proposes novel cognitive solutions for WSNs that include a reasoning machine and a learning protocol. Weighted Cognitive Maps (WCM) and Q-Learning are identified as suitable tools for addressing the aforementioned challenges and designing the cognitive solutions due to their ability to consider conflicting objectives with low complexity.&#xd;
   WCM is a mathematical tool that has powerful inference capabilities. Thus, they are used to design a reasoning machine for WSNs. Two case studies are proposed in this thesis that illustrate the capabilities of WCMs and their flexibility in supporting different application requirements and network types. In addition, an elaborate theoretical model based on Markov Chains (MC) is proposed to analyze the operation of the WCM system. Extensive computer simulations and analytical results show the ability of the WCM system to achieve the end-to-end goals of the network and find compromises between conflicting constraints. &#xd;
   On the other hand, Q-Learning is a well known reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to evaluate the actions taken by an agent over time. Thus, it is used to design a learning protocol that improves the performance of the WCM system. Furthermore, to ensure that the learning protocol operates efficiently, methods for improving the learning speed and achieving distributed learning across multiple nodes are proposed as well. Extensive computer simulations show that the learning protocol improves the performance of the WCM system in several metrics.</description>

   <description>Many obese individuals and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have elevated levels of insulin. Hyperinsulinemia is a major cancer risk factor in T2DM individuals and activated insulin receptor (IR) has been linked to many types of cancer and poor survival. However, the mechanisms that account for the link between the hyper-active insulin signaling and cancer risk is not well understood. PTEN plays an antagonistic role in the canonical insulin signaling pathway, and is the second most commonly mutated tumour suppressor (after p53) found in human cancers. In many cancers the PTEN gene is not deleted, but instead the protein is lost. Therefore the regulation of PTEN protein in humans is of great importance. Here we hypothesized that the activated insulin signaling down-regulates PTEN. Considering that insulin signaling is highly conserved from C. elegans to human, I used C. elegans as a model and showed that DAF-2, the worm homolog of IR, is a negative regulator of DAF-18, the worm homolog of PTEN. In addition, I showed that DAF-28, the worm homolog of insulin, also negatively regulates DAF-18/PTEN. I used western blot and immunostaining to show that the protein level of DAF-18/PTEN is increased in the daf-2/IR and daf-28/insulin mutants. I further showed that daf-18/Pten is genetically epistatic to daf-2/IR in regulating neuronal development. I then employed human cell culture experiments and reported that this negative regulation is conserved in human cancer cell lines. I showed that knocking-down IR through siRNA up-regulates PTEN, and over-expressing a gain-of-function IR down-regulates PTEN. I also showed that insulin stimulation dramatically decreased PTEN and this decrease is dependent on IR. I further confirmed a physical association between IR and PTEN in both human and C. elegans, and reported that IR could phosphorylate PTEN. To provide mechanistic insight to DAF-18/PTEN regulation, I identified another protein, which is a ubiquitin ligase, that functions in insulin signaling to down-regulate DAF-18/PTEN. Additionally, I also provided evidence that insulin signaling cross talks with Eph receptor signaling. In summary, my findings will be informative for cancer biologists to study the roles of these genes in carcinogenesis.</description>

   <description>Cognitive radio is an important technology which aims to improve the spectrum resource utilization and allows a cognitive radio transceiver to detect and sense spectrum holes without causing interference to the primary users (PUs). As a result of the development of cognitive radio technology, the concept of cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) has recently been proposed in the literature, which aims to apply the cognitive radio to traditional ad hoc networks. However, this new network paradigm creates more research challenges than those in classical cognitive radio networks (CRNs).&#xd;
These research challenges in CRAHNs are due to the variable radio environments caused by spectrum-dependent communication links, hop-by-hop transmission, and changing topology. This study will focus on important research topics in spectrum management in scalable CRAHNs driven by local control, such as spectrum sharing, allocation, and mobility. To conduct this study, a local control approach is proposed to enable system-level analysis and protocol-level design with distributed protocols for spectrum sharing. In the local control approach, we can evaluate the system dynamics caused by either protocol-specific parameters or application-specific parameters in CRAHNs, which is hard to explore using existing methods. Moreover, combining the previous evaluations and scaling law analysis based on local control concept, we can design new distributed protocols based on the features of the medium access control (MAC) layer and the physical layer. In this study, the proposed research themes and related research issues surrounding spectrum sharing are discussed. Moreover, justification of the research has been made by experimental and analytical results.</description>

   <description>Implementing the legal mandate to accommodate students with impairments in higher education, particularly in fieldwork settings, poses a significant challenge to retaining academic integrity (Pardo, 1999). Currently, there is no consistent way of determining which academic requirements are “bona fide” (OHRC, 2004), and might not be altered for students with disabilities, and those which can be accomplished using a different method. Situating accommodation and accessibility within the Environmental Factors domain of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF) as a theoretical framework, a set of questions are presented to determine whether academic requirements in fieldwork can be accommodated or not, and why. Combining an occupational therapy perspective on the importance of task analysis (Ashworth, 1995) with the means of identifying discrimination laid out in the human rights case law provides the required tools for such an analysis. &#xd;
      This dissertation examines the intersection of legislated mandates for accommodation and academic integrity, by applying human rights legislation to higher education. Using the three-step test of discrimination set out in Meiorin (1999) and an additional question based on Granovsky (2000) to analyze academic tasks and requirements of fieldwork, bona fide requirements can be determined. The resulting model for determining accommodation for students with impairments is applicable to accommodation of disability in primary and secondary education, as well as in the employment sector and accessibility planning, and contributes to standards of practice in academic accommodation planning, a need identified by Reed, Lund-Lucas, &amp; O'Rourke (2003). Following the introduction, six distinct chapters explore 1) the background of accommodation in post-secondary education, 2) the weaving together of models of disability with legislated requirements and curricula, 3) the human rights paradigm itself, 4) accommodation policies, 5) an experimental focus group investigation of the proposed model, and 6) an explication of when accommodation might not be appropriate. The conclusion draws these various threads together into a lifeline for accommodation analysis and planning.</description>

   <title>Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks: Spectrum Acquisition and Co-Channel Interference Effect</title>

   <description>Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) allows Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) to locate vacant spectrum channels and to protect active Primary Users (PUs). However, the achieved detection accuracy is proportional to the duration of the CSS process which, unfortunately, reduces the time of useful communication as well as increases the Co-Channel Interference (CCI) perceived by an active PU. To overcome this, this thesis proposes three CSS strategies, namely the Dual-Threshold CSS (DTCSS), the Maximum CSS (MCSS), and the Max-Min CSS (MMCSS). These strategies reduce the number of reporting terminals while maintaining reliable performance and minimal CCI effect. The performance of these three methods is analyzed, and the numerical and simulations results illustrate the accuracy of the derived results as well as the achieved performance gains. The second part of this thesis studies the impact of CCI on the performance of a number of transmission techniques used by CRNs. These are Chase combining Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HAQR), Fixed Relaying (FR), Selective Relaying (SR), Incremental Relaying (IR), and Selective Incremental Relaying (SIR). The performance of these techniques is studied in terms of the average spectral efficiency, the outage probability, and the error probability. To obtain closed forms for the error probabilities, this thesis proposes a novel accurate approximation of the exponential integral function using a sum of exponentials.</description>

   <description>This thesis addresses three issues.  These are the self-assembly of block copolymer in selective solvents, hierarchical assembly of micelles or crosslinked micelles of block copolymers, and the application of block copolymers as solid state compatibilizers in polymer-based photovoltaic cells. &#xd;
Poly(acrylic acid)-block-(2-cinnamoyloxylethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(perfluorooctylethyl methacrylate) or PAA-b-PCEMA-b-PFOEMA self-assembles in solvent mixtures of α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (TFT) and methanol, which are selective towards PAA.  At TFT volume fraction (fTFT) of 40 %, the copolymer forms vesicles at 70 oC and cylinders at 21 oC.  These two structures inter-convert via meta-stable intermediates including jellyfish-like, tethered vesicular, and bilayer sheet-like structures.  These structures occur in kinetic experiments involving quick temperature swing from 21 to 70 oC or vice versa and also in experiments involving annealing samples long at temperatures between 21 to 70 oC.  Thus, they are meta-stable and point to complex pathways for the morphological transition.  At fTFT = 10 %, the polymer forms vesicles with bumpy surface at 70 oC and toroids with sharp angles at 21 oC.  Closely examined is how the liquid crystalline nature of the PFOEMA block affects the formation of these unique morphologies and their morphological transitions. &#xd;
Two types of hierarchical assembly of cylindrical micelles (cylinders) or crosslinked cylindrical micelles (fibers) of block copolymers are examined.  First, carboxyl-bearing nanofibers of PAA-b-PCEMA and amino-bearing nanocylinders from poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-dimethylamino-ethylmethacrylate), PtBA-b-PCEMA-b-PDMAEMA, are mixed in solvent.  The two species firstly aggregate via electrostatic interaction.  Upon heating and aging, the cylinders dissociate on the fibers and eventually evolve into composite multilayered cylindrical structures.  Second, layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition of carboxyl- and amine-bearing nanofibers yielded multilayer films.  These films detached from a substrate separate nanospheres based on their size and surface charge differences.&#xd;
Diblock copolymers poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate-random-2-[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyroyoxyethyl methacrylate) (T-C60C) and poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(2-acetoxyethyl methacrylate-random-2-[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyroyoxyethyl methacrylate) (T-C60A) are synthesized and used as compatibilizers for polymer-based photovoltaic cells containing poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).  Both copolymers can stabilize the morphology of the active layer and thus the device performance.  T-C60A in the active layer yields longer life-times and better initial performance of the devices, due to the matching of surface tensions between C60A and PCBM.</description>

   <description>The Hudson-James Bay Lowlands (HJBL) are composed of fens and bogs frequently intersected by rivers and punctured by bioherms (ancient reef mounds) rising from bedrock aquifer. The peatlands exist partly due to minimal vertical losses limited by the low hydraulic conductivity (K) of the Tyrrell Sea sediments and small vertical gradients between the surface and bedrock aquifers. The recent development of an open-pit mine; DeBeers Victor Diamond Mine within the HJBL requires dewatering of the regional limestone aquifer to a depth of 200 mbgs. Two major components in assessing the potential impacts of dewatering on the hydrogeological regime and the sensitive peatland ecosystem are: the characteristics and behaviour of the Tyrrell Sea aquitard, and bioherms as potential recharge enhancing features.&#xd;
The Victor Tyrrell Sea (VTS) deposits are clayey silt with low LL, low PI, and no smectite clay minerals. The clay fraction consists of quartz, illite, chlinochlore, and usually calcite. The deposits are normally consolidated with Cc values of 0.08-0.155 and void ratios of 0.52-0.77. The VTS deposits are grey with pockets of black graphite and frequent shells. The K rages from 6.6x10-9 to 4.7x10-8 m/s.&#xd;
GEO-SLOPE™ finite element modeling software was used to investigate the sensitivity of surface drainage and consolidation behaviour in regard to the range of measured VTS parameters. The behaviours were also compared to classic clay aquitard types such as Lake Agassiz and Lake Champlain. Unit thickness, K, and the K modifier function have the greatest impact on the rate and magnitude of consolidation, and vertical drainage of the surface. The K of the underlying till is extremely important because they can be a buffer between the dewatered bedrock aquifer and the VTS.&#xd;
The characteristics of the sediments and the flow regime surrounding three outcropping bioherms which increase vertical drainage are investigated and a conceptual model of flow is proposed.  The sediments in profile around bioherms have different levels of stratification but always contain silt and sand units. The hydraulic conditions at eight nested piezometers and the stratigraphy as defined by a series of auger hole profiles  was considered to develop a conceptual model. The flow regime presented is of radial flow towards the bioherms enhanced by high K sediments between the peat and bedrock becoming vertical flow when the high K sediments contact vertical channels in the rock.</description>

   <description>Siblings are an integral part of the support network for adults with a developmental disability (DD). However, little is known about the psychological stress of having a sibling with a DD in adulthood. This project had four main objectives: (1) to identify variables that predict and moderate psychological well-being and depressive symptoms in adults who have a sibling with a DD; (2) to examine differences in sibling relationship characteristics, psychological well-being, depressive symptoms, and support use in siblings of individuals with a DD alone versus siblings of individuals with a DD and symptoms of a mental illness; (3) to determine whether relationships with siblings with a DD differ from relationships with siblings without a DD; and (4) to explore the perspectives of adults with a DD regarding their sibling relationships and how these relationships affect their well-being.&#xd;
	One-hundred ninety six adult siblings of individuals with a DD completed online questionnaires about life events, relationship closeness, sibling contact, impact of having a sibling with a DD, family functioning, use of supports, symptoms of depression, and psychological well-being. Life events and having a sibling with a DD and behavioural or psychiatric symptoms predicted symptoms of depression and psychological well-being. However, the relationship between these predictor variables and psychological well-being was moderated by general family functioning. Additionally, siblings of individuals with a DD and behavioural or psychiatric symptoms reported less positive feelings about their sibling relationship, more symptoms of depression, and lower psychological well-being than siblings of individuals with a DD alone. &#xd;
	A subset of the participants (n = 128) who also had a sibling without a DD completed questionnaires about their relationship closeness, sibling contact, and perceived impact of their sibling without a DD. Participants reported more in-person and telephone contact with siblings with a DD, more positive feelings about the sibling relationship, and greater perceived life impact as compared to their relationship with their sibling without a DD. &#xd;
	Seventeen adults with a DD also completed in-person interviews and answered questions about their sibling relationship closeness, shared activities, and support exchanged with siblings. Participants identified numerous activities they enjoyed doing with siblings and indicated a desire to spend more time with siblings. They also reported that they both provided support to and received support from their siblings.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the ways in which socio-cultural, economic and religious ideologies shape discourses on women’s rights, higher education and empowerment in Ghana.  The study starts from the premise that female identity in Ghana is constructed through discourses of reproduction that produce and reproduce unequal gender relations that negatively impact women’s higher socio-economic and educational attainments. Consequently, discourses of women’s rights and empowerment are inextricably linked to normative reproductive labour expectations. Using a postcolonial feminist theoretical framework, I argue that women’s rights and empowerment issues must be located within particular historical, local and global socio-cultural and political discourses in postcolonial societies. Subsequently, this study situates women’s rights concerns within the larger framework of global systemic inequalities that reinforce the local socio-cultural, political and economic disadvantages of women in Ghana. I interviewed women’s rights activists, conducted focus group discussions with male and mostly female participants during an intensive six-month field study. In line with postcolonial feminist epistemologies, I consider participants as knowledgeable subjects in the production of knowledge about their lived realities, by centering their voices and experiences in my analyses. The experiences of research participants (heterogeneous as they are) provide excellent insights into transnational feminisms, gendered postcolonial landscapes, and global cultural patriarchal hegemonies. These experiences also illustrate how global discourses of rights provide leverage to simultaneously challenge and politicize colonial discourses of race and gender in the global south.</description>

   <description>The electron rich and aromatic character of the indole group allows for a wide range of oxidative and substitution reactions, creating a versatile platform for generating structurally diverse molecules. This thesis explores enzyme and synthetic chemistries that act upon indoles and related molecules. Chapter 1 describes the results of in vivo studies of RebC, an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of the indolocarbazole alkaloid rebeccamycin. A homologous enzyme, StaC, exists in the biosynthetic pathway for staurosporine, a related indolocarbazole. Structural differences between the RebC and StaC active sites were hypothesized to play a pivotal role in determining the oxidation state in the corresponding natural products. Sequence alignment of RebC and StaC with homologous enzymes from related indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathways revealed six non-conserved residues in the active site. Three RebC variants were generated by replacement of all six, four, or two specific residues with their StaC counterparts. It was demonstrated that only two substitutions, F216V and R239N, are required to convert the specificity of RebC to that of StaC. Analysis of the structure of the RebC bound to a putative reaction intermediate supports the importance of F216 and R239 in catalysis. Based on these results, contrasting mechanisms for RebC and StaC are proposed to account for their differing specificities. &#xd;
     Chapter 2 describes a synthetic approach to primarily heterocyclic analogues of lycogarubin C. Suzuki coupling of appropriately functionalized 3,4-dibromopyrrole or 3,4-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)pyrrole was effective for numerous π-excessive five-membered heterocyclic-3-boronic acids. The optimized conditions were less effective for cross-couplings involving heteroaromatic-2-boronic acids, π-deficient heteroaromatic boronic acids, and heteroaromatic boropinacolate esters. Oxidative cyclization of the 3,4-bis(thiophen-3-yl)pyrrole and 3,4-bis(benzothiophen-3-yl)pyrrole to give analogues of the corresponding indolocarbazoles was demonstrated. &#xd;
     Chapter 3 describes preliminary results on the development of regioselective C-5 and C-7 indole metalation tactics of indole-6-carboxamides, in order to provide new functionalized indoles. The use of an indole C-2 silicon protection strategy in combination with a sterically bulky C-6 N,N-di-isopropyl carboxamide directed metalation group overcame undesired side reactions observed with the analogous N,N-diethyl indole-6-carboxamide, affording the C-5 and C-7 substituted products in 40% and 13% yields, respectively.</description>

   <subject>principal</subject>
   <description>A professional workshop series has been designed for the purpose of bringing together Ontario’s aspiring principal leaders who are considering moving into a leadership position. The workshop series accommodates working professionals who are unable to attend a full day. The workshops are designed for meeting once per week for two hours; however, a full day workshop could easily be accommodated. The four workshops provide a forum for professional dialogue and critical self-reflection. The workshop topics have been purposefully selected to provide participants with information about the Ontario Ministry of Education’s leadership initiatives. Issues one must consider before assuming a principal’s position are also presented to assist participants in making an informed decision about their leadership pathway. Participants will actively engage with the Institute for Education Leadership’s (n. d.) “Self Assessment Tool for Aspiring Leaders” document which was published for the purpose of assisting Ontario’s aspiring leaders with personalized leadership development. Future leaders will also be provided with information regarding administrative portfolio development, the Principal’s Qualification Program, and an extensive online leadership development reading list.</description>

   <description>What is metaphor and how do we learn to think analogically?  Education by Metaphor explores these questions from two perspectives: poetics and curriculum theorizing.  Through this discursive inquiry, I develop arguments and hypotheses on the origins, mechanics, and educative possibilities of metaphor, often by drawing from Zwicky’s philosophical work and interviews I conducted with six Canadian writers.  I sought conversations with these writers because the works they publish display deft and provocative analogical play.  I wanted to know what they know about metaphor, and how they came to know such things, and how these ideas inform their critical, artistic, and pedagogical practices.  I also asked for their thoughts on particular discursive conflicts and metaphoric models, and I asked them about their curricular experiences, both formal and otherwise.  Excerpts from these transcripts are interwoven throughout the manuscript, according to their connections with the topics at hand.&#xd;
&#xd;
     The first chapter of this dissertation traces metaphor’s discursive history and delineates its conflict with philosophy.  From that foundation, I critique contemporary models for metaphor that stem from Black’s and Richards’ theorizing; after explaining why they are ill-suited to poetic terrain, I develop a less reductive model.  Much of this work informs subsequent chapters, hence its preliminary positioning.  In the second chapter I approach metaphor anthropologically and advance hypotheses for how we, as a species, might have come to think metaphorically.  These hypotheses emphasize empathy and anthropomorphism, two important notions nested within the inner-workings of analogical thought.  In turn, these hypotheses inform the third chapter’s explorations of poetic and ontological attention.  This theoretical work reveals concepts integrally related to metaphor’s emergence, for example aesthetic experience, defamiliarization, and the interplay of pattern and anomaly.  In the fourth chapter, I revisit these concepts from a more empirical perspective and use comments from my interviewees to illuminate intersections amongst play, pedagogy, and analogical thought.  Lastly, the fifth chapter asks, what good is the study of metaphor?  I respond to this question by addressing metaphor’s imaginative, ethical, and educational consequences.</description>

   <description>Molecular-targeting therapeutics directed towards growth factor receptors have become promising interventions in cancer. They include the family of mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor, TrkA and insulin. In particular, the insulin receptor (IR) is one of the most well-known members of the RTK family of receptors playing a role in cancer. IRs are covalently-linked heterodimers of αβ subunits on the cell membrane in the absence of insulin. The IR signaling pathways are initially triggered by insulin binding to the α subunits followed by the interaction of β subunits and ATP. The parameter(s) controlling IR activation remains unknown. Here, we report a membrane receptor signaling platform initiated by insulin binding to its receptor to induce Neu1 in live HTC-IR and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines. Microscopy colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that Neu1 and MMP9 form a complex with naïve and insulin-treated receptors. Tamiflu (neuraminidase inhibitor), galardin and piperazine (broad range MMP inhibitors), MMP9 specific inhibitor and anti-Neu1 antibody blocked Neu1 activity associated with insulin stimulated live cells. Moreover, Tamiflu, anti-Neu1 antibody, and MMP9 specific inhibitor blocked insulin induced insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation (p-IRS1). The previous findings reveal a molecular organizational signaling platform of Neu1 and MMP-9 crosstalk in alliance with insulin receptors. It proposes that insulin binding to the receptor induces MMP9 to activate Neu1, which hydrolyzes α-2,3 sialic acid in removing steric hindrance to generate a functional receptor. The results predict a prerequisite desialylation process by activated Neu1. A complete understanding of IR activation and the role of sialic acids in the&#xd;
iii&#xd;
signaling pathways may provide a therapeutic strategy in the prevention of different diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cancer.</description>

   <description>During pipe bursting, a cone shaped expander is pulled through an existing pipe, breaking it, enlarging the cavity, and pulling a replacement pipe into place. The expansion of the soil cavity and axial movements of the burst head cause ground disturbance, and infrastructure such as other buried pipelines and overlying pavements may be damaged. Pipe bursting involves a complex three dimensional response of the ground surrounding the old pipe. A three dimensional numerical study has therefore been undertaken to explicitly simulate propagation of the burst head, and study the response of soil and adjacent pipelines in detail. &#xd;
A description of the ABAQUS modeling is presented, focusing on the analysis of pipe bursting experiments conducted using the buried infrastructure test facilities at Queen’s. The ground surface deformations, pulling forces and strains on an adjacent polyvinyl chloride pipe were computed and compared with experimental observations. On average, the computed results differ by 20% compared to experimental values. In addition, the stress and strain responses of soil were analyzed to explain the failure mechanism of soil during progression of the burst head.&#xd;
A parametric study was conducted by changing the burial depths, expansion ratios, trench widths, and material properties to provide a general guideline for ground movements during pipe bursting. The analysis was further extended by changing the positions (under, over, beside) and orientations (perpendicular or parallel) of adjacent pipelines with respect to the pipe being replaced. Use of the parametric study was illustrated and evaluated using a large scale pipe bursting test. The computed results are about 20% conservative compared to the experimental values of peak vertical deformations and peak longitudinal strains of adjacent pipe.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the synthesis and application of three types of selectively functionalized mesoporous materials. In the first section, periodically ordered mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) are prepared that have the axially chiral bidentate phosphine ligand 2,2'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (BINAP) embedded in the wall structure. Asymmetric hydrogenation of β-ketoesters under high-pressure hydrogen gas and hydrogen transfer reduction were carried out using Ru catalysts resulting from these materials. In the next chapter, our new methodology to selectively functionalize the internal/external surface of SBA-15, a mesoporous silica whose pore diameter is ~8 nm, by blocking the pore surface with reloaded Pluronic P123® micelles is presented. Multiple tests were attempted to validate the efficiency of the methodology including nitrogen adsorption, quantitative analysis by solid state NMRs, fluorescence measurements, elemental analysis and XPS. Eventually SS NMR proved to be the most appropriate. Finally, chapter four describes ordered organic materials in catalysis, namely star-shaped polymers containing chiral core-gels synthesized from chiral 1,1’- binaphthalene-2,2’-diol (BINOL) and 1,1’-binaphthalene-2,2’-diamine (BINAM). The kinetic resolution of 1-phenyl ethanol was carried out expecting to see differential affinity of the chiral core-gel to one enantiomer of the substrate in hydrogen transfer oxidation reaction.</description>

   <description>Existing specifications for asphalt cement employ insufficient aging  and conditioning times prior to testing and low strains during the actual test which are insufficient to predict asphalt performance, especially if the materials are modified with additives such as those used for warm mix technology. However, slightly modified protocols, like increasing the conditioning time in the bending beam rheometer (BBR) test and increasing the aging duration in the pressure aging vessel (PAV), predict asphalt performance better than the current Superpave™ specification. These improved protocols are published as new test standards through the collaborative effort between the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Queen’s University. &#xd;
	In this study, the effects of warm mix and other additives on rheological, aging and failure properties are investigated. The properties are measured by regular tests and by modified protocols. The latter include the extended BBR test (LS-308) and the double-edge-notched tension (DENT) test (LS-299). Changes in ductile strain tolerance within base asphalts due to the various additives as measured with the DENT test were found to be very significant. The DENT results like essential work of fracture, we, plastic work of fracture term, βwp, and critical crack tip opening displacement, CTOD, are usually helped to correlate with the cracking distress survey results of the pavement in service. The addition of amide and polyethylene waxes risks increasing the cracking susceptibility in the pavement. They show a negative effect on strain tolerance in the ductile state, which is likely to show up as premature and/or excessive cracking in service which is similar to their physical hardening behavior from low temperature grading and extended BBR testing.</description>

   <description>Chemotherapeutic treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is substantially challenged by several membrane-spanning, multidrug-efflux pumps of the three-component RND family. Of these pumps, MexXY-OprM contributes to the intrinsic resistance of this organism by exporting clinically relevant antibiotics, most notably the ribosome-targeting aminoglycosides. Overproduction of MexXY-OprM is the most common mechanism providing pan-aminoglycoside resistance to P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis clinical isolates. The mexXY genes are located in an operon, the expression of which is induced by ribosome-targeting antimicrobials. The mexXY operon is negatively regulated by MexZ, a repressor protein encoded by the divergently-transcribed gene mexZ. A second gene, PA5471, is also induced by ribosome-targeting antibiotics and is required for antibiotic induction of mexXY expression. One possibility is that PA5471 interacts with MexZ to alleviate repression of mexXY, thereby providing a mechanism for PA5471-dependent drug inducibility of mexXY. PA5471 interaction with MexZ was confirmed using a bacterial two-hybrid assay. To identify residues/regions of PA5471 important for interaction with MexZ, random chemical mutagenesis of the mexZ and PA5471 genes was carried out and the effects of these mutations on interaction of their protein products was assessed using the bacterial two-hybrid assay. Mutations of PA5471 that compromised interaction with MexZ included P68S, G76C, R216C, R221W, R221Q, G231D, and G252S, which occur within or in close proximity to a predicted surface-exposed α-helix of a PA5471 structural model that may contribute to the MexZ-interaction domain. Representative mutations P68S, G76C, R216C and R221W were placed into the chromosome of P. aeruginosa to assess their impact on drug-inducible mexXY expression. All of these mutations significantly reduced mexX upregulation in the presence of spectinomycin, where mutations R216C and R221W resulted in the near complete ablation of this antibiotic induction. These data suggest that PA5471 acts as a direct antirepressor of MexZ and that this interaction is key to mexXY upregulation in response to ribosome-targeting induction signals.</description>

   <description>Acrylic resins used as polymeric binders in automotive coatings are complex copolymers containing reactive functional (often hydroxyl) groups. A better understanding of the copolymerization kinetics of these monomers is required in order to ensure uniform distribution of the functional groups among the polymer chains over the course of production. Free radical copolymerization propagation kinetics of styrene (ST) with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) have been investigated both in bulk and solution, using pulsed-laser polymerization (PLP) combined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and proton NMR. All of the solvents examined (n-butanol, toluene and DMF) affect ST/HEMA copolymer composition relative to bulk polymerization, while the effects on propagation rates suggest that hydrogen bonding interactions need to be explicitly considered. Semibatch reactions of ST/HEMA, butyl acrylate (BA)/HEMA and butyl methacrylate (BMA)/HEMA have been carried out in xylene, DMF and 1-pentanol at 110 and 138 °C. The variation in monomer composition for the three solvents agrees with the kinetic studies. It was found that polymer molecular weight is strongly affected by solvent choice and operating conditions, partially due to branching reactions caused by impurities from commercial HEMA monomers. PLP and 13C-NMR analysis indicate that no backbiting occurred during polymerization of HEA, and it is shown that H-bonding disrupts the backbiting mechanism found for other acrylates. Thus, semibatch production in n-butanol can reduce branching and increase molecular weight of BA homopolymers by a factor of five compared to polymerization in xylene.</description>

   <description>Despite over seven decades of speciation research and 25 years of phylogeographic studies, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms that generate biological species remains elusive. In temperate zones, the pervasiveness of range fragmentation and subsequent range expansions suggests that secondary contact between diverging lineages may be important in the evolution of species. Thus, such contact zones provide compelling opportunities to investigate evolutionary processes, particularly the roles of geographical isolation in initiating, and indirect selection against hybrids in completing (reinforcement), the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. &#xd;
The spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) has six well-supported mitochondrial lineages many of which are now in secondary contact. Here I investigate the evolutionary consequences of secondary contact of two such lineages (Eastern and Interior) in Southwestern Ontario using genetic, morphological, acoustical, experimental, and behavioural evidence to show accentuated divergence of the mate recognition system in sympatry. &#xd;
	Mitochondrial and microsatellite data distinguish these two lineages but also show ongoing hybridization. Bayesian assignment tests and cline analysis imply asymmetrical introgression of Eastern lineage nuclear markers into Interior populations. Male calls are divergent between Eastern and Interior allopatric populations and show asymmetrical reproductive character displacement in sympatry. Female preference of pure lineage individuals is also exaggerated in sympatry, with hybrids showing intermediate traits and preference. I suggest that these patterns are most consistent with secondary reinforcement.&#xd;
	I assessed levels of post-zygotic isolation between the Eastern and Interior lineages using a laboratory hybridization experiment. Hybrid tadpoles showed equal to or greater fitness than their pure lineage counterparts, but this may be countered through competition. More deformities and developmental anomalies in hybrid tadpoles further suggest post-zygotic isolation.&#xd;
	Despite evidence for pre-mating isolation between the two lineages, isolation appears incomplete (i.e. hybridization is ongoing). I hypothesize that potentially less attractive hybrids may circumvent female choice by adopting satellite behaviour. Although mating tactics are related to body size, genetic status may play a role. I show that pure Eastern males almost always engage in calling, while hybrids adopt a satellite tactic. An absence of assortative mating, despite evidence of female preference, suggests successful satellite interception possibly facilitating introgression.</description>

   <description>Background: As the paradigm underlying mental health care slowly shifts from an approach primarily institutional and medical in its orientation toward one more community-based and recovery-oriented, housing needs have come to the forefront. Many people with persistent mental illness accept group home living situations that do not necessarily meet their needs, and do not align with the recovery vision. Research focused on recovery for residents of group homes is all but absent in the literature. &#xd;
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the challenges and opportunities for enabling group homes to increase their capacity to serve as an environment that integrates the recovery vision. &#xd;
Method: Using ethnographic methods, this case study examined the cultural milieu of a group home, how recovery is understood within the setting, and the impact of policies and practices on enacting the recovery vision. By converging multiple strategies for data collection (participant observation, key informant interviews, and document analysis), a multi-level perspective was achieved. The use of the social-ecological model, with its attention to multiple levels of influence, emerged as a highly relevant perspective, without which the recovery vision cannot be realized.&#xd;
Findings: The culture within the home revealed a comfortable atmosphere, basic needs being met, access to planned and unplanned activity, and caring relationships with staff, which contribute to a place attachment that could be difficult to loosen. There is a lack of awareness of recovery-enabling practice at multiple levels, which emerged as a key challenge to its implementation. Although some policies at the government level support self-sufficiency as an important objective, others make progress towards this ideal difficult, if not impossible, such as those related to funding. The focus on enhancing well-being in the day-to-day setting subsumes the growth goals associated with recovery.&#xd;
Conclusion: Integrating the recovery vision within group home could benefit from confronting well-established approaches, embracing advocacy roles, and addressing mechanisms for change at multiple levels. Only then will people with mental illness living in group homes reap the benefits of social justice, social inclusion and full citizenship that come with recovery.</description>

   <description>Fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) have gained considerable popularity as a building and repair material. In particular, FRPs have been an economical means of extending the life of structures. As time passes, an increased number and variety of new and old structures are incorporating FRPs as reinforcement and for rehabilitation. Perhaps most common are their applications for bridge structures. Much of the reluctance towards the inclusion of FRP as primary reinforcement or as a rehabilitation measure in building structures is due to its poor performance in fires. In order to move forward with an understanding of how FRP may overcome its temperature-related short comings, it is important to explore the behaviour of FRP, and structures which utilize FRP for reinforcement, at elevated temperatures.&#xd;
The results of a testing program including eleven high temperature, two room temperature intermediate-scale, FRP-strengthened, and one unstrengthened reinforced concrete beam tests are presented. The elevated temperature tests were conducted on both un-post-cured and post-cured FRP strengthening at temperatures up to 211°C. The tests also utilized a novel method for heating and post-curing FRP-strengthening in place. The strengthened beams exhibited strength gains above the unstrengthened reference beam, and it has been demonstrated that post-curing of an FRP system can be effective at increasing an FRP’s performance at elevated temperatures. Exposed to constant temperatures, un-post-cured specimens still exhibited substantial FRP strength at exposure temperatures up to Tg+79°C. Post-cured specimens exhibited similar performance at temperatures of Tg+43°C. The transient temperature tests resulted in beam failure at an average temperature of 186°C and 210°C for un-post-cured and post-cured FRP strengthening respectively at a constant applied load level 93% of that of the room temperature strengthened control beam. The results of this testing program demonstrate that FRP strengthening can remain effective when exposed to temperatures well above the measured value of Tg.</description>

   <title>Understanding Humour: A Teacher’s Handbook</title>

   <subject>Education</subject>
   <description>Humour is found wherever there are people. In schools the way that students and teachers laugh and joke gives an instant impression of any classroom. A lack of laughter is just as telling. But humour is complex. Why do we laugh? Why do we say one thing and mean another? How can two people have completely different reactions to the same joke? For students, humour is vital in establishing group norms and behaviour and is used as a way of talking about subjects they find uncomfortable. For a teacher, humour can be an effective tool to increase student retention of subject matter and a way to create immediacy in the classroom. For school administration, humour is an opportunity and a problem; by encouraging humour an institution can be seen as more accessible but the misuse or misunderstanding of humour can lead to negative consequences—students can feel demeaned by a teacher’s sarcastic comments and humorous teasing often accompanies bullying behaviour. This handbook provides teachers with the information, language, and tools they need to gain a fuller understanding of the opportunities and pitfalls of using humour in the classroom.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-03-01 06:28:50.729</description>
   <description>A number of aspects of the coining process are investigated, both through experimentation using several types of tooling using blanks made of copper 110 or brass 260, and by developing and using a FEA model. Several relationships have been found which describe the effects of changing the type of coin blank or the geometry of the coining tooling on how much volume of the coin is formed at different forces. &#xd;
&#xd;
The open-die bulk upsetting test was used to find the true stress and strain curves of both materials, and the ring test was used to determine the coefficient of friction. Coins were made over a large range of forces in order to test the general nature of how the diameter and design of a coin are formed. While the diameter begins to increase, the thickness of the coin reduces and material is pushed into the punch cavity, filling the design’s volume up rather linearly. &#xd;

Tests on the effects of changes in the wall angle were inconclusive. As the punch design depth increased the force requirement went down in a manner roughly inverse to the ratio of the increase in depth. Effects of coining with a punch on one side versus two sides were tested. Effects of the perimeter of the punch design showed that a longer perimeter actually reduced the forces required for thinner coins, a difference that got smaller as the coin blanks got thicker. &#xd;
&#xd;
Blanks required 1.4 times the force to form than a coin half its thickness. A direct correlation of forming force to the yield stress of the material was expected but rather appeared to be related to the full nature of the true stress-strain curves.&#xd;
The FEA model was able to match experimental results relatively closely, but only up to about 333.3 kN, the lowest force used for the bulk of the experimental samples. The FEA model provided a good look into what happens to the coin while it is under load and the mysteries of ghost coining were unveiled.</description>

   <description>Precise manipulation of heterogeneous droplets on an open droplet microfluidic platform could have numerous practical advantages in a broad range of applications, from proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and microreactors, to medical diagnostic platforms capable of assaying complex biological analytes. Toward the aim of developing electrically controllable micropost arrays for use in open droplet manipulation, custom-designed titanium dioxide (TiO2)- loaded poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) micropost arrays were developed in this work and indirectly mechanically actuated by applying an electric field. Initial experiments explored the bulk properties of TiO2-loaded PDMS films, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirming a uniform TiO2 particle distribution in the PDMS, and tensile testing of bulk films showing an inverse relationship between TiO2 % (w/w) and Young’s Modulus with the Young’s Moduli quantified as 4.22 ± 0.51 MPa for unloaded PDMS, 2.27 ± 0.18 MPa for 10 % (w/w) TiO2, and 1.39 ± 0.20 MPa for 20 % (w/w) TiO2. Following bulk material evaluation, soft lithography methods were developed to fabricate TiO2- loaded PDMS micropost arrays. Mathematical predictions were applied to design microposts of varying shape, length, and gap spacing to yield super-hydrophobic surfaces actuatable by an electric field. Visual inspection and optical microscopy of the resulting arrays confirmed a non- collapsed micropost geometry. Overall, round microposts that were 100, 200, and 300 μm in length, 15 μm in diameter, and spaced 50 μm apart were produced largely free of defects, and used in contact angle measurements and micropost deflection experiments. Droplet contact angles measured on the arrays remained above 120° indicating the arrays successfully provided super- hydrophobic surfaces. Individual microposts deflected most notably above an electric field strength of 520 kV/m (12.5 kV nominal voltage). The ability to mechanically deflect customized microposts using an electric field demonstrated by this work is promising for translating this technology to precise droplet manipulation applications. Indirect actuation of droplets could enable the manipulation of liquids with varying electrical properties, which is a limitation of current micropumping technologies. Once optimized, electrically actuated micropost arrays could significantly contribute to the micro- handling of heterogeneous, highly ionic, and/or deionized fluids.</description>

   <description>Factor VIII (FVIII) is an essential blood-clotting protein and mutations in the FVIII gene are the cause of hemophilia A, a severe inherited bleeding disorder. FVIII synthesis has been observed in discreet endothelial sub-populations including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and in selected microvascular beds. The mechanistic basis for this differential expression is unknown. Differences in shear stress are believed to play an important role in determining endothelial heterogeneity. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of various shear stress conditions on FVIII expression in blood outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (BOECs) with an in vitro flow system. Under static conditions, BOECs do not express FVIII. In contrast, after exposure to laminar shear stress for 48 hrs, a significant increase in FVIII expression was documented by qRT-PCR, regardless of the magnitude of shear stress studied (1, 5, 15 and 30 dynes/cm2). To determine the effect of prolonged shear stress, laminar flow was applied over 120 hrs and FVIII mRNA levels returned to static levels. Induction of gene expression by laminar shear stress followed by repression after longer durations is common to other pro-coagulant genes induced by non-laminar or oscillatory flow (eg. tissue factor). BOECs exposed to 15 dyne/cm2 of shear stress, oscillating every 0.5 sec for 120 hrs, had FVIII mRNA levels 4.7-fold that of cells in static conditions. This was significantly higher than FVIII expression in BOECs exposed to 15 dyne/cm2 of laminar shear stress for the same duration. Expression of KLF2, a transcription factor that suppresses endothelial pro-coagulant gene expression under laminar shear stress, was significantly reduced in BOECs exposed to oscillatory as opposed to laminar shear stress. Finally, in BOECs exposed to oscillatory shear stress, FVIII protein was synthesized and co-localizes with its carrier protein VWF in Weibel-Palade bodies. These studies show that shear stress is a significant regulator of FVIII expression in BOECs, that FVIII expression is inversely correlated with that of KLF2, and that FVIII protein co-localizes with VWF in these cells.</description>

   <description>Rapid advances in hardware technology are making it possible to manufacture different types of Sensor Nodes (SN) that results in fast growing heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These WSN’s are applicable for a wide range of applications relevant for military, industry and domestic use.  However, WSNs have particular features such as scarce resources which can affect their performance. In addition, WSNs are subject to experience changes that can occur both within the condition of the network, due to factors such as node mobility or node failure (prevalent in harsh environments), and with regards to user requirements. Consequently, it is vital for WSNs to sense the current network conditions and user requirements to be able to perform efficiently. Cognition is necessarily introduced in WSNs as a response to this need. Cognition in the context of WSNs deals with the ability to be aware of the environment and user requirements and to proactively adapt to changes. &#xd;
This thesis proposes a hierarchical architecture along with a cognitive network management protocol capable of enabling cognition in WSNs. Specifically; this research introduces Cognitive Nodes (CN) into WSNs so that they can manage the cognitive network. The cognitive network management process is composed of three sub-processes: 1) scanning the network, 2) decision-making, and 3) updating the nodes from taken decisions.Scanning the network process aims to provide an awareness of current network conditions. Therefore, at the first execution, each CN creates a profile table for each node in its purview and updates the tables periodically during the network operation. In decision making process, CNs make necessary decisions in terms of the working state of SNs (active/sleep), the duration of this state, and the Frequency of Sensing (FoS). Decision making process uses an optimization scheme to find the optimal number of active SNs in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. Finally, the nodes will be informed of the taken decisions. Based on the simulation and implementation results, the proposed cognitive WSN shows a significant enhancement in terms of the network’s longevity, its ability to negotiate competing objectives, and its ability to serve users more efficiently.</description>

   <description>Neutron diffraction is a widely used technique for measuring internal stresses inside polycrystalline materials.  By examining the diffraction patterns collected during in situ uniaxial deformation, the lattice strains along various crystallographic directions can be calculated.  These lattice strains give insight into the active deformation mechanisms active within the material during plastic deformation.  This is most commonly done by fitting model results to the experimentally measured lattice strains through an iterative process of refining the model parameters.&#xd;
&#xd;
A numerical optimization technique was successfully applied to the problem of refining the input parameters of an elastoplastic self-consistent (EPSC) model.  The results were found to be comparable to those obtained by a past researcher manually refining the model parameters and subjectively judging the fit to the experimental data.  The numerical optimization method was able to reach an acceptable result much faster than is possible by a human being (days as opposed to weeks or months), meaning that it has the potential to reduce the turn-around time from data collection to interpretation/publication significantly.&#xd;
&#xd;
At the same time, common experimental techniques for conducting diffraction experiments during uniaxial deformation tests were examined.  It is common to use an interrupted loading scheme where the sample is brought to a certain loading condition and then held steady while the neutron data is collected, a processes that often takes several minutes.  This interrupted loading may be done such that the sample is held at constant stress, strain, or simply by having the load frame stay in a constant position.  Each of these different loading modes results in a particular type of relaxation within the sample as it is being held, so a series of experiments were conducted to investigate any impact these different relaxation types may have on the measured values of the lattice strains.  Overall it was found that both qualitative and quantitative differences in the recorded data can arise as a result of the different loading modes, and that such differences tend to manifest themselves at or near the point at which the material begins to yield macroscopically.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
Framed within a wholly Indigenous  paradigm - Gayanehsragowah  - my dissertation is a counterstory constructed to engage colonialism in a decolonizing research and writing project. I chose story, an autoethnographic novel, as form to represent Indigenous reflexive method; a metaphoric text performed to unlock metaphor’s meaning, once known, I see through to and refract truth upon my own life story implicit within that text. To illustrate human potential for healing and self-change, I construct pedagogical relationship between lived experience and theoretical meaning in interlocking and entangled threads inseparable from form, not possible in conventional thesis organization. Tadoda:ho, the Great Law icon for transformation centers my inquiry into effects of cultural, social and political disconnection from Hodinohso:ni:  systems; in particular, I examine historical unresolved grief carried both over the life span and across generations. I use Denzin’s approach to critical personal narrative, Ellis’s autoethnographic method and Richardson’s creative analytical practice to create an interpretive text comprised of short stories, poetry, conversations, dialogue, visual representation and layered accounts. My inquiry reveals Battiste’s transforming energy flux, which I call spirit, manifests in Indigenous language structures, and similar to Ellis’s evocative and analytical texts, once voiced through writing, creates change in the universe and in self. Critical reflection and representation of an Indigenous world in constant motion to renew livingness lends key knowledge that reconnection to ancestral histories, lands, and cultures restores Indigenous identity to resolve the trauma of historical grief. As Gayanehsragowah is performative healing narrative, my inquiry intends to add new knowledge of Indigenous story as form with power to inform self-change.</description>

   <description>In this work, a micro-model of the catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was developed. &#xd;
The micro-model includes the transport phenomena and the reaction kinetics within a three dimensional micro-structure representing a sample of PEMFC catalyst layer. &#xd;
Proper physical boundary conditions have been described on the surfaces of the sample as well as on the interfaces between &#xd;
the regions through which all constituents are solved in a coupled manner. A four-phase micro-structure of CL was reconstructed, the platinum particles were resolved in the &#xd;
computational grid generation and the governing equations &#xd;
were solved within platinum region. A body-fitted computational mesh was &#xd;
generated for the reconstructed micro-structure of CL. The number of computational cells were optimized based on how close to an analytical sphere the magnitude of the &#xd;
surface area of a sphere can be captured after generating the computational cells. The interfaces with important physical phenomena were more refined than the rest of &#xd;
the interfaces, specially the electrochemically active reaction surface. The computational mesh was checked for a grid independent numerical solution. The Knudsen effects was included &#xd;
by calculating the characteristic length in the pore region. Four different cases of including Knudsen effects were studied. Also, a comparison was made between solution with and without &#xd;
Knudsen effects. A physical model of oxygen dissolution was developed, the oxygen dissolution at the interface between pore and ionomer was treated as an superficial phenomenon. The performance &#xd;
curves were produced and provided for the &#xd;
reconstructed micro-structure along with the distribution of field variables. A length study of the reconstructed micro-structure was conducted such that the results from &#xd;
the micro-modeling can capture the trend in variable distributions observed in the macro-modeling of CL or experiments. A platinum loading study was preformed and the anomalous phenomena of &#xd;
dramatic increase in oxygen transport resistance observed in some experimental works was explained by isolating the ionomer region of the CL micro-structure and numerically calculating &#xd;
the shape factor for diffusive transport. It was found that the increase in oxygen transport resistance is due to the increase in diffusion pathway and decrease in the transport surface area.</description>

   <description>This is an examination of how conjugality acts as an access point for Canadian citizenship. The conjugal family unit — married or common-law — continues to be privileged in Canadian law and policy; this is especially evident in immigration policy and practice. Family class immigration continues to be a steady source of immigrants for Canada, spousal/partner sponsorship being the primary type of family reunification. In order to control access, a strict understanding of conjugality is used to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate families. When it comes to family class immigration, it is not simply a case of individuals sponsoring individuals; it is about the state producing and maintaining the ideal family unit through the provision of citizenship. My analysis proceeds in two main parts.  First, I engage with mainstream Canadian citizenship theory — focusing specifically on the work of Will Kymlicka and Rita Dhamoon — and analyze its focus on the individual citizen. Moreover, I examine how the state’s asymmetrical treatment of conjugality has created two versions of the conjugal family — the inside family (families within Canadian borders) and the outside family (families outside Canadian borders). Second, I explore the state’s reliance on conjugal relationships in their assessment of potential immigrants and refugees in three areas of immigration policy — the assessment of sexual minority refugee claimants, the assessment of common-law couples seeking sponsorship, and the government’s current crackdown on marriage fraud. Combined, these examples speak to the Canadian state’s vested interest in privileging the conjugal family unit; furthermore, they highlight how the inconsistent and often ambiguous treatment of conjugality undermines its effectiveness as the primary mode of identification in family class immigration. In summary, this dissertation integrates families into a body of scholarship that has ignored the role that one’s personal relationships plays in the provision of state access.</description>

   <description>From W.H. Auden’s The Age of Anxiety to Sigmund Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents, modernists have frequently attested to the anxiety permeating members of modern civilisation. While critics have treated anxiety as a consequence of the historical circumstances of the modernist period—two World Wars and the disintegration of European empires—my aim is to view anxiety in both a psychoanalytical and political light and investigate modernist anxiety as a narrative ploy that diagnoses the modern condition. Defining modernist anxiety as feelings of fear and alienation that reveal the uncanny relation between self and ideological state apparatuses which themselves suffer from trauma, perversion, and neurosis—I focus on the works of four key modernist writers—Sigmund Freud, Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, and Gertrude Stein. These authors have repeatedly constructed the mind as an open system, making the psyche one of the sites most vulnerable to the power of colonial ideology but also the modernist space par excellence to narrate the building and falling of empire. While the first part of my dissertation investigates the neurosis of post-war London in Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, the second part of my thesis discusses the perverse demands of the colonial system in Forster’s A Passage to India and Woolf’s The Waves, arguing that Woolf and Forster extend Freud’s understanding of repetition compulsion by demonstrating that the colonial system derives a “perverse” pleasure from repeating its own impossible demands. The concluding section of my dissertation discusses Woolf and Stein’s queer primitivism as the antidote to anxiety and the transcendence of perversity. My dissertation revives Freud’s role in the modernist project: Freud not only provides avant-garde writers with a theory of consciousness, but his construction of the fragmented psyche—a construction which had come to dominate modernist renditions of internality by the early-twentieth century—functions as a political stratagem for an imperial critique.</description>

   <title>Flexural Performance and Moment Connections of Concrete-Filled GFRP Tubes (CFFTs) and CFFT-encased Steel I-Sections</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2013-03-11 19:08:17.048</description>
   <description>The first part of this thesis addresses a new hybrid system, concrete-filled FRP tube (CFFT)-encased steel I-sections. The embedded steel section enhances flexural strength, stiffness and ductility, and facilitates connection of the CFFT member to footings or other members. Phase I addresses the flexural behaviour of the system through the testing of beam specimens with GFRP tubes which vary in thickness and laminate structure. The steel section enhances performance considerably, especially ductility, in tubes with cross-ply laminates, where significant sustained reserve strength remains upon fracture of the tube. CFFTs with angle-ply tubes show considerable inherent ductility on their own, although adding the steel section enhances strength and stiffness. Phase II addresses the development of a moment connection through cantilever tests. The connection consists of steel base plates welded to the steel sections, which are embedded into CFFT members at various length-to-span (Ls/L) ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. Three distinct failure modes are observed. At (Ls/L) ratios below 0.17, premature bond failure occurs. At ratios of 0.17 to 0.47, flexural tension failure of the tube occurs just beyond the free end of the steel section. Beyond a 0.47 ratio, the plastic hinge capacity is developed at the fixed end. A simple design-oriented model to predict strengths of the connection at the full range of (Ls/L) ratios is developed and validated. Also, a readily available computer program is adopted to model flexural behaviour of the CFFT-steel member itself. &#xd;
The second part of the thesis investigates unreinforced CFFT members, with emphasis on moment connections to concrete footings. The study explores the effect of maximum shear and maximum moment, both occurring at the same location, on the ultimate strength of CFFTs. Testing involves simple beams and cantilever specimens with varying shear spans and fixed end arrangements. End conditions consist of either direct embedment into concrete blocks with steel dowels, or mechanical clamping. For the cross-ply GFRP tubes used, the presence of shear at the location of maximum moment near the connection of the cantilevers does not reduce flexural capacity. Slip can prevent the CFFT member from attaining the potential moment capacity in spite of the tube failing due to tensile rupture.</description>

   <description>Crystals with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure are inherently anisotropic, and have a limited number of independent slip systems, which lead to strong deformation textures and reduced formability in polycrystalline products. In magnesium (Mg), all of the easy slip systems have a Burgers vector in the &lt;a> direction making twinning necessary for arbitrary shape changes. The most common twinning system which allows extension along the c-axis is {10-12}&lt;10-11>. A good predictor of slip is the global Schmid factor, which resolves the externally applied force onto the slip plane and direction of a crystal. The critically resolved shear stress (CRSS) at which a grain twins is not readily measured by experiment and the CRSS for twin initiation often appears larger than for twin propagation. In polycrystals, twin variants with both low and high Schmid factors have been observed indicating that this Schmid factor is inappropriate to predict twinning and more local effects play an important, though still uncertain role.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, experiments were devised to dynamically study extension twinning in a polycrystalline Mg alloy AZ31B with a strong basal rolling texture by tensile deformation parallel to the plate normal. Three-dimensional X-ray diffraction using a synchrotron source was used to map the centre-of-mass positions, orientations, and grain-resolved elastic strain tensors of over 1000 grains in-situ up to a true strain of 1.4%. The majority of twins formed in grains with a high local Schmid factor; however, low-ranked twin variants were common. The average grain-resolved stress did not always select the highest twin variant and resulted in some negative Schmid factors. The internal stress state of parent grains and twinned grains did not differ significantly within the large measurement uncertainties. The misorientations between grains ideally oriented for twinning and their nearest neighbours could not explain cases of no twin activity. Results suggest that the controlling factors for twin formation are much more local and not captured within the spatial resolution of the technique. Complimentary measurement of the strain rate sensitivity during twinning, by instantaneous strain rate change tests, suggest that basal slip is a part of this local process.</description>

   <description>Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). FL is clinically designated as an indolent disease with a long median survival of 8-10 years. However, the clinical and biological behavior of FL shows considerable variability, with some patients showing aggressive disease progression and very short survival. Because defects in the regulation of apoptotic cell death are fundamental in FL pathogenesis, we hypothesized that deregulated expression of components of the pRb signaling pathway may promote cell proliferation, thereby complementing antecedent anti-apoptotic mutations and producing more aggressive disease. In the present study we undertook an immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of expression of key cell-cycle regulatory proteins in diagnostic biopsies from 127 cases of FL using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) in tissue microarray (TMA) sections immunostained for p53, pRb, p16INK4A and cyclin D3. Data analysis revealed that increased abundance of p53 or p16INK4A is associated with reduced overall survival (OS) (p=0.005 and p=0.014 respectively), and with conventional pathological markers of tumour aggressiveness including high histologic grade. &#xd;
      Encouraged by this remarkable finding of a counterintuitive association between p16INK4A expression and clinical outcome, we analyzed CDKN2A gene deletion and methylation, as these are the most frequent mechanisms of the CDKN2A gene inactivation in NHL including FL. We determined the deletion and methylation status of CDKN2A in 105 FL cases. Laser-capture microdissection was used to enrich the samples for lymphoma cells. &#xd;
     CDKN2A was deleted in 9 cases and methylated in 22 cases. The 29 cases (28%) with CDKN2A deletion or methylation had decreased overall survival (OS) (p=0.046) in all cases and in cases treated with rituximab (p&lt;0.001). Our findings indicate that deleterious alterations of CDKN2A are relatively prevalent in FL at diagnosis and can predict poor clinical outcome.&#xd;
      In summary, our data reveal novel insights into the pathogenesis of FL and suggest a relationship between increased p16INK4A expression and CDKN2A deletion or methylation and unfavorable clinical outcome in FL. We hope that the work presented herein will provide a useful prognostic tool for predicting the prognosis and choosing optimal treatment approaches to help patients suffering from FL.</description>

   <description>Ultra-low doses (ULD) of the opioid receptor antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, augment the analgesic actions of morphine, block the induction of tolerance, and reverse established tolerance by an unknown mechanism. Preclinical studies demonstrate that chronic morphine administration induces spinal gliosis and that inhibition of gliosis prevents the development of analgesic tolerance to opioids. Thus, this thesis investigated the inhibition of spinal gliosis as a mechanism by which ULD antagonists attenuate analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. &#xd;
Immune cell activation is implicated in the etiology of morphine tolerance and intrathecal catheterization, a technique commonly used to study the spinal effects of drugs, causes profound gliosis. Thus, the first study investigated the effects of catheter-induced gliosis on acute and chronic morphine analgesic tolerance. Catheterization-induced gliosis did not alter antinociceptive responses to acute intrathecal morphine; however, tolerance to chronic morphine was exacerbated in catheterized rats compared to sham and surgery-naïve controls.&#xd;
The potentiation of analgesic tolerance to chronic morphine by spinal gliosis provided evidence that glia modulate opioid analgesia; therefore, inhibition of opioid-induced activation of glia was explored as a potential mechanism by which ULD antagonists prevent tolerance. The second series of experiments reported morphine-induced activation of spinal microglia and astrocytes was blocked by co-administering ULD naltrexone with morphine. These findings prompted us to elucidate the specific molecular target through which ULD antagonists attenuate opioid analgesia. &#xd;
Activation of glial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces gliosis and may contribute to analgesic tolerance and/or morphine-induced hyperalgesia (MIH). Antagonism of TLR4 by the opioid receptor-inactive (+) stereoisomer of naloxone was identified as a potential mechanism by which ULD antagonists modulate opioid analgesia. Tolerance and MIH developed in mice expressing non-functional TLR4 and in wildtype controls. Analgesic tolerance was stereoselectively blocked by ULD (-)naloxone, whereas MIH was blocked by both naloxone enantiomers. &#xd;
Collectively, these studies demonstrate analgesic tolerance and MIH occur through distinct mechanisms. ULD naloxone attenuates analgesic tolerance likely via an opioid receptor-mediated mechanism that is TLR4-independent. ULD antagonists do not attenuate tolerance via inhibition of spinal gliosis as hypothesized. In contrast, ULD antagonists prevent MIH by inhibiting opioid-induced gliosis in an opioid receptor- and TLR4-independent manner.&#xd;

   <description>Learning to read begins at home as children hear their families talk and interact with one another (Hart &amp; Risely, 1995). By age three children living in advantaged homes hear three times as many words as children living in disadvantaged homes (Hart &amp; Risely, 1995). Words that are not heard cannot be learned (Biemiller, 2007). This can impact a child’s ability to comprehend written text as reading requires the ability to not only decode written words but also the ability to understand word meaning. This project summarizes the research on the factors that promote a pre-school child’s vocabulary development and the research on vocabulary instruction throughout the early school years. Research on curriculum design is also summarized and a curriculum unit was developed based on the principles of backwards design and evidence based instructional approaches to teach vocabulary explicitly in kindergarten.</description>

   <description>Identifying psychological factors that can predict suicide risk is essential for reducing suicide rates. Shneidman (1993) postulated that psychache (or psychological pain) is a unique predictor of suicide when controlling for other relevant factors such as depression and hopelessness. Previous cross-sectional research has established a relationship between psychache and suicidality, leaving the question of whether or not feelings of psychache actually precede suicidal behaviours unanswered. Two studies were undertaken to increase knowledge on the relationship of depression, hopelessness, and psychache to suicidality. Psychological variables were examined prospectively to allow inferences to be drawn on their causal implications for suicidality. In Study 1, students (n = 1475) completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Psychache Scale, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation and provided information about prior suicidal behaviour. Regression analyses revealed that psychache was most strongly associated with suicidality, but that depression and hopelessness still contributed unique variance in the prediction of some suicidal outcomes. In Study 2, a subset of suicide ideators and attempters completed identical materials 10 weeks later (n = 90) and then another 10 weeks after that (n = 56). Again, regression analyses revealed that psychache was most strongly associated with suicidality. When looking at changes over time, dropping one predictor at a time could not overcome problems of multicollinearity, as most models were significant, but with no individual prediction from the factors. Results from models with significant regression coefficients revealed that psychache, hopelessness, and depression may be causes for suicide ideation. Theoretical and practical implications for the statistical prediction of suicide risk are discussed.</description>

   <description>Despite a long history of study showing that male courtship signals influence female mate choice in many species, we lack a good understanding of how females choose. What are the mechanisms of mate choice, and how do these mechanisms shape the evolution of courtship signals and traits? In this thesis, I use the peacock’s iridescent eyespots to link signal perception with female mate choice decisions and the behaviours males use during courtship. I begin by investigating how a peacock’s eyespot colours influence his mating success, using models of avian colour vision and measurements of eyespot plumage colours taken at light angles that mimic the way the feathers are displayed during courtship. My results suggest that a substantial portion of the variation in peacock mating success can be explained by these plumage colours, demonstrating that signal function is best understood by considering the context in which signals are presented. Next, I examine how females choose to visit different males for courtship. I show that a female’s familiarity with a male as a result of previous courtship encounters affects how she responds to his signals, including his eyespot colours. Lastly, I examine the visual effects of the peacock’s iridescent eyespot colours under different light conditions, and show that typical male courtship behaviours might enhance the eyespots in a way that influences female choice. I also find evidence that light conditions and female sensory biology together may have shaped the evolution of the eyespot colours in two species of peafowl. Overall, the results of this thesis demonstrate that by understanding how animals perceive colour signals, we can gain a better understanding of the function of behaviour on both sides of the courtship signaling exchange.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, French) -- Queen's University, 2013-03-25 11:02:58.324</description>
   <description>Dans son livre Espaces lointains, espaces rêvés dans la fiction romanesque du Grand Siècle, Marie-Christine Pioffet termine l’examen du « pays de la soie » (159) par un constat que l’image de la Chine au XVIIe siècle est en fait véhiculée par « les mythes de la chorographie romanesque » (32), et qu’« il faudra attendre encore un siècle pour qu’émerge un véritable exotisme chinois » (176) dans l’écriture de fiction. Qu’est-ce qui explique et définit ce véritable exotisme chinois? Comment l’Autre chinois est-il construit dans divers genres romanesques du XVIIIe siècle? Quel rôle cet Autre joue-t-il dans une réflexion idéologique et esthétique des auteurs sur les dichotomies très discutées à l’époque, soit Moi/Autre, général/particulier et universalisme/relativisme? Telles sont les questions que cette thèse se propose de traiter, en analysant les représentations de l’altérité dans les œuvres romanesques incluant les figures de la Chine et des Chinois.&#xd;
Notre travail commencera par une présentation de l’évolution historique des relations franco-chinoises. Il s’agira de définir, ensuite, le concept d’altérité même et ses implications dans les sciences humaines et sociales, vu que ces domaines influencent les images littéraires de l’Autre. En exploitant  des développements élaborés par Todorov, Segalen, Levinas, Bakhtine, Genette et d’autres encore, nous examinerons les multiples représentations de l’altérité chinoise dans 27 récits de fiction écrits au XVIIIe siècle. Il sera question de repérer des nuances dans les figures de l’Autre créées par trois formes de fiction : le conte, l’histoire galante et le roman. &#xd;
Quatre ouvrages seront étudiés en détail pour mettre au jour divers enjeux de l’intérêt pour l’Autre à cette époque: les Nouvelles et galanteries chinoises (1712) attribuées à Mme de Villedieu, La Princesse de Babylone (1768) de Voltaire, les Lettres chinoises ou correspondance philosophique, historique et critique (1739-1740) du marquis d’Argens et le Roman historique, philosophique et politique de Bryltophend (1789) de Le Breton. Ces analyses feront voir que si le XVIIIe siècle marque l’avènement d’un véritable exotisme chinois, son intérêt croissant pour l’Autre particulier fait partie intégrante de la recherche des valeurs universelles, partagées par tous les peuples, laquelle caractérise l’esprit et la démarche des Lumières.</description>

   <description>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most popular positioning system among some operational Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, GNSS suffer from accuracy deterioration and interruption of services in dense urban areas and are almost unavailable indoors. Although high-sensitivity receivers improve signal acquisition indoors, multipath is still be a challenging problem that affects accuracy especially indoors where a direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver almost never exist. Moreover, the wireless signal features are significantly jeopardized by obstacles and constructions indoors. To address these challenges, this research came in the context of proposing an alternative positioning system that is designed for GPS-denied environment and especially for indoors. Cramer-Rao Lower-Bound (CRLB) analysis was used to estimate the lower bound accuracy of different positioning methods indoors. Based on CRLB analysis, this research approached the wireless positioning problem indoors utilizing received signal strength (RSS) to achieve the following: 1) Developing new estimation methods to model the wireless RSS patterns in indoors. 2) Designing adaptive RSS-based wireless positioning methods for indoors. 3) Establishing a consistent framework for indoor wireless positioning systems. 4) Developing new methods to integrate inertial/odometer-based navigation systems with the developed wireless positioning methods for further improvements. The theoretical basis of the work was built on nonlinear stochastic estimation techniques including Particle Filtering, Gaussian Process Regression, Fast Orthogonal Search, Least-Squares, and Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks. All the proposed wireless positioning methods were developed and physically realized on Android-based smart-phones using the IEEE 802.11 WLANs (WiFi). In addition, successful integration with inertial/odometer sensors of mobile robots has been performed on embedded systems. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results showed significant improvements in modeling RSS indoors dynamically without offline training achieving a positioning accuracy of 1-3 meters. Sub-meter accuracy was achieved via integration with inertial/odometer sensors.</description>

   <description>This research uses a Bayesian approach to study the biases that may occur when kinematic data is used to estimate the mass of a galaxy. Data is simulated from the Hernquist (1990) distribution functions (DFs) for velocity dispersions of the isotropic, constant anisotropic, and anisotropic Osipkov (1979) and Merritt (1985) type, and then analysed using the isotropic Hernquist model. Biases are explored when i) the model and data come from the same DF, ii) the model and data come from the same DF but tangential velocities are unknown, iii) the model and data come from different DFs, and iv) the model and data come from different DFs and the tangential velocities are unknown. Mock observations are also created from the Gauthier (2006) simulations and analysed with the isotropic Hernquist model. No bias was found in situation (i), a slight positive bias was found in (ii), a negative bias was found in (iii), and a large positive bias was found in (iv). The mass estimate of the Gauthier system when tangential velocities were unknown was nearly correct, but the mass profile was not described well by the isotropic Hernquist model. When the Gauthier data was analysed with the tangential velocities, the mass of the system was overestimated.&#xd;
&#xd;
The code created for the research runs three parallel Markov Chains for each data set, uses the Gelman-Rubin statistic to assess convergence, and combines the converged chains into a single sample of the posterior distribution for each data set. The code also includes two ways to deal with nuisance parameters. One is to marginalize over the nuisance parameter at every step in the chain, and the other is to sample the nuisance parameters using a hybrid-Gibbs sampler. When tangential velocities, v(t), are unobserved in the analyses above, they are sampled as nuisance parameters in the Markov Chain. The v(t) estimates from the Markov chains did a poor job of estimating the true tangential velocities. However, the posterior samples of v(t) proved to be useful, as the estimates of the tangential velocities helped explain the biases discovered in situations (i)-(iv) above.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents control methods to improve the efficiency and dynamic response of wind turbines that use a permanent magnet synchronous generator operating under a wide input and load range. Two new nonlinear controllers are developed and tested. These controllers are designed to overcome the limitations of the conventional vector control methods which exhibit slow performance and uncertain stability. The first controller is based on a control Lyapunov function (CLF) which increases performance and guarantees stability under all operating conditions but is limited by its dependence on system parameters. A novel adaptive passivity based controller (APBC) is designed to overcome the parameter dependence of the CLF controller while, again, increasing performance and guaranteeing stability under all operating conditions. These controllers are simulated and their performance is compared to that of the conventional controller. The APBC controller exhibits the best performance of the three followed closely by the CLF based controller.</description>

   <description>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an increasingly important software architecture, designed to flexibly connect separate components in response to rapid changes in the business environment. SOA focuses on the exchange of information between independent software&#xd;
components and on the reusability of the components by separating communication interface from internal implementation. There are several features of SOA that make legacy system modernization to SOA appealing in today’s world. These are loose coupling, abstraction of underlying logic, agility, flexibility, reusability, autonomy, statelessness, discoverability and reduced cost.&#xd;
Migration of legacy systems to SOA is an important problem. While migration of&#xd;
legacy data processing systems has been widely studied, migration of legacy web applications has not. In this thesis we review existing strategies for migration of monolithic legacy web applications to web services, noting the unique challenges due to the highly dynamic nature of the systems, poorly structured code, and weakly typed languages in web applications, and the need for automation to assist in the process.&#xd;
We present a new semi-automated framework for the analysis and migration of monolithic&#xd;
web applications to web services using source analysis and transformation techniques,&#xd;
and outline a set of source transformation steps that can be used to migrate existing&#xd;
legacy web applications to web services form. We demonstrate our framework on&#xd;
the analysis and automated restructuring of two large existing web applications to extract and migrate integrated internal features to independent, reusable web services.</description>

   <description>Many nurses travel internationally and provide nursing care around the world. The current literature provides evidence that international nursing experiences have numerous positive outcomes. Understanding the positive impacts and the challenges of the international nursing experiences can lead to a greater awareness of the benefits that come from these experiences. &#xd;
	This study examines the experiences of nurses who have travelled and practiced nursing internationally. Using the qualitative survey, I sought to understand 1) Why nurses participated in international nursing experiences 2) How international nursing experiences affect a nurse’s personal and professional developments and 3) The role that reflective practice plays in the international nursing experience. &#xd;
	Hearing the perspectives of nurses who have participated in international nursing experiences is crucial in order to enrich the current understanding and awareness. This study gave nurses an avenue to express their feelings regarding their experiences. The findings of this study may lead to nurses being recognized and supported more throughout their international nursing experiences. This recognition and support may eliminate some of the challenges that nurses face that in turn may lead to great, more successful international nursing experiences in the future that will continue to produce positive outcomes for health care in general.&#xd;
The similarities and differences revealed, throughout the data findings and the literature review, facilitate gaining a deeper understanding of the positive impact and challenges of international nursing experiences. The experiences provide a positive impact to those in the host location, to the nurse themselves and to the nursing practice in their home health care institution. This evidence provides a perspective that could continue to have a positive impact on health care should health care institutions respond appropriately.</description>

   <description>A novel, variable-gain switched-capacitor DC-DC converter is designed, constructed and tested. The proposed converter minimizes many of the problems which have traditionally hindered switched-capacitor DC-DC converters. The converter has high efficiency, strong regulation and low output voltage ripple across a wide variation in the line and load. The converter utilizes an optimized switching configuration that contains the maximum number of ideal conversion ratios for the given number of capacitors driven by a two-phase clock. The switched-capacitor converter is controlled by a gain-hopping feedforward control scheme in conjunction with duty-cycle, pulse-width modulation feedback control. The proposed control technique enhances the efficiency and regulation capability of switched-capacitor DC-DC converters, which are typically limited when there is a large variation in the line. Because the converter is optimized, programmable and capable of providing buck and/or boost operation (stepping-up and/or stepping-down the input voltage), the new switched-capacitor DC-DC converter is well-suited for a variety of applications and operating conditions.&#xd;
In addition, a novel algorithm based on graph theory and network analysis is developed which enumerates all possible ideal conversion ratios for a given switched-capacitor DC-DC converter structure. In particular, this algorithm can be used as a design tool to greatly improve the operation of multi-gain switched-capacitor converters, where the aim is to maximize the number of ideal conversion ratios while minimizing the number of switches and capacitors.&#xd;
Furthermore, the structure of all attainable positive, ideal conversion ratios of a two-phase switched-capacitor DC-DC converter, utilizing up to five capacitors, is enumerated. As a result, the design process for switched-capacitor converters is greatly simplified and a suitable converter structure can be more easily selected for a given application.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Political Studies) -- Queen's University, 2013-04-22 15:21:07.585</description>
   <description>This study examines how race affects the media’s coverage of candidates in Canadian politics. Situated in the literature on political communication, gendered mediation and race studies, it proposes a new theory of racial mediation, which posits that politics are covered in ways that reflect the assumption of whiteness as standard. Although candidate self-presentation does influence media portrayals, this alone does not account for differences in the framing of candidates’ policy interests, viability and socio-demographic characteristics.&#xd;
&#xd;
The project argues that candidate race has a significant but subtle impact on media portrayals. Articles from the print media coverage of the 2008 Canadian election are analyzed using a hand-coded content analysis, which is replicated through an innovative automated approach. The study finds that visible minority candidates’ coverage is more negative and less prominent than that of their White counterparts. It is less likely to focus on key electoral issues and much more likely to emphasize socio-demographic background. Visible minority candidates are held to a higher standard and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, they are portrayed as less viable and credible than their competitors. Gender can amplify these effects, with raced and gendered discourses characterizing the coverage of visible minority women. &#xd;
&#xd;
The media study is complemented by 40 elite interviews that probe candidates’ communication strategies, issue emphasis and self-presentation, as well as reporters’ negotiation of these elements in their construction of news stories. While there are visible minority candidates who emphasize elements of their ethnocultural heritage, my findings suggest that few rely only on racialized strategies, nor are White candidates immune from racialized appeals. Nonetheless, journalists struggle to adequately portray nuance and candidates’ multi-dimensionality. They employ familiar narratives and tropes, and generally only seize on racialized framing when it applies to visible minority candidates.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although the study does not provide a direct test of media effects on vote choice, it draws on existing literature to argue that because media coverage influences the ways that voters evaluate issues and develop schema for understanding the world around them, the portrayal of visible minority candidates has the potential to alter electoral opportunities and outcomes. As a result, racialized coverage and race continue to matter in Canadian politics.</description>

   <description>The thermally regenerative fuel cell (TRFC) concept that is analyzed is a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), powered by the electro-oxidation of H2 and the electro-reduction of propiophenone. The main products of this fuel cell should be 1-phenyl-1-propanol and electricity. The 1-phenyl-1-propanol should then be converted back to propiophenone, while hydrogen is regenerated by using waste heat and a metal catalyst (Pd/SiO2). &#xd;
The first objective was to find a compatible polymer that would work as either an ionomer/binding agent and as a membrane in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of the TRFC. This was achieved by checking the compatibility of each polymer with 1-phenyl-1-propanol and propiophenone (the alcohol-ketone pair). Catalyst coated gas diffusion layers or catalyst coated membranes were made to test the stability of the polymers in the catalyst bed when exposed to the alcohol-ketone pair. If the polymer was compatible with the alcohol-ketone pair, MEAs were constructed using this polymer. The second objective was to test these MEAs inside a H2/propiophenone fuel cell that would prove the concept of our envisioned TRFC. It was found that the only polymer that was stable in the alcohol-ketone pair was mPBI (m-phenylene polybenzimidazole). The mPBI had to be doped with H3PO4 to enable H+ conductivity. Unfortunately, some H3PO4 leached out of the H3PO4-doped mPBI when in the presence of the alcohol-ketone pair. MEAs that were created using H3PO4-doped mPBI were found to work for H2/air and H2/propiophenone fed PEMFCs. The best performance achieved with the H2/propiophenone powered fuel cell was 6.23 μW/cm2. Unfortunately, the presence of the 1-phenyl-1-propanol product could not be proved by EIS or CV on the fuel cell, or by GC-FID of the cathode effluent. Other unknown products were seen in the GC-FID spectrum of the cathode effluent. Therefore, it is possible that the propiophenone did reduce at the cathode but it produced an unknown product. &#xd;
In conclusion, the viability of the proposed TRFC system was not verified. H3PO4 leaching from the MEA makes it impossible to use H3PO4-doped mPBI as the electrolyte in the final version of the MEA in the TRFC system.</description>

   <description>In the past the works of Isidorus Hispalensis have been regarded as nothing more than a rehashing of the works of earlier ecclesiastical authors, with no direct reference to Roman sources.  He has been called at best a compiler and at worst a plagiarist.  However, a greater understanding of the historical context shows that it is likely that Isidorus Hispalensis was working directly from Roman sources.  In addition, by studying the historical context within which Isidorus is writing, evidence of his originality is seen in his ability to cater specific works to his specific context.  By outlining Rome’s presence in Spain from the very beginning, as well as the changing understanding of the barbarian invasions, I show through a study of the astronomical chapters of Isidorus Hispalensis’ De Natura Rerum that Roman traditions in Spain persisted well into the Visigothic period, and that Isidorus Hispalensis is a perfect symbol of the survival of Roman culture after the fall of the western Empire.</description>

   <description>The 306 kilometer Villa Tunari - San Ignacio de Moxos highway project was designed in 2008 as part of an interoceanic corridor to foster greater integration of the capitalist economy in South America.  Despite its double status as a protected ecological and Indigenous Territory, this highway was designed to cut through the center of the Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS).  Construction began in 2011.  The response was immediate; marches and protests were held both against and for the highway.  Construction was then put on hold as consultations were held with communities who live within the borders of TIPNIS.  Despite the existence of numerous documents regarding the rights of Indigenous Peoples, their operationalization has been deeply problematic.  &#xd;
The TIPNIS highway project received wide spread international attention when members of the Eighth Indigenous March in Defense of TIPNIS were attacked and detained by police in September of 2011.  This thesis will illustrate that this was not an isolated phenomenon.  Rather this, and subsequent events, are deeply embedded within the colonial framework in which they are taking place.  By highlighting the larger power structures that exist, as well as the strength and courage of Indigenous Lowlanders and those who stand in solidarity with them,  questions such as, ‘Why is this highway project so contentious?’, become clearer.</description>

   <description>Patient-centred care is the gold standard of health care, yet in practice, problems prevail. The use of the ‘expert patient’ in health professional education is one form of learning patient-centred care. A gap in the literature regarding how the use of ‘expert patient’ in health professional education promotes patient-centred care was acknowledged in current research. With Queen’s University Health Sciences &amp; Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board approval, a sample of Queen’s University MScOT students participated in a qualitative study with the following research question: “How does the students’ experience of interacting with the ‘expert patient' (‘XP’) relate to learning regarding client-centred practice (CCP)?” Three objectives were proposed: 1. Describe the OT students’ experience of interacting with the ‘expert patient’, 2. Describe the students’ learning regarding client-centered practice, 3. Identify the conditions particular to the ‘expert patient’ experience that led to learning regarding client-centered practice. &#xd;
In-depth interviews were conducted with the students subsequent to their ‘expert patient’ experience. Analysis revealed three conditions that together provided the foundation for student experiential learning regarding client-centred practice: interaction with particular persons with stable disability known as ‘expert patients’; students’ requirement to evaluate them and thus  ‘experience power’; and explicit opportunities for ‘directed reflection and discussion’. Questions were raised for researchers, health care professional educators and health care professionals regarding the potentially transformative nature of engaging in unfamiliar contexts with openness to learning. The thesis allowed insight into the lived experience of OT students learning with ‘expert patients’; and the admiration, discomfort, humility and gratefulness they experienced while gaining a sense of the meaning of collaboration, respect for autonomy and recognition of expertise. Implications of the research impact all stakeholders in health professional education.</description>

   <description>Background: Because it is a strong determinant of chronic disease and mortality risk, physical activity is a health behaviour that is measured in most large health surveys. Questionnaires are the most commonly used method for measuring physical activity in health surveys. In the early 1990’s, an international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) was created to allow researchers from across the globe to employ the same questionnaire within their country. Several studies have been conducted on the IPAQ to determine whether the responses obtained are comparable when the questionnaire is administered on multiple occasions (reliability) and to determine the ability of the questionnaire to obtain the same physical activity result when compared to other direct measures, considered as “gold standard” (validity). However, none of these studies have been conducted in Mexico. &#xd;
Objective: Examine: 1) the reliability of the IPAQ among Mexican adults by comparing minutes per week (min/wk) spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) from the IPAQ administered two times, 2) the validity of the IPAQ surveys by comparing IPAQ min/wk of MVPA to those obtained by the accelerometer. &#xd;
Methods: 267 Mexican adults who worked in a factory in Mexico City participated.  IPAQ was applied in a face-to-face interview during a first clinic visit. Participants received an accelerometer (motion sensor that measures and record physical activity) and wore it consecutively for the next 9 days. In a second visit, participants returned the accelerometer and completed a second IPAQ. The research team cleaned and analyzed the accelerometer data using standardized techniques. Results from the two IPAQ and the accelerometer were compared using the appropriate statistical tests.  &#xd;
Results: IPAQ1 and IPAQ2 measures of MVPA were significantly correlated to each other (r=0.55, p&lt;0.01). The MVPA (min/week) measures from IPAQ1 and IPAQ2 were only modestly correlated with the accelerometer measures (r=0.26 and r=0.31, p&lt;0.01). The percentage of the participants who were classified as inactive according to the World Health Organization physical activity guidelines was 18.0% in IPAQ1, 25.1% in IPAQ2, and 28.2% for the accelerometer.&#xd;
Conclusions: IPAQ was modestly correlated to each other and it was lowly correlated to values obtained by the accelerometer. Since IPAQ has been used to obtain physical activity prevalence worldwide, caution should be taken when this instrument is used. Future research should be focused on the importance of including direct measures to measure physical activity levels within epidemiological surveys.</description>

   <description>The freshwater ecosystems in the western Canadian Arctic are threatened by multiple and interacting stressors, as high-latitude regions are undergoing rapid change resulting from climate warming and other human-related activities. However, due to the paucity or absence of monitoring data, little is known about long-term changes in lake ecosystems. This thesis addresses this knowledge gap by using paleolimnological techniques to assess the responses of freshwater ecosystems in the Mackenzie Delta region to three major stressors predicted to become increasingly important, namely impacts from accelerated permafrost thaw, marine storm surges, and hydrocarbon exploration. Using a paired-lake design, six reference lakes were compared to six lakes impacted by retrogressive thaw slumps, an important form of thermokarst in this region. While all of the study lakes have undergone ecologically significant biological changes over the last ~200 years as a result of warming, lakes impacted by thaw slumps have changed more due to the cumulative effects of warming and heightened permafrost thaw. In addition to warming, the outer Mackenzie Delta is a low-lying landscape that is susceptible to inundation by marine storm surges from the Beaufort Sea. A large storm event in 1999 flooded >10,000 hectares of the outer delta. My paleolimnological data show that this marine intrusion resulted in diatom assemblage changes in flooded lakes on a landscape-scale that were unprecedented in the recent past, suggesting recent warming, and associated sea-ice decreases, are making this region more susceptible to storm-surge damage. Finally, lakes impacted by sumps used to dispose of the drilling by-products of hydrocarbon exploration exhibit distinct water chemistry, and are particularly elevated in potassium and chloride, which form a major component of some drilling fluids. Related to this, a discernible change in cladoceran assemblages coeval with the time of sump construction suggest that sump failure has resulted in biological changes in affected lakes. Collectively, this research shows that the ecosystems of the western Canadian Arctic are under threat from multiple stressors that have resulted in changes to the chemistry and biology of the freshwater resources of this region.</description>

   <description>Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE) was the king of Macedon and one of the greatest military commanders in the ancient world. Before his death at the age of thirty-three, Alexander had conquered Greece, the Persian Empire, and northern India. Alexander provided a model of a secular ruler for leaders in medieval and Renaissance Europe. Furthermore, with the revival of antique culture during the Renaissance, the life of Alexander became a favourite classical subject in art and literature.              My thesis seeks to examine the artistic interest in the life of Alexander during the Italian Renaissance. During the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, artists portrayed episodes from the life of Alexander for elite patrons, who commissioned monumental frescoes and panel-paintings, along with pieces of maiolica pottery, tapestry and sculpture for use in the rituals of court life. While Alexander represented a model of secular authority for the patron, he was also intrinsically linked with art. Alexander's court artists, particularly Apelles, had a legacy that was eagerly emulated by modern artists.&#xd;
This thesis begins by tracing the long literary tradition of Alexander. Accounts by ancient authors, medieval romances, and new humanist texts all informed the production of images of the ancient king. I will explore the earliest representations of Alexander influenced by the humanist themes of uomini famosi and Petrarch's I Trionfi, followed by the reception and the appeal of portraits of Alexander created by Andrea del Verrocchio, Valerio Belli, and Giulio Romano. I will argue that, based on evidence in the form of drawings, Raphael had life-long artistic interest in Alexander, and many of his designs were adapted by other artists, including a fresco by Sodoma at the Villa Farnesina, and finely decorated maiolica pottery. Finally, I will consider the monumental cycles of frescoes executed by artists for patrons, who had a profound personal connection to the ancient monarch. While the artistic interest in the life of Alexander seems to derive from the fact that he was an all'antica subject, as I will demonstrate throughout this thesis, this interest took many forms for patrons, artists, and viewers.</description>
