   <description>Over the last decade, high throughput biological data, have been accumulating at rapidly increasing rates, providing the opportunity to gain insight into various fundamental biological processes. Such large-scale data have been explored using network representation and graph theory to study biological relationships. Meanwhile, a great amount of effort has also been dedicated to integrate diverse biological data types in order to build networks and apply computational analysis to distill meaningful information for specific biological problems. As a result, network-based analysis has become a powerful paradigm to model and study large-scale biological data. The goal of network-based analysis of human complex traits is to annotate or predict new relationships between biological entities, such as proteins, drugs and phenotypes. Furthermore, such analysis can facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of common complex diseases. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis comprises three contributions. First, heterogeneous biological data are integrated and a novel tool has been developed to easily construct and navigate networks representing the large scale data. In addition the resulting networks can be analyzed using computational methods to solve specific biological problems. Second, an integrative network-based pathway analysis for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been proposed to take advantage of the large scale network to combine topological connectivity with signals from GWAS in order to detect enriched pathways. Third,  an integrative strategy combines multiple quantitative profiles with a large scale network to assist the biomarker selection for ovarian cancer using two different computational methods: (A) an aggregate ranking to score the candidate proteins and (B) pathway analysis to find enriched sub-networks. &#xd;
&#xd;
These three contributions demonstrate a pipeline to model large heterogeneous biological data in terms of networks and conduct network-based analysis for understanding the molecular basis of human diseases.</description>

   <description>Two physical issues of geomembrane wrinkle deformations and downslope shear deformations – that need to be considered to obtain good long-term geomembrane liner performance – are examined.&#xd;
First, field-scale monitoring of geomembrane wrinkles in a 1.5-mm-thick, black high-density polyethylene geomembrane during placement of cover soil is reported from three field investigations with an emphasis on the effects of cover soil placement techniques, construction equipment and geomembrane temperature on the fate of geomembrane wrinkles. In many cases, wrinkles were found to exist after placement of cover soil and were smaller in size than previously reported dimensions for uncovered geomembrane wrinkles. Post-backfill wrinkle heights between 10 to 50 mm and widths between 70 to 120 mm were measured for wrinkles that did not experience construction equipment loading, while post-backfill wrinkle heights between 10 to 60 mm and widths between 50 to 80 mm were measured for wrinkles that experienced equipment loading&#xd;
Second, post-backfill wrinkle geometries attained from field measurements were used in short-term physical experiments to examine the fate of geomembrane wrinkles when subjected to additional overburden pressures. The influence of the field cover soil placement technique, applied pressure, and subgrade material on wrinkle deformations and the fate of the gap beneath the wrinkle were examined. Increasing the applied vertical pressure produced relatively small wrinkle deformations, even at pressures of 3000 kPa due to the high degree of stiffness sustained in the small and narrow wrinkles tested. The gap beneath a 10-mm-high and 55-mm-wide wrinkle was eliminated from downward wrinkle deflection and upward foundation displacement for a hydrated geosynthetic clay liner beneath the wrinkle.&#xd;
Displacements along a 66-m-long, 3H:1V geosynthetic lined landfill side slope are reported during installation of a gravel drainage layer and subsequent waste placement. During construction of the gravel drainage layer, large downslope displacements were detected in the gravel, geogrid, and geotextile (up to 420 mm), with only minor movements in the geomembrane (less than 35 mm). Placement of waste (to-date 2/3rd up slope) has generated only small (1-2 mm) relative displacements between the gravel and geomembrane and the maximum geomembrane tensile strain was measured to be under 0.2% after 1.6 years of monitoring.</description>

   <description>An arthroscope consists of a shaft which is inserted into the patient and a camera&#xd;
head which can rotate about the shaft axis. In computer-assisted surgery that uses the&#xd;
tracked arthroscope, the angle of the camera head with respect to the arthroscope&#xd;
shaft must be known. This thesis investigates three methods which use computer&#xd;
vision techniques to recover the shaft rotation angle from the live arthroscope video&#xd;
feed. Five different trials were preformed using each method, and the computed&#xd;
angles were compared to a gold standard using a rotary magnetic encoder. The best&#xd;
method provided RSME of 1.7 degrees.</description>

   <description>Dimeric rhodium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes [Rh(NHC)(C2H4)Cl]2 react with a variety of other neutral donors to form heteroleptic complexes [(L)Rh(NHC)(C2H4)Cl] (L = phosphine, pyridine) or [(L)Rh(NHC)Cl] (L = 2,2’-bipyridine (bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen)). The reactivity of the resulting complexes towards O2 was investigated. In particular, [(bipy)Rh(NHC)Cl] and [(phen)Rh(NHC)Cl] resulted in RhIII peroxo complexes. In contrast, [Rh(NHC)2(O2)Cl] display particularly short O-O bond lengths and are described as singlet oxygen species. Interestingly, the mode in which O2 binds is associated with the coordination number about the transition metal complex, which is related to its reducing power.&#xd;
[Rh(IPr)(C2H4)Cl]2 reacts with phenyl pyridine derivatives at room temperature resulting in formal C-H activations. Upon the treatment of phenyl pyridine with pinacol borane (HBPin) in the presence of a weak base and a catalytic amount of [Rh(IPr)(C2H4)Cl]2, C-H borylated products were obtained in high yield and selectivity. The borylated products can then be used as substrates in the palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling with aryl halides. &#xd;
1,2,3-Triazole mesoionic carbene (tMIC) ligands were generated upon treatment of corresponding triazolium salts with strong bases, and can be trapped in the presence of a transition metal. The synthesis of Ag-tMIC complexes proceeds by a facile and mild route upon treatment of the triazolium salt with Ag2O. The resulting Ag-tMIC complexes undergo facile transmetallation to both Pd and Rh under very mild conditions resulting in air and moisture stable metal complexes. Triazolium salts can further be metallated to Pd in the presence of weak bases, and the resulting Pd-tMIC complexes are active catalysts in the Mizoroki-Heck reaction with aryl iodides. &#xd;
Benzylic trifluoromethyl sulfones are competent electrophilic substrates in palladium catalyzed cross coupling reactions, resulting in the formation of triarylmethanes in high yields under mild conditions. These substrates are conveniently synthesized and are highly reactive starting materials with phenyl boronic acids in the presence of a Pd-NHC catalyst. The structure of the Pd-NHC precatalyst is crucial, as only [(NHC)Pd(allyl)Cl] type complexes appear to be effective. These complexes can be conveniently synthesized upon the treatment of the corresponding imidazolium salt with a strong base and [Pd(allyl)Cl]2.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mining Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-05-02 15:24:15.057</description>
   <description>A performance monitoring study was conducted aboard electric cable shovels at three different open-pit mines for the purposes of quantifying digging effort.  A comparative analysis of public domain diggability metrics was conducted to look at the influence of rock types, fragmentation distribution, blasting practices, excavator capabilities and other factors on calculated values.  Results showed that fragmentation size distribution and excavator capabilities (power and size) influenced shovel behaviour significantly, resulting in public domain diggability metrics to be non-representative of digging conditions at some sites.  Further analysis of performance monitoring data demonstrated that energy consumption monitoring was representative of digging conditions at sites where public domain diggability metrics failed.  All shovels in this study were excavating in blasted, hard rock environments. &#xd;
Concurrent research analyzed the sensitivity of the calculated metrics to dig cycle timing inaccuracies and the degree to which these timing inaccuracies affected the calculated values of each performance metric.  The importance of accurately identifying the dig state and all other possible shovel states is discussed for the purpose of data set integrity and accurate productivity monitoring.  The main focus for this aspect of the research is the positive identification of the clean-up actions which were found to be infrequent at some sites and commonplace at other sites.  These clean-up actions were analyzed for their energy consumption and were discovered to be a non-trivial component of total energy use.  Operator influence on calculated metrics was observed and analyzed for each mine site with particular attention paid to unique operator joystick behaviour.   &#xd;
A guideline for the application of diggability metrics is given and focuses on fragmentation distribution and blast performance as well as excavator power and size as the determining factors between the use of energy consumption as a metric and the use of the previously established ‘diggability indices’ for the representation of digging conditions.  New methods for visualization of metrics as well as data averaging and smoothing techniques are presented to interpret performance monitoring results in various ways and to help identify trends in the data.</description>

   <description>Global Positioning System (GPS) is increasingly threatened by interference and especially jamming. They are substantial threats to the functions that rely on the GPS position velocity and time solutions. The ultimate objective of this thesis is to enhance GPS receivers’ anti-jamming abilities. Particular focus is given to the detection of Continuous Wave (CW) jamming signals that are close-by in frequency and in space.  To tackle the challenge, two high resolution signal processing methods are proposed for single antenna receivers and for antenna array receivers. The first method operates in the frequency domain and targets accurate and efficient detection and frequency estimation of single and multiple in-band CW jammers that lie between two FFT frequency lines. This is achieved by utilizing high resolution spectral estimation that is based on orthogonal search. On the other hand, the second method operates in the space domain to estimate the Direction of Arrivals (DoA) of the jamming signals</description>

   <description>Large-eddy simulations were carried out to investigate the flow dynamics of wall jets over smooth and rough surfaces. Results were validated against data in the literature. A sand-grain roughness model is used, based on an immersed boundary method. To understand the extent to which the outer/inner layer modifies the inner/outer layer and the extent to which the effect of roughness spreads away from the wall, instantaneous and mean flow fields were investigated. For the Reynolds numbers and roughness heights considered in this study, the effect of roughness is mostly confined to the near-wall region in both plane and radial configurations. There is no structural difference between the outer layer over smooth and rough surfaces. Roughness does not affect either the size of the outer-layer structures or the scaling of the profiles of Reynolds stresses in the outer layer. However, in the inner layer, roughness redistributes stresses from streamwise to wall-normal and spanwise directions. Contours of joint probability-density function of the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the bottom of the logarithmic region match those of the turbulent boundary layer at the same height; traces of the outer-layer structures were detected at the top of the logarithmic region, indicating that they do not affect the flow very close to the wall, but still modify a major portion of the inner layer. Simulations of plane and radial wall-jets at several Re numbers were then investigated to, first, compare the plane and radial wall-jets and, second, to quantify the interaction of inner and outer layers. In both cases, the local Reynolds number is an important determining factor in characterization of the flow. The joint probability density function analysis shows that the local Reynolds number determines the level of intrusion of the outer layer into the inner layer. As the local Reynolds number increases, the thickness of the overlap layer becomes smaller, and the inner layer of the wall jet becomes more similar to the conventional turbulent boundary layer, i.e., the extent of the logarithmic region of the wall jets increases and its slope gets closer to the universal law of the wall.</description>

   <description>I designed and prepared the components of an inducible gene expression system based on the mouse lac system to address limitations in conventional Drosophila melanogaster inducible gene expression systems that preclude their use from some aging studies. Based on both the D. melanogaster UAS/GAL4 system (adapted from yeast) and the mouse lac system (adapted from Escherichia coli), this system would ostensibly allow for precise control of the location, timing, and amount of a transgene’s expression. Previously, flies capable of expressing the lac repressor (lacI) in a GAL4-dependent manner were reported. Here, I report the remaining components needed to characterize the utility of these tools Two promoters incorporating two or three lac operator sequences into the conventional UAS promoter were also produced. Here, I generated promoter-reporter constructs to test the viability of this system. I prepared true-breeding transgenic flies and mapped the chromosome of transgene insertion in flies carrying the genes for pro-apoptotic reporter grim or the enzyme ß-galactosidase (lacZ) under the control of each chimeric UAS-lacO promoter. I prepared a total of 28 lines (eight 2-operator grim lines, five 3- operator grim lines, twelve 2-operator lacZ lines, and three 3-operator lacZ lines). Preliminary experiments to assess the baseline (unrepressed) expression of these reporters indicated weak expression relative to the conventional GAL4-UAS promoter, however as no appropriate benchmark for characterization of these lines existed at the time, these results were inconclusive. To assess the feasibility of this system in aging studies, preliminary longevity analyses in the presence of the inducers IPTG and lactose were performed. The presence of lactose was not shown to affect survival in a statistically significant manner. Survival was inconsistent when IPTG was present in the food. All the components of this system have been prepared, however further characterization is needed to confirm its utility in aging studies.</description>

   <description>Polyampholyte derivatives of ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR-g-PA) and polypropylene (PP-g-PA) were prepared through the reaction a tertiary amino alcohol, 2- [2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]ethanol (DMAEE), with maleated ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR-g-MAn) and maleated polypropylene (PP-g-MAn) respectively, forming zwitterionic grafts.  The resulting zwitterionomers contained grafted ammonium and carboxylate functionality.&#xd;
Conversion of EPR-g-MAn to EPR-g-PA substantially increased viscoelasticity and tensile modulus due to the presence of ionic associations between the polymer chains.  EPR-g-PA showed similar viscoelastic properties to an EPR lightly cross-linked using dicumyl peroxide but with greater strain hardening and tensile elongation. Relative to its precursor material, EPR-g-MAn, EPR-g-PA exhibited equivalent adhesion to metals and improved adhesion to other ionomers, which was believed to relate to the presence of ionic associations at the substrate interface.  The in-situ reaction of EPR-g-MAn with DMAEE during blending with PP produced a blend with superior impact properties compared to the thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) blend of peroxide cross-linked EPR and PP due to the elimination of peroxide induced degradation of the PP phase. &#xd;
Conversion of PP-g-MAn to PP-g-PA had a negligible effect on its viscoelastic and mechanical properties.  This was believed to relate to its low graft content, containing only 0.13 mol% grafted subunits.  Despite its low graft content PP-g-PA was capable of forming strong associations with EPR-g-PA. Immiscible blends of EPR-g-PA and PP-g-PA exhibited improvements in droplet dispersion, tensile elongation and impact strength relative to their precursor blends of EPR-g-MAn and PP-g-MAn.  Similarly, the addition of 7.5 wt% PP-g-PA to blends of 25/75 EPR-g-PA/PP was found to substantially improve droplet dispersion, impact strength and tensile elongation.  These results suggest the preferential localization of PP-g-PA at the interface and the interaction of zwitterionic functionality across the phase interface, improving the compatibility between PP and EPR-g-PA.  This conclusion was further supported by the frequency dependent viscoelasticity of blends containing both PP-g-PA and EPR-g-PA which was found to deviate substantially from conventional immiscible blend behavior, exhibiting properties consistent with reactively compatibilized blends.</description>

   <description>Rare-event searches, such as the direct detection of dark matter, of neutrinoless double beta decay and of the decay of long-lived radioisotopes, require highly-sensitive radio-pure detectors to measure extremely rare interactions amidst a sea of background events coming from natural radioactivity. The DAMA/LIBRA dark matter experiment has a long-standing claim of detecting event excesses inconsistent with known background and attributes these to the annual modulation signature expected from dark matter interactions on Earth. The DAMA/LIBRA detector array is composed of NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors, which do not possess event-by-event background rejection capabilities. Scintillating calorimeters, cryogenic detectors based on scintillating crystals that produce simultaneous heat and light signals, are a promising detector technology capable of a powerful level of background rejection. Rare-event searches employing scintillating calorimeters are on the look-out for crystals with favourable low-temperature properties. This dissertation will describe the optical cryostat that our group has designed, commissioned, tested and is now operating at Queen's University for the purpose of studying samples of scintillating crystals and measuring their properties as a function of temperature. In particular, it details measurements of the light yields of the alkali halides NaI, CsI and NaI(Tl) under alpha- and gamma-excitation down to 3.4 K. The temperature response of the alpha/gamma quenching factors of these scintillators is also presented, along with surface-dependent systematics. Informed by these low-temperature scintillation results, a scintillating calorimeter based on alkali halides is proposed and its expected sensitivity to dark matter is studied. The technical feasibility of such a detector is also discussed. It is demonstrated that if technical challenges can be surmounted and the phonon performance of the alkali halides can be improved to the level of other materials, a short exposure of 10 kg-days would have a good chance of being able to fully test the DAMA/LIBRA claim under standard astrophysical assumptions.</description>

   <description>In this dissertation, I argue that there is a tendency in postcolonial studies&#xd;
to equate injustice with a lack of knowledge. The political task for postcolonial&#xd;
studies is then framed in pedagogical terms: to provide the missing or&#xd;
invisible knowledge that is the catalyst for political change, or the critical&#xd;
element that makes redress for injustice possible. This tendency is a part of&#xd;
a Marxist tradition of social critique that aims to expose and thus undo the&#xd;
hidden workings of domination, but it also has something in common with&#xd;
liberal thought, which assumes that education will improve those who are&#xd;
not already free to participate in market relations. For both these liberal&#xd;
and Marxist traditions, ignorance is tantamount to un-freedom, and ignorant&#xd;
people, though they may have the capacity for autonomy and critical&#xd;
thought, are un-emancipated.&#xd;
The literary works that I consider here are Jhumpa Lahiri's \Hema and&#xd;
Kaushik" (2009), Kiran Desai's The Inheritance of Loss (2008), Mohsin&#xd;
Hamid's How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2014), Wayne Macauley's&#xd;
The Cook (2012), Indra Sinha's Animal's People (2009), and Richard Flanagan's&#xd;
Gould's Book of Fish (2001). Though their authors may be interested&#xd;
to some degree in making injustice visible, these texts do not lend themselves&#xd;
in a fully satisfying way to the aims of either social critique or liberal political&#xd;
reason. They show that education can perpetuate injustice and inequality.&#xd;
They suggest that knowledge alone is not su cient to ameliorate injustice,&#xd;
and that representing injustice may compound as well as mitigate it. They&#xd;
contain characters who knowingly perpetuate injustice. These literary works&#xd;
show that knowledge is not the only factor required for political change at a&#xd;
societal level or for the development of free, autonomous individuals.&#xd;
Through my readings of these works of literature, I develop a multifaceted&#xd;
understanding of the problem of the political. I argue that politics is&#xd;
an on-going project without end, rather than a decisive moment of transformation.&#xd;
Similarly, freedom is not an ontological state, but a process which is&#xd;
always possible but never guaranteed, and individuality itself is constitutively&#xd;
relational. Beyond knowledge of injustice, individuals need universalisable&#xd;
principles and a reason to work with others to secure their rights in common.&#xd;
These writers suggest agape as this motivating reason, and foster a sense of&#xd;
agape in their readers.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Neuroscience Studies) -- Queen's University, 2015-05-26 09:37:41.621</description>
   <description>The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a widely used decision-making task often used to assess decision-making impairment in clinical populations. During learning of the task, individuals receive consistent monetary rewards and inconsistent monetary punishments of different frequencies and magnitudes. Learning relies on in part the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) which integrates reward and loss information to identify the decks with the highest expected value (EV). Currently, little is known about factors that might influence this unique process. This thesis uses experimental techniques to investigate how sleep and punishment structures can influence learning of the IGT. &#xd;
In Chapter 2 we show evidence that a period of post-learning sleep enhances IGT learning, specifically via reduced choice from deck B. Deck B is an initially preferred “bad” deck that requires integrating a large infrequent $1250 punishment to discover its negative EV. In Chapter 3 we link this improvement to increased theta (4-8 Hz) activity in the vmPFC and left prefrontal cortex. We also show evidence that pre-sleep anticipatory emotions correlate to heightened theta activity in the right vmPFC during post acquisition REM. Finally, chapter 4 provides the first evidence that higher-order punishment structures can influence learning of the task. We provide the first evidence that punishment structures with high variance/skew may cause risk-aversion and that IGT decision-making may not be driven by EV alone. &#xd;
Collectively, the work presented provides much needed knowledge on factors that can influence IGT learning. We are the first to show evidence that IGT learning may be enhanced with post learning REM sleep and suggest that similar areas that are involved in online learning (i.e., vmPFC) may be involved. We are also the first to show that performance can be influenced by higher-order punishment structures. Taken together, this body of work reveals that integrating punishments into value estimates may be enhanced by post learning REM sleep and influenced by higher-order punishment structures. These results have widespread implications for how punishment structures in our day-to-day life may influence online and offline decision processes and provides a strong foundation for continued work to understand decision-making in healthy and clinical groups.</description>

   <description>Homework provides an opportunity for practice and learning to occur outside the classroom, and research has consistently shown that it can have a positive influence on achievement. However, the preponderance of this research in high schools has been in higher-level Academic classrooms. The purpose of this study is to compare the perspectives of students and teachers with respect to homework, and student learning in Applied math classrooms in Ontario. It builds on recent research by Pang and Rogers (2013) who found that while homework completion was a strong predictor of achievement in Academic math classes, it was a weak predictor in Applied math classes. This result suggests that the current model of homework may not provide strong support for learning in Applied math classes. &#xd;
	This study employed a multiple-method, non-experimental design. The sample consisted of 165 students and 21 teachers in Grade 9 and Grade 10 Applied math classes in Ontario. Students completed surveys, and teachers completed surveys and in-depth interviews. After the data were collected, students were separated into two groups (high achieving and not-high achieving) based on average EQAO math achievement in their schools. An exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the factor structure of the student survey. Independent sample t-tests were subsequently conducted to examine between group differences among students in high achieving vs. not-high achieving classrooms. Teachers’ perspectives were explored by conducting a thematic analysis of their qualitative interview and survey data. Matching items on the student and teacher surveys and interviews were compared to determine the alignment between students and teachers with respect to homework and student learning. Descriptive statistics were also used to gain overall pictures of the distributions of students and teachers who took part in the study.&#xd;
	Significant differences were found between students in high achieving vs. not-high achieving classrooms with respect to the assignment and completion of homework. The analysis of teacher perspectives, and the comparison of teacher and student data, resulted in implications for research and practice that highlight the need for more conversation, examination and exploration of the complex issues surrounding homework and student learning in Applied classrooms.</description>

   <description>Literary critical discourse nowadays tends to classify African texts within global literature by drawing links among works through writing. Therefore, to achieve this purpose, African writers use forms and poetics of hybridity, intertextuality, and intergenericity. &#xd;
Besides the multilingualism analysis, this dissertation is intended to approach the corpus by analyzing themes pertaining to a mixed writing style (métissage) and formal study of intertextuality and intergenericity, which are hypothesized to be specific characteristics of Lopes’ writing. This study looked into intertextuality as a formal intermingled writing to the extent that intertextuality is understood as a process that puts together two or multiple texts through diverse writing mechanics. Thus, in addition to scrutinizing the theme of blended writing («métissage de l’écriture»),  the study pointed out that Lopes’ literary practices greatly hinge on the integration and transformation of other texts from various origins, including the Bible; antique and contemporary philosophical theories; works and dissertations of famous Afro-Caribbean writers (Senghor, Oyono, Fanon etc.); French literature texts, mostly those dating back to the Middle Ages, Renaissance, classical century (intertextuality); and other genres such as tales, proverbs, songs, biographies, letters, testimonies (intergenericity). How does this double principle play out, and what are its inherent techniques? We attempted to answer this question by drawing mainly on Lopes’ four novels characterized by the blended writing, more specifically Le chercheur d’Afriques (1990), Le lys et le flamboyant (1997), Dossier classé (2002), and Une enfant de Poto-Poto (2013). The four novels uniquely echo the Bakhtinian dialogic principle from which intertextuality and intergenericity practices derive. &#xd;
We primarily used, among other frameworks, Gerard Genette’s transtextuality and hypertextuality theories to identify and analyze transformation and integration mechanics of other texts, which Lopes utilized. Josias Semujanga’s works on the African novel specifically helped demonstrate transcultural and transgeneric dimension of the works under study. Such tools and information enabled us to reach the level of understanding that Lopes’ literary art aims at deconstructing the traditional novel logic and placing his works in the aesthetics movement of heterogeneity and universality that is advocated by global literature and postmodernism.</description>

   <description>Visual recognition of the irregular shapes of natural objects and surfaces is crucial to the study of geology. Field geologists are aided by a learned ability to, at a glance, differentiate cohesive outcropping rock from talus, pick out fossils from loose clasts on the ground, judge fault displacement and perform any number of other discriminative tasks on the basis of morphology. Interpretation of geology depends upon identifying subtle and ambiguous natural forms that may be widely variable in response to diverse conditions of formation, preservation and weathering. Applying numerical models to these morphological cues empowers geologists to support or refute hypotheses with enhanced objectivity.&#xd;
With the growing prevalence and quality of remotely sensed spatial data in the geosciences, accurate modeling of diagnostic aspects of Earth surface morphology becomes more feasible while its potential benefits increase greatly. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in particular is valued for collecting dense point clouds which enable precise, non-contact measurement of structures in outcrop. Unfortunately, the process of interpreting irregular shapes and textures in point-cloud data is labor intensive and its results subject to user bias. Automated point-cloud classification tools promise improved objectivity in scene interpretation, though their application to natural surface geometry has not yet been studied in depth. The objective of this research is to investigate, apply and refine automated point-cloud classification methodology for geological targets, with discriminating the erosive styles of sedimentary rocks in outcrop as the central theme.&#xd;
To accomplish this goal, three studies investigate range measurement biases in TLS data collection, the scale dependence of rock surface roughness, and 3D multiscale classification methodology. The findings of this research have implications in particular for studies using TLS to measure statistics of target morphology close to the instrument resolution limits. The multiscale classification methodology investigated is immediately applicable to a range of identification and discrimination tasks encountered in the geosciences. Overall, this research will contribute to increased productivity and objectivity of interpretations for the growing population of geoscientists working with remotely sensed spatial data through improved automation of a wider range of interpretive tasks.</description>

   <description>Throughout much of the 20th century, industrial emissions caused the widespread acidification of thousands of lakes in North America and Europe. Acidification has led to unprecedented damage on zooplankton communities, with reductions in species richness, and in extreme cases, local extirpations. Although lake pH is recovering due to emission control policies, many acid-sensitive species (e.g. large Daphnia) have failed to re-establish in lakes, despite their occasional detection in plankton records. Coincidently, calcium, a critical component of cladoceran exoskeletons, has declined precipitously in many historically acidified lakes over the last few decades, and may be approaching ecologically concerning concentrations. Studies suggest that crustaceous zooplankton are likely vulnerable to calcium decline because of their fully aquatic lifecycle, calcified exoskeleton, and inherent reliance on available aqueous calcium. However, disentangling biological impacts of low calcium in acidic, and chemically recovered (pH>6.0) lakes is difficult because of a strong correlation between pH and calcium concentration.&#xd;
To investigate the impact of low calcium concentration on zooplankton recovery in acid-damaged lakes, lake mesocosms were stocked with zooplankton from the regional species pool and four treatments were applied in a factorial design: pH (5.7 and 6.3) and calcium (0.9mg L-1 and 2.3mg L-1). A comparison between the effects of calcium and pH indicates that impacts from declining calcium are likely to be similar to those of acidification. Total community metrics (i.e. abundance, richness, evenness, size-structure) remained similar across treatments; however, low calcium and low pH each resulted in lower abundance of Daphnia pulex/pulicaria – a large acid-sensitive, and heavily calcified cladoceran.  In contrast, the abundance of small cladocerans, including smaller, acid-tolerant daphniids (Daphnia catawba, Daphnia ambigua), was higher in low calcium treatments. When both stressors were combined, changes largely reflected the effect of the most severe independent stressor. By prohibiting recovery of acid-sensitive species, and promoting establishment of zooplankton already common to acid-structured communities, our results suggest that declining calcium is likely a barrier to biological recovery in historically acidified lakes.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2015-05-28 14:36:47.346</description>
   <description>The following research is an autoethnography based on the author’s three seasons of tree planting in northern Ontario. Tree planting in northern Ontario is a popular summer occupation for University students from southern Ontario. The contemporary demographic of tree planters is now dominantly university students which is unusual because tree planters were originally comprised of prisoners and marginalized individuals. After reviewing the history and development of the labour force, the research offers analysis of popularized perceptions of the occupation and of lived experience of the occupation. Popularized perceptions of tree planting are largely influenced by notions of Rugged Individualism. Rugged individualism emphasizes individual strength and resilience and is largely influenced by notions of Canadian nationalism and neoliberalism. These ideologies largely figure into not only perceptions of tree planting but also within the work environment itself. Tree planting offers an opportunity for students to take on a physical and mental challenge, make substantial summer earnings for the school year, and identify with a ‘tree planter’ image. Through autoethnography, these opportunities are discussed in relation to perceptions of the occupation. The research illuminates the positive aspects of tree planting such as sense of community as well as the negative impacts of neoliberalism within the work culture.</description>

   <description>As climate warms, phytophagous forest insects are expected to advance into previously unoccupied regions and/or experience population eruptions within their extant ranges.  Already stressed by abiotic factors, arctic and alpine treeline environments will therefore become increasingly vulnerable to insect disturbances.  Using vegetation surveys and dendrochronological techniques, we examined factors that may have predisposed the forest-tundra ecotones of southwest Yukon to spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) infestation, and investigated the subsequent effects of insect disturbance on the growth and establishment of white spruce (Picea glauca).  Specific objectives were to evaluate (i) the relationships between stand structure and variance in beetle-induced mortality and (ii) growth patterns between stands affected and relatively unaffected by the outbreak.  Information on spruce size, reproduction and health, shrub cover, seedling density and size, stand density, and basal area was collected from three elevations at six sites, divided equally into three mortality classes.  A subset of mature spruce individuals – both living and deceased – was sampled from one low-mortality and one medium-mortality site.  Results demonstrated that hosts selected by spruce bark beetle were typically large individuals growing in dense stands, with spruce density and basal area dictating the extent of stand mortality.  The majority of mortality was concentrated at – though not exclusive to – forestline elevations, though incidence of attack was sporadic across the region.  At forestline, deceased individuals shared a period of accelerated growth when trees were between 75 and 150 years old, not present in their surviving counterparts, and had stronger temperature-growth correlations in early summer of the growing season than for still-living trees.  Post-outbreak growth releases were observed in several surviving forestline mature spruce, but this accelerated growth was restricted to stands that experienced high levels of spruce mortality.  The results indicate that host selection mechanisms and competitive restrictions in forest-tundra ecotones are similar to those in low-elevation, closed-canopy forests, but suggest that additional factors may increase susceptibility to attack in treeline environments.  Insect disturbance has the capacity to significantly alter treeline positions and dynamics, and is therefore an important factor to consider when assessing the future of forest-tundra ecotones.</description>

   <description>Indigenous artists challenge cultural stereotypes by creating images that contest preconceived notions of the "place" of Indigenous people held by the Canadian population at large. This thesis research explores the question of identity and stereotypes and how this is transgressed through the work of contemporary Indigenous artists in Canada to adjust the position of Indigenous people in the social hierarchy that controls their "place." Many Indigenous artists incorporate political statements into their artworks that challenge the ongoing stereotypes that assign Indigenous people to their "place";  the political commentary is often the only aspect of their work that identifies it as "Indigenous," with a variety of techniques, media, and styles used in the creation of the art, reflecting the individuality of the artists.  &#xd;
	The normativity of whiteness and its impact on ideology and politics is examined, both in historical and contemporary times. Hegemonic images have promoted the Eurocentric concept that the White "race" is the norm and the standard by which others should be judged and put in their "place," contributing to the objectification of Indigenous peoples and the creation of the stereotypical "Indian," such as the "noble savage," and the "ignoble savage." Images created by contemporary Indigenous artists transgress these cultural stereotypes.&#xd;
	The re-labeling and marketing of Indigenous "artifacts" as "art" reflects changing attitudes in the value placed on the work of Indigenous artists, transforming many from anonymous artisans into renowned artists. This recognition as creators of art provides opportunities for Indigenous artists to make public statements, with their work being widely displayed under the classification of contemporary art. The Sakahàn International Indigenous Art Exhibition held by the National Gallery of Canada in 2013 embodies the momentum that is building within the Indigenous artistic community; Sakahàn is the largest exhibition of any kind mounted by the National Gallery, to date, and is also the largest worldwide exhibition of Indigenous art. &#xd;
	Identity is constantly changing in relation to events and circumstances; as the place of Indigenous people continues to be contested by artists, it will edge further on the continuum towards being "in place" instead of "out of place."</description>

   <description>Insulin is one of several molecules that signals the energy balance state to the brain. This study examined the effect of insulin sensitivity on the responsiveness of appetite regulatory brain regions to visual food cues. Nineteen participants diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were studied. Subjects were divided into insulin-sensitive (n=8) and insulin-resistant (n=11) groups based on the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). Subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing food pictures following water or dextrose consumption. The corticolimbic Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) responses to high-calorie (HC) or low-calorie (LC) food pictures were compared within and between groups. BOLD responses to food pictures were reduced during a glucose challenge in numerous corticolimbic brain regions of insulin-sensitive subjects, but not in insulin-resistant subjects. In addition, a positive interaction was detected between insulin sensitivity and condition. Furthermore, the degree of insulin resistance positively correlated with the corticolimbic BOLD response in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in response to HC pictures and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), mPFC, anterior cingulate, and insula in response to LC pictures following a glucose challenge. The activity in the OFC, midbrain, hippocampus, and amygdala was positively correlated with HOMA2-IR in response to HC>LC pictures following a glucose challenge. We conclude that the normal inhibition of corticolimbic brain responses to food pictures during a glucose challenge is compromised in insulin-resistant subjects. The increase in brain responsiveness to food pictures during postprandial hyperinsulinemia may lead to greater non-homeostatic eating and perpetuate obesity in insulin-resistant subjects. Understanding how insulin sensitivity affects appetite-regulating brain regions responses to food pictures is necessary for the development of prevention strategies and effective therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity, particularly obesity related to insulin resistance in PCOS.</description>

   <description>The research presented in this thesis consists of work conducted in two studies designed to evaluate temperature effects on microalgal growth in Arctic wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs). These systems are commonly used to treat municipal wastewater in small arctic communities, however, summer temperatures that rarely exceed 20oC could potentially limit microalgal growth. The presence of microalgae in these systems has been suggested to enhance wastewater treatment efficiency due to the synergistic relationship between microalgae and heterotrophic bacteria, supporting the need to develop a better understanding regarding the effects of climate and summer temperatures on microalgal growth for areas north of the 54th parallel.&#xd;
The first study investigated the effects of temperature on the growth of the microalgal strain Chlorella vulgaris. Experimental data were subsequently compared against three models developed to predict algae growth as a function of temperature. Growth rates were evaluated for a range of 1-23oC and experimental results showed a strong correlation between maximum microalgal growth rates and temperature, where maximum microalgal growth rates were found to be at their lowest at 1oC and peaked at 23oC. The experimental data were then compared to the maximum growth values predicted by three mathematical models: the Eppley Curve, an Arrhenius Relationship and the Peeters &amp; Eilers model. The latter was deemed to be the most suitable model for microalgal growth rates in arctic WSPs, as it predicted the maximum growth rates of C. vulgaris reliably for the temperature range of 1-23oC. The second study involved the modification of an existing numerical model which was developed to simulate biochemical processes in WSPs. The Peeters &amp; Eilers growth equation was incorporated into this numerical model, along with historical weather data from Pond Inlet, NU in order to characterize the effects of arctic temperatures on microalgal growth in WSPs from year to year.&#xd;
The results of these studies suggest that microalgal growth in Arctic WSPs is highly susceptible to temperature, and solar radiation fluctuations, and that the presence of microalgae in these system may contribute to wastewater treatment efficiency.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Cultural Studies) -- Queen's University, 2015-05-29 10:14:56.169</description>
   <description>This research-creation discovers the connection between what Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari termed as the Univocity of Being, and the Sufi and pantheistic concept of Unity of Being (wahdat al-wujud) founded by the Islamic philosopher/mystic Ibn al-‘Arabī (A.H. 560- 638/A.D. 1165-1240). I use the decolonizing historiography of the concept of univocity of being carried out by the scholar of Media Art, and Islamic Thoughts Laura U. Marks. According to Marks’ historiography, it was the Persian Muslim Polymath Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn ibn Sînâ (980-1037) who first initiated the concept of haecceity (thisness)--the basis of the univocity of being. The thesis examines transformative experimental cinema and video art from a mystical philosophical perspective (Sufism), and by defying binaries of East/West, it moves beyond naïve cosmopolitanism, to nuanced understanding of themes such as presence, proximity, self, transcendence, immanence, and becoming, in media arts. The thesis tackles the problem of Islamic aniconism, nonrepresentability, and inexpressibility of the ineffable; as it is reflected in the mystical/paradoxical concept of the mystical Third Script (or the Unreadable Script) suggested by Shams-i-Tabrīzī (1185- 1248), the spiritual master of Mawlana Jalal ad-Dīn Muhhammad Rūmī (1207-1273). I argue that the Third Script provides a platform for the investigation of the implications of the language, silence, unsayable, and non-representation. This perspective sheds a fresh light on Deleuze’s secular philosophy of immanence and its obsession with creation, becoming, and expression as opposed to representation. By connecting Persian mysticism to contemporary immanentism, I argue that what Deleuze and Guattari proposed as the unthought or the thought without image, is enriched by the comparison to the inexpressibility of imageless Muslim God. For the purpose of contextualization, the thesis also engages with contemporary scholarships on global film/media such as accented, diasporic and intercultural cinema and video art. The creative component of the thesis was the production of five experimental videos that address the mystical philosophical ideas discussed in the thesis such as time, language, cine- thinking and visual thinking. The films and the theoretical component were developed in tandem, enriching and transforming each other.</description>

   <description>The Local Health Commission (LHC) was established in 1940. Its significance lies in the fact that it adopted a public health-based approach to local governance and that it delivered health and welfare services to residents of the neglected black and multi-racial urban areas. Even though its mandate was the antithesis of the goals of urban apartheid, the LHC expanded its scope after the National Party came into power in 1948. This dissertation is firstly, an institutional history of the LHC. Secondly, it examines the ways in which black urban residents practiced in municipal institutions by demanding that the LHC not only fulfill its mandate but, that it also amend its programs in order to meet their needs. A third and final theme of this dissertation is the role of Advisory Boards in addressing the public health crises specifically, ways in which the ABs held the LHC accountable. By exploring the LHC through these three themes, this dissertation addressed larger historical questions: firstly, the role of white liberal bureaucrats in the development of public health and urban governance in South Africa and secondly, the nature of black people’s participation in state institutions before 1994.</description>

   <description>Two approaches were followed to achieve increased control over properties of the photo-active layer (PAL) in solution processed polymer solar cells (PSCs). This was accomplished by either (1) the addition of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to improve the charge transport properties of the device or (2) the realization of dual donor polymer ternary blends to achieve colour-tuned devices.&#xd;
In the first component of the study, P3HT:PC61BM blends were doped with SWCNTs with the ambition to improve the morphology and charge transport within the PAL.  The SWCNTs were functionalized with alkyl chains to increase their dispersive properties in solution, increase their interaction with the P3HT polymer matrix, and to disrupt the metallic characteristic of the tubes, which ensures that the incorporated SWCNTs are primarily semi-conducting. P3HT:PCBM:CNT composite films were characterized and prepared for use as the photoactive layer within the inverted solar cell. The CNT doping acts to increase order within the active layer and improve the active layer’s charge transport properties (conductivity) as well as showed some promise to increase the stability of the device. The goal is that improved charge transport will allow high level polymer solar cell (PSC) performance as the active layer thickness and area are increased, which is an important consideration for large-area inkjet printing. &#xd;
The use of ternary blends (two donor polymers with a fullerene acceptor) in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices on plastic substrates was investigated as a future means to colour-tune ink-jet printed PSCs. The study involved the blending of two of the three chosen donor polymers [red (P3HT), blue (B1), and green (G1)] with PC61BM. Through external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, it was shown that even devices with blends exhibiting poor efficiencies, caused by traps, both polymers were able to contribute to the photovoltaic (PV) effect. However, traps were avoided to create a parallel-like BHJ (PBHJ) when two polymers were chosen with suitable physical compatibility (harmonious solid state mixing), and appropriate HOMO-HOMO energy band alignment. The parallel diode model was used to describe the PV circuit of devices with the B1:G1:PC61BM ternary blend.</description>

   <description>A general formalism is developed that can be used to obtain photon dynamics in coupled-cavity system in leaky photonic crystal slabs. This is accomplished using a non-Hermitian projection operator, where the coupled-cavity modes, known as quasimodes, are used as a basis. Because of this, intrinsic features of these quasimodes such as the leakage and the non-orthogonality are included in a self-consistent manner. The projection technique can be used to represent the Hamiltonian of a typical system in the basis of the quasimodes. In addition, the corresponding quantum Master equation and adjoint quantum Master equation are provided. By employing these, the time dependence of the density matrix and Heisenberg operators can be obtained.&#xd;
&#xd;
In particular, a multimode Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is obtained for photonic crystal slabs interacting with multiple quantum dots. As a proof of principle, a simple system with two quasimodes is considered, where the mode non-orthogonality affects the photon dynamics in a non-trivial manner. It is shown that, while the number of photons in each quasimode decays off, it also oscillates due to the quasimode non-orthogonality.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using the same projection technique, the problem of nonlinear photon pair generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing in photonic crystal slabs is discussed. The main objective is to examine the effect of loss on pair generation in systems such as photonic molecules and coupled-resonator optical waveguides. Several conclusion are made. In addition to the overall loss rates of the pump, signal and idler photons, the loss difference between signal and idler channels plays an important role in minimizing the number of unpaired photon in the system. Also, there is a trade-off between source brightness and higher order generation depending on the losses in the system. This is important, because both the number of unpaired photons and the number of multiple photon pairs degrade device performance. Moreover, when slow light devices are considered, the probability of finding photon pairs at particular locations is affected both by the dispersive behavior of the waveguide and the lossy behavior. This is important as it opens up different possible design strategies that one might want to use in lossy systems.</description>

   <description>Most individuals with a physical disability do not participate in sport despite its numerous benefits. Peers have been known to exhibit leadership techniques associated with increased motivation for sport and they play an important role in influencing behaviours of others with a physical disability (e.g., disseminating knowledge of resources). Transformational leadership (TFL) is associated with positive sport outcomes and has been associated with peers in the sport context. Transformational leaders use individualized consideration, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and idealized influence to enable their follower to perform beyond their own expectations. However, it is unknown how peer athlete mentors (mentors) use TFL to encourage and maintain sport participation among their mentees with disabilities. The purpose of this study was to understand the leadership behaviours, particularly the TFL behaviours of peer athlete mentors in parasport. Participants were 11 mentors and 10 mentees who have been involved in parasport. Data were collected through semi-structured telephone interviews. The interviews were grounded in TFL. Inductive content analysis revealed behaviours from the perspectives of mentors and mentees and the behaviours were deductively cross-referenced with TFL behaviours. Mentors recalled their own mentorship behaviours and behaviours of the mentors that encouraged them. Mentees recalled behaviours of their mentors and mentor behaviours they have begun to engage in. Behaviours were consistent with TFL and were generally perceived as the same among mentors and mentees. Individualized consideration behaviours were creating an enriching environment, appropriate peer matching, understanding readiness to participate, and understanding different personalities. Inspirational motivation behaviours were conveying optimism about the benefits of sport, telling success stories, and being a role model for sport excellence. Intellectual stimulation involved disseminating resources encouraging mentees to try, encouraging reducing sedentary time, and letting the mentee solve problems. Idealized influence included showing commitment, having a positive attitude, and fulfilling duties on the team. Negative behaviours speaking negatively about another sport and having unrealistic expectations. The results of this study provide an in depth description of the TFL used by peer mentors in parasport and can be used to inform peer athlete mentorship training programs in disability sport.</description>

   <description>This qualitative study explores inner and outer experience in the context of dramatic arts, and specifically in actor education. The author defines experience as the richness of now. It is everything that we bring to each moment, and everything that each moment brings to us. The dynamic space between inner and outer experience is found to be the place where thinking and feeling create our sense of be-ing. Movement between inner and outer helps determine the success of a dramatic experience. Literature from the disciplines of cognitive studies, dramatic arts, education, philosophy, psychology, and neurophysiology is examined alongside interviews with dramatic arts teacher-practitioners. These findings are considered in light of the author’s own experiences as a dramatic arts student, teacher, and participant. A conceptual model of cognition as an active and embodied phenomenon emerges. Building on models of “embodied cognition” (Lakoff and Johnson) and “enactive cognition” (Varela, Thompson, and Rosch), the author conceives of human thinking and being as “enacting cognition”. Enacting cognition is the dynamic synthesis of objective knowledge and personal understanding. It is the experience of be-ing.</description>

   <description>A fully 3D coupled finite element (FE) analysis is performed to examine the performance of four sections of a full-scale embankment on soft soils. The proposed FE model successfully captures the behaviour of full scale embankments involving geosynthetic-reinforced and piled sections, and the observed difference in performance of different improvement techniques, with respect to pore-water pressures, settlements, subsoil stresses, lateral displacements below the toe of the embankments, and reinforcement strains. The effects of geosynthetic reinforcement and multi-layers of reinforcement on the performance of the pile-supported embankment are discussed. The relative load transfer is calculated using eight existing methods and they are compared with the field measurements and numerical results.&#xd;
Deep-mixing-method (DMM) columns which are less rigid than piles are increasingly used as a cost-effective soft ground improvement technique. The influence of reinforcement viscosity on the post-construction performance of embankments with DMM floating columns and fully penetrating columns is investigated using the 3D FE coupled model verified by aforementioned field case. It is shown that the viscous behaviour behaviour of geosynthetic reinforcement can increase the long-term shear deformations of foundation soil and also the horizontal toe movement. The DMM column-supported embankments with viscous and with inviscous reinforcement are numerically constructed to identify the effect and magnitude of reinforcement creep and stress relaxation. &#xd;
It is shown that consideration of time-varying subsoil hydraulic conductivity has an important effect on time-dependent embankment behaviour particularly with respect to horizontal toe movement of reinforced and DMM floating-column supported embankments under working conditions. The potential interacting factors of the construction rate, column stiffness, column spacing, column type (floating and fully penetrating), reinforcement stiffness, and different foundation soil profiles are explored. The results show that there can be large residual (post-construction) crest settlement and a lengthy consolidation period for reinforced embankments with floating columns. &#xd;
Finally, the short-term and long-term performance of reinforced, DMM floating-column supported embankments with and without prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are investigated. The inclusion of PVDs is found to address the aforesaid issues. Also, the synergistic effects of PVDs and surcharge are examined for a bridge approach embankment.</description>

   <description>Countering the trend in contemporary ecocriticism to advance realism as an environmentally responsible mode of representation, this essay argues that the anti-realist aesthetics of literary modernism were implicitly “ecological.” In order to make this argument I distinguish between contemporary and modernist ecological culture (both of which I differentiate in turn from ecological science); while the former is concerned primarily with the practical reform &#xd;
characteristic of what we now call “environmentalism,” the latter demanded an all-encompassing reimagination of the relationship between humanity and nature. “Modernist ecology,” as I call it, attempted to envision this change through thematically and formally experimental works of art. Its radical vision, suggestive in some ways of today‟s “deep” ecology, repudiated modern accounts of nature as a congeries of inert objects to be manipulated by a sovereign subject, and instead foregrounded the chiasmic intertexture of the subject/object relationship. In aesthetic modernism we encounter not “objective” nature, but “nature-being” – a blank substratum beneath the solid contours of what philosopher Kate Soper calls “lay nature” – the revelation of which shatters historical constructions of nature and alone allows for radical alternatives. This essay looks specifically at modernist ecology as it appears in the works of W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and Samuel Beckett, detailing their attempts to envision revolutionary new ecologies, but also their struggles with the limited capacity of esoteric modernist art to effect significant ecological change on a &#xd;
collective level.</description>

   <description>Introduction: How youth cope with the many changes associated with adolescence, such as physical and sexual maturation, psychological development, changes in social situations, and often, new home life dynamics, determines whether or not they will make a healthy transition into adulthood (Breinbauer, 2005; Fraser-Thomas et al., 2005; Lerner, 2002; Roth &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003; Roth et al., 1998). Programs promoting Positive Youth Development (PYD) have been shown to equip youth with competencies to successfully navigate this transition but programs are not equally available to youth of all socioeconomic strata. Not-for-profit programs such as The Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada strive to enhance accessibility to PYD experiences by offering low-cost or no-cost programs that are guided by PYD principles (Kerr, 2011; Roth &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003). Though programs like the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada aim to provide a setting and opportunities for PYD, evidence linking program content to PYD from a youth perspective is scant (Lerner, 2005). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore youth perspectives of their Boys and Girls Club involvement through the lens of PYD outcomes and to examine how these perspectives fit with aspects of PYD endorsed by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada. Methods: Boys and Girls Club youth members (n=7) were trained in Photovoice methodology to explore their experiences in Boys and Girls Club programming through photographs. Youth took photographs and shared the stories behind their photographs via interviews. Interviews were analyzed deductively, using Lerner and colleagues 5 C’s of PYD framework, and inductively for emerging themes using NVivo 10. Results: Youth participants indicated that their experiences at the Boys and Girls club were influenced by diverse factors; they also talked about how their participation in programs helped them develop interpersonal connections and individual growth. Overarching themes were: 1) PYD outcomes, and 2) ecological factors. Discussion: Youth participants displayed growth on an individual level through assets, experiences and opportunities made available to them through the Boys and Girls Club. This study contributes to the growing body of literature highlighting the importance of accessible PYD programming for adolescents.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2015-05-31 22:30:58.894</description>
   <description>Land-cover change monitoring has remained at the forefront of interest in environmental science and sustainability research for many years. Digital change detection, which mainly relies on remote-sensing technology, has been widely applied to encompass the quantification of dynamic land-cover change. A variety of digital change detection techniques can be categorized into unsupervised and supervised approaches depending on the availability of reference data.  Traditional unsupervised and supervised approaches both suffer certain issues which may lead to unreliable results of change discrimination. This thesis seeks to advance current methodology of digital change detection in order to better address the complexity of practical land cover monitoring.  &#xd;
Unsupervised methods are firstly investigated in the first manuscript under the condition of the unavailability of reference data. To deal with ambiguous definitions of ‘change’ and ‘no change’ existing in past research, an objective categorization system of ‘interested’ and ‘irrelevant’ change is constructed according to the nature of the considered scene of a given urban region.  An advantageous unsupervised change detection procedure is hereby developed to separate these interested and irrelevant changes by fully exploiting the complementary attributes of luminance and saturation. &#xd;
In the second manuscript, a new and more applicable approach called ‘targeted change detection’ is described to improve change-detection techniques when reference data is available. In the proposed targeted approach, only reference data for targeted types are required with the goal of identifying only interested changes and discarding other classes, and thus the drawbacks of uncertainties and tedious sampling in the supervised approach can be addressed. An efficient algorithm for targeted change detection and its operational workflow are presented. Two very different study cases are used to demonstrate the proposed procedure with the results both showing the higher accuracy of our proposed method compared with other potential targeted change-detection methods.</description>

   <description>The coordination chemistry of the phosphonium-1-indenylide (PHIN) ligand methyldiphenylphosphonium-1-indenylide (1-C9H6PMePh2, I) has been studied, and a new phosphonium-1-indenylide (PHIN) ligand methyldiphenylphosphonium-4,7-dimethyl-1-indenylide (4,7-dimethyl-1-C9H4PMePh2, II) has prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography. The zwitterionic structure of methyldiphenylphosphonium-4,7-dimethyl-1-indenylide II is isoelectronic with the cyclopentadienyl ligand and one can anticipate interesting coordination chemistry.[Ir(COD)][BF4] and [Rh(COD)][BF4] were prepared by reactions of silver tetrafluoroborate, AgBF4, with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 and [Rh(COD)Cl]2 and by reacting the resulting [Ir(COD)][BF4] and [Rh(COD)][BF4] with I and II. The resulting planar chiral iridium(I) and rhodium(I) complexes [Ir(η4-C8H12)(η5-I)]BF4 (III), [Ir(η4-C8H12)(η5-II)]BF4 (IV), [Rh(η4-C8H12)(η5-I)]BF4 (V), and [Rh(η4-C8H12)(η5-II)]BF4 (VI) were synthesized as pairs of enantiomers depending on which face of five-membered rings coordinates to the metal centers.  The iridium and rhodium complexes have been characterized by extensive NMR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. Hydrogenation of [Rh(η4-C8H12)(η5-I)]BF4 (V) and the oxidative addition of methyl iodide and benzyl chloride to all the new complexes III-VI were attempted. Coordination of I to a variety of metals in Groups IV, IX, X, and XII, was attempted.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, we consider the communication problem of a single source simultaneously transmitting to multiple receivers whose sets of requested messages overlap. For decades, one of the challenges in this broadcast setting has been decreasing the number of transmissions from the source to the terminals without increasing the system complexity. The multicast and broadcast problems with ‘common’ information have been mostly studied ‘existentially’: information-theoretical bounds on rates and capacities have been discussed in a number of previous works. In this work, we take the contrasted ‘constructive’ viewpoint and attempt to design practical transmission protocols with low encoding and decoding complexities. Our approach is based on rateless fountain coding equipped with efficient belief propagation (BP) decoders. While previous network coding solutions require high-complexity Gaussian elimination decoding for optimality, fountain codes allow for much better performance-complexity trade-offs with BP decoders due to their sparse decoding Tanner graphs. We provide insights and solutions for the 2-terminal setting as an example that show the extraordinary power and flexibility of fountain codes to address the conflicting challenges in the design of efficient transmission protocols. Our ideas can be extended to larger number of receivers and though we have focused on Luby-Transform (LT) codes, other fountain coding distributions can be equally useful. The proposed coding methods in this thesis can be applied to many practical systems such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) that have limited power, memory, and processing capabilities.</description>

   <description>Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation is  rapidly expanding,  driven by decreases in capital and operational costs. Modeling of expected energy output is a major factor affecting the operation and construction of these systems, and the objective of this thesis is to present methodologies and tools which improve  PV system modeling. Initially, the modeling of short circuit current in PV modules is investigated and demonstrates techniques for filtering of data from fielded PV modules, allowing performance metrics traditionally derived in laboratory tests to be derived from data collected from stationary outdoors systems. &#xd;
&#xd;
The spectral component of irradiance is important for PV system modeling, and dataset of hourly spectral irradiance from 250nm-2500nm was collected from November 2012 to April 2014. This data set can be used to validate the derived  equations from the previous chapter, and is aimed to enable improved  modeling of spectra using an iterative  methodology. &#xd;
 &#xd;
 Albedo, or reflected, irradiance is then considered, where effects of spectral mismatch can be substantial. It was found that spectral mismatch error can lead to modeling errors ranging from 0.04 % to 10.5 % as PV module tilt increases from 25 degrees to 90 degrees from the horizontal, and methods of predicting and modeling this albedo spectral mismatch were presented. &#xd;
&#xd;
 Detailed methods for identifying snowfall losses were investigated, and provided results from two typical winters in 2010 and 2011. It was found that there is not a simple correlation between meteorological factors and snowfall losses, which warrant further investigation in the the modeling an prediction of this phenomenon. Consequently,  an empirical lag 1  time-series model is proposed, based on the stochastic variation in snow depth that is able to predict daily snow fall losses within 3%. &#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, an investigation is undertaken into the use of planar diffuse reflectors for albedo augmentation. It was found experimentally that such a system can increase system output by 18%. A physically based non-empirical model was developed that predicted system output with a bias error of 1%, and  was used to perform a sensitivity analysis that demonstrated a yearly energy increase of 30% is achievable at the latitude of Kingston, Ontario.</description>

   <description>This thesis addresses the tension between industrial development policies and environmental protection and the rising pollution levels in the City of Lüleburgaz in Thrace region, a peripheral region of Istanbul, Turkey. The environmental narratives of second- third-generation Muslim-Balkan immigrants, who began arriving in the early 20th Century, and Kurdish migrants, who arrived in Lüleburgaz in the post-1990 era, express conflict geographies of pollution across communities and between the communities and the state. Heavy pollution in the Ergene River, where the river is declared “dead,” is not a mere accident but rather a facet of neoliberal environmental governance. A politics of non-governance Conflicting narratives of Muslim-Balkan immigrants and Kurdish migrants uncover multiple layered conflict geographies of water pollution in Thrace region by grappling with the question of how “the nation” is continously reterritorialized within neoliberalized constructions of environment and river politics at the community and policy realms. Ethnic-class segregation leads to different community demands with regard to river pollution and environmental degradation in neighbourhoods characterized by different materialities of housing and occupation, a particular facet of non-governance that creates landscapes of invisibility. This analysis contributes to theories on “actually existing neoliberalism” and the ways through which the nation and its various territorial practices at different epochs of neoliberalization processes not only create consent for neoliberalization practices, but also give way for historical and racialized ethnic conflicts to survive.</description>

   <description>Analytical models that describe the electromagnetic field interactions arising between field generating and sensing coils in close proximity to conducting structures can be used to enhance analysis and information extracted from signals obtained using electromagnetic non-destructive evaluation technologies. A novel strategy, which enables the derivation of exact solutions describing all electromagnetic interactions arising in inductively coupled circuits due to a voltage excitation, is developed in this work. Differential circuit equations are formulated in terms of an arbitrary voltage excitation and of the magnetic fields arising in inductive systems, using Faraday’s law and convolution, and solved using the Fourier transform. The approach is valid for systems containing any number of driving and receiving coils, and include nearby conducting and ferromagnetic structures. In particular, the solutions account for feedback between a ferromagnetic conducting test piece and the driving and sensing coils, providing correct voltage response of the coils. Also arising from the theory are analytical expressions for complex inductances in a circuit, which account for real (inductive) and imaginary (loss) elements associated with conducting and ferromagnetic structures. A novel model-based method for simultaneous characterization of material parameters, which includes magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity, wall thickness and liftoff, is subsequently developed from the forward solutions. Furthermore, arbitrary excitation waveforms, such as a sinusoid or a square wave, for applications in conventional and transient eddy current, respectively, may be considered. Experimental results, obtained for a square wave excitation, are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

   <description>The aquaculture sector has been the fastest growing animal food producer since the 1970’s. With such a fast growth rate, ecological problems have arisen due to the lack of ability to control nutrient run off in coastal systems. Conversely, land-based fisheries provide an ecologically sustainable solution to controlling the effects of pollution by regulating the effluent wastewater. A land-based fishery’s wastewater stabilization pond system (WSPS) in south-central Ontario, Canada, was characterized for its treatment of phosphorus (P) after experiencing occasional exceedances of their effluent compliance limits. An iron and aluminum oxide based media implemented as an advanced filtration was investigated as a possible treatment solution.&#xd;
&#xd;
Background testing was performed to characterize the water column as well as the sediment-water interface. The WSPS was characterized as two distinct systems. The primary loading system consisted of two slow flow but high concentration of P ponds that remove the majority of P. The primary system also had the greatest potential for P desorption from the sediments if the overlying P concentrations were to change. The secondary system is a polishing system with the majority of the flow but minimal P loading and removal.  &#xd;
&#xd;
An iron and aluminum oxide based medium was characterized for its P removal. Three lab-scale tests were run; a short-term semi batch test to predict the maximum P removal using Langmuir’s isotherm, a long-term semi-batch test to quantify the total P removal, and a column flow-through test to better quantify the medium’s P removal as a lab-scale simulation of a field implementation. The medium removed around 9 mgP/gmedia depending on the particle size and contact time. Langmuir’s isotherm severely under predicted the maximum removal capacity in comparison to the long-term physical tests. &#xd;
&#xd;
A hydrodynamic simulation coupled with a water quality model was developed to investigate the impacts on the WSPS if the advanced P filtration system using the proprietary medium previously investigated was implemented. The maximum treatment flow modelled without significant continuity errors removed 31.8% of the inlet P load. Suggestions for siting the advanced P filtration system have been discussed based on the needs of the fishery.</description>

Multiple DGDCs are networked together to share information and computing processes. In this thesis, a year-long DGDC simulation balances the computing demand and supply each hour with variable renewable energy production and electricity prices. A five-year Net Present Value (NPV) analysis determines the optimal energy system with the lowest lifetime cost of computing (LCC), equal to the net present value divided by the amount of electricity used for computing. The LCC fairly compares alternative energy systems by the ability to provide lowest cost computing.&#xd;
Grid-isolated DGDCs with 100kW of solar panels have an optimal computing capacity of 20kW and a 20 hour battery capacity. When the optimal grid-isolated DGDC is connected to the Ithaca electricity grid the battery storage is 10 hours and the LCC is $10/MWh less. The NYSERDA Solar PV Program applied to a grid-tied DGDC reduces the panel cost by $76,806 and reduces the LCC by 8.5%. Grid-tied DGDCs in Ontario are not feasible due to the high Feed-in-Tariff incentive to sell electricity.&#xd;
A grid-isolated DGDC is optimal in Ithaca when the cost of transmission infrastructure upgrades are greater than $8291 or when the value of a generated Renewable Energy Credits (REC) are higher than $38/MWh. Both on- and off-grid DGDCs use equal amount of energy for computing but a grid-tied DGDC is able to sell 26% of electricity from a 100kW solar system with only 10kW of transmission capacity.&#xd;
Grid-tied DGDCs are active market participants responding to electricity price signals. DGDCs buy low-cost electricity and sell electricity when prices are high. On average the cost of energy used by the DGDC is $19/MWh less than grid electricity. DGDCs provide a reliable source of computing for high-priority applications such as video streaming as well as a low-cost option for time independent tasks such as batch processes or cloud storage.</description>

   <description>Between 1925 and 1940 Canadian unbelievers in three cities, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal, got organized and took up an active struggle against religion. This study examines that historical moment and asks what it was about the interwar period that caused unbelief to thrive. It details the day-to-day operation of anti-religious organizations and the backlash that they provoked from both church and state. It also delves into the activities of those who sought to keep Canada Christian by agitating against atheism and the teaching of evolution.&#xd;
There were a number of social and cultural trends that fostered interwar unbelief, such as the disillusionment of many veterans with orthodox religion, conflicts between fundamentalists and modernists, and the spread of Communism. By examining local organizations we can see how these broader forces were made manifest in specific communities. Rationalist societies in Winnipeg and Toronto were remarkably successful in attracting working-class audiences. A group of francophone communists in Montreal were equally active in putting out anti-religious propaganda. This challenge to the Christian status quo faced stiff opposition from both church and state, however, and some leading unbelievers were severely punished. The absence of organized unbelief in Nova Scotia, meanwhile, did not prevent fears of creeping atheism, as is illustrated by a controversy over the teaching of evolution in local high schools. By examining and placing in context these stories from across the country this study sheds new light on the history of both belief and unbelief in Canada.</description>

   <description>Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an increasingly useful tool for life cycle management of deteriorating infrastructure. Rayleigh backscatter distributed fibre optic strain sensing (FOS) is a promising measurement technology that can provide relevant quantitative data across an entire structure as opposed to the single point data acquisition of conventional strain sensors. Utilizing this FOS technology, an experimental investigation to measure and better understand the effects of deterioration on reinforced concrete behaviour was undertaken.&#xd;
	Reinforced concrete tension specimens were instrumented with optical fibres and tested in axial tension to determine if FOS is capable of measuring the effects of tension stiffening and to develop insights into the bond performance of reinforced concrete. It was found that FOS could be used to measure the distributed reinforcement strain, especially before cracking occurs, and these results illustrate how the bond deteriorates with increasing load. In addition, FOS can detect crack locations as well as when cracks develop on only one side of the specimen.&#xd;
	The FOS technology was utilized to detect and quantify corrosion levels of the reinforcing steel and to determine how corrosion affects bond performance. An impressed current accelerated corrosion technique was used to corrode additional reinforced concrete tension specimens. Test results showed that reinforced concrete specimens that were corroded to 13% mass loss had a decrease in ultimate capacity of over 30%. This was due to pitting corrosion of the reinforcement that the FOS was able to detect. Additionally, the FOS results showed that as the corrosion levels increase, the bond performance continues to deteriorate. &#xd;
	To explore the usefulness of FOS in assessing deteriorated reinforced concrete structures, beams instrumented with optical fibres had the bottom flexural reinforcement corroded and were tested in three point bending. The FOS system was capable of detecting both flexural and shear cracks in the concrete, early signs of corrosion, and bond loss. Test results also showed that just 4.0% mass loss of the bottom reinforcing steel due to corrosion can decrease the ultimate capacity of the beam by 39% due to section loss and debonding of the reinforcing steel.</description>

   <description>Numerous claims have been made to the effect that clinical research on human subjects can be exploitative — and hence morally problematic — even if there is informed consent and in the absence of any harm. If such claims are true, it follows that research ethics bodies ought to include avoidance of exploitation amongst their guiding principles. In order to evaluate these claims and provide guidance to implement a principle of avoidance of exploitation, three main questions must be addressed: what exactly do we mean by “exploitation”; how does exploitation affect the morality of clinical trials on human subjects; and what can be done to tackle exploitation in clinical trials. Chapter 2 provides an expository account of the historical context of the claims that sparked the current debate. Chapter 3 addresses the first main question by outlining three main types of exploitation accounts — namely micro fairness exploitation, macro fairness exploitation, and mere use exploitation — with examples of each from the literature. This typology is used in subsequent chapters to conduct a type-by-type analysis in order to determine whether or not particular controversial practices could constitute exploitation. Chapter 4 examines the nature of the connections (if any) between the three types of exploitation and a) concerns about standards of care and placebo controls, as well as b) concerns about participants’ post-trial access to successfully tested interventions. Both of these concerns arose in the context of international research conducted in Low and Middle Income Countries, but neither is necessarily unique to that context. Chapter 5 examines if and when benefits to entire communities might be necessary to avoid exploitation of either the communities themselves or individual trial participants. Chapter 6 advances a proposal aimed at reducing exploitation in commercial clinical trials by recognizing commercial clinical trial participation as a form of labour, which ought to be financially compensated, and suggesting the adoption of a locally indexed “living wage” model as a minimum standard of compensation.</description>

   <description>This thesis deals with non-standard optimal quantization and approximation problems in source coding and stochastic control.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The first part of the thesis considers randomized quantization. Adapted from stochastic control, a general representation of randomized quantizers that is probabilistically equivalent to common models in the literature is proposed via mixtures of joint probability measures induced by deterministic quantizers. Using this general model, we prove the existence of an optimal randomized quantizer for the generalized distribution preserving quantization problem. A Shannon theoretic version of this source coding problem is also considered, in which an optimal (minimum distortion) coding of stationary and memoryless source is studied under the requirement that the quantizer's output distribution also be stationary and memoryless possibly different than source distribution. We provide a characterization of the achievable rate region where the rate region includes both the coding rate and the rate of common randomness shared between the encoder and the decoder.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second part of the thesis, we consider the quantization problems in stochastic control from viewpoints of information transmission and computation. The first problem studies the finite-action approximation (via quantization of the action space) of deterministic stationary policies of a discrete time Markov decision process (MDP), while the second problem considers finite-state approximations (via quantization of the state space) of discrete time Markov decision process. Under certain continuity conditions on the components of the MDP, we establish that optimal policies for the finite models can approximate  with arbitrary precision optimal deterministic stationary policies for the original MDP. Combining these results leads to a constructive scheme for obtaining near optimal solutions via well known algorithms developed for finite state/action MDPs. For both problems, we also obtain explicit bounds on the approximation error in terms of the number of representation points in the quantizer, under further conditions.</description>

   <description>Model Driven Development (MDD) is a relatively new software development methodology that has been increasingly used in the last decade for software development and, in many cases, has replaced traditional, code-centric approaches. In MDD, models or software abstractions are the basic building blocks in the software development life cycle and model transformations are the technology used to map between models conforming to diff erent metamodels. Model transformations are used for diff erent&#xd;
purposes in MDD, e.g., refactoring, migration, and code generation. Since model transformations are essential in MDD, transformation testing and veri fication is essential to the success of MDD and has been of increasing interest to researchers and practitioners. In this research, we investigate the verifi cation of model transformations with respect&#xd;
to a wide range of properties in an automatic and scalable fashion using symbolic execution techniques. First, we survey the state-of-the-art in testing and veri fication of model transformations. Second, we present a model transformation that we have previously developed in an industrial context and used later on as a case study for experimentation. Third, we experiment with a black-box testing tool and an automated formal verifi cation tool on the aforementioned industrial case study. This step was intended to give us a better understanding of the limitations of current tools that yet need to be addressed by researchers. Fourth, we attempt to address the limitations encountered in the state-of-the-art tools by extending and enhancing a symbolic model transformation property prover for a graph-based transformation language&#xd;
called DSLTrans. Finally, we use our symbolic model transformation property&#xd;
prover to verify properties for our industrial transformation and for another large transformation, both of which we reimplemented in DSLTrans. We report on the results, strengths and limitations of our property prover in comparison with other verifi cation tools, lessons learnt, and possible future work.</description>

   <description>Honeycomb (or cellular) Top Down–Bottom Up blinds are quite widely available. When this type of blind is closed there are two or more vertical blind portions and a series of horizontal or near-horizontal blind portions joining the vertical portions forming a series of cells.  When such a blind is open the vertical portions of the blind bend decreasing the blind height. &#xd;
A honeycomb blind with a single column of cells in two different shapes was considered in the present study. Results have also been obtained for a Top Down-Bottom Up plane blind for comparative purposes.  The effect of the dimensionless top and bottom blind openings, shape of the blind and dimensionless window recess depth on the convective heat transfer from a window to the surrounding room was numerically investigated.  The case where the window is at a higher temperature than room was considered. Laminar and turbulent flow can occur over the window system for the conditions considered in this work. &#xd;
The numerical results were obtained using the commercial CFD finite-volume based solver FLUENT© and using the standard k-epsilon turbulence model. Some experimental tests were undertaken for a window-blind system with plane blind to validate the numerical results obtained in this work. &#xd;
From the results of this study it is concluded that when the blind is fully closed the mean window heat transfer rate for a case where a honeycomb blind is used is less than that for the case where a plane blind is used. However when the blind is partially open, the heat transfer rate from a window-blind system with a honeycomb blind is higher than it is for the case where a plane blind is used at high Rayleigh numbers considered. When the blind is partially open, increasing the dimensionless top blind opening or decreasing the dimensionless bottom blind opening increases the mean window Nusselt number at the higher Rayleigh numbers considered. The results indicate that the effect of the dimensionless window recess depth on the mean window Nusselt number is different in each flow regime i.e. with laminar, transitional and turbulent flow.</description>

   <description>Concrete is the most commonly used building material in the construction industry, and contributes to 52% of construction and demolition waste in Canada. Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is one way to reduce this impact. To evaluate the performance of coarse and granular (fine and coarse) RCA in structural concrete applications, four studies were performed: an environmental assessment, a material testing program, a shear performance study, and a flexural performance study. &#xd;
To determine the environmental benefits of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC), three case studies were investigated using different populations and proximities to city centres. Environmental modelling suggested that RCA replacement could result in energy savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions, especially in remote areas. &#xd;
Tests were performed to determine if the volumetric replacement of up to 30% coarse RCA and 20% granular RCA is suitable for structural concrete applications in Canada. Fresh, hardened, and durability properties were evaluated. All five (5) of the RCA mixes showed equivalent material performance to the control mixes and met the requirements for a structural concrete mix. &#xd;
The five (5) RAC mixes were also used in structural testing. One-way reinforced concrete slab specimens were tested to failure to evaluate the shear and flexural performance of the RAC members. Peak capacities of and crack formation within each member were analyzed to evaluate the performance of RAC compared to conventional concrete. The shear capacity of specimens made from four (4) of the five (5) RAC mixtures was higher or equivalent to the control specimens. Specimens of the concrete mixture containing the highest content of recycled aggregate, 20% volumetric replacement of granular RCA, had shear capacities 14.1% lower, and exhibited cracking at lower loads than the control. The average flexural capacities of all RAC specimens were within 3.7% of the control specimens. &#xd;
Results from this research provide evidence that up to 30% coarse recycled concrete aggregate and 10% granular recycled aggregate may be incorporated into structural concrete mixtures without altering the behaviour of the structure. Concrete containing 20% volumetric replacement of the natural aggregate with granular RCA should be designed with special consideration of the shear performance.</description>

   <description>The ability of tumour cells to avoid immune destruction (immune escape) and their acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs constitute important barriers to the successful management of cancer. The interaction between specific molecules on the surface of tumour cells with their corresponding receptors on immune effector cells can result in inhibition of these effector cells, consequently allowing tumour cells to evade the host’s anti-tumour immune response. The interaction of the Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of tumour cells with the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes leads to inactivation of these immune effectors, and is a specific example of an immune escape mechanism tumour cells use to avoid immune destruction. Clinically, antibodies capable of blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefit, and are currently being used to help bolster patients’ immune response against malignant cells in a variety of cancer types. Here we show that the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction also leads to tumour cell resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Incubation of PD-L1-expressing human and mouse tumour cells with PD-1-expressing Jurkat T cells or purified recombinant PD-1 resulted in tumour cell resistance to doxorubicin and docetaxel. Interference with the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction using blocking anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody or shRNA-mediated gene silencing resulted in attenuation of PD-1/PD-L1-mediated drug resistance. Moreover, inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 signalling axis using anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced the effect of doxorubicin chemotherapy to inhibit 4T1 tumour cell metastasis in an in vivo mouse model of mammary carcinoma. These findings indicate that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may be a useful approach to immunosensitize and chemosensitize tumours in cancer patients and provide a rationale for the use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as adjuvants to chemotherapy.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
&#xd;
Lightweight design, drawing an increasing attention for structural design in automotive industry, is recognized as an efficient and immediate way to improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. Topology optimization, by determining an optimum geometry and material distribution of a structure at an early design stage, serves as the cornerstone for not only increasing the performance of products but also streamlining the entire structural design process. &#xd;
In this thesis, the theory, algorithm, implementation and application of both of the traditional single-material topology optimization and an advanced multi-material topology optimization are presented, which can solve real-world engineering problems in the automotive industry. This research will advance structural optimization methods in academic research, and it is also expected that the developed method and tool would make a profound impact in the design of automotive parts and assemblies in the field. &#xd;
In Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, the traditional single-material topology optimization is explained, and it is applied to the design of an automotive engine cradle and a cross-car-beam (CCB). The computational method helped an automotive tier-1 supplier company produce better engineering products while reducing time and cost of the design process. &#xd;
In Chapter 4, a multi-material topology optimization methodology and its numerical tool are presented. This innovative approach can effectively deal with multiple, dissimilar materials in structural design. Advanced mathematical algorithms, numerical implementation, and practical applications are discussed in detail, and effectiveness and efficiency of the methodology is demonstrated with a variety of engineering problems. &#xd;
Detailed discussions are included in Chapter 5, and recommendations for future work are discussed in Chapter 6.</description>

   <description>Abstract &#xd;
The purpose of this study was to explore the help-seeking behaviour of African immigrants in Ottawa, Ontario. One of the greatest challenges to effective intervention for prevention and treatment of mental health disorders is the reluctance of people to seek professional mental health care. The mental health help-seeking behaviour of African immigrants has not been explored in mental health research in this country. In addition, very little has been written regarding specific cultural concepts in the worldview of this group of people and how this perspective impacts their help-seeking behaviour. In this study, existing research is reviewed and incorporated into a foundation for understanding African immigrants’ perception of mental health.&#xd;
Method: Eight self-identified African immigrants were interviewed. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. The findings from this study indicated there are hindrances to help-seeking behaviour for this group of the population, such as language barriers, cultural differences, stigma, loneliness, and lack of social support networks. &#xd;
Future studies may focus on strategies to evaluate and examine existing programs serving new immigrants as they navigate through the healthcare system.</description>

   <description>This dissertation locates the manifold concept of utopia as imbricated with the project of English settler colonialism in the New World and the succeeding settler colonial societies of Canada and the US. I situate Thomas More’s Utopia as an early modern narrative that was mobilized to articulate notions of transcendental progress and universal rationality commensurate with Christian Humanism, which served to justify expropriation of Indigenous lands. I further locate contemporary Indigenous critical theoretical interventions into longstanding scholarly theories of nation and peoplehood. I argue that Indigenous critical theory, literary studies, and works of Indigenous speculative fiction serve an immanent critique to the settler utopian traditions of Canada and the US, which both reflect and further the naturalization of settler colonialism as an enduring force which frames the contemporary experience of globalization. This immanent critique is also applied to contemporary utopian studies discourses, including emergent discussions of “Non-Western” and “postcolonial” utopias. I proceed to an exploration of contemporary speculative narratives of Indigenous, racialized non-Native, and white settler peoples concerned with varying notions of indigneity. I argue such narratives propose desirable social change in ways that further naturalize or resist settler colonialism in their respective envisages of the future.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2015-06-25 15:09:35.086</description>
   <description>Video game culture has been soundly criticized as being the privileged domain of heterosexual, white, male players and it has been criticized for marginalizing those players who do not meet these criteria. In current games studies research, the ways marginalized players navigate, challenge, and reshape online gaming environments to suit their own needs has received very little academic attention. In the online multiplayer game World of Warcraft developed by Blizzard Entertainment, two groups of LGBTQ players (and their allies) have created an alternative community to that of the mainstream. While the mainstream World of Warcraft community is plagued with oppressive heteronormativity and homophobia, this alternative community is based on equity and inclusivity. Utilizing a Foucauldian approach to discourse analysis, this thesis examines player-created texts, several official World of Warcraft forum threads, and Blizzard Entertainment’s legal policy documents in three distinct yet interrelated sections. First, drawing on Judith Butler’s (2009) notion of precarity, I argue that LGBTQ players have been positioned as precarious subjects in World of Warcraft culture. I then demonstrate how this precarity is mitigated within this alternate community through the active promotion of an LGBTQ community presence in the game, and through public community building events such as an in-game pride parade. Second, I discuss the importance of community, citizenship, and shared identities in establishing meaningful and inclusive social policies. This is done, in part, by drawing on Benedict Andersons’s (2006) imagined communities and Celia Pearce’s (2009) communities of play to demonstrate the contrast between the mainstream World of Warcraft community and the alternate community. Third, I suggest that regulating and enforcing the language players use in-game and in the forums is essential for promoting equity in World of Warcraft. By preventing the use of hate speech and thus limiting the harms that can result from it, marginalized players are afforded the opportunity to engage fully in the (social) gaming experience.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines Pierre Elliott Trudeau’s relationship with labour unions and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation-New Democratic Party of Canada from 1945 to 2000. Trudeau was an extremely influential historical figure, both as prime minister (1968-1984), but also before his entry into formal politics, when he traveled and studied around the world, became deeply influenced by leftist movements and intellectuals, and sought to modernize Quebec, which in his view was falling behind English Canada in terms of technological, social, and democratic development. In essence, Trudeau sought to forge a liberal democracy he thought absent in Quebec, and found his staunchest allies to be trade unionists and socialists. In the end, however, Trudeau largely abandoned those movements because he felt winning liberal freedoms required the shelving of socialist objectives. This would, in turn, be his justification for joining the Liberal Party in 1965.&#xd;
As Prime Minister, Trudeau opposed the objectives and philosophies of his former left allies, even as he maintained his image as a progressive. So while many saw his Just Society, his approach to public and Canadian ownership of energy, his New Society, and his Charter of Rights and Freedoms as left-wing initiatives, I argue that Trudeau’s actions were undertaken not to challenge capitalism, but to strengthen it, primarily through the empowerment of business and the disempowerment of unions and the economically-disenfranchised.&#xd;
Ultimately, this dissertation asserts that Trudeau cannot be classified as a socialist, but must be seen as a liberal preoccupied, not with liberty and equality, but with the continued pre-eminence of capitalist property relations.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-06 10:22:18.619</description>
   <description>Background: Adolescent school injuries are common and often result in serious consequences. Problem risk behaviours are known causes of injury and interventions have targeted these independent behaviours with modest success in the past. Although there is some research investigating relationships between risk behaviours, none have empirically evaluated measures of multiple risk behaviour using a theoretical framework of adolescent risk-taking. There is a need for research to utilize population health theory to investigate associations between measures of multiple risk behaviour and school injury. &#xd;
Objectives: The objectives of this thesis are to: 1) investigate the relationships between risk behaviours among a sample of Canadian adolescents using a framework of adolescent risk-taking, and 2) to evaluate adolescent risk behaviours and school climate as independent, and perhaps interactive, determinants of school injury under the Population Health Framework.&#xd;
Methods: Both objectives utilized an interim dataset from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study. Objective 1. Factor-analytically derived (and validated) scales of multiple risk behaviours were used to describe relationships between these behaviours. Objective 2. Students reported their experiences with different types of school injury. Relationships between multiple risk behaviour and school injuries were assessed. The influence of school climate on that relationship was also evaluated. &#xd;
Results: Objective 1. Adolescent risk behaviours appear to cluster into three distinct categories: 1) Overt Risk-Taking, 2) Active Healthy Lifestyle Detriment, and 3) Passive Healthy Lifestyle Detriment. Objective 2. Young, overt-risk takers were identified as a specific high-risk group for general school injuries, as well as several sub-types of school injury. School climate influences relationships between risk behaviour and school injury in complex and context-specific ways. The inconsistency of its effects suggests that it is not an effect modifier.&#xd;
Conclusions: Objective 1. Currently, surveillance, intervention programs, and research target isolated domains of risk behaviour. This thesis shows that risk behaviours cluster in predictable ways and should be studied and addressed in their related groups. Objective 2. Associations between multiple risk behaviour and school injury appear to be strongest among younger students. Effects of school climate on these relationships cannot be easily generalized across different grades or injury types.</description>

   <description>In contemporary debates about justice, political philosophers take themselves to be engaged with a subject that’s narrower than the whole of morality.  Many contemporary liberals, notably John Rawls, understand this narrowness in terms of context specificity.  On their view, justice is the part of morality that applies to the context of a society’s institutions, but only has indirect application to the context of citizens’ personal lives (unlike the rest of morality).  In contrast, many value pluralists, notably G.A. Cohen, understand justice’s narrowness in terms of singularity against a plural background.  On their view, justice is one fundamental value amongst a plurality of fundamental values.  &#xd;
     The purpose of my thesis is to establish that the pluralist conception of justice’s narrowness is (a) theoretically significant and (b) true.  To establish its theoretical significance, I argue that proper attention to the ways in which different understandings of narrowness inform the work of contemporary egalitarians explains a considerable amount of disagreement between them concerning the content and scope of distributive justice.  On the one hand, I’ll argue that if we understand justice’s narrowness in the manner Cohen and other pluralists do, i.e., understand a conception of justice to be a conception of a particular fundamental value, then both luck-egalitarianism and the claim that justice extends to the personal context are compelling.  On the other hand, I’ll argue that if we understand justice’s narrowness in a contextual manner, i.e., understand justice to comprise one or more all-things-considered principles adopted for the institutional context, then both luck-egalitarianism and the claim that justice extends to the personal context prove implausible.  &#xd;
     To establish the truth of the pluralist conception of narrowness, I argue first, that the contextual understanding is only plausible if fairness should be understood procedurally instead of substantively; and second, that substantive fairness cannot be eliminated, as specifying the content of procedural fairness requires a substantive criterion.  The upshot is that justice’s narrowness is best understood in terms of singularity against a plural background, rather than in terms of context specificity.</description>

   <description>Competitive engineering involves making modifications to the structure of youth sport (e.g., rules, facilities, equipment and competitive structure) to promote positive sport experiences and desirable athlete outcomes. Although this is a promising approach to structure youth sport, empirical evidence supporting competitive engineering has focused on skill development and performance, with little known about how athletes’ perceive these modified competitive environments. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore young female athletes’ experiences in their competitively engineered soccer environment. Seventeen recreational and competitive soccer players, aged 8-11, participated in semi-structured interviews that featured several visual qualitative methods (i.e., athlete-directed photography, an athlete drawing exercise, a pile-sort exercise and a photo-elicitation interview) to facilitate insight on their sport environments. &#xd;
Results from the athlete interviews revealed that the athlete’s competitively engineered soccer experience was perceived as being a unique environment that emphasized personal development, positive relationships with coaches, peers and parents, and the underlying enjoyment of sport. Results were summarized into five themes that fell under the overarching unique environment concept, including: (a) strong friendships, (b) supportive coaching, (c) evolving challenges, (d) emphasizing fun, and (e) family influence. One final underlying concept was revealed by contrasting soccer with other sport settings, highlighting that soccer was just one, of many, unique and potentially positive sport environments for the athletes. While athletes positively viewed the competitive engineering strategies and underlying philosophies they were exposed to in soccer, it is important to note that the athletes’ also reflected positively on the range of experiences, emotions and outcomes they gained from participating in diverse sport environments. These findings add to the youth sport literature, extending our knowledge of how modifications to the youth sport structure influence the athletes’ experiences, providing practical implications to further promote positive sport outcomes and experiences for young athletes.</description>

   <description>This three year study (2012-2014) investigated the age and growth parameters of two economically important recreational fish species, Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). Age and length data were obtained for both species through sampling at competitive fishing events held on Lake Ontario and the Bay of Quinte. Scales, dorsal spines, and otoliths were used to determine age in both species. The results of this study found that scales and dorsal spines were effective aging structures for fish up to an age of 9 in Smallmouth Bass, and 7 in Largemouth Bass. As previously demonstrated, otoliths were found to be an effective aging structure at all ages. A comparison of the aging structures for tournament bass indicated that scales would be an effective aging structure for most tournament caught Smallmouth Bass, while otoliths would be required to effectively age tournament caught Largemouth Bass. Growth was determined through back calculation of length-at-age. Growth in Lake Ontario Smallmouth Bass was found to be greater than growth in Largemouth Bass, which is in contrast to findings of growth studies on other North American bass populations. Growth in present day Smallmouth Bass also exceeds growth of historical Smallmouth Bass from Lake Ontario. The results of this growth study indicate that there has been a recent change in the ecology of Lake Ontario Smallmouth Bass populations that makes it unique relative to other North American populations. The potential of competitive fishing tournaments as an assessment tool for recreationally important fish populations in large water bodies is demonstrated through this study. Although tournaments are biased towards the older fish in a population, data obtained through tournaments can provide information about an important component of the population that is not well represented with other sampling approaches. Using this information, fisheries managers are able to more fully understand and better manage recreationally important fish populations for sustainable use.</description>

   <description>Geosynthetic clay liners (GCL) overlain by a geomembrane (GMB) in a geosynthetic composite liner system in landfill liner and other waste containment applications can be left exposed for weeks, months, or in some extreme cases, even years. Three known consequences of leaving a GMB-GCL composite liner system uncovered, namely geomembrane wrinkling, GCL panel shrinkage, and more recently down-slope erosion of bentonite from a GCL are investigated in a second field experiment at the Queen’s University Environmental Liner Test Site (QUELTS II).&#xd;
Wrinkles were quantified for black and high albedo white high-density polyethylene geomembranes (both smooth and textured). Relative to the black geomembrane, wrinkles in the white geomembrane formed later in the morning and reduced sooner in the evening. Wrinkles in the white geomembrane relative to the black were less frequent, smaller in height, and had much shorter maximum interconnected lengths.&#xd;
GCL panel shrinkage and solar-driven down-slope bentonite erosion were quantified for four GCLs (two powdered bentonite GCLs, one polymer enhanced bentonite GCL, and one multicomponent GCL with a polymer coating installed coating up) left covered only by a black geomembrane, and for one GCL (containing fine-grained granular bentonite) left covered by a black geomembrane, white geomembrane, or 0.3 m of gravel cover.&#xd;
All GCLs experienced some overlap reduction except the GCL covered by gravel, although no loss of panel overlap occurred during 28 months of monitoring. If immediate cover is not possible, the choice of GCL type and the use of a white geomembrane can result in slower shrinkage rates.&#xd;
 	In addition to timely covering, GCL selection can reduce bentonite susceptibility to down-slope erosion. The polymer coated GCL (coating up) was found to be the most resistant to down-slope erosion, while the polymer enhanced and powdered bentonite GCLs were all far more resistant to erosion than the fine-grained granular bentonite GCL, although no erosion features with bentonite loss were detected on any GCL within the first seven weeks of exposure following the May 2012 construction. The use of a white geomembrane reduces the thermal effects on the composite liner, but ultimately did not prevent solar-driven down-slope bentonite erosion.</description>

   <description>This thesis consists of three essays related by the themes of networks and macroeconomics. The first essay examines the role of networks in workers’ search for employment. Unemployed workers gain employment by sending resumes directly to employers, and indirectly through employed friends. I find that the amount of search effort a worker undertakes is related to how many employed friends it has, and whether networks are substitutes or complements in search. When search costs are linear I find that complementary networks cause those with the most friends to search, while substitutable networks cause search effort to be independent of an individual’s network position. Finally, I examine the role of aggregate links on aggregate matching.&#xd;
The second essay examines the impact of networks on aggregate labour market variables, such as unemployment and unfilled vacancies. It is concluded that networks lead to wage heterogeneity, increased unemployment volatility, and higher autocorrelation of vacancy rates. The conclusions follow analytically using an approximation method, and quantitative magnitudes are discussed using numerical simulations. Finally, issues of network formation and multiple equilibria are addressed.&#xd;
The final essay analyzes the role of imitation on firm pricing decisions. A generalization of Calvo pricing is developed. It is shown that price dynamics are much different in a model with imitation. I demonstrate analytically that sticky inflation can arise. I partially characterize equilibrium prices and inflation. I finish the chapter by generalizing the network effects.</description>

   <description>“Emerging Voices: Reading Canadian Youth Online” examines digital youth-generated cultural content, including text, intertext, visual art, photography and tweets. I argue that youth are not simply passive recipients of culture; they are cultural producers who have recently gained access to new audiences through the use of digital technology. This dissertation examines three communities of content producers: young Indigenous writers mobilizing traditional knowledges to address contemporary issues like residential school legacies, racism, and substance abuse; street-entrenched youth from the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, BC creating multimedia content that disrupts the silence and stigma surrounding youth homelessness; and young feminists utilizing performative autobiography and self-portraiture to render the impacts of gender-based violence visible as part of the #YesAllWomen and #AmINext? Twitter movements. My analysis reveals that youth knowledges are highly generative and that the form of youth cultural production often reflects its content; just as youth knowledges are determined by intersecting identities and experiences, youth cultural content is created through intersecting media and modes of expression. Ultimately, my dissertation advocates for a model of cultural criticism that recognizes young people as knowledge producers, engages ethically and closely with their creative interventions, and attunes itself to the contexts and technologies that are shaping their work.</description>

   <description>High-latitude freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, the response to warming is rarely straightforward and may be modulated by local or regional factors, producing variability in biotic responses. This thesis examines three important drivers of local to regional-scale variability in the climate response of diatoms and chironomids, specifically: 1) the modulation of regional climate by the Wrangell-St. Elias ice fields over the Holocene in the Yukon; 2) the role of ice cover as the dominant driver of diatom assemblages in the High Arctic; and 3) the interaction between climate and nutrient dynamics at the archeological site Kukulek, Alaska. In the Yukon, paleolimnological records from three lakes at varying distances from the Wrangell-St. Elias ice fields were used to investigate the possible influence of large cryospheric features over the Holocene. The lake proximate to the ice fields showed a response to the Holocene Thermal Maximum, a warm period of similar magnitude to expected warming, suggesting that the moderating effect of the ice fields evident in recent records (spanning ~150 years) might deteriorate as the ice fields ablate. In the High Arctic, using a comparative study design we explicitly contrasted the diatom response to warming in four groups of sites characterized by different ice cover regimes. The diatoms shifted in a predictable manner from a low diversity, epipelic and epilithic assemblage, to a more diverse, largely epiphytic, assemblage likely in response to warming-associated changes in ice cover. At the Kukulek archeological site, marine-derived nutrients from historical hunting activities were traced by stable isotopes entering the adjacent pond, potentially tracing two periods of disturbance in the sediment record: the 1878-1880 AD famine and the archeological excavation in the 1930s. Warming temperatures, coincident with the late 19th century disturbance, may have compounded the fertilization of this pond as thawing permafrost released nutrients from the Kukulek site, affecting the diatom species composition. Collectively, this research increases our ability to effectively use diatom and chironomid assemblages as paleoecological proxies for climate and other environmental changes at high latitudes. Understanding context is key for improved paleoclimate reconstructions in this under-studied region.</description>

   <description>Boredom, in its blankness, has been both a canvas and a subject for modern artists and intellectuals. Whereas those in the early and mid-twentieth century theorized and aesthetically reencountered the conditions of boredom as a wasteland, boredom appears in the work of today as impossibly dense. Boredom in the semiocapitalist information age only remains blank insofar as it is full to the brim with information of inscrutable complexity and choices without real alternatives. Because boredom is fundamentally an experience of time distorted and emptied of meaning, developing this theory of boredom sustains a critical reflection on the temporality of contemporary everyday life. My approach is through vignettes of communication practices that are attempts at meaning-making and modulating time, but are also, in some sense, boring. After reviewing key literature on boredom pre- and post-digital revolution, I first turn to a consideration of texting. While texting is usually derided as trivial and time-wasting, I consider it as habitual in a compulsive, physical sense, but also ritual, in the sense of something done in a patterned way to affirm a bond. The experience of repeated sending and receiving is analyzed as an experience of accelerating or decelerating interpersonal temporalities. In the next chapter, I follow the shape of communication paths through the network and arrive at an exploration of line-making itself. Treating the line as a heuristic device, I consider the line as a cipher of boredom and the networked line, specifically, as an icon of late modernity. Chapter four deals with the use of lines and linearity in conceptual art and writing that explores boredom as a counter-spectacle; that is, as both a symptom of info- and entertainment culture and as a state from which it can be understood. I posit this work as an other of choice and information overload. Having used these vignettes to develop the idea of a uniquely late modern boredom of overload, I conclude that any confrontation with the twenty-first-century politics of information on the grounds of such practices as surveillance or semiocapitalism, is incomplete without an understanding of this boredom as a public affect.</description>

   <description>The recent surge in wrist-worn devices has stirred an increasing interest in wearable technology, however, reactions to these devices are split and the use-case of these devices is still unclear. This thesis explores affordances and opportunities offered by wrist-worn devices through the design and implementation of DisplaySkin. &#xd;
We approach the topic of wrist-worn displays by initially presenting a historical analysis of the development of the wristwatch. Based upon this analysis we present a series of design guidelines: we suggest that wrist-worn devices should be designed for non-focal attention, supply the user with contextual information, accommodate glance based interactions and consider the user’s body pose. &#xd;
Implementing these guidelines, we built DisplaySkin, a wrist-worn, pose aware device. DisplaySkin features a large flexible electrophoretic display and advanced sensing capabilities, allowing it to orient content towards the users face, independently of their body-pose. This design approach takes both new technological opportunities, as well as the cultural history of the wristwatch into account.  &#xd;
To evaluate DisplaySkin, we conducted two experimental studies. The first study investigates the effects of display size on a scrolling task, demonstrating that, even if the input area is kept constant, users are able to complete tasks faster using a larger display. In our second experiment we investigate the pose-aware display, demonstrating that using a pose-aware display improves reaction times when acknowledging notifications on a wrist-worn display.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Economics) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-06 17:52:10.206</description>
   <description>This thesis contains three essays spanning the fields of econometrics and the economics of education. The first is a methodological essay wherein I propose a solution to the test score measurement problem. Test scores that measure the same skill or trait are often scaled differently. I propose a statistical methodology to express test scores in a standard format to make them comparable across different tests. While other methods to standardize scores exist, the method I develop avoids several statistical pitfalls that commonly befall other procedures. The second chapter is an applied paper examining the question of whether academic achievement increases when students are the same race as their teacher. I pay particular attention to the effects of same-race teachers on academic achievement in both the short and medium run. Using a model that takes into account past school inputs, I find positive effects of racial matching on student achievement; moreover, these benefits persist with time. The third is a methodological piece that develops a technique to answer the question of whether one can be confident that a statistical estimate of something such as a mean or a regression parameter estimate lies between two points. The procedure has desirable statistical properties, and is ideally suited for use when testing for the existence of zero or near-zero effects.</description>

   <description>This study explores the use of technology for social justice education in one case, TakingITGlobal (TIG). Framed by the theoretical work of Paulo Freire, the principles of social justice education and empowerment theory this study explores youth empowerment and engagement in TIG’s on-line platform. TIG’s program model has a clearly stated mandate to leverage technology use for social justice education and action and connects youth engagement in social justice issues to a structured framework that provides resources, opportunities for action and possibilities for connecting with an active community. While much has been written on the use of social media in supporting social justice, little work has been done around the use of social media within an explicit social justice education framework. Data were collected in the form of documents from the TIG website, an interview with a senior staff member and documents written by TIG youth members in which they self-reported their experiences using the TIG platform. Findings from the case study demonstrated that the primary focus of technology use in the platform was to facilitate the development of awareness and issue understanding, connect engaged individuals to networks and empower them to engage in sustainable and meaningful action. TIG pedagogy adhered to the principles of social justice education and demonstrated the technology-embedded practices that support the transformative use of technology. The findings indicate that TIG expressed a clear intention to use technology to support social justice education and action and that TIG’s social justice education program and technology use interacted to support participants’ feelings of empowerment and development of praxis. Participants consistently identified their experience using the technology and platform as having a positive impact on their feelings of empowerment, their engagement in social justice, and their capacity to achieve their social justice goals. Considering the evidence regarding the conditions necessary for transformative use of technology it would appear that more research should occur around the transformative potential of technology used explicitly for social justice within a pedagogic approach that adheres to the essential elements of social justice education. &#xd;

   <description>Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the family of neurotrophins and binds to the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor. Like other neurotrophic factors, BDNF is involved in the development and differentiation of neurons. Recently, studies have suggested important roles for BDNF in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is critical for normal energy balance contains high levels of both BDNF and TrkB mRNA. Studies have shown that microinjections of BDNF into the PVN increase energy expenditure, suggesting BDNF plays a role in energy homeostasis through direct actions in this hypothalamic nucleus.&#xd;
We used male Sprague-Dawley rats to perform whole-cell current-clamp experiments from PVN neurons in slice preparation. BDNF was bath applied at a concentration of 2nM and caused depolarizations in 54% of neurons (n = 25; mean change in membrane potential: 8.9 ± 1.2 mV), hyperpolarizations in 23% (n = 11; mean change in membrane potential: -6.7 ± 1.4 mV), while the remaining cells tested were unaffected. Previous studies showing effects of BDNF on γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) mediated neurotransmission in PVN led us to examine if these BDNF-mediated changes in membrane potential were maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) sodium channel blocker (N = 9; 56% depolarized, 22% hyperpolarized, 22% non-responders) and bicuculline (GABAA antagonist) (N = 12; 42% depolarized, 17% hyperpolarized, 41% non-responders), supporting the conclusion that these effects on membrane potential were postsynaptic.&#xd;
We also evaluated the effects of BDNF on these neurons across varying physiologically relevant extracellular glucose concentrations. At 10 mM 23% (n = 11; mean: -6.7 ± 1.4 mV) of PVN neurons hyperpolarized in response to BDNF treatment, whereas at 0.2 mM glucose, 71% showed hyperpolarizing effects (n = 12; mean: -6.3 ± 2.8 mV). &#xd;
Our findings reveal that BDNF has direct impacts on PVN neurons and that these neurons are capable of integrating multiple sources of metabolically relevant input. Our analysis regarding glucose concentrations and their effects on these neurons’ response to other metabolic signals emphasizes the importance of using physiologically relevant conditions for study of central pathways involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis.</description>

   <description>In the current research, the annular swirling flow in a short subsonic air-air ejector that can be found in helicopters, fixed wing aircrafts, ships and other applications was investigated experimentally and numerically under different inlet flow conditions and geometric parameters. These ejectors are attached to the exhaust systems of gas turbine engines. A key phenomenon studied was the large wake that appears downstream of the primary nozzle of the ejector system. This phenomenon is typically called core separation in the industry. The effects of the core separation on the ejector performance parameters were also studied. &#xd;
	It was found experimentally that severe core separation took place for swirl angles greater than 20 degrees. This core separation leads to severe distortion in the exit velocity and temperature profile. The core separation also changed the pressure recovery along the device axis and this leads to a rebalancing of the pumping at the mixing tube inlet and entraining diffuser. This affected overall ejector pumping, back pressure and film cooling effectiveness. &#xd;
Numerical studies were carried out using two-equation turbulence models that were available in ANSYS Fluent. In a series of CFD simulations, the measured flow parameters in the annulus were used as CFD inlet boundary conditions (AIBC). In another series of CFD simulations, the measured flow parameters at the nozzle exit were applied as CFD inlet boundary conditions (NEBC). &#xd;
With applying both the AIBC and NEBC using cold and hot inlet flow conditions with swirl angles &lt; 20o, the RNG k-ε turbulence model showed superiority over the other turbulence models and a useful tool for effectively designing such devices particularly with applying the NEBC. At higher swirl angles the CFD did not accurately predict the strong changes in pressure recovery of such devices. &#xd;
	In the current study, detailed performance data of air-air ejectors including the core separation phenomenon were generated. The understanding of the impact of core separation on such devices was improved. Deficiencies of the two-equation turbulence models in predicting the core separation in the ejector devices were identified. The effects of the swirl strength and other parameters on the ejector performance criteria were evaluated.</description>

   <description>Background: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a condition causing focal neurological deficits lasting less than 24hrs. TIA patients present similarly to other conditions with rapid onset of neurological symptoms such as migraine. The accurate diagnosis of TIA is critical because it serves as a warning for subsequent stroke. Furthermore, cognitive deficit associated with TIA may predict the development of dementia. Therefore, characterizing the cognitive symptoms of TIA patients and discriminating these patients from those with similar symptoms is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. Currently the diagnosis of TIA is made on clinical and radiographic evidence. Robotic assessment, with instruments such as the KINARM, may improve the identification of cognitive impairment in TIA patients. &#xd;
Methods: In this prospective cohort study, two KINARM tests, trail making task (TMT) and spatial span task (SST), were used to detect cognitive deficits. Two study groups were made. The TIA group was tested at 5 time points over the span of a year. The migraine active control group had one initial visit and another a year later. Both of these groups were compared to a normative database of approximately 400 healthy volunteers. From this database age and sex matched normative data was used to calculate Z-scores for the TMT. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was also administered to both groups. &#xd;
Results: 31 participants were recruited, 20 TIA group and 11 active controls (mean ± SD age= 66 ± 11.3 and 62 ± 14.5). There was no significant difference in TIA and active control group MoCA scores. The TMT was able to detect cognitive impairment in TIA and migraine group. Also, both KINARM tasks could detect significant differences in performance between TIA and migraine patients while the MoCA could not. Changes in TIA and migraine performance on the MoCA, TMT, and SST were observed.  &#xd;
Conclusions: The robotic KINARM exoskeleton can be used to assess cognitive deficits in TIA patients.</description>

   <description>This thesis is an exploration of different manifestations of the struggle to determine the place of health and medicine in the international diplomatic and institutional landscape during early years of the Cold War. Relying on analysis of archival material and a survey of contemporary medical literature, this thesis makes a contribution to the literatures on international health arrangements, the interplay between domestic and global policy issues, and the evolution of a humanitarian impulse within certain corners of the medical profession. The actors and organizations profiled here grappled with questions related to whether the medical profession could lead the international system to a higher moral plane through the intrinsically apolitical nature of the pursuance of health, or whether medicine and its inherent power relationships could ever escape politics. In their efforts to enshrine health and medicine within the international system, physicians and other health professionals pursued a course that was as pragmatic as any in the idealistic context of the postwar period, but they also demonstrated a philosophy and outlook that fit with the grand visions that dominated plans of the period. As medical professionals looked beyond their borders to address issues with global repercussions, they nonetheless brought their national paradigms, circumstances and preconceptions to their efforts. This thesis therefore casts a lens on the dynamic interplay between national and international efforts to apply the spirit of medicine to concerns ranging from cancer control to the prevention of war. It also explores the manner in which physicians sought to organize themselves on an international basis to exchange valuable expertise about issues affecting their profession domestically.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-10 16:50:37.719</description>
   <description>In this thesis, using Methanococcus maripaludis as a model organism, significant, novel advances have been made to the understanding of the archaeal N-glycosylation pathway as well as archaella regulation and assembly. The archaellum is the swimming organelle in the third domain of life, the Archaea. Genes involved in archaellation are mainly clustered in the fla operon. The structural proteins of archaella, termed archaellins, are usually glycoproteins modified with N-glycans. In M. maripaludis, a euryarchaeon, all three archaellins FlaB1, FlaB2 and FlaB3 are modified at multiple sites with an N-linked tetrasaccharide with the structure Sug-1,4-β-ManNAc3NAmA6Thr-1,4-β-GlcNAc3NAcA-1,3-β-GalNAc, where Sug is a unique sugar (5S)-2-acetamido-2,4-dideoxy-5-O-methyl-L-erythro-hexos-5-ulo-1,5-pyranose exclusively found in this species. Using FlaB2 as a reporter protein, I genetically identified three novel genes, aglU, aglV and aglW, which are involved in the synthesis of the archaellin N-glycan. AglU, a putative threonine transferase, is thought to be responsible for the transfer of the threonine onto the third sugar residue in the N-glycan. AlgV and AglW, annotated as a methyltransferase and a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, respectively, are involved in the biosynthesis of the unique terminal sugar. &#xd;
Since it has been shown that disruption of the N-glycosylation pathway caused defects in archaella assembly or function, I explored the specific requirement of N-glycosylation of archaellins on archaellation by eliminating the four N-glycosylation sites in FlaB2 in all possible combinations. As many as three N-glycosylation sites could be removed from FlaB2 without interfering with archaella assembly or function. However, archaella could not be assembled when all four N-glycosylation sites in FlaB2 are eliminated. &#xd;
While there is evidence that archaella synthesis in M. maripaludis is not constitutive, no transcriptional regulators had been identified for the fla operon in any euryarchaeon. I genetically identified and characterized ArnE as the first euryarchaeotic transcriptional activator of the fla operon. Deletion of arnE resulted in the cessation of the transcription and translation of the reporter gene flaB2 and translation of FlaB2 was restored when the mutant was complemented with arnE in trans. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the specific binding of purified ArnE to DNA fragments from the fla promoter.</description>

   <description>The Fes protein tyrosine kinase is abundantly expressed in phagocytic immune cells, including&#xd;
tumor associated macrophages. Fes knockout mice (fes-/-) display enhanced sensitivity to LPS,&#xd;
and this was shown to be associated with increased NF-κB signaling and TNFα production from&#xd;
fes-/- macrophages. Interestingly, tumor onset in the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-Neu)&#xd;
transgenic mouse model of breast cancer is significantly delayed in fes-/- mice, and this was&#xd;
associated with increased frequency of CD11b+ myeloid and CD3+ T cells in the premalignant&#xd;
mammary glands. Recent studies have also implicated Fes in cross-talk between MHC-I and the&#xd;
NF-κB and IRF-3 pathways in macrophages. Signal 3, the production of inflammatory cytokines&#xd;
and Type I interferons downstream of NF-κB and IRF-3 pathways in antigen presenting cells, is&#xd;
considered an important component of T-cell activation, after engagement of T cell receptor by&#xd;
MHC presented antigen (Signal 1) and co-receptors by their ligands (Signal 2).&#xd;
Using a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of immune activation, I&#xd;
show that LPS stimulated fes-/- macrophages promote more robust activation of LCMV antigenspecific&#xd;
CD8+ T cells than wild type macrophages (fes+/+). Furthermore, LPS stimulated fes-/-&#xd;
macrophages showed increased phosphorylation of NF-B and IRF-3. I also showed that Fes colocalizes&#xd;
with MHC-I in dynamic vesicular structures within macrophages. These observations&#xd;
are consistent with a model where Fes regulates Signal 3 in antigen presenting cells through roles&#xd;
in cross-talk between MHC-I and the NF-kB and IRF-3 signaling pathways. This suggests that&#xd;

   <description>The growing demand for video streaming is straining the current Internet, and mandating a novel approach to future Internet paradigms. The advent of Information-Centric Networks (ICN) promises a novel architecture for addressing this exponential growth in data-intensive services, of which video streaming is projected to dominate (in traffic size). In this thesis, I present a novel strategy in ICN for adaptive caching of variable video contents tailored to different sizes and bit rates. My objective is to achieve optimal video caching to reduce access time for the maximal requested bit rate for every user. At its core, my approach capitalizes on a rigorous delay analysis and potentiates maximal serviceability for each user. I incorporate predictors for requested video objects based on a popularity index (Zipf distribution). In my proposed model, named DASCache, I present queuing analysis for Round-Trip Time (RTT) of cached objects, providing a cap on expected delay in accessing video content. In DASCache, I present a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) formulation for the cache assignment problem, which operates in rounds based on changes in content requests and popularity scores. DASCache reacts to changes in network dynamics that impact bit rate choices by heterogeneous users and enables users to stream videos, maximizing Quality of Experience (QoE).  To evaluate the performance of DASCache, in contrast to current benchmarks in video caching, I present an elaborate performance evaluation carried out on ndnSIM, over NS-3.</description>

   <description>At sufficiently high Reynolds number, all surfaces are rough, and roughness affects most flows in engineering and the natural sciences. Examples range from atmospheric boundary layers over buildings and canopies, to engineering surfaces with erosion, deposits, etc. To study the roughness effects, we take a high-resolution approach to capture the flow around individual roughness elements using direct and large-eddy simulations (DNS and LES); the goal is to elucidate phenomena which have been difficult to access using physical experiments, and to help develop engineering correlations and models. First, most experiments and turbulence models are based on a standardized type of roughness, sand-grain roughness, which can be described using a single length scale. The relationship between the geometry of an arbitrary surface and the canonical one must be known, to predict critical flow parameters such as the drag, using either experimental correlations or turbulence models. Using numerical experiments, we relate this length-scale to the roughness geometry, and propose a guideline for its prediction in the industrial setting. Next, to explain the dependence of drag on the topographical details, we examine the role of the wake of the roughness elements in the drag generation of a rough surface. The wake field is found to promote vertical momentum transfer and near-wall instability; it might provide a link between geometry details and the engineering modeling of roughness effects. Lastly, we focus on a more realistic flow scenario -- the one with freestream accelerations -- and study the combined effects of roughness and  acceleration, a phenomenon widely present in engineering flows over airfoils or complex landscapes. It is first shown, by comparing equilibrium accelerating flows  obtained in the present  study with the non-equilibrium flows in the literature, that the roughness and acceleration effects are interdependent and depend on the flow equilibrity.  Then, using DNS data of a spatially developing flat-plate boundary layer, it is found that the effect coupling develops as the  roughness affects the turbulence time scale and thus the flow susceptibility of the acceleration stabilization, while acceleration changes the wake velocity and ultimately the roughness destabilization level.</description>

   <description>The herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is an important human pathogen that is the main cause of genital herpes infections and has a significant and wide-ranging impact on human health. HSV-2 infections are one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases and are highly prevalent worldwide, thus making understanding their infection mechanisms all the more relevant. The UL21 gene, which is conserved amongst members of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, encodes a tegument protein that is essential for HSV-2 propagation. More specifically, UL21 plays a critical role in the primary envelopment of capsids during nuclear egress, however the precise mechanism by which it does this is unclear. To investigate the role of UL21 in HSV-2 nuclear egress, we focused on events upstream of primary envelopment. First, we examined the role of UL21 in disrupting the localization of nuclear lamins during infection. Nuclear rim localization of lamins A, C, B1, and B2 was indistinguishable between the wild-type (WT), UL21 null (∆UL21), or repaired (∆UL21R) HSV-2 strains, suggesting UL21 is not implicated in the disassembly of nuclear lamins at the nuclear membrane. Additionally, UL21 did not influence the localization of the nuclear egress complex (NEC), composed of UL31 and UL34, insofar as cellular and virally-encoded UL31 and UL34 localization patterns were indistinguishable between the UL21 null, and repaired or wild-type strains. Lastly, in an attempt to characterize interacting partners for UL21, we focused on proteins implicated in nuclear egress or proteins that may function to recruit UL21 to the nuclear membrane, where it may carry out its essential role(s). While no interactions were detected between UL21 and key mediators of primary envelopment including UL31, UL34, or Us3, UL21 localization at the nuclear rim was enhanced by the overexpression of the inner nuclear membrane protein, LAP2β, suggesting a potential interaction between the two proteins. However, more experiments are warranted before any conclusive remarks can be made regarding such interaction. Taken together, these data have shed light on HSV-2 nuclear egress and have eliminated possible theories regarding the role of UL21 in HSV-2 primary envelopment.</description>

   <description>Background: Many parents of hospitalized children use the Internet to look for health information regarding their child’s condition. Due to the unregulated nature and unreliable quality of online health information this important problem focused coping strategy may be influenced by person characteristics such as eHealth literacy self-efficacy. Unfortunately, research focusing on online health information seeking as a coping behaviour is limited. This study sought to fill this gap and expand research in this area. The purpose of this study was to explore how eHealth literacy self-efficacy contributes to online health information seeking amongst parents of hospitalized children and, ultimately, how it contributes to problem focused coping strategies and coping outcomes of parents when their children are hospitalized. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to test the hypotheses with a sample of 61 parents of paediatric inpatients in a single paediatric unit in Southeastern Ontario. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire including demographics, Internet use, eHEALS, Brief COPE, and Psychological Well-being Index. Results: The results demonstrated that eHealth literacy self-efficacy contributes positively to online health information seeking amongst parents of hospitalized children. Older age was found to contribute to decreased use of the Internet to seek health information amongst parents. Personal characteristics (length of stay and income) were found to make significant contributions to problem-focused coping behaviours whereas eHealth literacy self-efficacy and online health information seeking were not. Furthermore, problem-focused coping behaviour was found to contribute positively while length of hospital stay was found to contribute negatively to coping outcome (emotional state) of parents of hospitalized children. It is hoped that findings from this thesis will provide useful insight into coping and information seeking amongst parents of paediatric patients in the digital age.</description>

   <description>Advancements in and adoption of consumer virtual reality are currently being propelled by numerous upcoming devices such as the Oculus Rift. Although applications are currently growing around the entertainment field, wide-spread adoption of virtual reality devices opens up the potential for other applications that may have been unfeasible with past implementations of virtual reality. A virtual reality environment may provide an equal or larger screen area than what is provided with the use of multiple conventional displays while remaining comparatively cheaper and more portable. &#xd;
&#xd;
A virtual reality application for the viewing of multiple image slices was designed using: the Oculus Rift head-mounted display, Unity, and 3D Slicer. Volumes loaded within 3D Slicer are sent to a Unity application that proceeds to render a scene for the Oculus Rift head-mounted display. Users may interact with the images adjusting windowing and leveling using a handheld gamepad controller. Multiple images may be brought closer to the user for detailed inspection.&#xd;
&#xd;
Application usage was demonstrated with the simultaneous visualization of concurrent slices of a serial CT scan of a patient with a lung nodule. Also demonstrated was the studying of multiple-sclerosis lesion evolution by visualization of a large time-series MRI dataset. Experiments for validating usage of the virtual reality system for differential diagnosis and remote collaboration were performed.</description>

   <description>Suicide and self-mutilation are widespread societal issues, making them an important area of research. The interpersonal theory of suicide (ITS) and Shneidman’s theory of psychache have each garnered substantial support in suicide research; however, to date, there have been no studies that combine the theories in hopes of creating a better model of suicide. There has also been very limited research that has applied these theories to self-mutilation, a behaviour highly correlated with suicide. It is expected that these two theories are compatible given that they both focus on unmet needs which create an undesirable state, and they both suggest that an additional factor is necessary for unmet needs to create suicidality. The current research also contributes theoretically to the literature by investigating previously unexplored possible antecedents to suicide and self-mutilation, namely adverse childhood experiences and early maladaptive schemas (unmet needs from childhood that influence an individual’s interpretation of the world). Data were collected from two distinct populations: 428 university undergraduates and a community sample of 533 individuals. Participants completed questionnaires assessing the criterion measures of self-mutilation and suicidality and the psychological predictors of psychache, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability for suicide. Analyses revealed that, for both the university and community samples, the ITS model (interaction of thwarted belonging, perceived burdensomeness and acquired capability) and psychache each added unique variance to the prediction of suicide ideation, motivation, preparation, and non-suicidal self-injury. A combined model, however, was not better able to predict a past suicide attempt. Further, contrary to expectation, the ITS-self-harm relationship was not mediated by psychache. Explanations for these findings are provided. Overall, these results provide important theoretical and practical contributions to the literature suggesting the utility of a new, blended model of suicide. Limitations and future directions are discussed.</description>

   <description>In Mombasa, Kenya government officials, public figures, NGOs and wananchis (civil society) often decry the presence of street children, viewing them as both criminal and therefore as in need of discipline and reform, and as limited rights-bearing citizens deserving of education and a ‘work-free’ childhood. To address this social concern, charitable children’s institutions (CCIs), operating under the Children’s Act (2010) are granted authority by the Government of Kenya to remove and relocate children from urban spaces by institutionalizing them under the premise of ‘rehabilitation’. Despite widespread critique, the practice of institutionalizing street-connected girls in Mombasa, Kenya remains common, with few studies examining the longitudinal and gendered effects of such schemes within the current era of rights-based ‘development’. With attention to spatial, historical and sociopolitical specificity, I explore the complex, shifting and historically-situated relationship between the Wema Centre and the women who, as street-connected young girls, became the targets of ‘rehabilitation’ schemes aimed at their own transformation. Situating such programmes contextually within colonial histories of power, I use Foucault’s concept of ‘disciplinary power’ (1979) to unpack the aims and practices of the Wema Centre’s ‘rehabilitation’ scheme to analyze how and through what means the Centre desires to transform street-connected girls. In reflecting on their experiences of institutionalization, ‘graduates’, who have spent on average 11.2 years of their lives institutionalized, recognize various ways in which they have benefited from the CCI’s intervention. However, in being confronted with significant challenges that ‘rehabilitation’ does not address, they also articulate strong demands for change to the ways in which the Wema Centre operates, while continuing to devise their own strategies of managing the difficulties they face on the “outside” and upon exiting care. In this thesis, I draw together my findings in a way that presents the Wema Centre’s ‘rehabilitation’ scheme as it both: 1) trains street-connected girls in gendered, useful ways in order to create ‘ideal’ Kenyan women necessary to sustaining the social reproduction of the conditions of production within neoliberal patriarchal capitalism, and 2) depoliticizes the conditions in which poverty arises by leaving political-economic questions unexamined, allowing the Wema Centre to sustain itself within the development apparatus.</description>

   <description>Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of a group-based, psychoeducational and behavioural modification intervention, Overcoming Stigma in Mood and Anxiety Disorders, to reduce the impact of mental-illness-related stigma. &#xd;
Methods. This pretest-posttest design measured changes to various psychosocial impacts of stigma for participants with Mood and/or Anxiety Disorders using a modified 12-item Stigma Impact Scale from the Inventory of Stigma Experiences. &#xd;
Results. Participants of the Overcoming Stigma in Mood and Anxiety Disorders intervention reported a significant decrease to five of the twelve stigma impact items, including self-esteem, social contacts, personal goals, family relationships and physical health. &#xd;
Conclusion. The results of this study are encouraging. A multicentre, three-armed randomized control trial is recommended to test the efficacy of the intervention with control groups. This is another important step towards developing evidence-based interventions to overcome self-stigma and manage social stigma to have a full and meaningful life.</description>

   <description>Freshwater invasive species, especially invertebrates are an important environmental stressor associated with significant ecological and economic impacts particularly in the Great Lakes, one of the freshwater ecosystems with a significant number of invasive invertebrates compared to other taxa. Because of the importance that policy development and implantation play in managing invasive species for their effective prevention and spread, a policy analysis of the proposed Ontario’s Bill 37 (“An Act respecting Invasive Species”) was conducted based on an extensive literature review, the interview responses with provincial government officials, and the results from the constructed non-native species checklist. A total of 46 species were identified as having a high impact on the environment, according to the literature, among 409 species identified as recorded as non-native anywhere including native species to North America.  Research attention seems to have been concentrated on high impact species despite they only represent 11.2% of the total species as well as on their main associated pathways, such as the ballast water and sediment of transoceanic and domestic ships in the Great Lakes. Particularly, research efforts are concentrated on only 16 invasive species, which are already established in the Great Lakes. Almost half of the high-impact species identified have not yet been introduced into Ontario’s freshwater ecosystems, representing a potential threat. Therefore, the implementation of Ontario’s Bill 37 is crucial for the effective prevention of the introduction and spread of invasive species in Ontario, particularly for aquatic invertebrates, however there are issues that need to be addressed before the implementation of the proposed legislation.</description>

   <description>Participatory research (PR) is the co-creation of new knowledge by researchers working in equitable partnerships with those affected by the issue under study or those who will benefit from or ultimately act on its results. A core driver of PR is the self-determination of stakeholders who intend to improve their lives, health or practice through active involvement in creating the evidence they need for action. In order to foster self-determination, PR utilises strategies intended to create community ownership over the research process, particularly when the research idea originates from outside the community. However, little is understood about the range of strategies employed or how community stakeholders perceive their utility in fostering ownership. This dissertation asks the question, what processes and strategies foster engagement within a participatory project, and how have these contributed to community ownership and self-determination over the research process? First, a systematic review was undertaken to synthesise best-practice participatory engagement strategies as employed by leading PR practitioners (manuscript 1). Then using social network techniques, we examined an active community-based participatory research project to ask, how do influence and decision-making evolve over the course of a participatory project as the project is developed and matures (manuscript 2)? A further set of network measures was applied in a longitudinal analysis to reveal changes in network structure, significance of change in actor roles, and demonstrate sustainability of change in ownership once the original non-community champion stepped aside (manuscript 3). Finally, through a qualitative case study using the participants from the same study, we explored what strategies were employed within the partnership to assure ownership and control by the community partners; and from the point of view of these participants, how responsible were these strategies for fostering the change in influence observed in the network analysis (manuscript 4)? Results show the dynamics of how community ownership emerged over the course of the PR project, and how stakeholders perceived engagement strategies to have fostered this change. Findings have implications for building community ownership and self-determination, while at the same time advancing methodological understanding of social network analysis for studying community partnerships.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-21 21:09:34.113</description>
   <description>Context: According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), approximately 40,000 immigrant students enter into the Canadian public school system each year; of those students, 80% are non-English speaking and 90% will attend schools in Montreal, Toronto, or Vancouver (OECD, 2011). As a result of this level of immigration, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is one of the most richly diverse communities in the world. While visible minorities account for 20.6% of the total Canadian population, 46% of the GTA are visible minorities (Statistics Canada, 2014). Diversity is also increasing in relation to religion, language, and Aboriginal peoples, as well as same-sex marriages (Statistics Canada, 2014).&#xd;
Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore how in-service teachers’ identities impacts their practice in diverse urban classrooms, as well as to identify what types of professional development and school initiatives, if any, are occurring to address equity issues. &#xd;
Method: The conceptual framework for this study views equitable reform across the following three levels: the macro/institutional (school structure), micro/personal (teacher identity), and meso/instructional (practices). Six one-hour, semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers who are currently working in diverse urban communities in the GTA. Data were first coded deductively to explore the extent to which the data were consistent with variables arising from the literature and the conceptual framework. Following deductive coding analysis, inductive coding was used to interpret concepts and themes arising from the raw data that were not represented in the conceptual framework.&#xd;
Results: The findings suggest that, by validating and honouring diverse student identities and experiences, teachers can tackle equity issues in the classroom through culturally responsive practices that place the student at the center of the learning experience. If the goal of equitable reform initiatives is to transform the learning outcomes for minoritized groups, then teachers need to be supported in their endeavours to create transformative learning spaces that engage students in their own learning in authentic ways and also challenge social inequities both inside and outside the classroom.</description>

   <title>Improving Code Search Using Learning-to-Rank and Query Reformulation Techniques</title>

   <subject>Code Search</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-23 16:44:28.655</description>
   <description>During the process of software development, developers often encounter unfamiliar&#xd;
programming tasks. Online Q&amp;A forums, such as StackOverflow, are one of the&#xd;
resources that developers can ask for answers to their programming questions. Automatic recommendation of a working code example can be helpful to solve developers’ programming questions. However, existing code search engines support mainly&#xd;
keyword-based queries, and do not accomodate well natural-language code search&#xd;
queries. Specifically, natural-language queries contain less technical keywords, i.e.,&#xd;
class or method names, which negatively affects the success of the code search process&#xd;
of existing code search engines. On the other hand, a code search engine requires a&#xd;
ranking schema to place relevant code examples at the top of the result list. However, existing ranking schemas are hand-crafted heuristics where the configurations&#xd;
are hard to determine, which leads to the difficulty in using them for new languages&#xd;
or frameworks.&#xd;
In this paper, we propose the approach which uses query reformulation techniques to improve the search effectiveness of existing code search engines for naturallanguage queries. The approach automatically reformulate natural-language queries&#xd;
using class-names with semantic relations. We also propose an approach to automatically train a ranking schema for the code example search using the learning-to-rank technique. We evaluate the proposed approaches using a large-scale corpus of code examples. The evaluation results show that our approaches can effectively recommend&#xd;
semantically related class-names to reformulate natural-language queries, and the improvement on the search effectiveness over existing query reformulation approaches&#xd;
is statistically significant. The automatically trained ranking schema can effectively&#xd;
rank code examples, and outperform the existing ranking schemas by 35.65% and&#xd;
48.42% in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and expected&#xd;
reciprocal rank (ERR), respectively.</description>

   <description>Micro Electro Mechanical Systems as well as Microfluidics are versatile technologies which have been evolved due to the advantage of miniaturization over the last decades. However, the majority of microfluidic devices are still powered by macroscale power supplies. Here, interconnection problems, unwanted electronic interactions (noise), and difficulties in controlling the power delivered are some of the problems which can arise. One possible approach to ease such difficulties is through the use of integrated (embedded) power sources. This thesis is focused on the development and characterization of a nickel/metal hydride microbattery on a glass substrate which can be easily integrated during the regular microfabrication process of the microfluidic device.&#xd;
Glass or glass-like materials, such as silicon dioxide, are often used as substrates for microfluidic chips. Hence, we pursue a two-dimensional approach in that we fabricate thin films of electroactive materials on glass wafers using microfabrication techniques which are common in semiconductor (electronics) industries. A tailored polymeric layer is placed between the two electrodes to serve as an electrolyte reservoir and electrode separator in a sandwich-like structure which mimics a typical microfluidic chip design.&#xd;
The microfabricated electrodes are investigated in terms of material characterization and electrochemical performance. In detail, we use x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectroscopy, and profilometry to study the materials properties as well as the surface morphologies. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge characterization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are performed to gain insights into the electrochemical performance of the single nickel electrode and of the single metal hydride electrode. This is also accompanied by a mathematical derivation and evaluation of electrolytic and gas sorption models of the metal hydride electrode.&#xd;
Finally, the performance of the microbattery is investigated using charge-discharge, voltage-current, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements.</description>

   <description>Background: Previous research has found links between olfactory deficits and depression. Olfactory ability is restored with successful treatment with antidepressant medication. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are two effective treatments for depression. It is not known whether these somatic treatments may, similarly to pharmacotherapy, restore olfactory sensitivity and identification ability in individuals with depression.&#xd;
Objectives: The objective of the present study was to determine whether treatment with ECT or rTMS is associated with improvement in olfactory sensitivity or identification in individuals with depression.&#xd;
Methods: Six patients receiving ECT and three patients receiving rTMS completed the study. Before beginning treatment and 20-30 days after their first treatment, patients were assessed using the Smell Threshold Test (STT), Smell Identification Test (SIT), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHPS). The control group consisted of nine matched healthy participants.&#xd;
Results: There was no significant difference between the ECT, rTMS, and control groups for olfactory sensitivity either before or after treatment. At both testing visits, the rTMS group performed significantly worse on olfactory identification compared to control, while the ECT group performed comparably to control. Olfactory identification ability was significantly correlated with HDRS score at baseline but not after treatment. Olfactory performance was not correlated with BDI or SHPS score.&#xd;
Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that individuals with depression may not have decreased olfactory sensitivity ability compared to healthy controls. However, in those who do exhibit poor olfactory identification, rTMS may be effective in restoring sense of smell. Further research is needed to determine whether olfactory deficits are caused by depressive symptoms, and whether ECT may also restore olfaction in individuals who have olfactory deficits. Determining the links between olfaction and depression may be important for promoting the early diagnosis and treatment of depression, and for improving quality of life and everyday functioning.</description>

   <description>Competency-based training models in surgical education challenge programs to adequately document and assess trainees’ clinical decision-making, problem solving, and procedural skills in the operating room. While a variety of tools for the assessment of procedural skills exist, validated intraoperative assessment tools are scarce. Those that have been validated often employ checklists or numerical rating scales, which are prone to bias and provide limited feedback to residents. The Surgical Procedure Feedback Rubric (SPR) was developed by the Department of Surgery at Queen’s University to document the quality of resident performance during a single, directly observed operative encounter and provide targeted feedback to support learning. It differs from other assessment tools because it defines performance criteria by increasing complexity through the use of behavioural anchors, thus embedding standards of performance in the tool.&#xd;
This study begins the process of building a validity argument for the SPR. Validity in educational assessment is an evaluation of the appropriateness of inferences made with the use of an assessment tool. Kane and Stobart’s validity frameworks guided this study. The purpose of this study was to examine the inference that the SPR is able to distinguish between the intraoperative performances of different levels of learners.&#xd;
A 14-month observational study was conducted in the General Surgery, Orthopaedic and Obstetrics and Gynecology training programs. Document analysis of the SPR provided evidence that the SPR was being used as intended. Exploratory factor analysis identified a 3-factor structure of the SPR consisting of Operating Room Preparation, Technical Skills and Intrinsic Competencies. Three-way (PGY x Program x Role) ANOVA confirmed the results of factor analysis, showed the utility of the SPR in discriminating between residents by postgraduate training year (PGY), and provided evidence for partial transferability of the SPR between programs and different roles in surgery. These results contributed to evidence to support scoring, generalizability and extrapolations inferences in the validity argument of the SPR. &#xd;
In addition to supporting the validity argument for the SPR itself, results of this study provide evidence for the use of rubric-based assessment tools to support competency-based assessment systems in medical education.</description>

   <title>Extending Learning Through Service:  Practical Strategies for Designing Meaningful Service-Learning  Opportunities</title>
   <creator>Buswa, Desta</creator>
   <subject>Service-learning, aboriginal, professional development, secondary school, medicine wheel</subject>
   <description>Service-learning has historical roots within the education system that have been maintained to present day models, which are implemented worldwide from elementary to post-secondary studies.  The goal of service-learning is simple yet complex, as it takes on various forms and levels of application.  However, the common denominator is that service leads to learning.  The layers and depths of learning are uniquely discovered through the personal responses of local needs that are addressed through a call to action.  The purpose of service-learning has developed over time, from providing post-secondary students an opportunity to interact with a wider segment of society to precise, strategic execution of curriculum expectations being met through application based learning.  Types of service-learning opportunities range from one-time volunteer experiences, such as peer tutoring between college and high school students, to feeding the hungry through various campaigns.  The results of service-learning have been recognized for creating awareness, fostering empathy, promoting civic engagement, and improving student success.  Service-learning has a richer documented basis within American literature in comparison to Canadian references, however, the overall research in this field is lacking.</description>

   <description>Optimal zero-delay coding of a finite state Markov source through quantization is considered. Building on previous literature, the existence and structure of optimal policies are studied using a stochastic control problem formulation. In the literature, the optimality of deterministic Markov coding policies (or Walrand-Varaiya type policies) for infinite horizon problems has been established. This work expands on this result for systems with finite source alphabets, proving the optimality of de- terministic and stationary Markov coding policies for the infinite horizon setup. In addition, the ε-optimality of finite memory quantizers is established and the depen- dence between the memory length and ε is quantified. An algorithm to find the optimal policy for the finite time horizon problem is presented. Numerical results produced using this algorithm are shown.</description>

   <description>Our understanding of treatment for psychotic disorders has improved considerably over the last 20 years. One area that has received international attention is the importance of early intervention for psychosis. Research suggests that family support promotes recovery and is a key component of any successful early intervention program. However, very little is known about familial interaction patterns in families that are coping with the unexpected onset of a psychotic illness and the factors that help to foster adaptive family functioning during this challenging time. The purpose of this study was to understand the individual, caregiver, and family factors that are associated with healthy and adaptive family functioning in early episode psychosis and to explore differences in family interaction patterns between families with an individual with psychosis and healthy control families. This study employed two methodologies: (1) an online caregiver survey that examined relationships among various caregiver and family system variables such as caregiver appraisals, coping strategies, quality of life, perceived helpfulness of support systems, and family functioning and (2) an experimental laboratory-based study that examined the real time affective states and dynamic flexibility of family interactions in families with an individual with early psychosis and healthy control families. The results of this project indicate that cognitive appraisals about the illness, its consequences, and one’s caregiving role are important predictors of family functioning. Specifically, greater positive caregiver appraisals were associated with better family functioning. Family members of an individual with psychosis reported more family difficulties across dimensions of cohesion and flexibility; however in the laboratory-based observation study, families with an individual with psychosis were equally flexible and diverse in their expression of affect, and had more predictable interactions compared to healthy control families. This is the first study to use state space grids to visually depict family interactions in real time, demonstrating its unique applications both for research and clinical intervention. The findings from this study have important implications for the field of early intervention in psychosis and could inform relevant treatment targets for family-based interventions.</description>

   <description>Although the magnitude of recent anthropogenic environmental change is unprecedented, humans have been leaving measurable footprints on the landscape prior to the era of industrialization. This thesis examines the long-term impacts of human activities on aquatic ecosystem by using limnological and paleolimnological approaches to examine: 1) the long-term impacts of a small oil and gas operation located in the Cameron Hills, Northwest Territories, on local aquatic ecology; and 2) the impacts of a Dorset Palaeoeskimo settlement on a nearby lake at Port au Choix, Newfoundland. In the Cameron Hills, water samples and dated sediment cores were analyzed in order to assess modern-day as well as long-term impacts of oil and gas activities on aquatic ecosystems. Both modern water chemistry and paleolimnological records provided evidence of catchment disturbance and localized acidification in lakes more closely associated with the oil and gas operations. Nonetheless, changes recorded in the sediment record suggested that recent climate warming is the dominant driver of changes in these lakes. At Port au Choix, paleolimnology was used to examine changes in aquatic ecology related to Dorset Palaeosekimo sealskin processing activities and to assess changes in the environment that might have led to the abandonment of the site at ~1180 cal BP. Concurrent elevated periods in sedimentary δ15N and chlorophyll-a concentrations provided evidence of Dorset activities.  In addition, changes in diatom assemblages were suggestive of ecological shifts related to nutrient additions, likely as a result of past seal processing activities. Analysis of nearby reference ponds provided no indication of changes in climate that might have resulted in site abandonment. Collectively, these studies demonstrate how paleolimnology can be used to increase our understanding of the impact of human activities on aquatic ecosystems in a variety of settings.</description>

   <description>Filipino workers migrating overseas have put at risk the traditional model of eldercare in the Philippines. Instead of co-residing with their aging parents or guardians, migrant workers, especially women, choose to work in Canada, typically caring for Canadian children and people in the last stages of their lives. This situation raises the question of who will care for their own parents during their final years. Existing literature addresses the effects of migrant workers leaving behind their children and spouses; however, the ramifications of worker emigration on seniors, the elderly, and the infirm have not been explored to the same extent. &#xd;
This master’s thesis addresses the gaps in the literature by providing a qualitative examination of the impact of worker migration on traditional Filipino senior care, focusing on Live-In Caregivers in Victoria, BC, Canada. Migrant workers are able to take care for their families through remittances, which in turn pay for education, health care, and an overall higher standard of living. Primary eldercare becomes a responsibility shared by all members of the family who are left behind. Caring for the elderly is thus maintained transnationally through cultural adaptation.</description>

   <description>In order for mammalian fertilization to transpire, spermatozoa must transit through the female reproductive tract and penetrate the outer investments of the oocyte: the cumulus oophorus and the zona pellucida.  In order to penetrate the oocyte, spermatozoa must undergo the acrosome reaction.  The acrosome reaction results in the exposure of the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) and proteins that coat it to the extracellular environment.  After the acrosome reaction, the IAM becomes the leading edge of spermatozoa undergoing progressive movement.  Thus the enzymes which effect lysis of the oocyte investments ought to be located on the IAM.  An objective of this study was to identify and characterize enzymatic activity detected on the IAM and provide evidence that they play a role in fertilization.  This study also describes procedures for fractionating spermatozoa and isolating the IAM and proteins on its intra- and extra-vesicular surfaces, and describes their development during male gametogenesis.  Since the IAM is exposed to the extracellular environment and oviductal milieu after the acrosome reaction, this study also sought to characterize interactions and relationships between factors in the oviductal environment and the enzymes identified on the IAM.&#xd;
The data presented provide evidence that MMP2 and acrosin are co-localized on the IAM, originate from the Golgi apparatus in gametogenesis, and suggest they cooperate in their function.  Their localization and results of in vitro fertilization suggests they have a function in zona pellucida penetration.  The data also provide evidence that plasminogen, originating from the oviductal epithelium and/or cumulus-oocyte complex, is present in the immediate environment of sperm-egg initial contact and penetration.  Additionally, plasminogen interacts with MMP2 and enhances its enzymatic action on the IAM.  The data also provide evidence that MMP2 has an important function in penetration of the cumulus oophorus.  Holistically, this thesis provides evidence that enzymes on the IAM, originating from the Golgi apparatus in development, have an important function in penetration of the outer investments of the oocyte, and are aided in penetration by plasminogen in the female reproductive tract.</description>

   <title>Brand Attachment as a Limitation on Customer Prioritization Strategies</title>

   <subject>Customer Prioritization Strategies</subject>
   <subject>Brand Attachment</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Management) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-29 14:47:42.476</description>
   <description>The marketing literature suggests that the existence of a strong customer attachment to a brand has the potential to bring increased profitability to that brand. While there is certainly the potential for positive benefits, the premise of this thesis is that there is also potential for negative outcomes, including limiting the implementation of other profit seeking strategies (such as customer prioritization strategies) for the brand. I argue that the reason for the expected detrimental effects arises because customers with strong brand attachment often develop a necessity to maintain their perceived brand-self distance, which leads them to constantly assess company actions. When a company’s actions (such as the implementation of customer prioritization strategies) result in a perceived increase in brand-self distance (feeling of being farther away from the brand) for the customer, thereby threatening his/her relationship with the brand, customers with a strong brand attachment are likely to increase their intentions to engage in not only positive behaviours for the brand as previously believed (e.g. repurchase behaviours, paying price premiums etc., Park et.al, 2013), but also neutral and negative behaviours such as retaliatory actions against the brand (by spreading negative word-of-mouth, engaging in problem solving complaining, ending brand relationship etc.) in order to restore or increase their brand-self distance. Contributions and managerial implications are further discussed.</description>

   <description>Awareness and knowledge of both engineering education programming and the engineering profession is important for students in high school because strategic course choices must be made for students to qualify for university enrolment. Strategic and informed high school course selections must be made so students will graduate with the prerequisites needed for application to a university program. This complexity may be particularly concerning for students who realize late in high school that they wish to pursue an engineering education. &#xd;
&#xd;
This research aims to provide insight into how Grade 12 students learn about post-secondary programs and career planning, and how students are supported in this learning by teachers and guidance counsellors. The students were surveyed to learn how they use resources to learn about post-secondary programs. Grade 10 Careers teachers, Grade 12 mathematics and science teachers, and guidance counsellors were interviewed on their advising experiences and their knowledge of engineering was explored. A phenomenological qualitative approach encouraged participants to describe their experiences and the meaning they associate to them.&#xd;
&#xd;
The findings show that student participants found value in the visibility of many universities and programs online, and in their interactions with resources. Teacher and guidance counsellor participants frequently associated students who presented academic strength and interest in mathematics and science, particularly physics, as those who could become engineers. These participants also described conflicting surface knowledge of engineering disciplines. Advising by teachers and guidance counsellors was found to be very focused on getting students to a post-secondary program in which they will likely succeed. While there was little discussion by the teachers and guidance counsellors in advising on the alignment between the post-secondary program and the students’ intended career path, findings from the student survey showed that students do refer to their teachers for career-related information. With the common association of strong mathematics and science student with engineering, low confidence in their engineering knowledge, and academic planning focused advising, there is little assurance that high school students currently have the knowledge needed to make an informed decision selecting an engineering education and career pathway.</description>

   <title>The role of the Fer protein-tyrosine kinase in HER2-positive breast cancer</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Pathology &amp; Molecular Medicine) -- Queen's University, 2015-07-29 20:20:56.091</description>
   <description>Fer is a member of a distinct subclass of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases with homology to a family of adaptor proteins that regulate membrane-cytoskeletal remodeling events, including receptor endocytosis. Fer has been found to promote metastasis using shRNA knockdown and mouse engraftment models of lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Interestingly, in a transgenic mouse model of HER2-positive breast cancer, mice targeted with a kinase-inactivating mutation (ferDR/DR) had delayed tumor onset, suggesting an important role for Fer activity in tumorigenesis. ferDR/DR mammary tumor epithelial cells (MTECs) from these tumors were hyper-sensitized to EGF stimulation, and this was linked to increased rates of EGFR internalization. This study identifies a role for Fer kinase activity in suppressing EGFR mitogenic signaling, as well as metastasis. In vitro experiments were conducted to validate that a rescue of Fer kinase activity in ferDR/DR MTECs suppresses EGF internalization. As this was correlated with a suppressive effect on downstream signaling and cell proliferation, this suggests that the native function of Fer is to negatively regulate transduction of EGFR signals. Next, MTECs were examined in vivo to show that Fer disruption impairs metastasis. When cells were examined in vitro, loss of Fer activity was associated with impaired cell migration and increased susceptibility to anoikis, suggesting that Fer contributes to multiple cellular processes during metastasis. Fer was also examined in a structure-function study by rescuing Fer expression in ferDR/DR MTEC cells using a panel of domain-specific mutants. We showed that Fer activity may be self-regulated by F-BAR domain activity and phosphorylation of Tyr402, as targeted mutations in these motifs impaired both Fer auto-phosphorylation and the ability of the kinase to suppress EGF-linked mitogenic signaling. Together, these results suggest that Fer plays a direct role in HER2-positive breast cancer by both promoting metastasis and by buffering signals originating from EGFR.</description>

   <description>Security aid refers to practices of development that focus on enhancing regimes of surveillance, policing, prisons, border management, and social control in recipients countries of the global South. Similar to traditional aid regimes, security assistance is animated by humanitarian sentiments, yet it also corresponds with a desire of prosperous countries to manage perceived insecurities fomenting in the “underdeveloped” world. My dissertation combines interviews with security experts and a comprehensive use of the Access to Information Act to explore Canadian practices of security aid. I argue that security aid regimes are expressions of humanitarian reason, though these altruistic sentiments are subordinate to two overlapping objectives: 1) the advancement of Canadian strategic interests and 2) the “development” of security agencies in the global South into transversal networks of security directed by norm-makers of the global North. I describe Canada as a norm-supporter within the broader arrangement of globalizing security governance, where Canadian security innovation provides practical and technical contributions to transversal practices of social control set by norm-makers. With a focus on developing tangible and concrete best practices of policing and surveillance, Canada explicitly avoids the responsibilities of global inequalities that correspond with security assistance trends. In contributing to debates on security communities and Canada’s “place” within these formations, I suggest that the transversal security community has two overarching characteristics twinned to its particular set of security aid practices: transnational security cooperation-integration, and morally anchored tropes of global humanitarianism. In the following pages, I argue that “security aid” is a mirroring of these normative imperatives, and explore the practices of the transversal security community through an investigation of Canadian security aid.</description>

   <description>This research presents a multi-scale analysis of the transport and reaction processes in the catalyst coating of a reformer to optimize the catalyst coating microstructure for methane steam reforming. A multi-scale methodology is developed to incorporate and analyze the effect of the catalyst coating morphology on the performance of a wall-coated reformer, based on hypothetical catalyst structures generated using an in-house particle packing code. The results show the significant effect of intra-particle and inter-particle porosity as well as particle size on the rate of hydrogen production in the coating. This study also shows that an optimal catalyst coating has decreasing porosity along the reformer length based on the difference in the degree of diffusion limitation. The results of the multi-scale analysis based on random particle packing are compared with the analysis based on the real catalyst coating pore structure obtained from nano- and micro-computed tomography. The comparison shows that despite similar morphological characteristics and transport properties, the rate of hydrogen production in the packing of overlapping spheres is higher than the rate in the real catalyst structure. This result also shows that by making a structured catalyst coating with a tailored pore network, the performance of the coating improves significantly. Based on the assumption that a structured catalyst coating can be represented by a random packing of spheres, a systematic parametric study is done using response surface methodology and Latin hypercube design of experiment to optimize the catalyst coating microstructure.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the work of William Thompson and Anna Wheeler in relation to more prominent feminist political theorists of the period.  It argues that, read in light of Thompson and Wheeler’s "Appeal of One Half the Human Race" (Appeal), John Stuart Mill’s "The Subjection of Women" (Subjection) represents a step backward in the history of feminist political thought. Mill’s "Subjection" reproduces many of the limitations in Mary Wollstonecraft’s groundbreaking "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (Vindication), limitations that had been overcome by Thompson and Wheeler’s "Appeal", which was published in between the publication of "Vindication" and "Subjection".  These limitations center on the relationship between women’s access to self-government and happiness, the economy, and the lack of compensation for domestic and reproductive labor. Unlike "Appeal", "Vindication" and "Subjection" limit women’s freedoms by maintaining women’s obligations to perform unpaid labor within the private sphere.  "Vindication" and "Subjection" are unable to recognize women’s biological difference without reducing women’s role to that difference. &#xd;
Thompson and Wheeler resolve the tension between capitalism and gender equality by making the case for radically democratic communities of mutual co-operation, where all useful labor, including reproductive labor, is compensated.  They use utilitarianism to advance this argument, but some contemporary scholars describe them as conservative utilitarians. I argue to the contrary, that because Thompson and Wheeler’s utilitarianism is ‘indirect’ and is informed by both a rich account of the self and a relational understanding of happiness, that it is not incompatible with arguments for greater social and economic equality.</description>

   <description>Overactive bladder (OAB) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) are conditions that affect 12 – 18% of Canadians and that grow increasingly common with age. Patterns of use and comparative safety of six anticholinergic medications used to treat OAB and UUI were examined. Two of these medications (oxybutynin, tolterodine) have been included for many years on the provincial drug formulary, while the other four (solifenacin, darifenacin, trospium chloride, fesoterodine) have only recently been listed with conditions as “limited use” (LU) products. Acute urinary retention is a possible adverse outcome associated with these medications and was the outcome selected for the analysis of comparative safety. &#xd;
&#xd;
Participants were patients from Ontario between 66 and 105 years of age who received a new prescription for one of the bladder anticholinergic medications listed on the formulary between December 15, 2011 and December 31, 2013. A retrospective cohort design was used. &#xd;
&#xd;
Patients who were new users of any of the six bladder anticholinergic medications were identified from ODB program data. Descriptive statistics were used to assess physician adherence to the LU criteria. These patients were assigned to groups based on the bladder anticholinergic medication they received and the risk of acute urinary retention in new users of each medication was compared. Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios to compare the risk of acute urinary retention among new users of each of the newer medications as compared to new users of oxybutynin. Analyses were stratified by sex, as men are known to be at greater risk of urinary retention than women.&#xd;
&#xd;
Only 10% of patients met the LU criteria for a prior trial of oxybutynin. Among men (but not women), new use of solifenacin, darifenacin, or tolterodine was associated with a reduced risk of acute urinary retention as compared to oxybutynin. &#xd;
&#xd;
The LU criteria for newer bladder anticholinergic medications do not appear to serve as an effective means of regulating their prescription. Exposure to these medications appears to confer a lower risk of acute urinary retention than oxybutynin in male patients. Further research into other potential adverse effects of these medication is needed.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the life and work of Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-1542) through the lens of the works he produced within and about his experiences of incarceration on charges of treason under Henry VIII of England (1509-1547). Through a close analysis of contemporary primary documents as well as Wyatt’s poetry, this thesis situates Wyatt’s experiences as a prisoner and writer within the historical context of the political crises of Henry VIII’s reign, exploring what Wyatt’s writing reveals about the changing conceptions of treason and the traumatic experience of imprisonment for a member of the political elite in Henrician England, while also considering how Wyatt’s writing gives rise to a new form of literary witness in the English literary tradition.</description>

   <description>Automating Social Inequality: How Single Mothers and Caseworkers Navigate the Neoliberal Surveillance of ‘Ontario Works,’ 1995–2015 examines the growth and impact of surveillance practices administered by the social assistance program Ontario Works [OW]. The purpose of this dissertation is to show the effects of the “welfare surveillance apparatus” from the perspectives of those receiving OW as well as those administering OW benefits to better understand what it feels like to “live” under the surveillance gaze of the declining welfare state. Surveillance practices within government services correspond with wider neoliberal transformations that have led to increased privatization, downsizing and deregulation, and a reluctance of the state to accept their role to either intervene in the economy and/or mitigate inequalities. By placing OW within the context of the international phenomenon of neoliberalism, I contend that it this political philosophy and practice that has altered the administration and purpose of Ontario’s social assistance programs over the past twenty years. In order to economize and undermine state aid, surveillance has become normalized under neoliberal governments that are fixated on meeting targets, quotas and timelines, while the needs of recipients of the services and frontline workers are rarely (or inadequately) calculated in changing policies. However, the significance of welfare surveillance has largely escaped academic inquiry. This study, the first of its kind in Canada, expands upon a small body of literature that examines surveillance practices of government-funded programs such as social assistance. Building upon leading scholars in the field, this dissertation suggests the importance of unearthing the political, economic and moral implications of welfare surveillance, especially upon those “watched” by the state. To tease out these implications, this project employs discourse analysis of the Ontario Works Act 1997 and other primary government documents, alongside 33 qualitative, in-depth interviews with single mothers on assistance, frontline OW caseworkers and anti-poverty activists. Paying close attention to the ways gender, race, class, ability and geographic location create variations in how OW welfare surveillance, discipline and regulation are experienced, this dissertation suggests that a neoliberal agenda has served to exacerbate rather than mitigate contemporary inequalities in Ontario.</description>

   <title>Older Federal Inmates: Needs, Institutional Treatment, and Legal Implications</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Law) -- Queen's University, 2015-08-04 16:54:58.237</description>
   <description>This thesis is a blend of social science methodology and legal interpretation aimed at investigating the quality of life of older Canadian federally incarcerated offenders and whether their rights are being respected.  For this study I used social science empirical methodology to answer certain legal questions, such as: what are the needs of older male offenders and how are these needs influencing the exercise of their legal rights? Are institutions prepared to deal with the increased needs of older offenders? If no, is this an infringement of this group’s rights? Is the Canadian legal framework broad or specific enough to offer protection to the vulnerabilities of the older male prison population?&#xd;
 First, I was able to establish a set of acute and chronic needs that older male offenders have. Second, I encountered a series of legal, policy, and institutional limitations in responding to those needs. All these seem to show a diminished quality of life for older male offenders, a profound sense of dehumanization, an erosion of their community ties, and greater fears regarding their release.&#xd;
Under such circumstances it seems sensible that the CSC approach towards older offenders needs to change. If such change does not come voluntarily, it is the duty of the courts to have a flexible and open-minded approach towards different actions that challenge the current prison regime. A number of legal actions based on statutory and constitutional norms are explored in this dissertation in an attempt to improve the protection of prisoners’ rights in light of the findings presented in this study. I conclude by making three sets of recommendations (legal, policy, and institutional) that could help align the treatment of older inmates with the Canadian societal values, as well as Canada’s international commitments.</description>
