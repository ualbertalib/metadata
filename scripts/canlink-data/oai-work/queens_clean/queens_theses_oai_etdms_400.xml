   <description>Traditionally, source coding (data compression) and channel coding (error protection) are performed separately and sequentially, resulting in what we call a tandem (separate) coding system. In practical implementations, however, tandem coding might involve a large delay and a high coding/decoding complexity, since one needs to remove the redundancy in the source coding part and then insert certain redundancy in the channel coding part. On the other hand, joint source-channel coding (JSCC), which coordinates source and channel coding or combines them into a single step, may offer substantial improvements over the tandem coding approach. &#xd;
This thesis deals with the fundamental Shannon-theoretic limits for a variety of communication systems via JSCC. More specifically, we investigate the reliability function (which is the largest rate at which the coding probability of error vanishes exponentially with increasing blocklength) for JSCC for the following discrete-time communication systems: (i) discrete memoryless systems; (ii) discrete memoryless systems with perfect channel feedback; (iii) discrete memoryless systems with source side information; (iv) discrete systems with Markovian memory; (v) continuous-valued (particularly Gaussian) memoryless systems; (vi) discrete asymmetric 2-user source-channel systems. &#xd;
For the above systems, we establish upper and lower bounds for the JSCC reliability function and we analytically compute these bounds. The conditions for which the upper and lower bounds coincide are also provided. We show that the conditions are satisfied for a large class of source-channel systems, and hence exactly determine the reliability function. We next provide a systematic comparison between the JSCC reliability function and the tandem coding reliability function (the reliability function resulting from separate source and channel coding). We show that the JSCC reliability function is substantially larger than the tandem coding reliability function for most cases. In particular, the JSCC reliability function is close to twice as large as the tandem coding reliability function for many source-channel pairs. This exponent gain provides a theoretical underpinning and justification for JSCC design as opposed to the widely used tandem coding method, since JSCC will yield a faster exponential rate of decay for the system error probability and thus provides substantial reductions in complexity and coding/decoding delay for real-world communication systems.</description>

   <description>Although cis-PtCl2(NH3)2 (cisplatin) has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent, its use can be accompanied by toxic side effects and the development of drug resistance. Consequently, much research has been focused on the discovery of novel transition metal compounds which elicit elevated cytotoxicities coupled with reduced toxic side effects and non-cross resistance. Recently, research in this lab has focused on preparing derivatives of titanocene dichloride (TDC), a highly active chemotherapeutic agent, with pendant alkylammonium groups on one or both rings. Earlier results have demonstrated that derivatives containing either cyclic or chiral alkylammonium groups had increased cytotoxic activities.&#xd;
This research therefore investigated a new series of TDC complexes focusing specifically on derivatives bearing cyclic and chiral alkylammonium groups. A library of ten cyclic derivatives and six chiral derivatives were synthesized and fully characterized. These derivatives have undergone in vitro testing as anti-tumour agents using human lung, ovarian, and cervical carcinoma cell lines (A549, H209, H69, H69/CP, A2780, A2780/CP and HeLa). These standard cell lines represent solid tumour types for which new drugs are urgently needed. The potencies of all of the Ti (IV) derivatives varied greatly (range from 10.8 μM - >1000 μM), although some trends were observed. In general, the dicationic analogues exhibited greater potency than the corresponding monocationic derivatives. Additionally, the cyclic analogues bearing 1,3- and 1,4-substituted pyridines displayed potent cytotoxic activities (IC50> 20 μM). It was also found at concentrations of ~30 μM that the derivatives bearing an ephedrine derived substituent were cytotoxic. Conversely, analogues substituted with piperidinyl, morpholinyl or primary alkylammonium groups were inactive (>200 μM) against the cancer cell lines assayed.</description>

   <description>This dissertation, flying between aesthetics, visual arts, and political/cultural/historical issues, traverses lines of stratification, and (de/re)territorialization to examine uncertainties in making and teaching art. In keeping with a conviction that nothing is unitary, that everything is always connected to countless others, Deleuze and Guattari’s metaphor of rhizome is the central organizing element in my work. My research questions what is meant by creativity, whether assumed to be a gift, talent, or innate quality, and what is meant by teaching art in university, which assumes creativity can be organized and developed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Differing discourses of creativity exhibit a general continuity of agreement that creation takes place within chaos, and forms where chaos and order meet each other. I posit that contemporary discourses of creativity hegemonically reinforce capitalism as a system of nomadic power and of constant de/reterritorialization. All, in a capitalist system,  is linked to the construction of the  urge to consume, and therefore  the acceleration of capitalism necessitates  an increase in the rate  at which we manufacture venues for consumption, even in such innovative ways as by making creativity itself a consumable package. How do we resist this? &#xd;
&#xd;
From a Deleuzian point of view, creation is a becoming event, as destructive as productive. Creativity, which is about freedom, occurs on a plane of immanence which sifts chaos and multiplicity together to break lines. Teaching, however, is on a “plane of organization” where rigid and dichotomous segmentarities of personal and social life operate. I suggest that artistic knowledge can be theorized and taught, in the Schönian sense, but creativity, a matter of “lines of flight,” is fundamentally unrelated to artistic knowledge. I argue that what can be taught is technique, theory, and the material language of media, and that these should be taught as explicit professional objectives, not as “creativity.” We can teach the value of breaking away from the false seriousness of creativity, with reference to Dada. We can teach the enjoyment of chaos and the confrontation of it. We can teach resistance. We can teach a love of complexities. We can teach play.</description>

   <description>Performance evaluation of document recognition systems is a difficult and practically-important problem.  In this thesis, we contribute to the understanding of performance evaluation by studying some issues that arise in evaluation of systems for recognition of mathematical expressions.  Issues that are discussed cover the reported performance evaluation experiments, the code availability, the nature of the mathematical notation, the extent of the coverage of mathematical recognition systems, and the quantification of performance evaluation results.  For each issue, we discuss its impact on performance evaluation, give an overview of the state of the art for addressing it and point out open problems.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to explore new reactivities and to improve luminescent properties of 7-azaindole-containing metal complexes. Selectivity for the activation of toluene and ethyl benzene has been investigated with two cationic Pt(II)(N,N-L) complexes, where N,N-L = 1,2-bis(1-N-7-azaindolyl)benzene (BAB) or bis(1-N-7-azaindolyl)methane (BAM). A high regioselectivity toward toluene and ethyl benzene benzylic C-H activation and a distinct diastereoselectivity for ethyl benzene benzylic C-H activation are demonstrated. Detailed mechanistic studies have been performed, leading to the establishment of both the intermediacy of the η3-benzylic Pt(II) complexes in the reactions and the ligand steric impacts as origins for the distinct diastereoselectivity. A PtMe2 complex of 1-N-(pyridin-2-yl)-7-azaindole (NPA) has been synthesized and found to undergo facile transformation at ambient temperature, resulting in the quantitive formation of a neutral Pt4 molecular square. The mechanism of the transformation process has been examined, establishing a distinct intramolecular C-H driven self-assembly process. The geometrical impacts of the BAB and BAM ligands on the structure and stability of their fac-Pt(IV)Me3 complexes has been investigated. The BAB ligand is more effective than the BAM ligand in stabilizing the five-coordinate Pt(IV)Me3 complexes. With the BAB ligand, a five-coordinate fac-Pt(IV)Me3 complex is obtained; with the BAM ligand, two six-coordinate fac-Pt(IV)Me3 complexes are obtained. In solution, the methyl groups in the BAB complex exchange slowly, but those in the BAM complexes exchange rapidly.&#xd;
Several new 7-azaindolyl derivative ligands via either modifying or altering the BAM and BAB bridging groups have been developed. The syntheses, structures and reactivities of their Pt(II) complexes have been examined, leading to the finding of an unconventional C-Sn oxidative addition reaction. The modification of the NPA ligand via the incorporation of a triarylboron group has been carried out. Several novel Pt(II) and Cu(I) complexes have been synthesized and studied. A Cu(I) complex is found to display exceptionally bright ambient temperature phosphorescence. A series of dinuclear Cu(I) compounds of the 1,2,3,4-tetra(1-N-7-azaindolyl)benzene (TTAB) ligand have been synthesized and examined. The close contacts between the TTAB bridging phenyl ring and the Cu(I) centers are present in the complexes.</description>

   <description>Annually and subannually laminated lacustrine sediments potentially contain a wide range of information that can be interpreted for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.  These laminae are produced by the physical and biological processes that operate in the lake and in the surrounding terrestrial environment.  However, identification of the influences that control laminae production may not be straightforward, and other processes may subtly influence the overall depositional sequence.  This thesis examines two different depositional environments on Colin Archer Peninsula, Devon Island, Canada, with the objective of identifying the factors that influence subannual sediment deposition and how the resultant sedimentary structures can be used as indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions.&#xd;
	In proglacial Lake R, clastic sediment deposition is controlled primarily by subannual meteorological conditions.  Periods of positive air temperature or large rainfall events produce discernable laminae that, when combined, form a varve sequence.  However, overarching geomorphic controls influence the delivery of sediment to the lake and may reduce or enhance the hydrometeorological signal contained in the varves.&#xd;
	An additional influence for calibration of the varve record to meteorological observations is the role that melt season thermal inversions have on temperature extrapolation in the High Arctic.  Meteorological stations at sea level may not be representative of the surrounding region, thereby reducing the accuracy of vertical temperature estimation.  Investigation of the inversions in the central Canadian High Arctic demonstrated that melt season inversions are common and increased inversion frequency may potentially have influenced enhanced glacial melt since the late 1980s, with implications for proglacial lake sediment transport and deposition.&#xd;
	In coastal Lake J, late Holocene sediments record a relatively unusual accumulation of microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS).  Such a record has not been previously described in the circum-Arctic, although they are known to exist elsewhere.  These sediments are produced by the interaction between clastic sedimentation and cyanobacterial growth and production.  Although chronological constraint could not be assigned with certainty to the record, statistical study of the laminated sequence suggested a dominant pattern that is plausibly annual.  A heuristic model of annual sediment accumulation was developed in order to explore the potential for quasi-annual paleoenvironmental interpretations.</description>

   <description>A lacustrine sedimentary process study was undertaken at Kluane Lake, which is a large, glacier-fed, alpine lake in the southwestern corner of Yukon Territory.  Data from moored instruments, sediment traps, water column profiling, and high-resolution sub-bottom acoustic surveys were collected over the peak melt seasons of 2006 and 2007 in order to document the spatial and temporal lacustrine sedimentation patterns.  A river monitoring station was also established to continuously record the inflow variations of Slims River, which drains meltwater from Kaskawulsh Glacier.  Kluane Lake receives sediment-laden (up to 5 g/l) water from Slims River, which varies diurnally in terms of both discharge and suspended sediment concentration.  While evidence of seasonal sediment exhaustion is present within the system, the diurnal hysteresis relationship between discharge and suspended sediment is either insignificant or more commonly counterclockwise.  The high suspended sediment load delivered by Slims River produces continuous, diurnally fluctuating turbidity currents with maximum velocities in excess of 0.6 m/s at delta-proximal locations, although velocities between 0.2 and 0.4 m/s are more typical.  During peak flow conditions, variations in current velocity can be traced to the deepest portion of the lake, over 4 km from the point of inflow.  The longitudinal changes in the vertical concentration profiles, suspended sediment load, and mass accumulation rates suggest that the flow structure of the turbidity currents changes rapidly along the first several kilometres of flow.  Sedimentation in the Kluane Lake basin is dominated by turbidity currents; overflows occur intermittently and contribute less than 2% to sediment accumulation along the lake bed.  The highest rate of deposition occurs approximately 1 km from the delta and is consistent with an accumulation of approximately 0.4 m/a; closer to the delta, high current velocities appear to inhibit sediment deposition.  The sediment in Kluane Lake is dominated by silt-size particles and contains virtually no sand except in small amounts very close to the delta.  The diurnal pattern of turbidity current activity produces daily rhythmites in sediment traps deployed near the lake bottom, but these laminations do not occur consistently over time or space.</description>

   <description>In the information age of today, vast amounts of sensitive and confidential data is exchanged over an array of different mediums. Accompanied with this phenomenon is a comparable increase in the number and types of attacks to acquire this information. Information security and data consistency have hence, become quintessentially important. Log file analysis has proven to be a good defense mechanism as logs provide an accessible record of network activities in the form of server generated messages. However, manual analysis is tedious and prohibitively time consuming. Traditional log analysis techniques, based on pattern matching and data mining approaches, are ad hoc and cannot readily adapt to different kinds of log files. &#xd;
&#xd;
The goal of this research is to explore the use of grammar inference for log file analysis in order to build a more adaptive, flexible and generic method for message categorization, anomaly detection and reporting. The grammar inference process employs robust parsing, islands grammars and source transformation techniques.&#xd;
&#xd;
We test the system by using three different kinds of log file training sets as input and infer a grammar and generate message categories for each set. We detect anomalous messages in new log files using the inferred grammar as a catalog of valid traces and present a reporting program to extract the instances of specified message categories from the log files.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2008-05-22 15:44:36.541</description>
   <description>Background: Less than half of Canadian youth meet recommended levels of physical activity.  This is of concern given the health burden associated with physical inactivity.  With the limited success of physical activity interventions, research has begun to focus on how physical and sociocultural environments affect physical activity.  Investigation of school and neighbourhood characteristics that facilitate physical activity may identify environmental changes that could increase participation among adolescents.&#xd;
Objectives:  The objectives of the two studies comprising the thesis were to examine, among youth in grades 6 through 10: 1) the association between school recreational characteristics and physical activity during free-time and class-time at school, and 2) the&#xd;
effects of perceptions of neighbourhood safety and availability of parks and recreational facilities on physical activity participation outside of school.  &#xd;
Methods: Data from the 2006 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Survey (HBSC) were analyzed.  Multilevel logistic regression was employed to quantify associations between school and neighbourhood characteristics and physical activity.  For the first study, student responses to school-time physical activity scales were dichotomized (≥ 2 vs. &lt;2 hours/week).  A cumulative index that considered together policies, varsity and intramural athletics, presence and condition of fields, and condition of gymnasia was constructed based on principals’ reports.  In the second study, physical activity outside of school was dichotomized (≥ 4 vs. &lt;4 hours/week).  A scale of individuals’ perceptions of safety was constructed.  The number of parks and recreational facilities within a 5 km buffer of schools was abstracted from a geographical information system.  &#xd;
Results: Objective 1. School recreational features were modestly positively related to adolescents’ physical activity at school, particularly that occurring during free-time.  The cumulative effect of school recreational features exerted a stronger effect than any single feature.  Objective 2. Perceptions of safety were associated with students’ physical activity, whereas increased availability of parks and recreational facilities neither prevented nor promoted physical activity.&#xd;
Conclusions: Objective 1.  High levels of recreational support at schools might promote physical activity among young people.  This could inform educational policies and support funding of school recreational opportunities.  Objective 2. Improving perceptions of safety might promote physical activity participation among youth.</description>

   <description>The thesis offers the following contributions to the epidemiology of hypertension in Canada: &#xd;
1.The first manuscript uses cross-sectional data from the 2007-2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) to compare the prevalence of controlled hypertension between people with and without diabetes. Of the 74% of Canadians with diabetes who had hypertension, 56% (95% CI: 45%-66%) had controlled blood pressure compared to 64% (95% CI: 58%-69%) of Canadians without diabetes.  Among people taking medication, individuals with diabetes were less likely to have controlled hypertension (ORadjusted: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2-0.6).  &#xd;
2.The objective of the second manuscript was to determine, among Canadians with hypertension, whether individuals with diabetes were less likely than those without to recall health professional advice for healthy behaviours and whether receipt of such advice influences behaviour, using cross-sectional data from the 2009 Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada (SLCDC).  Canadians with diabetes were more likely than those without to recall advice to control/lose weight (81% vs. 66%), exercise (79% vs. 68%), limit alcohol (78% vs. 55%) and modify diet (70% vs. 61%) but not limit salt (65% vs. 64%). Both groups were equally likely to report following advice, with receipt of advice positively associated with engagement in healthy behaviours.  &#xd;
3. The third manuscript describes knowledge of blood pressure targets in Canadians with hypertension using cross-sectional data from the 2009 SLCDC.  Knowledge of blood pressure targets was low, with 28% and 32% of Canadians with and without diabetes reporting having discussed a blood pressure target and reporting a target in line with clinical practice guidelines.  &#xd;
4.The fourth manuscript validates an existing self-reported blood pressure control question in a sample of 161 patients with hypertension in Kingston.  In people with and without diabetes, the question had sensitivities of 83% ± 11% and 78% ± 10% and specificities of 30% ±19% and 58% ± 21%, respectively.   &#xd;
5.The final manuscript tests a method designed to account for misclassification in epidemiologic studies, using data from the CHMS. The method was found to perform inconsistently in multivariate contexts and introduced bias when minor differential misclassification was ignored.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates and documents fundamental studies of highway materials (asphalt engineering properties) especially on different modified asphalt binders and mixtures in order to understand failure mechanisms at low temperature and superior performance of such asphalt binders with the aim of preventing premature cracking on Ontario highways. In addition, seven asphalt binders of different compositions were used as a template for study and this research work is tailored towards Superpave® performance-based specification testing with the aim of improving asphalt pavement performance under various conditions and consequently reducing premature cracking in order to achieve long lasting highways. &#xd;
  Based on the actual applied pattern of Superpave® specification criteria, the mechanical responses of the binders are analyzed by extended bending beam rheometer (eBBR), tensile stress ductilometer (Petrotest DDA3®), compact tension test (Instron AsphaltPro®), double-edge-notched tension and single-edge-notched tension (MTS 810 universal testing machine) protocols. The objective of this study entails establishing and developing of a proper procedure for the testing of binders with the aim of ranking (grading) the performance after validation of laboratory and field experiments. &#xd;
  Analysis of the results appears to show that the premature distress on the Highway 417 trial sections can be attributed to reversible aging tendency (wax crystallization) at low temperatures coupled with low fatigue resistance of the binders. The results suggest that different polymer modifications had significant influence on the performance of asphalt mix as demonstrated from the results obtained from essential and plastic work of fracture using double-edge-notch-tension test (DENT).  Crack tip opening  displacement (CTOD) parameter consistently show the performing grading of asphalt binder while compact tension test protocol provides plane strain fracture toughness (K1c) which could be used to rank binders with respect to fracture resistance at low temperature. Hence, CTOD is a promising parameter which can be used to establish performance ranking of the binders.</description>

   <description>For many young adults, career decision-making is a challenge that may lead to feelings of disequilibrium, stress, and anxiety. This disequilibrium may be especially problematic for young Christian women. On one hand, their belief system may provide a stabilizing anchor, and embue them with a sense of purpose (Fowler, 1981). On the other hand, distinct Christian values may further perpetuate traditional male-female roles and thus limit their labour force participation (Scott, 2002). To better understand this dichotomy and add to the limited research on this topic, my study explored the relationship between Christian faith and career development with a sample of four women (ages 33 to 51) already established in their careers. Research data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews. Each interview was preceded by the construction of a lifeline, or timeline of major events in the participant’s life (Campbell &amp; Ungar, 2004). Themes emerging from case and cross analyses were (a) life story, (b) centrality of motherhood, and (c) spiritual grounding. These three themes were first reported for each participant as an individual case, and then in an overview of findings across cases. &#xd;
Implications for post-secondary career counsellors, based on this study’s results, as well as on relevant literature, focus on incorporating the notion of calling into three traditional career development activities: (a) self-discovery; (b) exploration and research; and (c) formulating a plan. Implications for career development researchers include: (a) creating a comprehensive theory reflecting spiritual and non-spiritual factors in women’s career development; (b) studying this topic with different methodologies; and (c) undertaking a best practices study of career programs integrating calling at secular or non-secular universities. These practical and theoretical implications may provide post-secondary career counsellors guidance on how to direct young women of diverse faith backgrounds to explore and pursue their fields of choice.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Art History) -- Queen's University, 2008-05-27 17:26:55.126</description>
   <description>The main topic of discussion in this thesis is the iconography of two etchings and five paintings of the Holy Family in a domestic or domestic/workshop setting.  All of these works were, at one time, attributed to Rembrandt van Rijn.  Although doubt now has been expressed by experts as to the authenticity of at least two of the paintings, namely, the Holy Family at Night (c. 1638/40, Amsterdam) and the Holy Family with St. Anne (1640, Paris), these disputed works are included because of a similarity to the way in which Rembrandt depicted the Holy Family in a non-Biblical context.  If these are not works by Rembrandt’s own hand, they are certainly variants of his ideas, painted by artists in his circle.  The remaining paintings consist of the Holy Family (1634, Munich), the Holy Family with Angels (1645, St. Petersburg), and the Holy Family with the Curtain (1646, Kassel).  The etchings described are the 1632 Holy Family and the 1654 Virgin with the Cat and the Snake.&#xd;
&#xd;
     Prior to a consideration of the aforementioned works of art, both individually and as a group, and in order to ascertain whether or not Rembrandt was influenced by earlier artists, a brief overview of depictions of the Holy Family in imaginary settings is provided, covering a period from the time of the Renaissance to the beginning of the seventeenth century.  Mention also is made of the influence of restrictions on religious art that followed in the wake of the Reformation, particularly with respect to the art of the north Netherlands.&#xd;
&#xd;
     Lastly, a look at a few depictions of the Holy Family by Rembrandt’s students and followers gives some indication of the extent to which they emulated his work.  A comparison of the treatment of the same subject by Peter Paul Rubens and Jacob Jordaens, both of whom worked in the Catholic environment of the south Netherlands helps to demonstrate Rembrandt’s ability to meet the requirements of a largely Protestant society through the manner in which he chose to present the Holy Family.</description>

   <description>Many speech enhancement algorithms suffer from musical noise - an estimation residue noise consisting of music-like varying tones. To reduce this annoying noise, some speech enhancement algorithms require post-processing. However, a lack of auditory perception theories about musical noise limits the effectiveness of musical noise reduction methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Scientists now have some understanding of the human auditory system, thanks to the advances in hearing research across multiple disciplines - anatomy, physiology, psychology, and neurophysiology. Auditory models, such as the gammatone filter bank and the Meddis inner hair cell model, have been developed to simulate the acoustic to neuron transduction process. The auditory models generate the neuron firing signals called the cochleagram. Cochleagram analysis is a powerful tool to investigate musical noise.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
We use auditory perception theories in our musical noise investigations. Some auditory perception theories (e.g., volley theory and auditory scene analysis theories) suggest that speech perception is an auditory grouping process. Temporal properties of neuron firing signals, such as period and rhythm, play important roles in the grouping process. The grouping process generates a foreground speech stream, a background noise stream, and possibly additional streams.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
We assume that musical noise is the result of grouping to the background stream the neuron firing signals whose temporal properties are different from the ones grouped to the foreground stream. Based on this hypothesis, we believe that a musical noise reduction method should increase the probability of grouping the enhanced neuron&#xd;
firing signals to the foreground speech stream, or decrease the probability of grouping them into the background stream. We propose a post-processing musical noise reduction method for the auditory Wiener filter speech enhancement method, in which we&#xd;
employ a proposed complex gammatone filter bank for the cochlear decomposition. The results of a subjective listening test of our speech enhancement system show that the proposed musical noise reduction method is effective.</description>

   <title>The Development and Investigation of a Conceptual Model to Understand Knowledge Management</title>

   <description>The realization that knowledge constitutes a key organizational resource and should be managed effectively gave rise to the field of knowledge management (KM). Since then, the field has experienced tremendous growth as measured by the number of research papers, books, conferences, and consulting services. The lack of a theoretical foundation, however, has resulted in the proliferation of KM definitions and models with little underlying coherence among them. This research represents an attempt to address this shortcoming by developing and investigating a theoretically grounded model for KM. &#xd;
&#xd;
The focus of the research is twofold. First, a conceptual model is developed that combines tenets of evolutionary theory, organizational learning and organizational memory (OM) into a single integrated model. The model proposes that organizational knowledge evolves through four recursive stages. At each stage, a process is required to manage the evolving knowledge, namely, knowledge scanning process, knowledge evaluation process, knowledge transfer process, and knowledge application process. The model further proposes that, as it evolves, knowledge is enabled by and embedded in OM infrastructures namely, individuals, roles, business logic, artifacts and culture.&#xd;
&#xd;
		Second, the conceptual model is then examined within an organizational setting to gain an understanding of how each of the knowledge processes and OM infrastructures function inter-dependently to contribute to the management of knowledge. Using a case study methodology, an investigation is conducted within the context of new service development in three different lines of business (LOB) (referred to as TM, PD and MM) of a major logistics company. The research shows that the LOBs with enhanced KM capability (i.e., TM and PD) share three dominant aspects: articulable (i.e., their knowledge processes and OM infrastructures are well-defined and well understood at each stage of knowledge evolution); supportive (i.e., their knowledge processes and OM infrastructures at each stage are aligned with the goals of the respective stages); and equifocused (i.e., they are attentive to all the stages of knowledge evolution). In contrast to KM at these two LOBs, KM at MM is lacking in all three key aspects.</description>

   <description>Modern Japan established three kinds of national identification (ID) systems over its population: Koseki, Alien Registration, and Juki-net. The Koseki system is a patriarchal family registration of all citizens. It began in the 1870s when Japan’s nation-state was developed under the emperor’s rule. Koseki used traditional patriarchal hierarchy and loyalty to construct subjects for the Japanese Empire and reify a fictional unity among the “Japanese” people. Until today, this disciplinary element has functioned as the norm for organizational relations in Japan.&#xd;
The Alien Registration System requires non-citizens to register and carry an ID card to distinguish “foreigners” from “Japanese”. This system stems from surveillance techniques used over the colonial populations in the early twentieth century: the Chinese in the colony of “Manchuria”, in northeast China, and the Koreans on the Japanese mainland. Although the empire collapsed after World War II, the practice was officially legislated to target Koreans and Chinese who remained in post-war democratic Japan.&#xd;
Juki-net is the recently established computer network for sharing the personal data of citizens between government and municipal authorities. Juki-net attaches a unitary ID number to all citizens and gives them an optional ID card. Juki-net uses digital technology to capture individual movement, so the system is direct, individualistic, and fluid. It has expanded the scope of personal data and shifts the foundation of citizenship to state intervention. &#xd;
This thesis examines how these three systems have defined the boundary of the nation and constructed categories for its subjects, which have then been imposed on the entire population. Drawing on the theories of Foucault’s bio-power and Agamben’s bare life, I explain how the national ID card systems enable the state to include and exclude people, use them for its own power, and produce subjects to support the state. Although this process is often hidden, the scheme is a vital part of the current proposal to use national ID card systems in the global “war on terror”. I argue that the national ID card systems impose compulsory classifications on individuals, threaten the public’s rights against state intervention, and spread “bare life” across the population.</description>

   <description>Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) provide an affordable solution for last mile network access. They also allow for extension of a network by configuring a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) where it may otherwise be physically infeasible or cost prohibitive to do so. With the increasing use of real-time applications such as video conferencing and Voice over IP (VoIP), networks are stressed to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for these applications. Examples of key requirements include bounded delay and packet loss ratios. Addressing this issue in WLANs, the IEEE 802.11e amendment was proposed to provide a QoS mechanism. However, the performance of 802.11e in meshed environments is yet to be studied. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this work, we study VoIP call quality in a meshed environment with provisions for QoS. We study the call quality and throughput of background traffic in an experimental WMN testbed in order to test how well the IEEE 802.11e QoS provisions support voice calls. Call quality is tested in different configurations and scenarios. We study the effect of the number of wireless hops on VoIP call quality. In addition, we investigate the number of VoIP calls that can be supported simultaneously for different numbers of wireless hops. We also study how fairly the network treats different calls in different configurations. Then, we look at how much effective bandwidth a VoIP call uses on the network. Finally, we examine the VoIP call quality of different calls when calls have different QoS parameters and study the effect that a busy central node has on traffic passing through it. We provide suggestions to improve call quality on a WMN and hint at possible future work.</description>

   <description>For the past two decades, events on the world stage and particularly in the United States have serious implications for the operations of financial markets.  In this study, we will attempt to provide some insights into information dispersion before and after three particular events: the near collapse of Long Term Capital Management in August 1998, the Tech-Bubble Burst in March 2000, and the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.  A study of these events will yield insights into the resolution of information uncertainties in the financial markets.  We estimated state prices and state price densities using Claims-based asset pricing (a la Ross (2000)).  We then used our results to gauge investor sentiments three months before and three months after each event.  We also used two new measures of the level of pessimism in the market during these events: skewness of the state price distributions and the percentages of discount states (with state price densities greater than one).  Our results clearly indicate that different markets reacted differently to the three events, and that there were different levels of information leakage in the markets for each event.  As expected, the impacts from the 9/11 event were immediate but short-lived in both the SPX and NDX markets.  Further, our results show that event impact contamination played an important role in the over- and under-reactions to the three events.  More specifically, our results indicate that the LTCM event was closely related to and was probably precipitated by the Russian Currency Crisis.  As well, the 9/11 event occurred immediately following predictions of a U.S. economic recession, and three months prior to the declaration of the War on Terror.  Our results show lulls and peaks in market expectations which correspond to these separate and yet correlated events.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis was to examine age-related changes in weight and body composition as they relate to health in older adults. This thesis was completed in manuscript format and consists of two studies, both of which are based on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohort. The CHS is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older (≥65 years) men and women who were followed for 8 years. &#xd;
	The first manuscript examined whether physical activity (PA) attenuates age-related weight loss in the elderly. Mixed modeling procedures were employed to create body weight trajectory curves for the 8 year follow-up period according to physical activity level in a sample of 4512 CHS participants. Body weight declined over the follow-up period in all physical activity groups, with an accelerated weight loss occurring in the final years of follow-up. Over the 8 year follow-up, body weight was reduced by 2.72 kg in the least active PA quartile. Compared to the least active quartile, weight loss was attenuated by 0.55 kg (20%), 0.80 kg (29%), and 0.69 kg (25%) within the second through fourth physical activity quartiles. Therefore, participation in modest amounts of PA attenuated age-related weight loss by approximately 25%. &#xd;
	The second manuscript examined whether sarcopenic-obesity is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than either sarcopenia or obesity alone, and whether muscle mass or strength is a stronger marker of CVD risk. CHS participants who were free of CVD at baseline (n=3400) were classified as normal, sarcopenic, obese, or sarcopenic-obese based on measures of waist circumference and either muscle mass or strength. Participants were followed for CVD development over 8 years and proportional hazard regression models were used to compare risk estimates for CVD after adjustment for covariates. When based on measures of waist circumference and muscle mass, CVD risk was not increased in sarcopenic, obese, or sarcopenic-obese groups in comparison to the group with a normal body composition. When categorized based on waist circumference and muscle strength, CVD risk was significantly increased (by 38%) in the sarcopenic-obese group but not in either the sarcopenic or obese groups. Thus, sarcopenic-obesity, based on muscle strength, was associated with increased CVD risk implying that strength is more important than muscle mass for cardiovascular health in old age.&#xd;
	In summary, the findings of this thesis support the continuation of public health efforts to promote regular PA and balanced nutrition to assist with maintenance of optimal body composition and weight through adulthood and into old age.</description>

   <description>Replication fork stalling is a source of potentially tumourigenic genomic instability. The RecQ family helicase, Rqh1, is critical for the prevention of replication fork collapse and the formation of potentially deleterious recombination intermediates following fork stalling. Previous work in our lab with Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) has shown that rqh10/rqh10 diploids are inherently unstable and show rapid reversion to the haploid state. The current work exploits this characteristic of fission yeast rqh10 mutants in a screen for genes that normally promote replication associated genomic instability. The rqh10rad30 mutant strains employed in this work incorporate the checkpoint deficiency caused by a lack of Rad3, so as to exacerbate the genomically unstable nature of this model. The current work describes the lithium acetate transformation based random mutagenesis by non-homologous integration of the ura4+ selectable marker into the rqh10rad30 fission yeast strains. This random mutagenesis generated extensive (24,500 – 50,000) mutant libraries. The quality of the libraries was assessed by can1 mutant assay, confirming an adequately extensive mutagenesis for the proposed screen. The process to be employed in the screen would involve the crossing of the mutant libraries, with the hope of generating diploids that will have two mutant copies of the same gene. Some of these diploids would appear unusually stable, showing a normal sporulation phenotype. This would indicate the mutation of a gene that normally promotes genomic instability following replication fork stalling. The practicality of the proposed screen of a vast number of diploids was assessed and described in detail in the current work. A technique involving inverse PCR (IPCR) adopted from previous work to identify mutants of interest, was also investigated. The investigation of this technique, and the work of others, suggests that transformation using such selectable marker fragments results in most apparent transformants containing extrachromosomal ura4+ fragments. These fragments are thought to provide the predominant template for IPCR, rendering the process unsuccessful at identifying the mutation in the current screen. However, with the mutant libraries generated, and the screen procedure detailed, the stage is set to conduct the screen once a more appropriate mutation location technique is identified.</description>

   <description>This research develops a memory model capable of performing in a human-like fashion on a maze traversal task.  The model is based on and retains the underlying ideas of Minerva 2 but is executed with different mathematical operations and with some added parameters and procedures that enable more capabilities.  When applied to the same maze traversal task as was used in a previous experiment with human subjects, the performance of a maze traversal agent with the developed model as its memory emulated the error rates of the human data remarkably well.  As well, the maze traversal agent and memory model successfully emulated the human data when it was divided into two groups: fast maze learners and slow maze learners.  It was able to account for individual differences in performance, specifically, individual differences in the learning rate.  Because forgetting was not applied and therefore all experiences were flawlessly encoded in memory, the model additionally demonstrates that error can be due to interference between memories rather than forgetting.</description>

   <description>Ice-associating proteins (IAPs) are proteins that interact directly with ice crystals, either by offering a site for nucleation, i.e. ice nucleating proteins (INPs), or by binding to nascent crystals to prevent addition of more water molecules, i.e. antifreeze proteins (AFPs). AFPs have been found to inhibit the formation of clathrate-hydrates, ice-like crystalline solids composed of water-encaged guest molecules. Study of AFP-hydrate interaction is leading to a greater understanding of AFP adsorption and of the mechanism behind the “memory effect” in hydrates, wherein previously frozen crystals reform more quickly after a brief melt. AFP is currently the only known memory inhibitor. Such a low-dosage hydrate inhibitor (LDHI) is of great interest to the oil and gas industry, as hydrate formation and reformation in the field is a huge problem. Bacterial AFPs, though largely uncharacterized, may be the best candidates for large-scale production of hydrate inhibitors, given the difficulties in obtaining AFP from other sources.&#xd;
The popular kinetic inhibitors (KIs) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinylcaprolactam (PVCap) were used for points of comparison in experiments exploring the hydrate-inhibition activity of several ice-associating bacteria and proteins. The addition of the soil microbe, Chryseobacterium, increased the average lag-time to tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate formation by 14-fold, comparable to PVP or PVCap. Samples containing Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium having both ice-nucleation protein (INP) and AFP activity, had lag-times double that of the control. Solutions with P. putida and Chryseobacterium sometimes formed hydrate slurries of stunted crystal nuclei instead of solid crystals. No inhibition of memory or nucleation was noted in bacterial assays, however bacteria with INP activity was linked to unusually rapid memory reformation. Quartz crystal microbalance experiments with dissipation (QCM-D) showed that a tight adsorption to SiO2 and resistance to rinsing are correlated with a molecule’s inhibition of hydrate formation and reformation. These results support a heterogeneous nucleation model of the memory effect, and point to the affinity of AFP for heterogeneous nucleating particles as an important component of memory inhibition.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-19 12:32:08.686</description>
   <description>Heme is essential for numerous enzymes involved in the regulation of vascular tone; it is an integral component of nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase, and is the substrate for heme oxygenase, enzymes critical for vasodilation. Inhibition of heme synthesis is anticipated to result in a deficiency in these hemoproteins, causing disturbances in the tissue’s ability to regulate vascular tone. Hypertension is frequently associated with the morbidity of both porphyria and lead poisoning, two conditions wherein heme biosynthesis is disrupted. The hypothesis tested was, that extended pharmacological inhibition of heme synthesis disrupts normal vascular control and induces hypertension. &#xd;
Rats were treated with SA, a heme synthesis inhibitor, for two weeks; this depleted heme stores of the liver, kidney, spleen and vasculature by up to 62.2%.  A significant decrease in hematocrit, hemoglobin, urine nitrate levels, NOS activity and sGC activity were also produced, indicating compromised hemoprotein synthesis and function. Ex vivo studies of blood vessels revealed blunted sensitivity to nitric oxide donors. Lastly, SA treatment produced a significant increase in left ventricular mass, which is indicative of altered cardiac output and blood pressure elevation. &#xd;
Next, telemetry devices were used to determine in vivo blood pressure and salt-sensitivity of blood pressure of rats treated with SA for 33 days. Hemodynamic changes were minimal, yet there was a mild decrease in pressure over two weeks of SA treatment alone. The change from low to high salt diet in SA rats showed no difference compared to control rats. A small increase was observed in 3 mg/kg L-NAME plus high salt compared to high salt alone, while there was no change at this dose in control animals. Heme tissue and blood content was depleted by up to 47%, but was less than two-week experiments. An increase in kidney medulla NOS activity by 19% was observed in vitro compared to controls. &#xd;
Initial two-week experiments were consistent with the hypothesis above, as heme depletion impaired in vivo activity of NOS and sGC and altered vasodilator function. Nevertheless, in vivo results did not support the hypothesis as hypertension and salt-sensitivity of blood pressure were not observed.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes three different design projects that are intellectually connected by the fact that they all involve the development of apparatus to facilitate the precise control of sample temperature in modern microscopes.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first project is a low-temperature sample stage, for a beetle-type scanning tunnelling microscope. The design for this sample stage, and images taken on it with atomic resolution at 114 K are presented. This stage has the capability for variable-temperature sample cooling, which is also discussed.&#xd;
&#xd;
The second project is a set of low- and variable-temperature isothermal radiation shields for a new microscope that is currently being designed and assembled by our research group. These shields provide temperature control between 5 K and room temperature, with measured stability better than +/- 0.1 K. Controlled and stable temperature changes at rates up to 1.5 K per minute have been produced. The shields are modular and can easily accommodate future modifications. The design for the shields, along with their cooling and temperature control capabilities, is presented.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third project is a new stage design for heating, cleaning, and transferring metal and semiconductor samples. Also for use with the new microscope, this stage uses electron bombardment to provide precision temperature control between room temperature to temperatures in excess of 1250 C‰. With this stage, the sample temperature can be determined by measuring the power applied to the sample. The design of this stage, its heating performance, and a method to calculate the sample temperature is presented.</description>

   <title>Simultaneous Imaging and Current Clamp Recordings from Hippocampal Slices during Simulated Ischemia</title>

   <description>Following sudden failure of the Na+/K+ATPase pump, the acute neuronal swelling and dendritic damage that occurs within minutes of stroke onset are consequences of anoxic depolarization (AD). The AD front in our protocol is imaged as an increase in tissue light transmittance (LT) propagating across gray matter of the hippocampal slice preparation. Under current clamp in the single neuron, AD is recorded as a sharp depolarization within 6 min of O2/glucose deprivation (OGD). Simultaneous imaging and current clamp recordings show that the increased LT front and sudden depolarization are coincident. AD onset in CA1 hippocampal neurons is delayed in slices pretreated with 10 μM dibucaine (dib), a local anaesthetic understood to block voltage-gated sodium channels, and 10 to 100 µM carbetapentane (CP), a sigma1 receptor agonist.&#xd;
We examined if changes to single cell excitability could explain how dibucaine and CP work to inhibit AD. Pretreatment of slices with dibucaine for 30 min had no effect upon resting membrane potential, or whole cell input resistance (n=11). However dib pretreatment consistently raised spike threshold, decreased AP frequency and increased the fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP). Orthodromic and antidromic APs were also eliminated within 15 min. Intracellular dibucaine application in addition to similar effects upon intrinsic electophysiological properties reduced the peak potential of the fast AD while extending the time until the persistent depolarization of AD reached zero. &#xd;
In contrast, 30 -100 μM CP had no effect upon orthodromic or antidromic responses, probably because unlike dibucaine it did not markedly raise spike threshold. Also unlike dibucaine, the fAHP was eliminated while the slow AHP was accentuated, resulting in a lowering of the AP frequency during steady depolarization. Both drugs appear to inhibit AD onset by reducing cortical excitability at the level of the single pyramidal neuron, but through strikingly different mechanisms.&#xd;
Our simultaneous imaging and single cell recording under current clamp allowed for further examination of potential cell recovery after AD in CA1 neurons and astrocytes, as well as confirmation of AD generation in the CA3 region. Indirect evidence for a more robust AD generation and propagation was evident in the transverse slices of dorsal hippocampal CA3 region compared to coronal slices. AD in astrocytes was lower in amplitude and more prolonged, as well as often displaying recovery to near resting potential. This supported our previous imaging experiments showing that astrocytes quickly recover their volume post-AD.</description>

   <description>There have been few investigations of sexual coercion in relationships. I conducted several studies to develop a measure of partner sexual coercion and to identify its proximate causes and the relevant personal characteristics of male perpetrators. Community participants’ self-reported propensity to engage in various tactics to obtain sex from a reluctant partner clustered into a subscale relating to sexual coercion and a subscale pertaining to sexual coaxing. These subscales had excellent internal reliability, construct validity, criterion validity, and were used to test predictions in subsequent studies. I tested the application of Lalumière et al.’s (2005) three-path model for the development of sexually coercive behavior in general to sexual coercion in relationships. Self-reported interest in partner sexual coercion in a community sample was significantly related to psychopathy, but not age or neurodeveopmental insults. I confirmed the importance of psychopathy in this model by comparing men who raped their partner to other sex offender groups. Another characteristic of sex offenders, sexual deviance, was tested for its application to partner rapists. Unlike non-partner rapists, men who raped their partner exhibited low sexual arousal to rape scenarios, similar to community controls. Cuckoldry risk, a hypothesized proximate cause of partner sexual coercion, was also tested. Direct cues to cuckoldry risk were related to self-reported propensity for partner sexual coercion, whereas indirect cues of cuckoldry risk were related to sexual coaxing. In a forensic sample, most partner rapists had experienced cuckoldry risk prior to committing their offense, and they experienced more cuckoldry risk events than partner assaulters. A necessary condition of the cuckoldry risk hypothesis is that men should exhibit sexual arousal to cues signaling cuckoldry risk. Men in a community sample exhibited as much sexual arousal to stories depicting partner infidelity as they did to stories depicting consenting sex with their partners, and men who were currently in relationships showed greater arousal to stories of infidelity than consenting sex. Taken together, my results suggest psychopathy and cuckoldry risk are important contributors to partner sexual coercion.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-25 14:16:41.951</description>
   <description>Directional drilling has become a popular construction method used by municipalities, contractors and engineers alike for the construction of new subsurface pipelines while minimizing impact on the surrounding community. Pressurized drilling fluid is used during the advancement of the borehole through granular materials to maintain borehole stability throughout the drill path. It is believed that failure of the soil surrounding the borehole is controlled by the shear strength of this frictional ground and this influences the maximum allowable mud pressure that may be applied to the borehole. While there have been a number of theoretical studies, there have been few if any experimental investigations to examine the efficacy of the proposed design equations.&#xd;
The basis of this research considers a horizontal directionally drilled borehole and compares the analytical findings with those obtained from a series of smaller and larger-scale laboratory experiments for a uniformly graded sand and layered sand - sand and gravel case. The analytical solutions are considered reasonable for hydrofracture during pullback, but may not be directly applicable to blowout during pilot borehole drilling such as the model researched in the experiments.&#xd;
During the experiments the downhole mud pressures were continuously monitored and observations of composite drilling fluid and sand material were made. Smaller-scale experiments were carried out to determine the response of the horizontal stresses resulting from internal pressurization acting on the sidewalls of the test cell.

Through the course of the research, physical information has been collected regarding the changes that a clean sand undergoes when in contact with a drilling fluid, the ability of a borehole to resist internal loading, and the effectiveness of the various analytical models currently used to estimate the peak allowable internal fluid pressures. In addition, physical data has been collected regarding the displacement of a surrounding material during the introduction of drilling fluid into a horizontally drilled borehole</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Classics) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-09 15:40:16.227</description>
   <description>This thesis is an examination of realism in the love elegies of Propertius: of how it is created, how it is limited, and how its limitations increase its effectiveness rather than diminishing it.  The first half analyzes the variety and subtlety of the creation of realism in elegies 1.3, 2.29b, and 4.7, three poems that, because of shared features that link them to each other and set them apart from the rest of Propertius's elegies, represent a case study of realism.  The second half begins by describing how the realism in these poems is limited, and how these limitations intensify the effect of their realism by drawing attention to the poet's agency in creating it.  This effect is then related to larger trends in the creation and limitation of realism in Propertius's remaining love elegies, in which the same pattern is observed, by means of the analysis of recurring techniques.  This examination of aspects of realism in Propertius's poetry provides insight not only into his poetic method, but into his attitude to his genre and its potential.</description>

   <description>Interference makes reasoning about imperative programs difficult but it can be controlled syntactically by a language's type system, such as Syntactic Control of Interference (SCI). Haskell is a purely-functional, statically-typed language with a rich type system including algebraic datatypes and type classes. It is popular as a defining language for definitional interpreters of domain-specific languages, making it an ideal candidate for implementation of definitional interpreters for SCI and Syntactic Control of Interference Revisited (SCIR), a variant that improves on SCI. Inference rules and denotational semantics functions are presented for PCF, IA, SCI, and SCIR. An extension to Haskell98 is used to define Haskell functions for those languages' semantics and to define type constructions to statically check their syntax. The results in applied programming language theory demonstrate the suitability and techniques of Haskell for definitional interpretation of languages with rich type systems.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-16 12:10:06.42</description>
   <description>Objective&#xd;
As part of this work, two preliminary studies were conducted that identified three possible swings used at the elite level of volleyball and the resulting ball velocities created using these swings.  Therefore, the purpose of this work was to explore the kinematic aspects of the different spike attack arm swings (straight ahead (SA), cross body (CB) and outside (OS)) where each different swing was broken down into its constituent parts.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods&#xd;
Six elite-level varsity players participated in this study.  A motion tracking system was used to collect motion data which was used to calculate the kinematics of the upper arm during each of the swing types.  A number of minimums and maximums were then calculated including maximum hand speed.  To compare means between swings one-way ANOVA’s were used.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results&#xd;
Few differences were found between the swing types.  The only difference seen between the SA CB swings was a more pronounced wrist flexion during the CB swing.  It is possible that this helped propel the ball across the body during the CB.  The OS swings differed from the CB and SA swings in that the OS was less horizontally adducted and there was a more pronounced external rotation during CB than during OS.  These differences are likely to be responsible for the ball being hit away from the midline of the body during the OS swing.  Typically, the hand speed results agreed with those of the study done previously concerning resulting ball speeds when these swings were employed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions&#xd;
Between the SA, CB and OS swing types, only the OS was consistantly different throughout the three studies.  It is recommended that future studies attempt to examine the whole body during these types of swings.  Also, it appears that elite-level players may be quite different kinematically, and each one should be treated as a separate case in a training situation.  The findings of these studies may help coaches, trainers and athletes develop better training, injury prevention and rehabilitation programs in the sport.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Civil Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-12 18:03:43.501</description>
   <description>Horizontal directional drilling is increasingly used to install pipes without costs and disruptions associated with conventional ‘cut and cover’ installations.  This technique, which was developed by industrial innovators, feature complex soil and pipe response which is not well understood.  The success of this operation depends on knowledge of the pulling forces applied, level of ground disturbance, ground expansion or fracture from mud pressure, and the effect of the pulling operation on the pipes.  Tensile stresses in the pipe vary with time during and after installation, and along the pipe.  This applies especially to polymer pipes where the stresses during insertion and those over the service life of the pipe may influence its performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
The main objective of this study is to model the short term and long term response of pipes installed using horizontal directional drilling and to investigate the effect of the time dependent behaviour of polymer pipes, as well as other installation variables on the performance of the pipe during and after installation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The mechanical behaviour of high density polyethylene used to manufacture a significant portion of pipes installed using horizontal directional drilling is investigated and two sophisticated constitutive models are developed to simulate the time-dependent behaviour of high density polyethylene.  The interaction between the pipe and the surrounding soil during horizontal directional drilling installations is also investigated and modelled.&#xd;
&#xd;
A FORTRAN algorithm is developed to calculate the short and long term response of elastic and polymeric pipes installed using horizontal directional drilling.  The program uses the HDPE constitutive models as well as the pipe-soil interaction model developed in the study.  After evaluation, the developed program is employed in a parametric study on the sensitivity of short term and long term pipe response to different parameters, including the effect of overstressing the pipe during installation.&#xd;
&#xd;
As Multiaxial modeling is necessary for accurate analysis of some applications including the swagelining method, a uniaxial constitutive model developed in the current study is generalized to a multi-axial model that can simulate the response to biaxial stress-strain fields.  The multi-axial model is implemented in a finite element code and its performance in simulating multiaxial stress-strain fields is evaluated.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-13 09:43:55.515</description>
   <description>AJAX is a web application programming technique that allows portions of a web page to be loaded dynamically, separately from other parts of the web page. This gives the user a much smoother experience when viewing the web page. This technique also conserves bandwidth by transmitting only new data relevant to the user, keeping all other content on the web page unchanged. The migration from traditional round-trip web application to AJAX-based web application can be difficult to implement due to the many details required by AJAX.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, an approach is presented to automate the process of AJAX conversion using source transformation and backward slicing techniques. The result is an AJAX-based web page that will enhance the user experience and also conserve bandwidth.</description>

   <title>Dealing with a massacre : spectacle, eroticism, and unreliable narration in the Lemnian episode of Statius' Thebaid</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Classics) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-18 16:18:54.985</description>
   <description>I offer three readings of the Lemnian episode narrated by Hypsipyle in book five of the Thebaid, each based upon an interpretive tension created by textual, intertextual, and cultural factors and resolved by the death of Opheltes, the child nursed by Hypsipyle. In the first reading (chapter two), I suggest that Hypsipyle emphasizes the questionable nature of the evidence for the involvement of Venus and other divinities in the Lemnian massacre, which is on the surface quite obvious, as a subconscious strategy to deal with her fear of divine retribution against her and Opheltes. In the second reading (chapter three), I argue that much of the violence of the massacre is eroticized, primarily by allusions to Augustan elegy and Ovidian poetry, and that this eroticism challenges a straightforward, horrified reaction to the Lemnian episode. In the third reading (chapter four), which continues the argument of the second, I suggest that the reaction of Statius’ audience to the Lemnian massacre was influenced by familiarity with the violent entertainment offered in the Roman arena, and that this encouraged the audience to identify with the perpetrators of the massacre rather than the victims. The problematization of the audience’s reaction and of the divine involvement in the massacre is resolved by the death of Opheltes, which is portrayed as both undeniably supernatural in origin and emphatically tragic in nature. Thus, as the first half of the Thebaid draws to a close, Statius decisively affirms the power of the gods and the horrific tragedy of violence and prepares to embark upon the war in the Thebaid’s second half, which will end ultimately with the double fratricide of the sons of Oedipus and Statius’ prayer for future generations to forget this sin.</description>

   <description>State price density (SPD) and stochastic discount factor (SDF) are important elements&#xd;
in asset pricing. In this thesis, I first propose to use projection pursuit regression&#xd;
(PPR) and local polynomial regression (LPR) to estimate the SPD of interest rates nonparametrically.&#xd;
By using a similar approach, I also estimate the delta values in the interest rate options and discusses how to delta-hedge these options. Unlike SPD measured in a risk-neutral economy, SDF is implied by an asset pricing model. It displays which prices are reasonable given the returns in the current period. Hansen and Jagannathan (1997) develop the Hansen-Jagannathan distance (HJ-distance) to measure pricing errors produced by SDF. While the HJ-distance has several desirable properties, Ahn and Gadarowski (2004) find that the specification test based on the HJ-distance overrejects correct models too severely in commonly used sample size to provide a valid test. This thesis proposes to improve the finite sample properties of the HJ-distance test by applying the shrinkage method (Ledoit and Wolf, 2003) to compute its weighting matrix.</description>

   <description>Among the complications of current treatments for hemophilia A, the development of anti-FVIII antibodies including “FVIII inhibitors” remains the major clinical problem in treating hemophiliacs. Factor VIII inhibitors work through neutralizing the coagulation cofactor activity of the infused FVIII and preventing the restoration of normal hemostasis. This thesis explains the influence of genetic background on the generation of FVIII inhibitors, introduces a new pre-clinical approach that reduces the immunological response towards FVIII and predicts the in vivo behavior of recombinant and plasma-derived FVIII products in hemophilic patients.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, we studied the influence of the genetic background on the formation of FVIII antibodies by treating hemophilia A Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice with repetitive FVIII infusions. We observed that the C57BL/6 mice developed higher FVIII antibody titers than the Balb/c mice. Our results suggest that differences in the cytokine immune responses due to FVIII in Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice are responsible for the different FVIII antibody titers in each of these strains. &#xd;
&#xd;
Second, we investigated the use of FVIII-pulsed immature dendritic cells in inducing immune tolerance against FVIII prior to the FVIII treatment. We showed that in vivo, FVIII does not induce the activation and proliferation of hemophilic T cells. Furthermore, infusing FVIII-pulsed immature dendritic cells into hemophilic mice resulted in a long-term reduction in immune reactivity towards FVIII. Also, we have proposed methods on how to improve the tolerogenic abilities of dendritic cells. Our results indicate that the immature dendritic cells induced the formation of T regulatory cells and that these T regulatory cells were responsible for the observed reduction in immune reactivity.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we were able to identify the mechanisms behind the immune system activation in mice treated with either recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII products. We showed that plasma-derived FVIII results in reduced FVIII antibody titer formation in hemophilic mice. Our results demonstrate that the differences in antibody formation in hemophilic mice treated with either recombinant or plasma- derived FVIII products are due to the distinct cytokine micro-environment induced by each product. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis contributes to the current knowledge on FVIII immunology and the in vivo behavior of FVIII in hemophilic mice. The results generated from this thesis can be used to modify the available FVIII treatments in order to minimize the immunological complications of FVIII and improve the quality of life of hemophilic patients.</description>

   <description>This dissertation investigates the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade on firm level decisions and examines the effect of policy changes on aggregate productivity and welfare in open economies.  The first two chapters build an open economy model of FDI and&#xd;
trade where heterogeneous firms make simultaneous foreign investment and export decisions.  The theoretical model is estimated using Indonesian manufacturing data.  The estimated model is then used to perform a variety of counterfactual experiments to assess the positive and normative effects of international barriers to trade and FDI.  I find that the impact of FDI on aggregate productivity is at least three times the impact of international trade on aggregate productivity.&#xd;
&#xd;
The third chapter, co-authored with Hiroyuki Kasahara, investigates whether importing intermediate goods improves plant performance.  While addressing the issue of simultaneity between productivity shocks and the decision to import intermediates, we estimate the impact of the use of foreign intermediates on plants' productivity using plant-level Chilean manufacturing panel data. We find that by importing foreign intermediates, manufacturing plants can improve productivity.</description>

   <description>Model-based control and process optimization technologies are becoming more commonly used by chemical engineers. These algorithms rely on fundamental or empirical models that are frequently described by systems of differential equations with unknown parameters. It is, therefore, very important for modellers of chemical engineering processes to have access to reliable and efficient tools for parameter estimation in dynamic models.  The purpose of this thesis is to develop an efficient and easy-to-use parameter estimation algorithm that can address difficulties that frequently arise when estimating parameters in nonlinear continuous-time dynamic models of industrial processes. &#xd;
The proposed algorithm has desirable numerical stability properties that stem from using piece-wise polynomial discretization schemes to transform the model differential equations into a set of algebraic equations. Consequently, parameters can be estimated by solving a nonlinear programming problem without requiring repeated numerical integration of the differential equations. &#xd;
Possible modelling discrepancies and process disturbances are accounted for in the proposed algorithm, and estimates of the process disturbance intensities can be obtained along with estimates of model parameters and states. Theoretical approximate confidence interval expressions for the parameters are developed.  &#xd;
Through a practical two-phase nylon reactor example, as well as several simulation studies using stirred tank reactors, it is shown that the proposed parameter estimation algorithm can address difficulties such as: different types of measured responses with different levels of measurement noise, measurements taken at irregularly-spaced sampling times, unknown initial conditions for some state variables, unmeasured state variables, and unknown disturbances that enter the process and influence its future behaviour.</description>

   <description>An underlying goal of designers of some exercise video games is to increase people's motivation to exercise. Research in the field of exercise psychology shows that performing physical activity in groups increases exercise participation and adherence. However it is unclear whether the benefits of grouping apply to video games involving physical activity.&#xd;
&#xd;
This research investigates whether the motivational benefits of grouping translate to exercise games. We experimentally validate three properties of collaborative exercise games. Experiments were performed using a custom exercise game, designed with game requirements intended to increase exercise motivation. We discovered that the exercise enjoyment and engagement benefits of grouping do translate to exercise games: players preferred collaborative over single-player exercise games, and found our collaborative exercise game equally enjoyable and engaging in both co-located and distributed settings. Most interesting, non-exercisers and exercisers found the game equally enjoyable and engaging.&#xd;
&#xd;
These results indicate that collaborative exercise video games are a promising approach to helping with exercise enjoyment and engagement, and that developers should consider incorporating multiplayer support into their exercise games.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-25 17:02:58.559</description>
   <description>A few reasons taken together have led to the undertaking of this study: an urgent need to examine classroom teaching in the drastically growing teaching-Chinese-as-a-second/foreign-language (TCSL/TCFL) industry; a personal interest in probing a cross-cultural Chinese teacher’s treatment of communication in teaching; and the implications from theories of teacher beliefs and practice. &#xd;
    Thus, this study investigated how a TCFL teacher posits her teaching beliefs and practice in light of her communicative habits when facing a variety of tensions (e.g., those from culture, ideology, educational tradition, curricular prescription, and pedagogical trend). This qualitative case study was triangulated with multiple data sources: interviews, classroom observations, and document analysis, with an experienced teacher in Canada who has taught in both China and Canada.&#xd;
    The findings of the study supported the literature on teacher beliefs and practice, and on the implementation of communicative language teaching (CLT). The majority of this teacher’s practices were based on the premise that they corresponded to the actualization of her beliefs. Meanwhile, there existed a few minor gaps between her educational beliefs and practices. This teacher demonstrated adaptability in tailoring her teaching to be most suitable in meeting her educational needs and beliefs. This study first provides insights to TCFL classroom teaching and program development in North America with CLT implementation in this area. In addition, the results of the study have implications for the evolving process of teachers’ belief systems and patterns of practice and future research into this field.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Environmental Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-24 16:12:50.1</description>
   <description>For the nearly 70% of India’s population of 1.2 billion who reside in rural villages,&#xd;
agriculture is often the primary source of income, as well as of food, fodder and fuel. Rural agricultural systems are recognized as complex mixed-cropping-livestock systems, whereby primary and secondary products from one component of the system are used in another. For instance, primary products such as grain and milk from livestock can be used for human consumption, while secondary products such as crop residues can be used as fodder or fuel, while manure finds use as fertilizer. Variations in cropping pattern and intensity will determine the production potential of food, fodder and fuel within a region. As limiting factors, land area and&#xd;
yield must also be considered in agricultural planning activities. The present research aims to develop a rational method for crop selection within a particular agro-ecoregion. An optimization&#xd;
model is constructed to optimize for selected parameters that are set to maintain defined basic minimum standards for human nutritional and livestock fodder demands.&#xd;
An agricultural survey was carried out in 2007 for three villages in Karnataka State,&#xd;
India. All three villages were located within the dryland agro-ecozone, where crop yields are relatively low. The survey was stratified according to household landholding area ranging from&#xd;
marginal (0-1 ha) to large (>4 ha). Information was solicited on the demographic indicators of the population, the cropping cycle and cropping varieties used within the regions, and certain livestock parameters were gathered. Various demands, such as human food energy and protein requirements as well as fodder, and constraints, such as land area, were modeled to determine the&#xd;
potential for food, fodder and fuel production under optimal cropping pattern. The linear programming software, What’sBest, Version 9.0 from LINDO systems, was used to solve the optimization model.&#xd;
Results indicate that the current export-driven cropping pattern produces inadequate food to satisfy human nutritional demands at the village level, particularly among marginal and small households, who produce in the range of only 10 and 50 % of required food energy and protein, respectively, on a household basis. The current cropping pattern is also inadequate to satisfy&#xd;
village-wide livestock fodder demand, especially in villages heavily centered on cash crops,wherein only 30-40 % of fodder demand can be accounted for.&#xd;
On an individual household level, it is determined that a minimum 0.8 ha of land area is required to satisfy both food and fodder demands, placing strain on marginal households, who own less then 1 ha of land. The optimization model also demonstrates that it is possible to produce adequate food and fodder for both human and livestock consumption within the land area available in all the villages, if between 30-60% of land area is cultivated with food-based crops&#xd;
used for village wide consumption. This would require diversion of between 50 and 90 % of current land area under oilseeds and commercial crops to cereal based crops. In villages that cultivate sufficient proportion of cereal and pulse based food crops, as little as 4 % diversion of&#xd;
crops towards cereals may be necessary. Results also indicate that double cropping systems can generate crop residues sufficient to provide fuel for generation of 2.6-11.3 kWh/hh/day of electricity, adequate for cooking and lighting; this could be done at the same time as providing enough primary product to satisfy food and fodder needs.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-26 08:39:21.645</description>
   <description>Background: Long-term night shift work has been associated with multiple cancer sites, including breast, prostate, colon and endometrial. The mechanism for this effect is hypothesized to include the hormone melatonin; where increased light at night exposure during shift work reduces melatonin production and decreased melatonin levels are associated with increased cancer risk. In addition, physical activity has been shown to reduce cancer risk and existing laboratory studies indicate it has the potential to influence melatonin levels. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: A cross-sectional study of light intensity exposure, physical activity and melatonin levels was conducted among 61 rotating shift nurses at Kingston General Hospital. Light intensity exposure was measured using a light intensity data logger and melatonin concentrations were measured from urine and saliva samples, collected over a 24-hour period. Physical activity was assessed from a study questionnaire and one-day diary.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: A statistically significant inverse association between light exposure and urinary melatonin levels was observed; however, the relationship was no longer significant when stratified by shift group. Analysis of salivary melatonin levels demonstrated that circadian rhythms of melatonin production in night workers were not altered in timing, such that peak melatonin production occurred at night. No association between light exposure and the magnitude of salivary melatonin variation was observed. The relationship between recent physical activity and melatonin differed by shift group, with a positive association seen among day workers, while an inverse relationship was seen among night workers. There was no association between usual physical activity and melatonin in either shift group. Finally, no significant correlation was observed between sleep duration and melatonin among either day or night workers.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: While this study demonstrated an inverse relationship between light intensity and melatonin, the comparison of functional time points between day and night workers meant that differences in urinary melatonin levels between shift groups could be attributed to differences in the time of day when urine samples were collected. No consistent relationship between recent or usual physical activity and melatonin levels was observed in either shift group. Sleep duration was not correlated with urinary melatonin levels, suggesting it cannot be used as a proxy for melatonin production.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the application of the stochastic-flow-modeling (SFM) approach&#xd;
to represent the quality behavior of a manufacturing system. Initially, a simple,&#xd;
one-product type SFM is discussed and then a more complex multiple-product manufacturing system is developed. This quality SFM-based model has aggregation by station, product, and operational shift. Subsequently, potential supervisory control architectures that could be used in conjunction with this quality-based SFM are discussed and developed. Distribution parameter fitting is explored using static and adaptive approaches and a comparison between these two approaches is given. Then, the accuracy of the SFM modeling technique is demonstrated using two simulation examples.&#xd;
&#xd;
Effective equipment maintenance is essential for a manufacturing plant seeking to produce high quality products. The impact of equipment reliability and quality on throughput have been well established, but the relationship between maintenance and quality is not always clear nor direct. Therefore, after developing a SFM to&#xd;
represent the quality of a manufacturing system, the focus of this work shifts towards&#xd;
identifying correlations between maintenance and quality. This thesis describes a&#xd;
statistical modeling method that makes use of a Kalman filter to identify correlations&#xd;
between independent sets of maintenance and quality data. With such a method, maintenance efforts can be better prioritized to satisfy both production and quality requirements. In addition, this method is used to compare results from the theoretical maintenance-quality model to data from an actual manufacturing system. Results of the analysis indicate the potential for this method to be applied to preventive, as well as reactive maintenance decisions, since ageing aspects of equipment are also considered in the model.</description>

   <description>This thesis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the overall magnitude&#xd;
of intangible investment and the impact of this intangible investment on the behavior&#xd;
of the capital stock and on the value of capital goods.&#xd;
I begin by constructing a data set to document firms’ expenditures on an identi-&#xd;
fiable list of intangible items in Canada. I then examine the implications of treating&#xd;
intangible spending as the acquisition of final (investment) goods on estimates of GDP&#xd;
growth for Canada. I find that investment in intangible capital by 2002 is almost as&#xd;
large as the investment in physical capital. Furthermore, the growth in GDP and&#xd;
labor productivity may be underestimated by as much as 0.1 percentage point per&#xd;
year during this same period.&#xd;
I proceed by measuring the size of the stock of the intangible capital in Canada&#xd;
using newly released data on the market value of all securities in the economy. The&#xd;
approach taken relies on a quantitative application of the q-theory of investment to&#xd;
generate the quantity of capital owned by firms. I find that the intangible capital&#xd;
stock accounted for approximately 30% of overall capital since 1994. Of this, the&#xd;
R&amp;D reported by national accounts makes up only 23%. These results imply that&#xd;
official Canadian statistics failed to account for 26% of the value of the capital stock&#xd;
in their 2005 quarterly data collection. &#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, I extend the q-theory of investment to model explicitly the decision of&#xd;
firms to invest in intangibles. I then use the model to measure the contribution of&#xd;
intangible goods to the overall capital stock in the U.S. The model departs from&#xd;
the one mentioned earlier in that it highlights the embodiment of intangible goods&#xd;
in tangibles and the role of relative price movements in the measurement of the&#xd;
contribution of each type of investment to the overall capital stock. I find that the&#xd;
growth in the overall capital stock from the late-80s until 2000 was driven mainly by&#xd;
an increase in the contribution of intangibles. However, the contribution of intangibles&#xd;
fell consistently after 2000. These results underscore the importance of accounting&#xd;
for the movements in the price of intangibles rather than focusing only on their rising&#xd;
share in overall investment.</description>

   <description>Research in the field of developmental psychology has highlighted the importance of structured activities in providing positive experiences and outcomes for youth. In particular, youth participation in organized sport has been linked to the development of physical, motor, and psychosocial skills. Although these outcomes have been discussed in the sport psychology literature, it is not clear how positive youth development may be facilitated through sport. An ecological approach was used to examine developmental processes, personal characteristics, contextual factors, and time elements that may be linked to youth sport participation and positive development.&#xd;
	Study 1 used a quantitative methodology to examine the relationship between developmental asset possession and youth sport outcomes such as burnout and enjoyment. Of the eight asset categories examined, four emerged as significant predictors of burnout and/or enjoyment. Specifically, positive identity, support, and empowerment were linked to burnout and positive identity, empowerment, and social competencies were linked to enjoyment. &#xd;
	Study 2 also utilized a quantitative methodology in order to investigate differences between a group of youth sport “specializers” and a group of youth sport “samplers”. Outcomes including burnout, enjoyment, and developmental assets were compared as well as experiences in sport. The groups did not differ in developmental asset possession or in sources of enjoyment. However, “samplers” reported more experiences integrating sport, family, and community whereas “specializers” were more likely to have more experiences with diverse peer groups. The “specializers” also reported higher levels of burnout (i.e., exhaustion) relating to their sport participation.&#xd;
 	Study 3 examined the development of positive youth within a sport specialization context. Through the use of interviews with elite youth sport coaches and practice observations, four characteristics (i.e., appropriate training structure, opportunities for personal and social development, opportunities for physical and motor skill development, and the presence of supportive interactions) were developed outlining how elite sport settings can enable the development of positive youth. &#xd;
	This line of research highlighted the key role of the sport experience in promoting positive youth development. If youth sport programs are delivered with an emphasis on skill development in conjunction with the growth of key assets and an appropriate contextual experience, young people have the potential to emerge as healthy, secure, and positive citizens who feel valued and invested within their homes and communities.</description>

   <title>Impossible Speech: 19th-century women poets and the dramatic monologue</title>

   <description>This study seeks to redress the continued exclusion of women poets from the theorization of the dramatic monologue.  I argue that an unacknowledged consensus on the definition of the dramatic monologue exists, in spite of the oft-proclaimed absence of one, and that it is the failure to recognize this consensus which has in part debarred women poets from the theorization of the form.  In particular, the failure to acknowledge this consensus has led recent feminist critics attempting to “rethink” the dramatic monologue, such as Cynthia Scheinberg and Glennis Byron, to reinscribe the very model they are attempting to rewrite by admitting into their analysis only those poems which already conform to the existing model.  In consequence, these critics inadvertently repeat the exclusion they are attempting to redress by reinscribing a model which is predicated—as both Scheinberg and Byron acknowledge—on the exclusion of women poets.  In order to end this cycle of exclusion, my project begins from a different beginning, with Hemans instead of Browning, and traces her innovations and influence across the dramatic monologues of two key dramatic monologists of the 19th-century, Augusta Webster and Amy Levy.  In the hands of all three women poets, the dramatic monologue develops into a form which calls into question not only the nature of the self, as is characteristic of Browning’s model, but more crucially, the possibility of the subject.  Their poems persistently dramatize what Judith Butler calls “impossible speech”—speech that is not recognized as the speech of a subject—and thereby challenges the model of authoritative speaking which underpins both men’s dramatic monologues and the prevailing theory of women’s as a clutch for linguistic freedom, power and authority.  This project therefore has dual aims: to complicate our current conception of the dramatic monologue by placing the women’s dramatic monologues in conversation with the larger tradition of the form; and to complicate our understanding of 19th-century women poets’ conception and constructions of female subjectivity by re-theorizing their poetic strategies in the development of the dramatic monologue.</description>

   <description>This thesis uses a macroeconomic approach to study labour adjustments following&#xd;
sector-specific shocks. I develop a general model, investigate its dynamic adjustment&#xd;
process and apply it to study the Canadian economy in 2002–2006. This episode is an&#xd;
interesting case study because it features a significant labour reallocation to the resource sector and away from manufacturing, precipitated by an increase in global commodity prices and an associated exchange rate appreciation. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results establish that impediments to the adjustment process are economically&#xd;
significant in the aggregate for this episode, imposing costs of up to three percent of output during the transition. These findings augment several studies that suggest individual workers can face large and persistent earnings losses during job turnover. However, unlike previous research, I use the search and matching approach — which incorporates explicit labour market frictions — to uncover the sources of these costs for the macroeconomy. The findings emphasize that job loss itself is not particularly important quantitatively,&#xd;
but rather the non-transferability of skills during job turnover is a key concern.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, I investigate how labour market policy impacts the economy’s response to&#xd;
sector-specific shocks by analyzing a counterfactual policy change in unemployment benefits and improved skill acquisition through faster learning and training subsidies. The results reveal interesting policy trade-offs. First, I find that increasing unemployment benefits prolongs the economy’s adjustment, reduces employment, output and welfare and increases unemployment incidence and duration. However, because this policy impacts high-productivity and low-productivity sectors differently, it shifts the composition of the remaining jobs towards high-productivity sectors, thereby raising aggregate productivity and also reduces wage inequality. Second, I find that faster skill acquisition has the potential to deliver large economic gains in the long-run, but requires up-front investment costs which entail reduced economic performance in the short-run.</description>

   <description>Autonomic Computing is an approach to designing systems that are capable of self-management. Fundamental to the autonomic ideal is a software's awareness of  and ability to tune parameters that affect metrics like performance and security. Traditionally, these parameters are tuned by human experts with extensive knowledge of parameter names and effects---existing software was not designed to be self-tuning. Efforts to automate the isolation and tuning of parameters have yielded encouraging results. However, the parameters are identified manually. This thesis proposes the adaptation of reverse engineering  techniques for automating the recovery of software tuning parameters. Tuning parameters from several industrially relevant applications are studied for patterns of use. These patterns are used to classify the parameters into a taxonomy, and to develop a metamodel of the source code elements and relationships needed to express them. An extractor is then built to obtain instances of the relationships from source code. The relationships are represented as graphs, which are manipulated and queried for instances of tuning parameter patterns. The recovery is implemented as a tool for finding tuning parameters in applications. Experimental results show that the approach is effective at recovering documented tuning parameters, as well as other undocumented ones. The results also indicate that the tuning parameter patterns are not specific to a particular application, or application domain.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines a moment in recent U.S. immigration history where an opportunity was created to move towards merit-based immigration, but that proposal was rejected. In addition to the highly publicized proposal for the legalization of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, the 2007 Immigration Reform Bill proposed a merit-based immigrant selection policy, or “Point System.” The new system would have evaluated potential immigrants according to characteristics deemed to be in the U.S. “national interest.” Critical discourse analysis of policy documents, media coverage in The New York Times and San Diego Union Tribune, and political rhetoric on the floor of the U.S. Senate reveals a distinct moral geography to selection policy. Whereas in Canada, economic immigration is the popularly endorsed mode of immigrant selection, the U.S. “Point System” proposal launched a diatribe by politicians and pundits, who called merit-based immigration “an experiment in social engineering” (Barack Obama 2007), against a “natural” human and “moral imperative” to reunite families (Robert Menendez 2007). This thesis demonstrates the complexity of the relationship between race and class, and how its complexity, when considered against the backdrop of immigration policy reform, becomes bound up in state endeavours to form and perpetuate national identity through discourses of citizenship. The U.S. economy’s need for transient labour conflicts with the state’s nation-building project: one that excludes Hispanic migrants. The moral crisis over the dismantling of family reunification in the U.S. serves as a competing discourse to the existing anxiety about Latino immigration and undocumented migrants, and as discussion, albeit veiled, of whether or not it is morally right to construct an immigration policy that disadvantages certain groups, most notably Latinos.</description>

   <description>Soft iterative detection and decoding techniques have been shown to be able to achieve near-capacity performance in multiple-antenna systems. To obtain the optimal soft information by marginalization over the entire observation space is intractable; and the current literature is unable to guide us towards the best way to obtain the suboptimal soft information. In this thesis, several existing soft-input soft-output (SISO) detectors, including minimum mean-square error-successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC), list sphere decoding (LSD), and Fincke-Pohst maximum-a-posteriori (FPMAP), are examined. Prior research has demonstrated that LSD and FPMAP outperform soft-equalization methods (i.e., MMSE-SIC); however, it is unclear which of the two scheme is superior in terms of performance-complexity trade-off. A comparison is conducted to resolve the matter. In addition, an improved scheme is proposed to modify LSD and FPMAP, providing error performance improvement and a reduction in computational complexity simultaneously. Although list-type detectors such as LSD and FPMAP provide outstanding error performance, issues such as the optimal initial sphere radius, optimal radius update strategy, and their highly variable computational complexity are still unresolved. A new detection scheme is proposed to address the above issues with fixed detection complexity, making the scheme suitable for practical implementation.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: The health of Aboriginal children and families has been negatively influenced by existing social and economic disparities, dramatic lifestyle disruption, social marginalization, inactivity, dietary change, and lower rates of educational attainment (in comparison with non-Aboriginal populations). Interventions to reduce these risks should emphasize a wholistic approach, consistent with indigenous understandings of the interconnectedness of physical, spiritual, mental and emotional wellbeing. Some positive effects have been seen in family based interventions promoting health, however researchers do not yet know how best to leverage the influence of family through these interventions. This study takes a community-based participatory approach and ecological perspective to develop tailored strategies and resources to engage families in supporting wholistic health messages received through AKWE:GO (a community-based outreach program for at-risk urban Aboriginal youth). &#xd;
PURPOSE: To discover what activities families (i.e., parents and children) associate with wholistic health, as well as any barriers, facilitators, and competition faced when attempting to engage in health behaviours. Findings will be used to inform the development of take-home packages for AKWE:GO families promoting wholistic health. &#xd;
METHODS: Fifteen women and 4 men (most are parents of AKWE:GO participants), and 13 girls and 10 boys involved in the AKWE:GO program at the Native Friendship Centres in Kingston and Owen Sound participated in one of 6 sharing circles (4 in Kingston, 2 in Owen Sound). Adults and children attended separate circles, which were facilitated by the AKWE:GO coordinators. Sharing circle questions were centered on wholistic health and based on principles of social marketing. Discussions were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Inductive and deductive content analysis was performed, supported by NVivo 8 software. &#xd;
RESULTS: Findings from deductive analysis indicate that AKWE:GO families consider engagement in physical activity, traditional activities, healthy eating, budgeting, and meaningful conversation with significant others to be conducive to wholistic health.  Inductive analysis of parent discussions revealed differences in community readiness between Kingston and Owen Sound. &#xd;
CONCLUSION: Results highlight the importance of considering population needs and community-readiness when developing health promotion strategies and resources for a given population.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2008-06-30 15:23:07.094</description>
   <description>The 17th century was quite nakedly a period of nation-building, cultural dislocation, and renegotiation of status within the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As a binding legal document formulated on Puritan religious principles The Body of Liberties mapped out the relationship of the church to the commonwealth, the Commonwealth to the male head of household, and the head of the household to the wife, children, and servants. By formalizing what had previously been a matter of custom and tradition, this early document solidified the social hierarchy and brought it under the purview of law. It was within this context that the first legal prohibition against domestic violence was formulated in the West, dictating that “Every marryed woeman shall be free from bodilie correction or stripes by her husband, unless it be in his own defence upon her assault” (excerpt from the Body of Liberties cited in Pleck 1987:21-22). Given that this migrant culture lay at the precipice of change (geographically displaced and in the process of displacing), and because they were equipped with the technical means to ‘fix’ these relations through law backed by force and sanction, it is reasonable to ask: ‘Why this law?’ ‘Why now?’ and ‘Toward what effects?’ &#xd;
       I begin by arguing against Pleck’s (1987,1989) claim that the Massachusetts Bay Colony devised a law against domestic violence out of humanitarian concern for women. By describing the socio-political context in which this law was one small aspect of a much broader and somewhat fragmented endeavor to assert ‘order’ and to establish authority, I argue that it would be a mistake to emphasize its prohibitive message over and above its productive and often contradictory effects. Drawing from Haskins insights on 17th century English legal tactics, and Roberts-Millers (1999) analysis of Puritan logic and language use, I warn against reading Puritan rhetoric or legal discourse literally, or ignoring the ways in which a complex system of regulatory controls and discursive slippages interacts to produce unexpected effects. When this new law prohibiting domestic violence is placed within this context, new insights and new questions emerge.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Physiology) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-02 14:17:41.602</description>
   <description>Breathlessness during activity is increasingly recognized as a common symptom in the elderly, in older individuals with minor airway obstruction due to tobacco smoking, and in those with obesity. The underlying mechanisms of perceived respiratory difficulty in each of these populations remain unknown and are largely unstudied.&#xd;
Objective: The main purpose of this original research was to elucidate the alterations in central ventilatory drive and in dynamic ventilatory mechanics that might explain the origin of increased breathlessness during exercise in these three populations.&#xd;
General Hypothesis:  In individuals with largely preserved resting pulmonary function, increased intensity of breathlessness during activity will arise as a result of measurable abnormalities of dynamic ventilatory mechanics, central respiratory drive, or both in combination. &#xd;
General Methods: We examined sensory-mechanical relationships during cardio-pulmonary exercise testing in each population (total n=146). We compared indices of ventilatory control (ventilation, pulmonary gas exchange and metabolic load), dynamic mechanics (breathing pattern and operating lung volumes) and ratings of dyspnea intensity in three well characterized cohorts:  elderly versus younger; smokers with minor airway obstruction versus age-matched non-smokers, and obese versus lean participants.&#xd;
Results:  Individuals across all three study populations had preserved resting pulmonary function. Compared with their respective control groups all three symptomatic groups demonstrated consistent abnormalities  in dynamic airway function during exercise [expiratory flow limitation (EFL), dynamic increases in end expiratory lung volume, and restricted tidal volume response]; all  had greater ventilatory requirements reflecting variable ventilation-perfusion and metabolic abnormalities. In all three groups, intensity of breathlessness increased as ventilatory demand approached capacity. In the elderly (with or without airway obstruction), breathlessness intensity ratings at a standardized ventilation during exercise correlated with indices of mechanical volume restriction secondary to EFL. In obese individuals, increased ventilatory drive secondary to increased metabolic loading (and not mechanical abnormalities) was the primary factor contributing to exertional breathlessness. &#xd;
Conclusion: Although the origin of breathlessness during physical exertion in the elderly (with or without minor airway obstruction) and in obese individuals is multi-factorial, we identified the central etiological importance of the combination of increased ventilatory drive and restrictive dynamic mechanical constraints to increasing ventilation.</description>

   <description>Rhinoceroses are arguably the most endangered of all large mammal taxa.  In order for ongoing conservation of this species to be successful, it is crucial to accurately characterize the remaining genetic diversity for all rhinoceros species.&#xd;
	To do this, I optimized a standard suite of 24 taxon-specific rhinoceros microsatellite loci.  These loci have the power to provide the most comprehensive estimate of comparative microsatellite genetic diversity within and among the four extant African and Asian rhinoceros genera. &#xd;
	These loci were further used to evaluate the comparative influences of rhinoceros species versus microsatellite taxonomic origin as predictors of rhino microsatellite diversity, and finally to examine the evolutionary relationships between extant rhino taxa.  &#xd;
	The African black michaeli rhino subspecies had the highest level of microsatellite genetic variability of all available rhinos, while southern white and Indian rhinos were the least variable rhinos.  These findings also suggested that species and taxonomic origin of microsatellite loci were both significant predictors of microsatellite heterozygosity in rhinoceroses.  &#xd;
	A weak association between the Sumatran and black rhinos was found with a DLR neighbour-joining tree.&#xd;
	The standard loci were able to assign unique genotypes to all available rhinos as well as differentiate between all rhino species by correctly assigning individual rhinos back to their respective populations.</description>

   <description>The fps proto-oncogene encodes a 92 kDa cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. Previous studies have shown that Fps expression in the mammary gland changes with development, and Fps has a suppressor function in mammary tumorigenesis. The aim of my thesis was to elucidate the role of the Fps tyrosine kinase in regulating mammary gland development and function. We have shown that the expression of the Fps kinase in the mammary gland increased during pregnancy and reached its maximum during lactation. The level of Fps tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled the expression pattern.  Pups reared by fps-null females gained weight more slowly than those reared by wild-type females. Epithelial cells were the primary source of Fps expression. Milk protein and fat content were not affected by the absence of Fps. Similarly, no differences in mammary gland structure were observed with whole mount or histological analysis.&#xd;
Fps was shown to be in a multi-protein complex with E-cadherin, β-catenin and p120-catenin. A strong co-localization signal was observed for Fps and E-cadherin. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin was disorganized and less concentrated at sites of cell-cell contacts in the fps-null glands. The interactions between the different adherens junction components were altered in the fps-null tissue. Specifically, less E-cadherin and β-catenin was associated with p120-catenin in the fps-null glands. Suprisingly, no phosphotyrosine differences were detected for the adherens junction components.&#xd;
Conditions were established to grow primary murine epithelial cell cultures that could be used to investigate the function of Fps. Fps expression was up-regulated in these cells in response to lactogenic hormones. A lentiviral system encoding a murine p53 shRNA sequence was used to increase the growth potential of the primary cells. Continual growth of the infected and uninfected primary epithelial cell mixture resulted in the establishment of an immortalized cell line. Immunofluorescent and immunoblot analyses revealed that the cells have undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. With the transduction of a myc-epitope tagged Fps into the cells, we have generated cell lines with the appropriate genetic backgrounds to study the function of the Fps kinase in the mammary gland, specifically as it relates to tumorigenesis.</description>

   <description>Germany has historically been a country where peoples from various countries have worked and settled, and diverse cultures have existed. Yet, German schools still adhere to what could be described as assimilative and deficit-oriented practices (Gogolin &amp; Krüger-Potratz, 2006; Schanz, 2006). In addition, the German education system has a high degree of social selection (Auernheimer, 2006a) that creates severe educational inequities between German and immigrant students. After four years of primary school, students are streamed into one of the three major secondary school types Gymnasium, Realschule, and Hauptschule, based on achievement. Since these schools provide education of varying quality, students are denied equal opportunities.&#xd;
      	The purpose of this study is to explore and critically analyze possible ways to alleviate the existing inequities in the German school system, which are reflected in the achievement gap between immigrant and German mainstream students (Hormel &amp; Scherr, 2004; Schofield, 2006). Using a case study approach, I analyze the educational work of the award-winning German primary school “Kleine Kielstraße” located in Dortmund with a culturally and linguistically diverse student population, situated in a socially disadvantaged district. My purpose was to gain insight into the school’s practices and strategies for recognizing diverse students and for striving to provide equitable education for all students. &#xd;
Despite the strategic steps taken by this school based on the competence and the enthusiasm of the principal and staff, it is quite evident that structural changes in the highly selective, three-tiered German secondary school system are required before educators can effectively challenge the built-in inequities. Though the German school system is designed and programmed to discriminate and deny equal opportunity, the participating school demonstrates a pedagogical approach that provides more equitable education for all students regardless of their cultural background and ethnicity. This thesis explores these strategies of the school to create an understanding that a progressive “Intercultural Pedagogy” can go a long way in providing a better education despite structural inequities.</description>

   <description>A numerical model that predicts high temperature pressure vessel rupture was developed.  The finite element method of analysis was used to determine the effects that various parameters had on pressure vessel failure.  The work was concerned with 500, 1000 and 33000 US gallon pressure vessels made of SA 455 steel.  Experimental pressure vessel fire tests have shown that vessel rupture in a fully engulfing fire can occur in less than 30 minutes.  This experimental work was used both to validate the numerical results as well as to provide important vessel temperature distribution information.     &#xd;
	Due to the fact that SA 455 steel is not meant for high temperature applications, there was little published high temperature material data.  Therefore, elevated temperature tensile tests and creep rupture tests were performed to measure needed material properties.  Creep and creep damage constants were calculated from SA 455 steel’s creep rupture data.  &#xd;
	The Kachanov One-State Variable technique and the MPC Omega method were the creep damage techniques chosen to predict SA 455 steel’s high temperature time-dependent behaviour.  The specimens used in the mechanical testing were modeled to numerically predict the creep rupture behaviour measured in the lab.  An extensive comparison between the experimental and numerical uniaxial creep rupture results revealed that both techniques could adequately predict failure times at all tested conditions; however, the MPC Omega method was generally more accurate at predicting creep failure strains.  The comparison also showed that the MPC Omega method was more numerically stable than the One-State Variable technique when analyzing SA 455 steel’s creep rupture.&#xd;
	The creep models were modified to account for multiaxial states of stress and were used to analyze the high temperature failure of pressure vessels.  The various parameters considered included pressure vessel dimensions, fire type (fully engulfing or local impingement), peak wall temperature and internal pressure.  The objective of these analyses was to gain a better understanding of the structural failure of pressure vessels exposed to various accidental fire conditions.  &#xd;
	The numerical results of rupture time and geometry of failure region were shown to agree with experimental fire tests.  From the fully engulfing fire numerical analyses, it was shown that pressure vessels with a smaller length to diameter ratio and a larger thickness to diameter ratio were inherently safer.  It was also shown that as the heated area was reduced, the failure time increased for the same internal pressure and peak wall temperature.  Therefore, fully engulfing fires produced more structurally unstable conditions in pressure vessels then local fire impingements.</description>

   <description>Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an attractive model for discovering biomarkers and elucidating mechanisms of tumour progression. We hypothesized that alterations in the expression of proteins with known roles in cancer biology and hematological cells might correlate with clinical outcome and thereby shed light on biological mechanisms. Sections from a tissue microarray (TMA) containing FL samples from 67 patients were immunostained for candidate biomarkers, including p53, p16INK4a, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, MUM1, PML, phospho-ERK, and p27Kip1. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to identify markers that correlate significantly (p&lt;0.05) with overall survival (OS). The chi-squared or Fisher exact test were used to examine associations between histological markers and baseline clinical features, including the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score. Expression of p16INK4a or p53, or absent CD10 expression correlated with poor survival. Patients with p16INK4a-negative tumours had a median OS of 13.4 years compared to 8.3 years for those with p16INK4a-positive tumours (p=0.006). Expression of p16INK4a was significantly associated with low hemoglobin, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high histological grade, high cell proliferation index, presence of associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-risk FLIPI classification. Our observation of a positive association between p16INK4a expression and indicators of tumour aggressiveness is novel and perhaps surprising since loss of the INK4a tumour suppressor gene is one of the most frequently observed lesions in human cancers, including lymphoma. Expression of p16INK4a may be part of a cellular response to unidentified pro-mitotic mutations, such as deleterious mutations of the RB tumour suppressor gene, associated with more aggressive instances of FL. Immunostaining FL diagnostic biopsies for expression of p16INK4a may serve as an informative prognostic biomarker to aid clinicians managing FL patients.</description>

   <description>Pain catastrophizing is a robust predictor of heightened pain report. However, theoretical models addressing mechanisms of catastrophizing are lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine whether high and low catastrophizers manifest differential psychophysiological arousal patterns in an experimental laboratory pain setting. Gender differences and covariates were also examined. Participants were 102 undergraduate students (56 female, 46 male) at Queen’s University recruited from the Psychology 100 subject pool aged 17-28 years (M = 18.44, SD = 1.40). After deleting participants with missing data, n = 95 for pain report/psychological variables, and n = 93 for psychophysiological measures. Participants were pre-screened using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) from which individuals were selected from the top third (i.e., PCS score ≥ 24) and the bottom third (i.e., PCS score ≤ 13) of the distribution to represent high and low catastrophizers respectively. Participants completed measures of depression and anxiety before participating in a cold pressor task. Participants’ heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were recorded during periods of baseline (3 minutes), pain induction (1 minute), and pain recovery (10 minutes). The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) was completed following the recovery period. Results showed that catastrophizing was related to greater pain intensity during pain induction and during pain recovery, as well as greater retrospective sensory and affective reports of pain. Women reported greater pain intensity during pain induction, during pain recovery, and greater retrospective reports of sensory pain. These effects were significant even when controlling for depression and anxiety. With regard to psychophysiological arousal, catastrophizing was related to higher HR during pain induction. There also appeared to be trends suggesting that catastrophizing may also be associated with HR before and after pain induction. Results provide partial support for an appraisal model of catastrophizing and may be useful in informing future models implicating catastrophizing in the development and maintenance of chronic pain.</description>

   <description>The city of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia has been labeled an “asthma hot spot” attributed to mining activity, prompting further investigation into toxic elements (Lee et al., 2006). Inhalation of nickel-bearing particles is a particular concern due to the presence of a nickel smelter 10km upwind of the city. The toxicological properties of nickel are well-documented, thus the primary objective is the characterization of phases identified as problematic in the lungs. To determine the smelter’s influence on nickel bioaccessibility in the soils throughout the city of Kalgoorlie, surface soil samples were taken from areas within the city and compared to soils near the smelter and outside the city, distant from the smelter. Soils were sieved to isolate the respirable fraction (&lt;10um) potentially associated with lung disease and analyzed using a simulated lung fluid to determine the concentration of nickel soluble in the lungs. The soluble nickel represents the fraction that may be involved in allergic or asthmatic reactions, while the insoluble compounds may be of concern as some are carcinogenic. Further soil characterization was done using a six step sequential extraction and mineralogical analysis to identify nickel-bearing minerals. The influence of the smelter activity on nickel bioaccessibility in the soils within Kalgoorlie is low, but soils near the smelter host significantly higher nickel concentrations and higher bioaccessibility. Respiratory nickel bioaccessibility in soils ranges from 1 to 3% in and outside the city of Kalgoorlie, while the area surrounding the smelter increases to up to 6.8%. In each case, there is a direct correlation between bioaccessibility percent and percent nickel bound in the water-soluble and exchangeable fractions, but the simulated lung fluid dissolves more nickel in each sample than is present in these two fractions, potentially due to the presence of weak chelating agents in the solution. Respiratory bioaccessibility is low in Kalgoorlie soils because nickel occurs primarily in sulfides, with minor oxides and silicates, all relatively insoluble in lung fluid. However, the high concentrations of these compounds could be of concern, as they are potential carcinogens at high concentrations.&#xd;

   <description>Thesis (Master, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-08 00:31:46.107</description>
   <description>In June 2005, fieldwork was conducted during the spring snowmelt period at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut to examine the relationships between snow accumulation, runoff, and nutrient fluxes in two High Arctic watersheds.  The snowcover was quantified by means of eleven depth and three density measurements at 42 survey transects (100 m) distributed throughout the West and East watersheds.  River discharge was monitored at the watershed outlets, where water samples were collected four times daily during the first ten days of melt and twice daily once flow receded.  Water samples were also collected from headwater and tributary sites in the two watersheds, and samples were analyzed for DOC, DON and DIN (NH4+ and NO3-).&#xd;
&#xd;
An objective terrain classification weighted equally on slope, aspect and land surface curvature was applied to the two watersheds using an ISODATA unsupervised classification scheme to determine watershed SWE.  The terrain model confirmed that topography likely explains greater SWE in the West watershed, and provides a method for reproducible estimates of watershed SWE in future years.  However, improved methods for estimating SWE in channels and deep snowbanks are required to ensure accurate assessments of watershed SWE.&#xd;
&#xd;
The seasonal trends in DOC, DON, and DIN concentrations and specific fluxes are reported for both watersheds.  The export of DON and DIN was strongly correlated with DOC in the West watershed, indicating that the flushing of terrestrial nutrients from surficial soils by snowmelt runoff governs nutrient export.  Despite less watershed SWE (51%), the East watershed exported greater specific fluxes of DOC (33%) and DON (43%) during the melt season.  This suggests that the East watershed had greater connectivity with OM sources early in the melt season.  Furthermore, low DOC:DON ratios (&lt; 15) in the East River indicate that a larger portion of DOM was likely derived from algal or microbial sources in the East watershed relative to the West watershed.  The export of DIN was similar in the two watersheds, and results suggest that DIN export was likely controlled by watershed vegetation coverage and runoff volumes during snowmelt.</description>

   <description>This study was born out of the Telephone Peer Support Group Program for Women with Spinal Cord Injury Living in Small Communities and Rural Areas in Ontario, funded by the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation. It represents the final chapter in the evaluation process of this innovative and participatory program, which produced positive results for a majority of women who took part in it. A phenomenological approach according to Moustakas was used to deepen the understanding and describe the participants’ experience of the program. The seven women who took part in the program contributed their narratives. &#xd;
&#xd;
Emotional support and learning were the main structures of the experience as reported by the women. The program was a space where participants gave and received emotional support through sharing, connecting and exchange. &#xd;
&#xd;
Participants who differed from the majority in the group because of the nature of their injury did not benefit as much from the program. &#xd;
&#xd;
For true peers, the program was a space of “real understanding” and learning in which participants’ perceptions of self were shaped and new identities found, where loneliness was replaced with the feeling of belonging and “not being alone”. It was the space where the bodily aspects of SCI and the socially constructed roles of women were examined, where solutions for health and lifestyle issues were discussed and embraced, and where relationships with others developed into the positive interactions of informed and empowered individuals. &#xd;
&#xd;
The women with SCI attributed changes in their attitudes and behaviours to participation in this program. Reported changes ranged from increased knowledge about a proactive and healthy lifestyle, to completed annual medical check-ups, changed pain treatment, changed dietary and exercise regimes, to the establishment of a web-site with information about a healthy and proactive life for women with SCI.&#xd;
For the majority of participants in this program, it was an enriching and life changing experience which has a huge potential for reaching isolated women with SCI. For service providers, the program was an opportunity to provide services to underserved populations, impacting their quality of life by using cheap and accessible technology. For participatory researchers it was a rewarding experience of seeing immediate benefits reported by satisfied research participants.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis was to develop a concept and methodologies for designing a total knee replacement (TKR) with normal kinematics and a high range of motion. The design philosophy was that a TKR can function similar to the normal knee, provided that after TKR the inherent passive characteristics of the joint are restored to normal with minimum disruption in the functions of the remaining structures of the joint.&#xd;
As the first step prior to design, cadaver experiments were conducted and biomechanical models of the passive knee were developed to study the mechanics of the normal knee. The guiding roles of the tibial articular surface including the menisci, the combined effects of the cruciates and contact forces, and the elongation patterns of the cruciates were investigated. Based on the results obtained from these studies and the relevant information in the literature, design requirements for a TKR with normal kinematics were identified, and an innovative design concept was introduced. On the medial compartment of this design the shape of the articular surfaces resembled a ball-and-socket joint, and on the lateral side a pair of guiding bearing surfaces mimicked the guiding roles of the cruciate ligaments.&#xd;
The novelty in the design concept lies in the design of the shape of the lateral articular surfaces. The progressive variations of the curvature of the medial and lateral aspects of the lateral condyle generate the desired guiding effect for the full cycle of extension and flexion. The bearing spacing defined as the distance between the medial and lateral contact points was kept constant throughout the motion, as this was proved to be necessary to ensure compatibility between the geometry of the bearing surfaces and the desired pattern of motion. Appropriate methodologies were developed to generate the complete shapes of the bearing surfaces and to build the prototypes based on the constraints of the bone geometries and kinematics of a sample cadaver knee. The kinematic test of the prototype proved the viability of the design concept and methodologies. The novel design philosophy, concept and methodologies developed in this thesis provide a foundation for a new generation of TKR with normal kinematics.</description>

   <description>This thesis will look at the use of the description of setting as a means to enhance and define character in the apologos of the Odyssey. The approach to this study will be two-fold. First, the descriptions of the various locales in the poem help establish a first impression of the characters that dwell within them. Second, and more importantly, the characters’ reaction and response to that setting further defines their character-traits, revealing their inner self to the audience. While this phenomenon is most commonly found with characters in their own setting, it can also be quite informative for characters in a foreign setting.&#xd;
	The main type of description on which I will focus is that generally found at the beginning of each respective episode. These descriptions are marked by a break in the narrative and set the scene for the remainder of the episode. I consider only descriptions longer than the formulaic noun-adjective combinations or the epithets found throughout the poem. While the latter two types are important, I will mention them only in comparison with the former type.&#xd;
	In Chapter Three I will focus on this relationship between description and character with regard to the Cyclopes and Phaeacians, although other scenes will be mentioned. In Chapter Four I will focus on the Lotus-Eaters, Sirens, Calypso, Circe, the Nymphs on Ithaca, and the realm of the afterlife.</description>

   <description>ABORIGINALITY, EXISTING ABORIGINAL RIGHTS AND STATE ACCOMMODATION IN CANADA: ABSTRACT&#xd;
	The central focus of this dissertation is the relationship between aboriginality, aboriginal rights and state accommodation in Canada.  The work considers how the existence of a plurality of conceptions of aboriginality impacts the capacity of aboriginal rights to protect and accommodate this collective identity.  This dissertation takes the position that aboriginal rights, as they are currently constructed in Canada, cannot account for the existence of this definitional multiplicity, and so impose serious limits on the degree to which aboriginality is accommodated and protected by the state.  This case is built by looking at Supreme Court cases that deal with Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.  The investigation contained herein examines the written legal submissions of the aboriginal and non-aboriginal participants in these cases, as well as the Court’s decisions, in an effort to trace the various articulations of aboriginality put forward by the parties.  &#xd;
	The dissertation demonstrates that, even though there is a multiplicity of conceptions of aboriginality – in other words, the aboriginal litigants, the provinces, the federal government and the Supreme Court justices advance different and often competing conceptions of aboriginality – aboriginal rights are constructed to protect and accommodate a single, particular vision of this collective identity.  Moreover, this version of aboriginality does not coincide with the version of this collective identity advanced by the aboriginal litigants themselves.  Consequently, the work in this dissertation argues that aboriginal rights fail to accommodate and protect aboriginal peoples’ collective identities and pose a substantial threat to these identities.</description>

   <description>Mitochondrial biogenesis requires an intricate transcriptional coordination between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to establish the structural and functional components of the organelle. This coordination is paramount in vertebrate muscles where oxidative capacity must be adjusted to meet varying energy demands. I investigated the regulatory circuits controlling mitochondrial content in vertebrate muscle in the context of development, adaptation to nutritional status and temperature, and in an evolutionary perspective. &#xd;
Initial experiments focused on the role of transcriptional regulators in the metabolic changes in the myocardium of aging rat. I hypothesized that the changes in oxidative capacity associated with aging would be primarily driven by the peroxisome proliferator activated-receptors (PPARs), the nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) and their common coactivator PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). However, the reduction in oxidative capacity in the heart of old rats was independent of these regulatory axes and occurred partially through post-transcriptional processes. &#xd;
The next series of experiments investigated the transcriptional networks regulating the metabolic remodelling in goldfish subjected to dietary and temperature stress. As a potent regulator of mitochondrial proliferation in mammals, I hypothesized that PGC-1alpha assumed a similar role in lower vertebrates. Similar to their mammalian homologues, PPARalpha and NRF-1 assumed their respective roles in regulating lipid metabolism and mitochondrial proliferation in goldfish. In contrast, PGC-1alpha was only a good predictor of the PPAR axis, while PGC-1beta was a better indicator of the NRF-1 and mitochondrial gene expression axis.  &#xd;
This apparent divergence of the PGC-1alpha homologues in vertebrates inspired the subsequent study, in which I investigated the evolutionary history of the PGC-1 family in vertebrates. Specifically, I sought to assess if PGC-1alpha functional divergence had a structural and evolutionary basis. PGC-1alpha phylogeny revealed asymmetric rates of evolution across the different domains of the protein. The domains essential to PGC-1alpha coactivating activity as well as PPARs interaction motifs were relatively well preserved in all lineages. In contrast, the NRF-1 interacting domain experienced accelerated rates of evolution in fish lineages compared to tetrapods. In addition, fish PGC-1alpha exhibited consequent insertions in this domain that could have important repercussions on its ability to bind NRF-1 and regulate mitochondrial gene expression.</description>

   <description>In much of Canada, the number of children in child welfare care has been increasing significantly in recent years. In Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, the permanent ward population doubled in size over the decade ending in 2005, according to the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies (Gail Vandermeulen, personal communication, January 6, 2006). Ontario law asserts that it is preferable for children who are permanent wards with no access to their biological parents to leave care via domestic adoption rather than remain in fostering arrangements (Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services, 2000). Nevertheless, rates of adoption for these children in Ontario actually declined over the past ten years according to the former government minister of the Ministry of Community and Social Services (Marie Bountrogianni, personal communication, February 23, 2004).&#xd;
The purpose of these investigations was two-fold: to profile the population of children who were legally available for domestic public adoptions while developing a theory about the decision-making processes of adoption applicants as they consider available children with and without disabilities. In the first study a representative sample of over 20% of the files of children who were permanent wards of the state on December 31, 2003 and legally available for domestic public adoption in Ontario was reviewed. Results indicated that 57.8% of children had at least one type of disability. Children with disabilities were more likely to enter care at older ages, were significantly less likely to be residing in adoption probationary homes, and have an official permanency plan of adoption than were the child wards who had no disabilities. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the variables most predictive of permanency plans included the age at which a child entered care. &#xd;
The second study included interviewing 15 adoption applicants. Using a grounded theory approach the data regarding participants’ decision-making processes were analyzed and a substantive level theory generated. A core category resulted and was labeled, gaining balance. Key categories included commitment, persistence, and evaluation. The findings were member checked by a select group of participants and were found to have considerable explanatory power.</description>

   <description>The acidification and metal contamination of freshwater resources are major environmental concerns in many areas, with Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) having been amongst the most severely impacted.  Many scientific investigations have examined the effects of these environmental stressors on aquatic systems, but relatively little is known about the biological recovery process following smelter emission reductions.   Therefore, paleolimnological techniques were utilized to determine if diatom and scaled chrysophyte assemblages have recovered toward their pre-disturbance conditions as a result of reduced anthropogenic inputs. Pre-industrial algal assemblages were primarily dominated by circumneutral to alkaline and pH-indifferent taxa.  However, there was a shift toward acid-tolerant species in all study lakes with the onset of open pit roasting and smelting operations. Coinciding with emission reductions, scaled chrysophyte assemblages in two of the three study sites have shown evidence of biological recovery.  Given the population growth of the city of Sudbury over the last century, and the lack of scientific information regarding cultural eutrophication trends in the region, paleolimnological techniques were also used to track long-term biological changes within diatom assemblages related to cultural disturbances.  Historically, oligotrophic diatom taxa primarily dominated the algal assemblages in each of the four study lakes.  With the onset of urban environmental stressors there was a shift toward taxa which thrive in more productive systems.  In addition, diatom assemblages appear to track increased lakewater pH through time.  Finally, geochemical analysis tracked the increase in copper and nickel concentrations in lake sediment with the onset of open pit roasting and smelting activities and the subsequent decline in concentration with emission controls.  Metal concentrations in recently deposited lake sediments remain elevated compared to pre-industrial concentrations. Paleolimnological studies comparing pre- and post-disturbance algal assemblages are of interest to lake managers as these data will aid in setting realistic mitigation targets for freshwater systems impacted by acidification, cultural eutrophication, and metal contamination, and will help gauge biological recovery mechanisms.  Furthermore, this study provides insight in to the role other environmental stressors (e.g., climate change) may play in the biological recovery process.</description>

   <description>This study examines the association between changes in accounting performance resulting from mandated adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and managerial incentives to engage in opportunistic equity issuance. Based on 2,719 Australian and the European Union firms that are required to adopt IFRS starting in 2005, I find that firms disclosing a material decline in reported net income under IFRS relative to reported net income under local standards are revalued downwards, while firms disclosing a material improvement in reported net income under IFRS relative to reported net income under local standards are revalued upwards. This indicates that relative to financial statements prepared according to local accounting standards, financial statements under IFRS convey new information that impacts market value. &#xd;
Building on the market timing hypothesis, I find that managers exploit their private information about the effects of changes in accounting standards on accounting performance and that managers strategically time equity issuance before their firms disclose those effects. In particular, during the three-year window prior to a firm disclosing the financial statement effects of IFRS adoption, the firm’s likelihood and size of equity issuance are negatively associated with the change in reported net income resulting from IFRS adoption. This is consistent with the prediction that firms whose reported performance is negatively affected by mandated changes in accounting standards are more likely to issue equity and issue a larger volume of equity in advance of the disclosure of those negative effects. The association between equity issuance and the relative decline in accounting performance resulting from IFRS adoption is robust to alternative definitions of equity issuers, specifications and measures of accounting performance, and changes in sample composition. I find some evidence that equity issuance is positively associated with earnings forecast optimism, where earnings forecast optimism is another proxy for information asymmetry arising from mandatory adoption of IFRS.</description>

   <description>Globally, mining and protected areas are both vital to our way of life. Mining provides the resources on which modern society depends, while protected areas help preserve the planet’s biological diversity by helping to ensure life’s essentials such as clean air and fresh water. The relationship between protected area management and mineral exploration and extraction is an issue of global and national significance. Many of Canada’s 42 national parks occur in close proximity to mining activities (AXYS, 2002) and the challenge becomes balancing development objectives with conservation values. Despite a historic perception that mining operations and protected areas are mutually exclusive, opportunities for partnerships exist and allowing mineral activities to occur within national park boundaries under certain limited circumstances could result in increased collaboration with the mineral industry and ultimately enable Canada to more quickly expand and better protect its national parks.    &#xd;
	Using the proposed expansion of Nahanni National Park Reserve (NNPR) in the NWT as a case study, this thesis explores the merits of a hypothetical amendment to Canada’s National Parks Act, which would permit metal mining within national park boundaries under certain limited circumstances. Using a case study research strategy and based on available written sources of information, the social, economic and environmental ramifications of allowing metal mining operations to continue within the extended boundaries of NNPR (i.e. policy option #1) were considered. Results were evaluated against the advantages and disadvantageous of expanding NNPR around existing mineral interests (policy option #2), as well as against the alternate option of maintaining Nahanni’s existing boundaries (policy option #3). &#xd;
	Results suggest that including existing mineral permit, claim and lease holders within an expanded NNPR is the favored approach of the three policy options in terms of its potential economic and environmental benefits and therefore, policy option #1 could be the preferred approach for most stakeholders.  It is recommended that the proposed amendment be presented to concerned parties to determine stakeholder support and, if favored by a majority, the amendment should be tabled to Parliament so that its merits can be debated at the national level.</description>

   <description>Ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) are being investigated as alternatives to nematic liquid crystals in display applications due to their low power requirements and fast switching times.  Commercial FLCs consist of a chiral dopant in an achiral smectic C (SmC) liquid crystal host.  A bulk property that arises from the chiral nature of this mixture is a spontaneous polarization (PS), which depends on the polarization power of the chiral dopant (δp).  The magnitude of δp reflects the ability of a dopant to induce a polarization in an achiral host.  It has been proposed that the magnitude of δp can be enhanced by matching dopant and host structures, which may enhance the propagation of chiral perturbations from the dopant to the host.  This is known as the chirality transfer feedback (CTF) model.  Previous studies in the Lemieux lab featured 2H NMR to detect chiral perturbations exerted by a dopant on the liquid crystal host based on the observation of pairs of quadrupolar doublets in the 2H NMR spectra.&#xd;
	In the work described herein, the contribution of chirality transfer feedback to the difference in quadrupolar splitting between pairs of quadrupolar doublets (ΔΔνQ) was assessed by 2H NMR spectroscopy.  These experiments confirmed the results reported by Finden and Yuh by demonstrating the presence of chiral perturbations exerted by a diester substituted 6,6’-spirobiindandione dopant ((RS)-2.6-d4) on the achiral SmC host NCB76, and the absence of those perturbations using the diester substituted 5,5’-spirobiindandione analogue ((RS)-2.3-d4).&#xd;
	Subsequent studies explored the effect of modifying the chiral topography of the 2,2’-spirobiindan-1,1’-dione core on the magnitude of δp.  Both the 5,5’- and 6,6’-disubstituted cores were reduced to give the corresponding mono-carbonyl derivatives ((R)-3.4-d4 and (R)-3.8-d4), substituted with ether side-chains.  Finally, ester side-chains were added to the 6,6’- mono-carbonyl derivative ((R)-3.9-d4) for comparison with previous experiments.  The ferroelectric induction properties of these dopants were investigated in NCB76 at mole fractions ranging from xd = 0.03 – 0.10.  The mono-carbonyl 5,5’- and 6,6’-diether dopants gave absolute polarization powers of 120 nC/cm2 and 123 nC/cm2 respectively, which are not significantly different.  This suggests that a reduction in the chiral topography of the spirobiindandione core greatly affects the polarization power of the dopant and may reduce the contribution from chirality transfer to δp.  This was confirmed by a measurement of the polarization power of the 6,6’-diester mono-carbonyl dopant (R)-3.9-d4 in NCB76, which gave a δp value of 117 nC/cm2.</description>

   <description>In several field studies it was concluded that highly transmissive features transmit the majority of solute mass in horizontally-fractured bedrock aquifers. The purpose of this investigation is to develop a new technique for determining the location and relative role of hydraulically connected fracture features with respect to solute transport. To explore this, a radial-divergent tracer experiment was conducted in a four-borehole array completed through a horizontally-fractured dolomite of Silurian age in Smithville, Ontario, Canada. The injection interval included several hydraulically-identified features located in the Upper Eramosa member of the Lockport formation. 496 L of Lissamine FF (a conservative fluorescent dye tracer at a concentration of 200 mg/L) was injected at a rate of 23.25 L/min +/- 1 %. The arrival of fluorescent tracer was detected in a series of open monitoring wells located in a down gradient direction using a submersible fluorometer equipped with a pressure transducer. Correlating the fluorescence signals at depth with hydraulically-identified features provided an in-situ measure that identified the vertical intersection and relative role of each feature with respect to mass transport. FRAC3DVS a discrete fracture finite element model was used to simulate the tracer experiment. Based on the results of the tracer experiment and numerical simulations, it is concluded that the highly transmissive features identified using hydraulic techniques do not always carry all of the mass in transport. The majority of mass transport, however, followed at least one of the largest features in every borehole, just not every large feature. Results of this experiment suggest it is imperative that a distinction between large fracture features that transmit and do not transmit mass be made.</description>

   <description>An aging workforce and stressful work environments are major issues potentially impacting the health, and in particular the cardiovascular health of Canadian hospital nurses. No study, to date, has examined the independent and combined effects between the work environment and indicators of cardiovascular risk among female Canadian nurses. The primary goal of this study was to determine if selected work characteristics influences cardiovascular risk profiles. One hundred and forty four nurses from two hospitals participated in a cross-sectional study.  Participants completed a questionnaire containing validated measures of job characteristics as measured by the Job Content Questionnaire and the professional practice work environment as measured by the Nursing Work Index (Revised).  Indicators of cardiovascular risk were obtained by anthropometric measures, clinical exam and serum sampling. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome, as classified by the NCEP ATP III Panel, was 7.7 % (n = 11) with 31.9 % having waist circumferences > 88 cm; 22% having a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHG and 15.2% having a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHG.  There was no statistically significant association between traditional measures of job strain and cardiovascular risk.  In stepwise backward regression analyses, higher age, lower perception of autonomy and higher family income accounted for 22% of the variance in waist circumference (p  &lt; .001).  Higher age and higher physical job demands accounted for 17% of the variance in systolic blood pressure, and 16% of the variance in diastolic blood pressure.  Similar to other female studies, there was no significant relationship between psychosocial job strain characteristics, as measured with traditional job strain measurements, and cardiovascular risk.   The findings from this study suggest that female nurses are at risk for cardiovascular disease, and that both physical and organizational characteristics of the work environment influence these associations. One may argue that traditional job strain is not unexpected in nursing practice is perhaps less stressful  than dealing with high patient acuity, moral distress and hierarchical healthcare organizations.</description>

   <description>The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), with two major isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ in their C-termini, and therefore recruit different signaling complexes. RET plays an important role in cell growth, differentiation, migration and survival. Regulation of RET is critical for normal cellular functioning, however, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the downregulation of RET isoforms, are still not clear. Cbl (Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that plays an essential role in mediating the degradation of RET. Recently, a negative regulator of Cbl, ARHGEF7 (β-pix/ Cool-1) was found to prevent Cbl-catalyzed deregulation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). &#xd;
In the current study, we characterized and further examined the association between RET and Cbl. We showed that RET can associate with the c-Cbl and Cbl-b homologues, in co-immunoprecipitations. Using far western assays and GST-pulldowns, with the purified tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain of c-Cbl, we detected a potential novel direct interaction between RET and c-Cbl.  Previously, an indirect association between RET and Cbl had been established, indicating that a bimodal interaction may occur.  &#xd;
Furthermore, we proposed that ARHGEF7 may interfere with RET-Cbl interactions, either by sequestring Cbl, so that it is unable to bind to RET, or by forming a complex with both RET and Cbl, thereby blocking Cbl activation. Here, we investigated the possibility of a complex formation using co-immunoprecipitations. We showed that ARHGEF7 and c-Cbl can co-immunoprecipitate, but we could not detect either of the RET isoforms in this complex. Further examination of a possible relationship between RET isoforms, and ARHGEF7, showed that ARHGEF7 phosphorylation was dependent on RET activation. However, in an in vitro kinase assay, we showed that this phosphorylation did not occur directly, but may occur indirectly through a pathway yet unknown. &#xd;
Our data predicts that ARHGEF7 may modulate Cbl-binding to RET, and subsequently inhibit its degradation, in a manner similar to that seen for EGFR.</description>

   <description>Commercially available glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) off-the-shelf structural shapes have great potential as stay-in-place open structural forms for concrete structures, including bridge decks and girders. The system simplifies and accelerates construction, and the non-corrosive GFRP forms can fully or partially replace steel rebar.  In this study, eight concrete slabs were constructed using flat pultruded GFRP plates, and nine girders were constructed using trapezoidal pultruded GFRP sheet pile sections as stay-in-place structural forms.  No tension steel reinforcement was used.  All specimens were tested in four-point monotonic uniaxial bending.  Four adhesive and mechanical bond mechanisms were explored to accomplish composite action.  The most effective mechanism, considering structural performance and ease of fabrication, was wet adhesive bonding of fresh concrete to GFRP.  Although failure was by debonding, no slip was observed prior to failure.  Other parameters studied were concrete slabs’ thicknesses and their shear span-to-depth ratios.  For the girders, three different cross-sectional configurations were examined, namely, totally filled sheet piles, one with a voided concrete fill, and an all-GFRP box girder developed by bonding flat GFRP sheets to the upper flanges of the sheet piles with a cast-in-place concrete flange.  Girders were tested in positive and negative bending to simulate continuity.  The built-up box girders showed superior performance, with up to 70% higher strength and 65% lower weight than the totally filled sections.  It was found that similar size conventional steel-reinforced concrete sections of comparable stiffness have considerably lower strength, while those of comparable strength have considerably higher stiffness than FRP-concrete members.  An analytical model was developed to predict the behaviour and failure loads of slabs and girders, using cracked section analysis.  A unique feature of the model is a multi-stepped failure criteria check that can detect flexural, shear, or bond failure.  The model was successfully validated using the experimental results, and used in a parametric study.  It was shown that using the typical value of 1MPa for shear strength of cement mortar predicts debonding failure, which occurs slightly above the interface, quite well.  Also, in practical applications of longer spans, flexural failure is likely to occur prior to bond failure.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-14 15:40:24.502</description>
   <description>Studies over the last ten years suggest computers are not being used to their full potential inside schools (Abrami et al., 2006; Smeets, 2005; Suronta &amp; Lehtimaki, 2004). Findings often recommend some combination of professional development, increased technical support, and the development and acquisition of user-friendly software to remedy the situation. While any one of these options may help in the short term, this thesis argues that, even in combination, none of these solutions get to the root of education’s problem with integrating new technology. Policy purports that simply inserting a computer into a classroom will open up new possibilities for learning, however in order to successfully integrate new technology in a way that is beneficial for both students and the teacher, what is needed is an approach to learning that will foster a creative and engaged learning environment. &#xd;
&#xd;
Using a phenomenological perspective that draws from my experience helping teachers implement computer technology and my artistic practice, this thesis will explore what began as a hunch, that there might be something to an artist’s approach that makes using technology more navigable. This approach, which is transferable to other environments, can foster meaningful learning. By developing a manner of approach that is by nature creative and leads to an unfolding process for learning, rather than programming for desired outcomes. &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis draws broadly from four sources: Christopher Alexander’s The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and The Nature of the Universe, Aristotle’s Nichomachean Ethics, Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception, and my memories from my Introduction to Painting class in art school.</description>

   <description>Two experiments were performed to investigate the interaction of a combustion wave with porous media. The first experiment was performed in a 1.22m long, 76mm wide, and 152mm high horizontal channel with a nitrogen-diluted stoichiometric methane-oxygen mixture at initial pressures of 20-50kPa. A layer of 12.7mm diameter ceramic-oxide spheres was placed along the bottom to partially obstruct the channel, leaving a gap of free space above. For a fixed gap height the bead layer thickness had very little effect on explosion propagation. For a fixed bead layer thickness the explosion propagation was strongly influenced by the gap height. For example, a 31% nitrogen diluted mixture at room temperature resulted in DDT for a gap height of 38mm at initial pressures of 30-50 kPa, but not for 109mm over the same pressures. The gap above the bead layer permits DDT as long as the gap height is larger than one detonation cell width. Propagation of the detonation wave over the bead layer is possible if the gap height can accommodate at least two detonation cells. For a 38mm gap, velocity measurements and sooted foil imprints indicate that the detonation undergoes successive failure and re-initiation, referred to as “galloping” in the literature.&#xd;
In the second experiment, the head-on collision of a combustion front with a layer of 3 and 12.7mm diameter ceramic-oxide spheres was investigated in a 61cm long, 76.2mm diameter vertical tube for a nitrogen-diluted stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen mixture at initial pressures of 10-100kPa. Four orifice plates were placed at the ignition end to accelerate the premixed flame to a “fast-flame” or a detonation wave. For fast-flames pressures recorded at the bead layer face were up to five times the reflected CJ detonation pressure. This explosion iv developed by two distinct mechanisms: a) shock reflection off the bead layer face and b) shock transmission into the bead layer and subsequent explosion therein. The measured explosion delay time (time after shock reflection from the bead layer face) was found to be independent of the incident shock velocity. Thus, it was shown that explosion initiation is not the direct result of shock reflection but is more likely due to the interaction of the reflected shock with the trailing flame. The bead layer was found to be very effective in attenuating the explosion and isolating the tube endplate.</description>

   <description>Constitutional democracy requires a constitutionalisation of Human Rights and the empowerment of judiciaries to enforce and protect such rights. In Ghana, these requirements have been put in place by the 1992 Constitution. Human Rights have been constitutionalised and the courts granted specific powers of Judicial Review to enforce the values of these rights by policing the actions of the legislature and the executive branches of Government. In response, the Judiciary has done a great deal through the power of Judicial Review to protect Human Rights in the country. It has developed a corpus of Human Rights jurisprudence which individuals and institutions can rely on for rights claims and protection. However, its role is not without blemish. This work seeks to discover the successes as well as the failures of the Judiciary of Ghana in enforcing Human Rights. As a theoretical prelude to the entire work, I claim that the main juridical basis to legitimate Judicial Review lies in the courts duty to enforce a higher body of law grounded in rights. On the basis of this claim, the work argues that while the Judiciary did play a constructive role in the promotion, enforcement and sustenance of Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms in the country, it has not adopted a consistent approach in giving all Human Rights equal weight. A generous reception has been given to Civil and Political Rights, while Social-Economic Rights have not been sympathetically considered. This has generated a gap in Ghana’s Human Rights jurisprudence, and negated the values upheld by the postwar global Human Rights constituency - of which Ghana is a member. To avert the creation of  Judicial determinism which will hold back the realisation of Socio-Economic Rights in Ghana, this work urges the Judiciary to accord equal respect to all Rights by adopting a purposive approach in deciding all rights claims.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, History) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-17 13:59:23.833</description>
   <description>This thesis examine the cultural interaction between Anishinabe people, who lived in what is now southern Ontario, and the Loyalists, Euroamerican settlers who moved north from the United States during and after the American Revolution.  Starting with an analysis of Anishinabe  cultural history before the settlement era the thesis argues that Anishinabe spirituality was not traditionalist.  Rather it inclined its practitioners to search for new knowledge.  Further, Anishinabe ethics in this period were determined corporately based on the immediate needs and expectations of individual communities.  As such, Anishinabe ethics were quite separate from Anishinabe spiritual teachings.  &#xd;
Between 1760 and 1815, the Anishinabe living north of the Great Lakes participated in pan-Native resistance movements to the south.  The spiritual leaders of these movements, sometimes called nativists, taught that tradition was an important religious virtue and that cultural integration was dangerous and often immoral.  These nativist teachings entered the northern Anishinabe cultural matrix and lived alongside earlier hierarchies of virtue that identified integration and change as virtues.&#xd;
When Loyalist Methodists presented their teachings to the Anishinabeg in the early nineteenth century their words filtered through both sets of teachings and found purchase in the minds of many influential leaders.  Such leaders quickly convinced members of their communities to take up the Methodist practices and move to agricultural villages.  For a few brief years in the 1830s these villages achieved financial success and the Anishinabe Methodist leaders achieved real social status in both Anishinabe and Euroamerican colonial society.&#xd;
	By examining the first generation of Anishinabe Methodists who practiced between 1823 and 1840, I argue that many Anishinabe people adopted Christianity as new wisdom suitable for refitting their existing cultural traditions to a changed cultural environment.  Chiefs such as Peter Jones (Kahkewahquonaby), and their followers, found that Methodist teachings cohered with major tenets of their own traditions, and also promoted bimadziwin, or health and long life, for their communities.  Finally, many Anishinabe people believed that the basic moral injunctions of their own tradition compelled them to adopt Methodism because of its potential to promote bimadziwin.</description>

   <description>Recent research addresses the problem of data-stream mining&#xd;
to deal with applications that require processing huge amounts of data&#xd;
such as sensor data analysis and financial applications.&#xd;
Data-stream mining algorithms incorporate special provisions to meet&#xd;
the requirements of stream-management systems, that is stream&#xd;
algorithms must be online and incremental, processing each data&#xd;
record only once (or few times); adaptive to distribution changes;&#xd;
and fast enough to accommodate high arrival rates.&#xd;
&#xd;
We consider the problem of data-stream classification,&#xd;
introducing an online and incremental stream-classification&#xd;
ensemble algorithm, Streaming Random Forests,&#xd;
an extension of the Random Forests algorithm&#xd;
by Breiman, which is a standard classification algorithm.&#xd;
Our algorithm is designed to handle multi-class classification&#xd;
problems.&#xd;
It is able to deal with&#xd;
data streams having an evolving nature and&#xd;
a random arrival rate of training/test data records.&#xd;
The algorithm, in addition, automatically adjusts its&#xd;
parameters based on the data seen so far.&#xd;
&#xd;
Experimental results on real and synthetic data&#xd;
demonstrate that the algorithm gives a successful behavior.&#xd;
Without losing classification accuracy, our algorithm&#xd;
is able to handle multi-class problems for which the&#xd;
underlying class boundaries drift, and handle the case when blocks of training&#xd;
records are not big enough to build/update the classification model.</description>

   <description>The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the most commonly used range image processing methods. However, slow operational speeds and high input band-widths limit the use of ICP in high-speed real-time applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents and examines a novel hardware implementation of a high-speed ICP object tracking system that uses stereo vision disparities as input. Although software ICP trackers already exist, this innovative hardware tracker utilizes the efficiencies of custom hardware processing, thus enabling faster high-speed real-time tracking. A custom hardware design has been implemented in an FPGA to handle the inherent bottlenecks that result from the large input and processing band-widths of the range data. The hardware ICP design consists of four stages: Pre-filter, Transform, Nearest Neighbor, and Transform Recovery.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This custom hardware has been implemented and tested on various objects, using both software simulation and hardware tests. Results indicate that the tracker is able to successfully track free-form objects at over 200 frames-per-second along arbitrary paths. Tracking errors are low, in spite of substantial noisy stereo input. The tracker is able to track stationary paths within 0.42mm and 1.42degs, linear paths within 1.57mm and 2.80degs, and rotational paths within 0.39degs axis error. With further degraded data by occlusion, the tracker is able to handle 60% occlusion before a slow decline in performance. The high-speed hardware implementation (that uses 16 parallel nearest neighbor circuits), is more then five times faster than the software K-D tree implementation.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
This tracker has been designed as the hardware component of ‘FastTrack’, a high frame rate, stereo vision tracking system, that will provide a known object’s pose in real-time at 200 frames per second. This hardware ICP tracker is compact, lightweight, has low power requirements, and is integratable with the stereo sensor and stereo extraction components of the FastTrack’ system on a single FPGA platform.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
High-speed object tracking is useful for many innovative applications, including advanced spaced-based robotics. Because of this project’s success, the ‘FastTrack’ system will be able to aid in performing in-orbit, automated, remote satellite recovery for maintenance.</description>

   <description>An important function of the brain is to inhibit irrelevant behaviors. This thesis examines the role of the basal ganglia in response suppression using saccadic eye movements as a model of behavior. We measured the activity of single saccade-related neurons in primate Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a main output structure of the basal ganglia, while the context surrounding the initiation and suppression of saccades was manipulated.&#xd;
Inserting a temporal gap of no stimuli between the disappearance of a central visual fixation point and the appearance of a peripheral visual target leads to a reduction in saccadic reaction times (SRT); the ‘gap’ effect. SNr pause neurons decreased their activity during the gap and this decrease correlated with SRT. This finding suggests the SNr may contribute directly to producing the gap effect and that signals related to the effect are propagating through a frontal-basal ganglia circuitry to impact pre-saccade processing.  &#xd;
Interleaving pro-saccade (look towards a visual stimulus) and anti-saccade (look away from visual stimulus) trials allowed us to investigate how neural processes change when preparing to suppress a saccade instead of making one automatically. We show that SNr neurons exhibit activity consistent with both suppression of automatic responses and facilitation of voluntary responses, during anti-saccades. These data provide direct neurophysiological evidence for a dual role of inhibitory and disinhibitory basal ganglia outputs in the flexible shaping of behavior.&#xd;
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs motor function due to depletion of dopamine in the striatum. Using an oculomotor countermanding paradigm, we found that PD patients were unable to suppress saccades to a peripheral target, providing evidence that the SNr performs a gating function that mediates the initiation and suppression of saccades. When pathology to the circuitry occurs, inhibitory control over saccades is affected.    &#xd;
In Conclusion, using a variety of behavioral contexts, this thesis has demonstrated that the basal ganglia, specifically the SNr, mediates the suppression and voluntary initiation of saccades, possibly via an inhibitory gating mechanism, and that this role is important for successful interaction with a dynamic environment.</description>

   <description>Background: MY7 clinical trial compared dexamethasone plus melphalan (MD) vs. prednisone plus melphalan (MP) in multiple myeloma treatment and found no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the two groups. But, patients reacted to treatment differently. We aimed to identify patients who might have benefited from dexamethasone, and characterize them by their baseline demographic and clinical factors. &#xd;
Methods: First, the prognostic model for OS was developed on the MP arm. The estimated coefficients and baseline hazard were applied to the MD arm to derive martingale residuals (MR). Classification and regression tree analysis was done to identify independent predictive factors for OS and MR was used as response variable. All covariates in categorical shape were used as independent variables to develop the predictive model in MD arm. MP arm was divided accordingly. Subgroups with negative mean MR (survived > expected) were candidates for positive responders while those with positive mean MR (survived &lt; expected) were candidates of negative responders. Mean MR in each subgroup and p values from comparison of OS (log rank test stratified by subgroups) were used to combine the appropriate subgroups as the positive responders or negative responders. &#xd;
Results: A total of 97 patients (42%) in MD arm were identified as positive responders and their OS (median of 44.5 months) was significantly longer than that (median of 33 months) in the corresponding subgroups in MP arm (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.4-0.8; p = 0.0014). All positive responders had three common baseline characteristics: aged ≤75 years, calcium concentration ≤2.6 mmol/L and Durie-Salmon stages 2 or 3. Among patients with ECOG performance status&lt;2 those with either HGB≥100 mg/dl or HGB&lt;100 mg/dl and WBC≥4,000 and &lt;4 lytic bone lesions were categorized as positive responders. Also, among the patients with ECOG performance status≥2, males with >3 lytic bone lesions were positive responders. Negative responders (HR = 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.1 – 2.2; p = 0.006) included patients aged >75 or aged ≤75 with calcium concentration >2.6 mmol/L or aged ≤75 with calcium concentration ≤2.6 mmol/L but had Durie-Salmon stage 1. &#xd;
Conclusions: Evaluation of the hypotheses validity warrants further studies.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-21 17:13:27.992</description>
   <description>Singularities have been a long-standing problem in general relativity.  In all other fields of physics, singularities can be easily located and avoided; in general relativity, singularities have an impact on the creation of the manifold, but, by definition, are not even part of real spacetime. Moreover, all singularities in general relativity cannot be treated in the same manner; thus, the classification of singularities is essential in order to understand them. One important class of singularities is curvature singularities, which, in some cases, can be subclassified as central, shell focusing or shell crossing singularities. We propose to further classify curvature singularities as either gravitational or non-gravitational.&#xd;
&#xd;
In general relativity, a curvature singularity is ``located'' where the scalar invariants of the spacetime are undefined.  The gradient field of a non-zero scalar invariant can then be calculated, and the end points of the associated integral curves can be determined. If integral curves are attracted to (i.e. intersect) the singularity, then it is a gravitational singularity; if the integral curves avoid the singularity, then it is a non-gravitational singularity.&#xd;
&#xd;
We will test our method by analysing several different spacetimes, including Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, self-similar Vaidya, self-similar Tolman-Bondi, non-self-similar Vaidya, and Kerr spacetimes. We find that in every case studied, the integral curves have specific end points, therefore they can be used to classify a curvature singularity as gravitational or non-gravitational.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker and Schwarzschild spacetimes, we determined that the a(t) = 0 and r = 0 singularities, respectively, are gravitational singularities.  In Vaidya and Tolman-Bondi spacetime, we determine that the massless shell focusing singularities are non-gravitational singularities and that the central singularities (which have mass) are gravitational singularities.  We also find that the non-gravitational singularities are the only singularities that have the possibility of being naked.&#xd;
&#xd;
In summary, we can determine which singularities are gravitational and which are non-gravitational by our method of examining the end points of the integral curves, which are constructed from the gradient field of scalar invariants.</description>

   <description>Myocardial infarction patients (MI, or heart attack) are vulnerable patients that require special care.  The purpose of this study was to develop a teaching guide to be used by nursing staff with MI patients in the hospital setting, and to investigate the impact of this Individualized Patient Teaching Guide (IPTG).  This research met its specific purposes through a three phase structure: development of the teaching guide, implementation, and assessment of participant impact.  In phase one, development of the teaching guide, two focus groups were conducted: one with previous MI patients and the other with nursing staff.  The IPTG was developed using topics identified as important by these two groups.&#xd;
Twenty patients participated in the implementation phase.  The intention was for these patients to have patient teaching guided by the options they chose on their IPTGs.  Seventy per cent of the patients provided feedback concerning the impact of the guide.  All of these patients (n=14) indicated that Risk Factors was very important or important for them to learn about while in the hospital, and 13 of them received instruction on Risk Factors from health care practitioners.  Psychological concerns was the topic most neglected: only one of the patients that had identified this as important received instruction on this topic.  While the majority of patients  (n=10) indicated that the IPTG provided them with an opportunity to identify their learning needs, only four of the patients surveyed felt that their learning needs were completely met in the hospital setting.  The other six patients indicated that the information provided to them was insufficient.&#xd;
It seems that some of the topics identified as important were addressed in the clinical setting.  Furthermore, the tool did allow patients an opportunity to identify learning needs.  However, given that the majority of patients indicated dissatisfaction with the amount of education they received in the hospital setting, it may be concluded that the IPTG did not accomplish the goal of improving the in-patient learning experience.  Reasons for this are discussed.</description>

   <description>Precarious employment refers to forms of work characterized by limited job security, few employment benefits, lack of control over the labour process and low-wages. Restaurant work demonstrates a range of precarious forms of employment and reveals the complexity of issues that such jobs raise in the context of the regulation of the local labour market. This thesis analyses the nature of precarious employment in the restaurant industry in Kingston, Ontario. In particular, it seeks to understand how precarious employment is shaped by the structure and dynamics of the local labour market. The research highlights the role played by labour mobility, in shaping workers’ experiences of precarious work. Labour mobility refers to the movement of workers between different jobs and between different worksites within a structured local labour market as they seek to better their economic situation and generate a sustainable income for themselves. Through a discussion of labour mobility, this thesis seeks to contribute to a new lens through which the impacts of a precarious and flexible labour market can be better understood as they shape the lives of workers themselves.&#xd;
	The objective of this study is to better understand the factors which shape the lived realities of precarious restaurant workers in one specific local labour market. The empirical analysis draws on data collected by Statistics Canada and interviews conducted with both employers and employees in local restaurants to analyze the structure of the local labour market and the nature of precarious employment.&#xd;
	The research demonstrates that the restaurant industry in Kingston is comprised of three distinct submarkets, each of which appears to operate largely independently of one another. Interviews were conducted with employees and employers in the submarket located in downtown Kingston. Within this submarket the combined processes of labour market segmentation and labour mobility has a significant impact on workers experiences of precarious employment. By understanding the complex interaction of these two features within the labour market, we can begin to conceive of ways to address the issues associated with the precariously employed in the low-wage service industry.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Psychology) -- Queen's University, 2008-07-24 15:00:30.512</description>
   <description>This program of research examined whether mock-jurors could more accurately discriminate between correct and false eyewitness identifications after exposure to the identification procedure instead of—or in addition to—the witness’s testimony. In Experiment 1, 332 eyewitnesses exposed to staged crime videos attempted to identify the “criminal” from lineups. Lineups contained either the “criminal” or a replacement foil, were presented simultaneously or sequentially, and were conducted under double-blind, single-blind, or post-identification feedback conditions. In Experiment 2, 432 mock-jurors viewed a subset of the eyewitnesses from Experiment 1 (n = 48). Each mock-juror viewed a single eyewitness making their identification decision and/or testifying about the crime, their identification, and the officer. More mock-jurors believed that the eyewitnesses had made correct identifications if they viewed the testimony—with or without the identification procedure—compared to exposure to the identification procedure alone. Furthermore, more mock-jurors believed eyewitnesses who received post-identification feedback or had made their identifications from sequential lineups. These differences in belief, however, did not translate into a difference in accuracy; overall, mock-jurors believed 62.96% of correct identifications and 56.48% of false identifications. Exposure to the identification procedure did not improve mock-jurors ability to determine the accuracy of an identification; however, these mock-jurors were more aware of the post-identification feedback. Videotaping identification procedures may make triers of fact more aware of biased lineup procedures; nonetheless, exposure to these videotapes will not improve the accuracy of mock-jurors’ decisions.</description>

   <description>Entry into kindergarten marks the beginning of formal education and has the potential to pave the way for future academic success or failure.  The transition into school is expected to be a challenging time for children and their families and these challenges are likely to be enhanced for children with developmental delays (DD).  Despite the importance of this period, school transition for children with DD has not been well researched. &#xd;
Twenty-nine parents of preschool aged children with DD, and 17 parents of children without DD participated in three one-hour phone interviews throughout the course of the child’s transition into school.  The Double ABCX Model was used as a framework for the current study to measure the outcome of transition (X) (using quality of life and school readiness), which is influenced by characteristics of the child (A), resources (B) and parental perceptions (C).  The objectives of the study were to: 1) describe a sample of children and their families who were transitioning into school, investigate the similarities and differences between children with DD and without DD, and investigate changes over the course of transition; and 2) determine which factors contribute to a successful transition for children with and without DD.  &#xd;
Results showed that children with DD had lower adaptive and higher maladaptive behaviour; and were utilizing more formal services and participating in less social activities than children without DD.  Parents of children with DD reported lower family income, higher parental stress, different patterns and types of perceptions, and different use of coping.  Very few variables changed over the course of transition.  There were no significant predictors of the child’s quality of life; and only adaptive behaviour predicted all aspects of school readiness, with family income also predicting the child’s social and emotional well-being.  Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>Rangeomorphs are a distinct group of millimeter- to meter-scale soft-bodied macrofossils that are restricted to the latter half of the late Neoproterozoic Ediacaran Period (635Ma- 542Ma). These fossils represent an extinct higher level taxon characterized by a modular construction based on a single architectural unit: the centimeter-scale, chevron-shaped rangeomorph element which displays several orders of self-similar branching. These elements could be arranged in a variety of different ways, constituting the wide array of gross morphologies found within the Group Rangeomorpha. The largest and most diverse assemblage of rangeomorph fossils in the world is found at Mistaken Point, on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, Canada, where these organisms are preserved within their original, in situ paleocommunities. Multibranched rangeomorphs are typified by bush-, comb- and network-shaped fossils which display multiple rangeomorph-bearing structures attached to an untethered basal stolon or central attachment point. &#xd;
&#xd;
Multibranched, comb-shaped rangeomorphs are endemic to Mistaken Point, and are represented by fossils displaying multiple parallel struts emerging along one side of an elongate, curved pedicle rod. Morphological and taphonomic evidence suggests that, in life, this organism had two rows of struts, each bearing a rangeomorph frondlet, arranged in an alternating pattern along the curved, tubular pedicle rod. Biometric analyses imply that the struts were added to both ends of the pedicle rod throughout the organism’s lifetime, with later inflation of the rangeomorph frondlets. Each comb-shaped rangeomorph locality likely represents a different age cohort within the organism’s lifecycle, providing rare evidence for spatfall reproduction in Ediacarans, which is similar to that found in modern macrobenthic organisms with pelagic larvae.&#xd;
Network-shaped multibranched rangeomorphs, represented by symmetrical to asymmetrical net-like fossils, are also endemic to Mistaken Point. This genus is reconstructed as having a symmetrical arrangement of flexible, rangeomorph-bearing leaflets that were, in part, neutrally buoyant with respect to the seawater. This flexible leaflet structure is unique, and shared only with a rare, previously undescribed, Ediacaran frond-like organism. It is suggested that the enigmatic leaflet structures shared by these two morphologically distinct taxa represent a new type of rangeomorph branching architecture, and therefore constitute a new type of rangeomorph.</description>

   <description>Empowered by linear precoding and decoding, a spatially multiplexed&#xd;
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system becomes a convenient&#xd;
framework to offer high data rate, diversity and interference&#xd;
management. While most of the current precoding/decoding designs&#xd;
have assumed perfect channel state information (CSI) at the&#xd;
receiver, and sometimes even at the transmitter,  in this thesis we&#xd;
design the precoder and decoder with imperfect CSI at both the&#xd;
transmit and the receive sides, and investigate the joint impact of&#xd;
channel estimation errors and channel correlation on system&#xd;
structure and performance. The mean-square error (MSE) related&#xd;
performance metrics are used as the design criteria.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
We begin with the minimum total MSE precoding/decoding design for a&#xd;
single-user MIMO system assuming imperfect CSI at both ends. Here&#xd;
the CSI includes the channel estimate and channel correlation&#xd;
information. The structures of the optimum precoder and decoder are&#xd;
determined. Compared to the perfect CSI case, linear filters are&#xd;
added to the transceiver structure to improve system robustness&#xd;
against imperfect CSI. The effects of channel estimation error and&#xd;
channel correlation are quantified by simulations.&#xd;
&#xd;
With imperfect CSI at both ends, the exact capacity expression for a&#xd;
single-user MIMO channel is difficult to obtain. Instead, a tight&#xd;
capacity lower-bound is used for system design. The optimum&#xd;
structure of the transmit covariance matrix for the lower-bound has&#xd;
not been found in the existing literature. By transforming the&#xd;
transmitter design into a joint precoding/decoding design problem,&#xd;
we derive the expression of the optimum transmit covariance matrix.&#xd;
The close relationship between the maximum mutual information design&#xd;
and the minimum total MSE design is also discovered assuming&#xd;
imperfect CSI.&#xd;
&#xd;
For robust multiuser MIMO communications, minimum average sum MSE&#xd;
transceiver (precoder-decoder pairs) design problems are formulated&#xd;
for both the uplink and the downlink, assuming imperfect channel&#xd;
estimation and channel correlation at the base station (BS). We&#xd;
propose improved iterative algorithms based on the associated&#xd;
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Under the assumption of&#xd;
imperfect CSI, an uplink--downlink duality in average sum MSE is&#xd;
proved. As an alternative for the uplink optimization, a sequential&#xd;
semidefinite programming (SDP) method is proposed. Simulation&#xd;
results are provided to corroborate the analysis.</description>

   <description>In light of rising costs in fossil fuels and petroleum, as well as the strain on this largely non-renewable resource, the conversion of biomass, in this case waste biomass, to value-added products is becoming more attractive. In this study, municipal sewage sludge and biosolids were used to determine their potential for glucose recovery. This research focused on three pretreatment processes including drying/grinding, as well as acid and alkaline pretreatments, followed by acid hydrolysis on primary sludge, activated sludge and biosolids. After each pretreatment under specified conditions, the residues remaining from the sludges and biosolids underwent a 2 % H2SO4 acid hydrolysis at 120oC for 1 hr. Compared with activated sludge and biosolids, primary sludge was found to demonstrate the highest potential for glucose recovery in this study. Primary sludge with 1.0 N HCl pretreatment over a 24 hour contact period yielded the highest glucose conversion result as 5.67±0.24%. The best KOH pretreatment condition for primary sludge was a 0.5 N KOH concentration for a 0.5 hour contact period. However, no consistent glucose recovery trend as a function of reagent concentration or contact time was identified for any of the sludges or biosolids in this study. Drying and grinding were also found to efficiently improve the acid hydrolysis results. &#xd;
Fibre content analysis was also performed on the sludge and biomass feedstocks and their residues following pretreatment and acid hydrolysis during this study, to better understand the conversion of these waste biomass feedstock. The Van Soest methods for neutral-detergent, acid-detergent and acid insoluble lignin analysis and the Weende crude fibre analysis were applied to the sewage sludge and biosolids samples prior to and after acid hydrolysis to determine the fibre content including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. A modification to the Weende crude fibre analysis was introduced, where a centrifuge step was added prior to the second filtration after the alkaline digestion of the procedure to reduce filter clogging problems. The centrifuge modification effectively reduced the filtering time from one day to 30 minutes; however, there was an average loss of 46% in crude fibre with the addition of this centrifugation step. It was found that most of cellulose content in the feedstock samples was hydrolyzed to glucose after the acid hydrolysis process and most hemicellulose content was likely to have been solubilized and washed away during acid and alkaline pretreatments and acid hydrolysis. The lignin content did not appear to be affected by the pretreatments applied nor the acid hydrolysis.</description>

   <description>This study examined the lived experience of diabetes as told by four young women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xd;
	Assuming a qualitative approach, I asked participants to describe their medical, academic, social, and psychological experiences during a single, guided open-ended interview. Analysis of the data revealed the subjective and unique nature of the illness experience, and the variety of ways in which diabetes had influenced Abbey’s, Olivia’s, Hannah’s, and Melinda’s life choices and existence. Despite differing in the ways in which they experienced their illness, there were some similarities that existed across cases. These women all faced a variety of challenges throughout their lives, ranging from difficulties with the treatment regimen, with the lack of diabetes awareness in the school setting, and in coming to terms with their illness.&#xd;
	Applying the Shifting Perspectives Model of Illness (Paterson, 2001) to the stories told by these four women provided an in-depth view of how these four individuals with diabetes made meaning of their experiences. Because these women viewed their lives primarily from a wellness in the foreground perspective, they were able to identify the many positive ways in which diabetes had transformed their lives.&#xd;
	This study contributes to the understanding of the lived experience of diabetes in the literature, and is one of the few studies to explore the diabetes experience using a theoretical framework. Recommendations for teachers are made based on the participants’ interpretations of the needs of diabetic students in the classroom, and based on suggestions offered by these four women.</description>

   <description>The calpain family of intracellular Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases is involved in a number of intracellular signaling processes. Calpain hyperactivity has also been implicated in ischemic injury, neurodegenerative diseases and cataract formation. However, the specific function of calpains in these normal and diseased states remains unclear. Competitive inhibition of calpain is useful for studying their functions and can lead to pharmacological treatments, while monitoring their activity with activity-based probes (ABPs) can reveal how calpain is regulated and be applied to screen for inhibitors in vivo. But these strategies are complicated by the similarity of the calpain active-site when compared to other intracellular cysteine proteases. Therefore, there is a need to design inhibitors and ABPs that selectively target calpain. Using X-ray crystallography, the interactions between the calpain active-site and each of two reversible inhibitors was studied. This led to the discovery of novel non-covalent aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between the primed-side adenine group of one inhibitor and indole ring of an active-site Trp residue in μ-calpain. A substrate-based competition assay later confirmed that these interactions provided this compound with an inhibitory advantage over the other, which lacked any primed-side interactions, thereby providing insight into the development of new, more specific reversible calpain inhibitors. Next, a fluorescent ABP, containing features borrowed from an irreversible and presumably calpain-specific inhibitor, was evaluated for its ability to detect calpain activitiy. Although this probe appropriately targeted the calpain active site in its Ca2+-activated form, it was unable to detect calpain activity in a cell extract. Nevertheless, the results of this study have yielded insights into ways of improving the calpain detecting ability of this ABP.</description>

   <description>This thesis research examines second generation Canadians’ negotiations of racism and citizenship with the aim of understanding how the former influences the latter. Through questionnaires and focus group discussion, I examine how they understand their racialized experiences and how they believe those experiences are different from, or related to, those of their parents. In addition, I conducted focus groups with an equivalent number of white Canadians in order to observe how the experiences of second generation Canadians of colour differ from those of their white counterparts.&#xd;
The findings of this thesis show that the negotiations of citizenship and racism of second generation Canadians of colour are not only varied, but multidimensional. Focus group discussions reveal that although they experience a variety of forms of racism, participants maintain a relatively positive outlook on Canadian society. This is likely the outcome of processes of identification and rationalization that distinguish them from both their parents and their white counterparts. That their experiences and perceptions of racism are prone to paradox only adds to the necessity for in-depth study and analysis. Although the influences of racism on feelings of belonging in Canada differ, the majority of second generation Canadians of colour report strong attachments to the country.</description>

   <description>Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a cytokine that promotes intestinal epithelial resistance to injury, however the mechanisms remain incompletely understood.  Evidence from the Ropeleski Lab supports IL-11 dependent activation of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor кB (NFкB), without the degradation of the inhibitor кB (IкB), which deviates from the classical mechanism involving proteolytic processing of IкB.  Also, IL-11 mediates the modulation of genes associated with healing, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).  It was hypothesized that IL-11 activates NFкB in intestinal epithelial cells by direct modulation of NFкB which, in a physiological setting, stimulates restitution during the healing response in the gut.&#xd;
Both cultured rat IEC-18 and human HIEC epithelial crypt cells were used as models to investigate whether the effect of IL-11 was species-specific.  Activated NFкB is targeted to the nucleus therefore immunoblotting of nuclear extracts for expression of NFкB protein subunits including p65, activated p65 (phospho-p65Ser536), p50, and RelB, as well as by immunofluorescent detection of p65 were used.  Inhibition of IL-11 signaling was carried out using various pharmacological inhibitors in order to determine their effect on p65 phosphorylation.  Mechanically wounded cells were used as a model of gut injury and restitution where immunoblotting was used to examine IL-11 dependent effects on phospho-p65Ser536 and COX-2 expression.  The binding of p65 to the кB binding site on DNA was detected with an ELISA-based system.&#xd;
IL-11 treatment was associated with the nuclear accumulation of phospho-p65ser536 in epithelial cell lines.  Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling with LY294002 and AktiVIII suggested a partial reduction in phospho-p65Ser536 while inhibition of MEK1,2 signaling with U0126 indicated almost a complete abrogation of phospho-p65Ser536 accumulation in the nucleus.  Inhibition of inhibitor of кB kinase-β (IKKβ) with SC-514 also revealed a strong attenuation of IL-11 induced phospho-p65Ser536.  Inhibition of p90RSK1 with SL0101 was inconsistent but suggested a partial blockage of phospho-p65Ser536 whereas inhibition of Src kinase with PP2, did not affect phospho-p65Ser536 in IL-11 treated IEC-18 cells. There was no increased binding of p65 to the кB binding motif on DNA after IL-11 treatment.  In mechanically wounded cells treated with IL-11, nuclear phospho-p65Ser536 was unaffected; however there was an evident potentiation of wound-induced COX-2 expression compared to untreated cells.  &#xd;
In conclusion, IL-11 activates NFкB signaling in a non-classical manner through the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit.  The predominant pathway appears to involve IKK and MEK signaling.  Also, IL-11 modulates COX-2 expression in response to wounding in intestinal epithelial cells.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was: (a) to examine the predictive utility of the achievement goal and Student Approaches to Learning (SAL) frameworks for characterizing Chinese students’ motivation and achievement, and (b) to investigate how Confucian-heritage culture (CHC) may combine with achievement goals or SAL to generate different learning processes and outcomes and to promote optimal motivation. A questionnaire was conducted during a two-week period with over 700 first-year students who took both of the two courses—college English classes for non-English majors and advanced mathematics classes for science students—at a university in northern China. The questionnaire consisted of students’ self-reported demographic information and the instrument that was designed to measure: (a) goal orientations, (b) attitudes towards the specified CHC values, (c) SAL constructs, and (d) two variables widely used in research in this field—metacognitive strategy and school well-being. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to examine the consistency of the extracted factor solutions with the four goal constructs postulated by the 2 x 2 conceptualization, the two SAL contructs posited by the SAL framework, and the five cultural value contructs derived from the literature review. Standard analysis procedures were used to calculate the reliability of the scales and to determine which items should be retained for further analyses. Then regression analyses were employed to examine the relationship of the goal orientation framework and SAL framework to cultural values, school well-being, metacognitive strategies, and grades. Results indicated that the 2 x 2 achievement goal framework was an appropriate model for characterizing the types of achievement goals these Chinese students pursued and for predicting a number of achievement-relevant processes and outcomes, as was the revised two-factor SAL framework for characterizing the different ways students approached their learning and for predicting these learning processes and outcomes. The results supported Chinese students’ multiple goal pursuit in an additive goal pattern, an interactive goal pattern, or a specialized goal pattern to promote their optimal motivation and achievement. The results also provided evidence that CHC values combined with achievement goals or SAL either in an additive or interactive pattern to facilitate Chinese students’ learning processes and outcomes.</description>

   <description>Increasing power consumption and heat dissipation are becoming urgent challenges for processors today and in the future. Digital power control architectures in which processors closely interact with voltage regulators are becoming necessary to enhance system energy efficiency. Digital techniques offer advantages such as flexibility, fewer external components and reduced overall cost as compared to conventional analog techniques.&#xd;
      The primary objective of this thesis is to develop new digital control architecture for processor voltage regulators with low complexity and high dynamic performance. A digital control technique to naturally implement the desired output impedance is proposed. In this technique, Adaptive Voltage Positioning (AVP) is implemented by generating a dynamic voltage reference and a dynamic current reference to achieve the desired output impedance. A dual-voltage-loop control with dynamic reference step adjustment, non-linear control and a dedicated transient detection circuit is proposed to improve the dynamic performance. The dynamic reference step adjustment method lowers the high speed requirement of reference update clock; the non-linear control minimizes the transient-assertion-to-action delay and maximizes the inductor current slew rate; and the transient detection circuit recognizes the load transient state in a manner adaptive to the amount and slew rate of load transient. Theoretical, simulation and experimental results prove the effective operation and excellent performance of the controller.&#xd;
      Finally, the dynamic performance of the voltage regulator with the proposed digital controller under large-step load oscillations is proven by simulation and experimental results.</description>

   <description>This study examines the figure of the violent woman in Atwood’s fiction as a productive starting point for the re-evaluation of various socio-cultural debates. Emerging from Atwood’s conviction that art, in its various forms, is often involved in the re-writing of convention, I begin by re-defining traditional constructions of womanhood and violence in order to evince the reformative work and often unconventional forms of brutality employed by women in Atwood’s novels, including Surfacing, The Blind Assassin, Lady Oracle, and Cat’s Eye, and in her collections of short fiction, such as Dancing Girls, Bluebeard’s Egg, The Penelopiad, and The Tent. Throughout, I demonstrate the ambivalence of violence as both destructive and generative, Canadian and un-Canadian, and Atwood’s drawing on this destabilizing ambivalence in order to propose change within her broader social milieu. More precisely, the introductory chapter offers an overview of representations of female violence in Canadian fiction, and of the various responses to this figure as she appears in Atwood’s fiction, that point to the need for a critical vocabulary that addresses women’s capacity to enact harm. The second chapter examines the various mythologies that define Canada and its people, and how the violent woman troubles these mythologies by inciting recognition of national identity as a narrative process open to re-evaluation. The third chapter moves away from this focus on national narratives to highlight the discourses that similarly shape our understanding of art, and those who participate in it. Here, the violent woman can be seen to engage in revisionary work by exposing the limits of the Red Shoes Syndrome that has in many ways come to define the fraught relationship between the female artist and her art. The final chapter examines Atwood’s on-going fascination with various kinds of mythologies and her revisions of Classical and Biblical myths in order to highlight the veritable range of female violence and the possibility, and at times necessity, of responding to these behaviors in ways that circumnavigate traditionally masculine forms of justice ethics. In focusing on how Atwood’s violent women engage these various socio-cultural discourses, this study concludes that traditionally marginal and nonliterary figures can perform central and necessary roles and that Atwood’s fiction responds to, and in turn (re)creates, the social environment from which it emerges.</description>

   <description>To meet growing demand for wireless access to multimedia traffic, future generations of wireless networks  need to provide heterogenous services with high data rate and guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS). Many enabling technologies to ensure QoS&#xd;
have been investigated, including cross-layer admission control (AC), error control and congestion control.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis,  we study  the cross-layer AC problem. While previous research  focuses on single-antenna systems, which does not&#xd;
capitalize on the significant benefits provided by multiple antenna&#xd;
systems,  in this thesis we investigate cross-layer AC policy for a code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) system with antenna arrays at the base station (BS).    Automatic retransmission request (ARQ)&#xd;
schemes are also exploited to further improve the spectral efficiency.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In the first  part,  a circuit-switched network is considered and an exact outage probability is developed, which  is then employed to derive the optimal call admission control (CAC) policy by formulating a constrained semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). The derived optimal  policy can maximize the system throughput with&#xd;
guaranteed QoS requirements in both physical and network layers.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second part,  a suboptimal low-complexity CAC policy is&#xd;
proposed based on an approximate power control feasibility condition (PCFC) and a  reduced-outage-probability algorithm. Comparison between  optimal and suboptimal CAC policies shows that the suboptimal CAC policy can significantly reduce the computational&#xd;
complexity at a cost of  degraded performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the third   part, we extend the above research  to packet-switched  networks. A novel SMDP is formulated by incorporating ARQ protocols. Packet-level AC policies are then&#xd;
proposed. The proposed  policies exploit the error control capability provided by ARQ schemes,   while simultaneously&#xd;
guaranteeing QoS requirements in the physical and packet levels.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the fourth part, we propose a connection admission control policy&#xd;
in a  connection-oriented packet-switched network, which  can guarantee  QoS requirements in physical, packet and connection levels. By considering joint optimization across different layers,&#xd;
the proposed optimal policy provides a flexible way to handle multiple QoS requirements, while at the same time, maximizing the overall system throughput.</description>

   <title>Parameter identifiability of biochemical reaction networks in systems biology</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-05 22:20:32.561</description>
   <description>In systems biology, models often contain a large number of unknown or only roughly known parameters that must be estimated through the fitting of data.  This work examines the question of whether or not these parameters can in fact be estimated from available measurements. Structural or a priori identifiability of unknown parameters in biochemical reaction networks is considered. Such systems consist of continuous time, nonlinear differential equations.  Several methods for analyzing identifiability of such systems exist, most of which restate the question as one of observability by expanding the state space to include parameters. However, these existing methods were not developed with biological systems in mind, so do not necessarily address the specific&#xd;
challenges posed by this type of problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this work,  such methods are considered for the analysis of a representative biological system, the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway.  It is shown that existing observability-based strategies, which rely on finding an analytical solution, require significant simplifications to be applicable to systems biology problems that are seldom feasible.  The analytical nature of the solution imposes restrictions on the size and complexity of systems that these methods can handle.  This conflicts with the&#xd;
fact that most currently studied systems biology models are rather large networks containing many states and parameters. In this thesis, a new simulation based method using an empirical observability Gramian for determining identifiability is proposed. Computational and numerical sensitivity issues for this method are considered. An algorithm, based on this method,  is developed and demonstrated on a simple biological example of microbial growth with Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  The new method is applied to the motivating NF-kappaB example to show its suitability for use in systems biology.</description>

   <title>Healthist ideologies : the case of Lululemon Athletica</title>

   <subject>Lululemon Athletica</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Master, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2008-08-06 10:27:01.881</description>
   <description>Over the last three decades, ideas about health have been influenced by neoliberal politics.  Robert Crawford coined the term healthism to refer to this dominant ideology that places much responsibility on the individual to achieve a level of health while avoiding ill-health.  The moral obligation to live a health-promoting lifestyle has become increasingly pronounced in North America, thus activities, services, and products that promote a high level of health have gained considerable attention.  In this social context, Lululemon Athletica, a yoga-inspired retail store that sells athletic apparel primarily to “active” women, has flourished.  This thesis focuses on Lululemon Athletica as a site in which to examine health ideologies in contemporary North American capitalist culture and exposes the ways in which Lululemon has incorporated health ideologies as a vehicle to corporate success.  This thesis is based on a discourse analysis of two primary texts produced by Lululemon Athletica: Lululemon’s website, www.lululemon.com, and a 150-page Lululemon Athletica memoirs book.  Three themes emerged from the analysis: Lululemon incorporates 1) healthist ideologies, 2) yoga as a holistic health practice, and 3) lifestyle branding techniques into the company’s promotional materials and retail practices in order to develop a corporate identity that seems timely, relevant and profitable.  My analysis affirms the potency of healthism in North American society and reveals that Lululemon’s strategic use of dominant healthist ideologies has helped the retailer to capture a large market and gain considerable corporate success.  This project ultimately provides awareness of the dominant, yet largely taken-for-granted health ideologies that currently circulate in North American society.</description>
