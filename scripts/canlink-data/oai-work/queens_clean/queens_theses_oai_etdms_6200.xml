   <description>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enables sensitive detection of (bio)chemical analytes. However, the need for nanostructured noble metal substrates poses a major obstacle to its application. In this thesis, we present a novel metallic nanostructured SERS substrate that is also produced in a nanofabrication-free manner. The substrates are formed through the electrokinetic assembly of silver nanoparticles, which results in extended dendritic structures. A unique feature of these nanostructures is their ability to function as concentration amplification devices, thereby enhancing their analyte detection efficiency. Moreover, the used SERS-active dendrites can be removed and replaced in a few minutes. &#xd;
In this work, we demonstrate the detection of illicit drugs in both aqueous samples and saliva using our SERS substrates. Identification and quantification of illicit drugs is accomplished via Principal Component Analysis coupled with a Support Vector Machine. We demonstrate 100% accuracy in the detection of four illicit drugs (cocaine, heroin, THC, and oxycodone), and 98.3% accuracy in the quantification of cocaine across four orders of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate a method for the detection of cocaine in saliva to a limit of detection of 100 ppb. We also establish a microfabrication-free “SERS-from-scratch” technique to produce our SERS substrates from a wide range of materials, including commercially available glass slides pre-coated with indium tin oxide. Our SERS substrates also have applications in the detection of toxic contaminants in food products. We apply our chips for: (1) the detection of thiram, a toxic pesticide, in apple juice, to a limit of detection of 115 ppb, with no sample preprocessing; and (2) the detection of melamine, a toxic food additive, to a limit of detection of 1.5 ppm in milk and 100 ppb in infant formula. &#xd;
Finally, we extend our method to enable SERS-active gold nanostructures via the electrokinetic assembly of gold nanoparticles. We explore the effects of conductivity on the growth of these nanostructures, and demonstrate the sensing capabilities of these gold nanostructures via: (1) the chemical detection of rhodamine 6G and thiram; and (2) a specific bioassay to detect streptavidin on biotin-modified gold nanostructures.</description>

   <description>Natural products from bacteria have long been the source of inspiration of new pharmaceutical compounds spanning from immunosuppressants to antimicrobials. Rapid discovery of bacterial natural products is hampered by several roadblocks in identification, dereplication, and activation. The goal of my thesis was to explore these roadblocks and identify novel solutions to streamline natural product discovery. The first chapter provides background on natural product discovery and biosynthesis. It gives insight into how several genomic and metabolic tools work in order to dereplicate and guide the isolation of novel natural products. Throughout the thesis, the need for a genomic mining tool capable of finding natural product analogues is highlighted and used to explore medicinal space. Chapter two introduces the concept of scaffold guided genomic mining and propose how we can use it to identify novel therapeutic analogues with different drug-like properties. To overcome current challenges in biosynthetic gene cluster comparison needed for scaffold guided genomic mining a new method for defining gene clusters based on natural language processing algorithms was created. I then built the analogous cluster comparison information tool to streamline identification and dereplication of analogous gene clusters. Chapter 3 demonstrates the utility of the tool to identify a prodigiosin analogue BE-18591 in Streptomyces. The tambjamine like molecule BE-18591 had previously been isolated but no known biosynthetic gene cluster was known to produce it. The compound was isolated and the gene cluster architecture was compared to other known analogues to identify its biosynthetic origin. Chapter 4 provides personal outlook on how the tool described herein will be used in the future and what the landscape of natural product discovery will look like in the coming years.</description>

   <title>Altering Compliance of a Load Carriage Structure in the Medial-Lateral Direction</title>

   <description>For work or recreation, many individuals transport heavy loads within a backpack. Carrying substantial weight while walking typically causes an increase in muscle activity, metabolic energy expenditure, and increases likelihood of injury. Understanding different modes in which a carried load can interact with a user could help inform design decisions of smart load carriage devices that minimize the burden of carrying weight. We explore this concept in this thesis by investigating a novel mode of load carriage: allowing carried weight within a backpack to oscillate in the medial-lateral direction. To date, our understanding of oscillating load carriage dynamics are constrained to the sagittal plane. Previous studies have explored vertically oscillating carried weight and have observed reductions in peak load carriage forces experienced by the user and reductions of the metabolic cost of walking. We seek to expand this understanding by investigating medial-lateral oscillating load carriage and its effects on gait. We created a novel load carriage device, and through device modelling, chose device parameters that resulted in out-of-phase mass oscillations with respect to trunk medial-lateral excursions. We found that peak load carriage forces were significantly reduced when walking with an oscillating mass, compared to a fixed mass. However, contrary to peak load carriage forces, the metabolic power of walking significantly increased. We identified an increase in the frontal plane interaction moment experienced by the user during oscillating conditions that increased with mass oscillation amplitude. This suggested that perhaps reducing the amplitude of mass oscillations may improve the metabolic response of users. The second objective of this thesis was to generate electricity from the oscillations of the carried mass. We developed an energy harvesting module that generated 0.22 W of electricity while carrying 9 kg of weight. The energy harvesting module also acted as a system damper reducing the amplitude of mass oscillations. We found that with reduced mass oscillations, the metabolic power required to walk with the device was not significantly different than walking with the mass rigidly fixed. The knowledge garnered through this exploration of medial-lateral load carriage will help inform future decisions on smart load carriage device design.</description>

   <title>Blockade of the Human Ether A-Go-Go-Related Gene (hERG) Potassium Channel by Fentanyl</title>

   <description>Fentanyl poses a serious health concern, with abuse and death rates rising over recent years. Despite the high number of overdose deaths attributed to fentanyl, the complete molecular mechanisms of such deaths have not been well-defined. Although activation of opioid receptors in the brainstem causes respiratory depression, in most cases of drug-induced sudden death cardiac arrhythmias are implicated. Therefore, we posited that disruption of cardiac electrophysiology may contribute to fentanyl-induced death. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr). Drug-mediated disruption of hERG function is the primary cause of acquired long QT syndrome, which predisposes affected individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Therefore, we investigated the effects of fentanyl on hERG channels. The effects of norfentanyl, the main metabolite, and naloxone, an antidote used in fentanyl overdose, were also examined. Currents of hERG channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells were recorded using whole-cell voltage-clamp. When hERG tail currents upon −50 mV repolarization after a 50 mV depolarization were analyzed, fentanyl and naloxone blocked hERG current (IhERG) with IC50 values of 0.9 and 74.3 μM, respectively, whereas norfentanyl did not block. The reduction of IhERG by fentanyl was not antagonized by naloxone, indicating that the reduction was not through activation of opioid receptors. An interesting finding is that fentanyl-mediated block of IhERG was voltage-dependent. Consequently, when a human ventricular action potential waveform voltage protocol was used, fentanyl blocked IhERG with an IC50 of 0.3 μM, which is within the range of blood concentrations after overdose deaths in humans. Furthermore, fentanyl (0.5 μM) blocked IKr and prolonged action potential duration in ventricular myocytes isolated from neonatal rats. The concentrations of fentanyl used in this project were higher than seen with clinical use but overlap with post-mortem overdose concentrations. Further, co-expressed long and short isoforms of hERG, proposed to mimic native channels, displayed an increased sensitivity to fentanyl. Although mechanisms of fentanyl-related sudden death need further investigation, blockade of hERG channels may contribute to death for individuals with high-concentration overdose or compromised cardiac repolarization.</description>

   <title>Social Control and Public Water in Cochabamba, Bolivia</title>

   <description>During the Water War in 2000, residents of Cochabamba, Bolivia, famously mobilized against water privatization, and gained back public control of the city’s water utility. Nearly two decades later, the water movement’s vision of democratic water provision remains largely unfulfilled. The city suffers from a prolonged water crisis of chronic water shortages and uneven distribution, with most of the peri-urban areas not connected to the municipal water operator. Drawing on 18 months of fieldwork, including participant observation and in-depth interviews with water users, community leaders, policymakers, water utility representatives, government officials, scholars, and activists, this thesis explores the daily struggles for better public water services in Cochabamba. As a starting point, I return to the Water War of 2000, where mobilized citizens demanded the democratization of governance structures through ‘social control,’ a local form of public participation. I argue that the inequitable water services in Cochabamba, stratified among classed, racial, and gendered lines, are linked to weak mechanisms of public participation, which can be traced to fundamental divides amongst actors over the meaning of participation. In order to analyze how participatory mechanisms have developed, I build a typology of different kinds of participation according to their conceptualizations, intended outcomes, tools, and practices. Applying this framework to the water and sanitation sector in Cochabamba uncovers whose interests are served, and which groups are included or excluded from access to water and decision-making. It further illustrates how, in their implementation, participatory practices are not linear and can be distorted or appropriated towards different ends. Competing perspectives of ‘social control’ and participation, weak participatory mechanisms, institutional inertia and persistent neoliberal logic have impeded transformative participation from taking hold within the municipal service provider in Cochabamba. Understanding what leads to mixed results of remunicipalization is crucial to strengthening public alternatives.</description>

   <description>This doctoral dissertation examines interdependent conceptions of selfhood in the works of Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-1542), John Donne (1572-1631), and John Milton (1608-1674). While previous studies of selfhood in the Renaissance have been dominated largely by conceptions of the self based on autonomy, nascent individuality, and agency – or the lack thereof – the present dissertation argues that these three Renaissance writers conceived of the self in interdependent terms, emphasizing instead the value of the community and interpersonal relationships in the experience of selfhood in their poetry. Through a close analysis of each writer as a case study involving conceptions of the self in dialogue with particular discourses (such as Stoicism, Anglican irenicism, and Italianate Republicanism), this dissertation argues that it is only through examining Renaissance selfhood in terms of interdependency that we can begin to accurately understand how the self was conceived of and experienced in the period.</description>

   <description>Interleukin (IL)-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine with pleiotropic functions across both innate and adaptive immunity. Composed of subunits IL-27p28 and EBI3, IL-27 signals via a heterodimeric receptor of gp130 and WSX-1 to activate STAT1 and STAT3 homo- and heterodimers. As a cytokine produced in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, IL-27 plays a role in modulating immune cell function during infection. TLRs are a class of pattern recognition receptors involved in the detection of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and corresponding induction of proinflammatory immune responses. Although IL-27 was originally identified as a mediator of helper T cell function, new functions of IL-27 on innate immune cells have come to light on myeloid cells, including enhancing antigen presentation as well as anti-microbial properties. Several anti-viral functions of IL-27 have been identified and it has been established that IL-27 can amplify responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The specific role of IL-27 during these anti-microbial responses is still largely unknown. While these new properties of IL-27 have been identified, how IL-27 modulates innate immune receptors such as TLRs that are involved in microbial recognition has not been investigated. In this thesis, how IL-27 impacts the expression and function of anti-bacterial TLRs, TLR4 and TLR5 and anti-viral endosomal TLRs, TLR7 and TLR8, is investigated using a model of human monocytes and macrophages. Upon stimulation with IL-27, monocytes and macrophages displayed enhanced TLR4, TLR5 and TLR7 expression, but expression of TLR8 was unaffected. TLR4 and TLR5 signaling, and TLR4-mediated cytokine production, was amplified by IL-27 in response to ligand stimulation. However, dissimilar to the anti-bacterial TLRs, the enhanced TLR7 expression did not result in amplified cytokines responses. Instead, TLR8 activity was amplified by IL-27 stimulation, even though its expression remained constant. Additionally, inhibition of TLR8 activity was shown to be inhibited by activation of TLR7 in monocytes and macrophages. Altogether, this work identifies novel functions of IL-27 in modulating innate immune responsiveness and provides insight into the potential mechanisms behind the anti-microbial promoting properties of this cytokine.</description>

   <description>Intestinal functions are predominantly controlled by the enteric nervous system (ENS), which is comprised of the inner submucosal and outer myenteric plexuses. The myenteric plexus innervates the intestinal smooth muscle layers to coordinate intestinal motility. Alterations in the structure of the myenteric plexus can result in dysmotility, which is seen in severe intestinal inflammation, such as the transmural inflammation of Crohn’s disease, one of the two major types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). As well, animal models of IBD have displayed sustained and seemingly irreversible myenteric neuron loss.&#xd;
&#xd;
GDNF, the neurotrophin responsible for development of the ENS, displays neuroprotective effects in adult systems, but this has not been studied in the post-natal ENS. We proposed that GDNF could protect myenteric neurons from inflammatory damage and tested this in a co-culture model system as well as in the TNBS-induced model of colitis in rats. Two distinct neurotoxic challenges that are present in intestinal inflammation are metabolic inhibition and high levels of nitric oxide, and these were modelled in vitro using chemical agents. Quantification of neuronal structure using immunocytochemistry and image analysis showed that either exogenous or cell-mediated GDNF delivery were equally successful in preventing myenteric neuron loss from these challenges.&#xd;
&#xd;
Since only the mature isoform of GDNF has been shown to influence myenteric neurons, the processing of GDNF in the intestine during physiological and inflammatory states was investigated. The matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 was shown to be an essential protease in GDNF processing to yield the mature isoform as well as functional outcomes. Both MMP-9 and GDNF were expressed in intestinal smooth muscle cells, and these showed parallel upregulation with pro-inflammatory stimuli. We conclude that exogenous or cell-mediated GDNF delivery is effective in preserving myenteric neurons during inflammatory challenge.</description>

   <description>The vast quantities of data generated and collected in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have given rise to large retrospective datasets that are frequently used for observational studies. The temporal nature and fine granularity of much of the data collected in the ICU enable the pursuit of predictive modeling. In particular, forecasting acute hypotensive episodes (AHE) in intensive care patients has been of recent interest to researchers in the healthcare domain. Advance warning of an impending AHE may give care providers additional information to help mitigate the negative clinical impact or prompt a search for an evolving disease process. However, the currently accepted definition of AHE is restrictive and does not account for inter-patient variability.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, a novel definition of an AHE based on patient-specific features of blood pressure recordings is proposed. Next, deep learning methods are explored to predict the onset of patient-specific episodes of hypotension at variable event horizons and amounts of observational data.&#xd;
&#xd;
An initial study on a single institutional cohort is conducted before extending the use of deep models to an external validation cohort. Using a single-institutional cohort of 538 patients, an initial deep model was able to successfully predict the onset of an episode of hypotension with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) up to 0.87. When extending the use of deep models to an institutionally external cohort of 223 patients, a refined model was able to successfully predict the onset of an episode of hypotension in the internal dataset with an AUROC up to 0.86 and the external cohort with AUROC up to 0.87. Deep models are shown to outperform a baseline logistic regression approach inspired by the current state-of-the-art on both internal and external test data. The outcome of this work presents a generalizable definition of a patient-specific event and a complimentary deep model that can successfully predict the onset of an episode of hypotension across care centers.</description>

   <title>Nonlinear Response of Monolayer Graphene to THz Frequency Radiation</title>

   <description>Graphene, as a zero-bandgap two-dimensional semiconductor with a linear electron band dispersion near the Dirac points, has potential to exhibit very interesting nonlinear optical properties. In particular, third harmonic generation of terahertz (THz) radiation should&#xd;
occur both due to the nonlinear relationship between the crystal momentum and the current density, and due to the interaction between interband and intraband parts of the current densities due to the vanishing bandgap. This thesis examines the nonlinear response of graphene to THz radiation. The THz response of graphene is investigated by developing density matrix equations employing the length gauge. It is possible to produce higher-frequency THz radiation through the generation of harmonics. Several experimental works have examined the harmonic generation in graphene with the radiation normally incident upon the graphene sheet. In this thesis, a configuration is considered where the graphene sheet is located inside a parallel-plate waveguide and the THz radiation is incident parallel to the sheet. This new configuration is found to increase the power efficiency by more than a factor of 100 relative to the normal-incidence configuration. The pump depletion, self-phase, and cross-phase modulation are also included in modelling the response of this system.  In addition, an optimized waveguide system is designed with two dielectric layers with different indices of refraction to overcome the phase mismatch between the pump field and third-harmonic field at high input fields. Because typical scattering times in graphene are only a few tens of femtoseconds and the period of THz light is on the order of a picosecond, scattering cannot be ignored in modelling the THz response of graphene. Later in the thesis, the linear and nonlinear THz response of graphene is investigated using the velocity gauge to explore the differences between the results obtained in the length and velocity gauges when phenomenological scattering is included. Finally, the nonlinear THz response of graphene is calculated in the length gauge with microscopic scattering. Different scattering mechanisms including neutral impurity scattering and optical phonon scattering are included in our microscopic model. We find that the nonlinear response is much more sensitive to the strength and type of scattering than is the linear response, indicating that any accurate model of harmonic generation in graphene should include microscopic scattering.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the development of two distinct types of luminescent materials and the exploration of their photophysical properties. The first part of the thesis focuses on the synthesis of four new deep-blue phosphorescent Pt(II) compounds by introducing side alkyl chains of different length to two reported Pt(II) compounds with tetradentate and macrocyclic chelate ligands, respectively. The employment of a new synthetic pathway leads to higher yield of the products and shorter reaction time. The modified Pt(II) compounds possess improved solubility in organic solvents, similar photophysical properties, and better performance as the deep-blue electrophosphorescent emitters of OLEDs, compared to the corresponding original Pt(II) compounds. In second part of the thesis, a series of fluorescent indolizino[6,5,4,3-def]phenanthridine derivatives were produced by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions between a new azomethine ylide and eight selected alkynes. All the BPhMes2-functionalized compounds are found to exhibit charge-transfer (CT) fluorescence, while the others exhibit π to π* transitions. Among them, the three pairs of push-pull regioisomers that are formed by reactions with BPhMes2-functionalized asymmetrical internal alkynes are worthy of most attention. They possess distinct electronic and photophysical properties and some of which show rare and interesting temperature “turn-on” fluorescence.</description>

   <title>Conflictual Justice: The Probationary Supervision of Indigenous Offenders in Northeastern Ontario</title>

   <description>This thesis explores the probationary supervision of Indigenous offenders in Northeastern Ontario through semi-structured interviews with four recently retired probation officers, and one Institutional Elder. Thematic analyses revealed three interlocking findings. First, probationary work requires foresight and situational awareness to balance competing conceptions of criminal justice that foreground policy, namely a balance between enforcement and offender rehabilitation. Second, establishing trust with Indigenous offenders is particularly challenging given a lengthy history of colonial assimilation, cultural destruction, and social marginalization - often situated within racial and cultural prejudices evident within Canada's criminal justice system. Probation officer's work with Indigenous offenders situates within a broader socio-political environment that attempts to contextualize the unique circumstances of Indigenous offenders that is suggestive of a turn towards reconciliation through a recognition of the hardships of Indigenous peoples. Lastly, these efforts fall short, as the Canadian state's appeal to reconciliation is ambivalent in the sense that it bounds Indigeneity within the settler-state's system of rules. Within this process, probation officers in Northeastern Ontario - despite their noble intentions - are limited by a lack of Ministry services, and community resources. Within this location, Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders alike do not receive the resources they need for rehabilitation in areas such as substance abuse, and ultimately is contributing to a cycle of criminality, particular within Indigenous populations, that exposes the ambivalence of the state. The results of this thesis suggest that perhaps an insurmountable cultural incongruity exists within the probationary process, and by extension the criminal justice system, wherein the needs of Indigenous offenders are not met within a colonial system that appears alien and repressive.</description>

   <title>Investigating the Role of Neutrophils in Endometriosis Pathophysiology</title>

   <description>Endometriosis is a debilitating gynecological disease characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue lesions outside of the uterus. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark feature of endometriosis, which has been observed in the form of elevated cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell populations such as neutrophils within the systemic circulation and peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients. However, whether and how neutrophils actively contribute to endometriosis pathophysiology have remained poorly understood. With emerging roles for neutrophils in chronic and sterile inflammatory processes, we sought to provide in-depth characterization of neutrophil involvement in endometriosis using patient specimens and an established mouse model. We demonstrated that neutrophils reside within patient ovarian endometriotic lesions and that patient lesions possess elevated expression of various factors known to influence neutrophil recruitment and function. We also provided first evidence that systemic circulating neutrophils from endometriosis patients display unique transcriptomic differences compared to healthy control neutrophils. Through extensive time-course characterization of our syngeneic, immunocompetent mouse model of endometriosis, we revealed that neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the peritoneal environment early after surgical endometriotic lesion establishment and remain present in murine lesions long term. Furthermore, neutrophil recruitment was associated with elevated peritoneal fluid and systemic chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, and pro-angiogenic mediators. In vivo neutrophil depletion altered the peritoneal and systemic immune microenvironment of endometriosis mice as demonstrated by alterations in inflammatory cytokines and a reduction in the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor. Taken together, these findings highlight a novel dimension for neutrophils in early events such as modulation of the local inflammatory environment and angiogenesis associated with development of endometriotic lesions.</description>

   <description>Background: Prostate Cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of cancer in men. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the standard of care for advanced PCa, has been associated with developing the metabolic syndrome. The gastrointestinal microbiota (GIM) plays a central role in governing host metabolic processes. We aimed to prospectively investigate the short and long-term impact of ADT on the GIM of PCa patients. We hypothesized that there will be a reduction in gastrointestinal bacteria associated with promoting human health (Clostridiaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae families) and an enrichment of bacteria associated with human pathologies (Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families) in men following ADT initiation. Methods: Men with PCa prior to ADT initiation or those on a watchful waiting protocol (WWP) were enrolled by the Centre of Applied Urological Research. Stool, blood, urine and saliva specimens were collected from men at baseline (prior to ADT initiation) and then prospectively 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following enrolment. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about food habits, basic demographics, medication use and history of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. DNA isolated from stool samples was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq 2000 and analyzed on MicrobiomeAnalyst and Prism 8, using alpha and beta diversity metrics for community level analysis, and nonparametric Friedman tests with Dunn’s multiple comparisons, for bacterial level analysis. Results: Fifteen PCa ADT-naïve men were enrolled; 11/15 initiated ADT, while 4/15 were on a WWP. The median age of both cohorts was 76, while mean weight, body-mass index, and waist circumference was significantly different between the two groups at baseline (p = 0.001, p = 0.018, p = 0.050, respectively). Sequencing analysis revealed no significant differences in community diversity between the two cohorts at baseline. ADT initiation was associated with no significant changes after 3 months, however 6 months of ADT was associated with a complete loss in Bifidobacteriaceae family (p = 0.04). Conclusions: The reduction of the family Bifidobacteriaceae may be linked to the metabolic changes associated with ADT initiation. Our study is the first to provide a prospective analysis on the impact of ADT on the GIM of PCa patients.</description>

   <description>With the deepening of the reform in examination and enrollment system in China, the English Academic Test plays an increasingly important role in selecting the secondary school graduates for institutions of higher vocational education. Therefore, it is of great significance to ensure the quality of the test. A substantial body of research has shown that test takers are able to correctly respond to reading comprehension (RC) multiple-choice (MC) items without reading or comprehending the accompanying passage (Hannon &amp; Daneman, 2001; Katz, Blackburn, &amp;Lautenschlager, 1991; Lifson, Scruggs, &amp; Bennion, 1984), confirming that the passage dependence issue does exist in the testing of RC. The term passage dependence refers to the extent to which students can correctly answer the RC questions depending on whether they have read the accompanying passage. This study seeks to determine the extent to which the RC MC items in the English Academic Test is passage-dependent from the perspective of passage types and item types.&#xd;
            A quantitative analysis (descriptive statistics, Independent-Samples T Test, One-Sample T Test, Chi-Square Test) of performance in RC component of the English Academic Test 2017 and 2018 were conducted on 343Grade 11 students in two senior secondary schools in Guangzhou, China. The results of the present study are as follows： &#xd;
 (1) Participants’ scores of the items for both narrative and expository passages under the with-passage condition were significantly higher than the scores obtained under the without- passage condition. Furthermore, the items associated with narrative passages were more passage-dependent than the items associated with expository passages. (2) Factual item type was more dependent on the passage than the inferential item type. (3) There was a significant relationship between item types and Passage Dependence Index.  In addition, the main idea item type and vocabulary-in-context item type were the least passage-dependent item types. &#xd;
            The result of passage types indicates that the RC component of the English Academic Test was with relatively high validity regarding passage dependence. Students and teachers are advised to be aware of the fact that it is impossible to gain success in the RC test simply by applying test-wise strategies. Emphasis should be made on the development of students’ RC ability. Meanwhile, the result of item types provides empirical evidence for the test designers for improving the quality of the test.</description>

   <description>Growing literature has raised concerns that repeated sub-concussive impacts to the head may induce changes in both structural and functional brain biomarkers. Despite these findings however, evidence from neuroimaging using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast has limited our understanding for the effects of repetitive head impacts on physiological parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2).&#xd;
&#xd;
In this project, we combined novel calibrated magnetic resonance imaging methods with helmet accelerometers to gather insight about the effects of sub-concussive collisions on brain hemodynamics and explore the relationship between head impacts and changes in brain biomarkers. Dual-echo BOLD and arterial spin labelling (ASL) contrasts modulated via precise gas breathing manipulations (i.e., hypercapnia and hyperoxia) were used to study changes in the brain of collegiate football players, while accounting for time-varying fluctuations in cerebrovascular physiology. Increases in default-mode network functional connectivity, as well as changes in resting CBF and CMRO2, were all documented following exposure to head impacts, suggesting that brain physiological parameters may be sensitive to repeated mechanical loading from sub-concussive events during the season.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using these findings as a basis for actions toward reducing head impacts in football, we leveraged TEDx Montréal as a social platform to introduce the NeuroProtection Project - a novel approach designed to re-focus coaching practices toward improving how athletes are thought to engage in contact on the football field. Finally, the effectiveness of the NeuroProtection project was tested in high- school football players using a combination of video analyses, helmet accelerometers and customized training paradigms. Significant improvements in blocking and tackling techniques were observed following introduction of the data-informed intervention, as well as a ~30% decrease in the frequency of head impacts sustained during practice. These findings suggest that targeted behavioral interventions may&#xd;
be used to improve coaching practices and promote safer play.&#xd;
&#xd;
Altogether, it is hoped that these findings will motivate the integration of multi-modal imaging designs to deepen our knowledge for the effects of sub-concussive impacts, while inspiring the expansion of community-based initiatives like the NeuroProtection project to prioritize safety in contact sports.</description>

   <title>Development of a Computational Treatment Planning System for Radiofrequency Ablation of Vertebral Metastases</title>

   <description>Introduction: Vertebral metastases affect around 61,000 Americans annually. The presence of vertebral metastases may lead to skeletal related events which can include pain, fracture, and neurologic compromise, all of which can negatively impact a patient’s mobility and quality of life. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a minimally invasive thermal therapy used to palliatively treat vertebral metastases. Current treatment practices incorporate little to no treatment planning and utilize two-dimensional imaging to localize the vertebra of interest. This may lead to inadequate treatment dose or delivering dose to healthy tissues. To address the need for better planning and delivery of RF ablation in spine procedures, this work aims to design and develop a computational treatment planning system (TPS) capable of generating patient specific treatment plans. The system was validated using functionality and usability testing. &#xd;
Methods: System requirements were determined based on input from clinicians and researchers. Using these requirements, a TPS that could interact with an external dose engine was developed using the open source platform, 3D Slicer. Patient imaging was obtained to perform functionality testing of the designed TPS. Testing was performed using a simplified prescribed dose function. The calculation of damage volumes was done on voxel-based meshes and compared to a ground truth. Usability testing was also performed with data captured from questionnaires given to clinicians after interacting with the system.&#xd;
Results: 14 patient CT scans were used to generate RF ablation treatment plans. In all cases the TPS was able to perform all necessary functionality. The voxel-based meshes produced thermal damage volumes larger than the ground truth. Usability testing indicated that clinicians were supportive of this TPS being adopted for RF ablation of vertebral metastases. The most likely clinical uptake for this system would come through radiation oncology, with treatment plans provided to orthopaedic surgeons and interventional radiologists. &#xd;
Conclusion: A computational treatment planning system could be a feasible and beneficial addition to the clinical workflow for RF ablation of vertebral metastases.</description>

   <description>Health professionals and people with Parkinson’s disease both agree that lapses in communication interfere with efficient and effective health care. The Talk4HealthCare program was developed with the aim of helping people with Parkinson's disease to have a collaborative healthcare journey by improving their knowledge, self-efficacy, health communication, and health service navigation. &#xd;
The aim of this thesis was to assess the potential of the program for further development and investment in terms of fit with literature, expert opinion, feasibility, and effect.  This aim was achieved through three studies: scoping review, formative evaluation and pilot testing.   &#xd;
A scoping review was conducted that provided theoretical justification for the program and helped in the refinement of the program.  We found person-level and system-level barriers prevent people with Parkinson’s disease from accessing healthcare. Communication barriers may arise at both levels.&#xd;
A formative evaluation was conducted by contacting fifteen Parkinson’s disease experts (people with Parkinson’s n=5, healthcare professionals n=4, educators n=4, family members n=2).  These experts took part in semi-structured focus group or individual interviews and indicated that the program covered essential and significant topics to promote communication skills through a well-designed format. They recommended changes to adapt the program to the physical needs of people with Parkinson’s disease. The program was thus refined and prepared for the pilot test. &#xd;
A pilot test, using a multiple-methods study design, tested feasibility and achievement of outcomes, and a qualitative study was aimed to obtain feedback from the participants.  Eight people with Parkinson’s disease (median age 72 years; male: female = 3:5) were recruited from Parkinson Canada. Data collection took place by administering questionnaires and telephone interviews.  The pilot study showed a large effect size for knowledge (0.59) and communication skills (0.51), and moderate effect size for self-efficacy (0.25).  The participants of the pilot study found that the program well organized with appropriate content and format. &#xd;
Overall, the program was found to be consistent with the literature; acceptable to Parkinson’s Disease experts, feasible to implement, and effective in improving the communication skills. The efficacy of the program should be tested in a further study with larger sample size.</description>

   <description>Background signals in particle detectors can originate from several categories of sources, including radioactivity found in the detector or its housing and cosmic radiations. High energy physics relies heavily on the use of particle detectors that are capable of identifying the desired particles while ruling out backgrounds. Fractures in the detectors create a background that makes it difficult to anticipate the timing of their occurrence. Given that typical rare-event search experiments last months or longer, it would be advantageous to find a way to identify when fractures occur and how to discriminate against them. The Double Cleavage Drilled Compression (DCDC) geometry allows creating fracture-inducing stresses in the material in a reliable manner. Given the brittle nature of Bismuth Germanate (Bi3 Ge4 O12 or BGO) single-crystal scintillators and their negligible afterglow, this thesis investigates backgrounds due to fractures in BGO crystals in the DCDC geometry. A series of experiments were conducted where both photonic and phononic emissions were recorded along with the crack propagation to study the fractoluminescence and acoustic signals generated, and how they would interfere with particle detection. Fractoluminescence in global fracture was confirmed in BGO over many conditions. Acoustic emissions due to fractures were correlated to the crack growth, and significant acoustic events were measured during subcritical fracture. The subcritical fracture was measured using image analysis of the crack, and the crack growth model was identified using evolutionary algorithms.&#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis also discusses the design of micro-fabricated chips to test the effects of cryogenic temperatures on the rate of crack growth, and to study the possibility of quantum effects dominating the subcritical fracture mechanism.</description>

   <description>Algal oils have been extensively used as feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. These can be obtained using one of several extraction techniques, such as Soxhlet extraction. A critical issue is the presence of compounds in the crude extract that lead to lower yields and low-quality biodiesel produced, i.e. phospholipids (PLs). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is commonly used for the analytical and sample preparation of compounds due to its rapidity, low cost and simplicity; including lipid analysis. The literature presents validated SPE methods for the fractionation of lipids in complex mixtures (i. e. human sources). However, SPE methods applied to algal lipid classification have yet to be fully developed and validated in the literature.  &#xd;
The objective of this project is thus to provide the user with a rapid, efficient and reliable standardized analytical method for the determination of useful lipids, triglycerides (TGs) and fatty acids (FAs) from algal biomass to produce biodiesel. &#xd;
Firstly, critical factors affecting the performance of the SPE procedure using NH2-Si were identified and evaluated, namely active phase, loading mass, precondition step and elutions. The results indicated that there is a cross-contamination between lipid classes, especially PLs, which were prone to be prematurely eluted when high quantities are present in the algal biomass (>15 mg). SPE conditions (active phase, loading mass, precondition step and elutions) were modified and tested in order to decrease the cross-contamination. The modified SPE method solved the PL elution issue. However, the elution of other type of lipids of interest was negatively affected (i. e. underestimation of fatty acids). &#xd;
Secondly, current SPE procedures using -Si and NH2-Si to quantify algal lipids were tested and standardized, and the results were then compared to the composition of standard mixtures of lipids used to perform the SPEs.&#xd;
An accurate reference to determine the total useful lipid content for biofuel production and other applications, using SPE procedures, is recommended in this thesis. SPEs using -Si and NH2-Si columns can be performed consecutively to quantify, firstly, neutral lipids (TGs, and FAs), GLs and PLs; and secondly, TGs and FAs; respectively.</description>

   <description>Since the release of the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, municipalities are increasingly addressing reconciliation in their practice, including new engagement with Indigenous heritage and public memory. Municipal perspectives of heritage are frequently colonial and result in Euro-Canadian commemorative landscapes that reinforce official national narratives of history and identity. These landscapes limit the expression of Indigenous heritage and reinforce settler-ignorance. If the goal of creating reconciliatory spaces is to foster dialogue, interaction, and opportunities for conciliation, current municipal heritage practices are insufficient. This research uses Kingston, Ontario as an opportunity to explore municipal heritage practice in the context of reconciliation, and learns from Indigenous peoples what new places of public memory might look like when created from decolonial perspectives. It indicates that there is a need not only for the modification of current colonial commemorative landscapes, but also for the creation of new places of Indigenous public memory that are dynamic, emphasize dialogue and community, and that might create opportunities for conciliation. Decolonizing municipal heritage practice will require a willingness to experience discomfort and vulnerability, the redress of settler-ignorance, and a commitment to creating new relationships with Indigenous peoples.</description>

   <title>Adhesion Proteins: Keeping Bacteria in Their Place</title>

   <description>Many bacteria produce outer membrane-localized proteins that adhere them to varying biotic and abiotic substrates. Such interactions are crucial for the life-cycle of many microorganisms, promoting retention in high-nutrient locations and the formation of communities, called biofilms. From a human perspective, microbial adhesion and biofilm formation are often detrimental, causing chronic antibiotic-resistant infections, the corrosion and clogging of machinery, and the spoiling of resources. It is in the best interest of human health and industry to understand the molecular connections that allow these natural phenomena to take place, and how they can be augmented or sabotaged. &#xd;
As such, the purpose of this thesis was to interrogate the structure/function of several adhesion proteins produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Two of the three adhesion protein examples chosen are part of the Repeats-In-Toxin family, which relies on the type I secretion system for proper localization and cell-membrane retention. The examples include: 1) The 1.5-MDa ice-binding protein from the Antarctic bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis. The protein’s remarkable size can be attributed to one region that holds ~120 tandem repeat domains. Structure determination of a four-repeat segment confirmed these domains to be immunoglobulin-like β-sandwiches that bind calcium ions for both proper folding and rigidity, facilitating the region’s proposed role of extension. 2) The adhesion protein from the oil-eating bacterium Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, which houses a proposed PA14 domain close to its C-terminal tip. This domain was shown to bind sugar through a combination of X-ray crystallography and a custom-made competition assay. Potential applications for this domain as a dextran-affinity tag were also explored. And 3) an example from a different protein family was characterized due to the incorporation of a DUF3494 – a well-known ice-binding domain – into its distal tip. The ice-binding activity of this DUF3494 was confirmed and characterized, adding to the ongoing intrigue of this widespread and functionally-variable domain.</description>

   <description>The MacMillan Pass district in Yukon, Canada, hosts the Tom and Jason sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) Pb-Zn-Ag-(Ba) deposits. Pyrite-bearing drill core samples were collected from seven drill holes that intersected mineralization and time-stratigraphically equivalent rocks 2 – 3 km away. Detailed petrographic analyses reveal four pyrite textural varieties, each with distinct morphological characteristics: earliest diagenetic (Py1), early diagenetic (Py2a), late diagenetic (Py2b), and metamorphic (Py3). The timing for SEDEX Pb-Zn mineralization was syn- and/or post-late diagenesis (Py2b). A representative subset of pyrite grains was analysed for trace element contents and distributions by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) using raster grids to create quantitative trace element composition maps. These were used to characterise the trace element composition of each pyrite generation and investigate how trace elements spatially vary. LA-ICP-MS analyses reveal each textural variety of pyrite has a distinct trace element composition that varies depending on the stratigraphic unit it is hosted in. A suite of SEDEX-mineralization-related elements (Zn, As, Pb, Tl, Bi) is incorporated into Py2 within mineralized units at greater abundances than in unmineralized units. Lead, Pb/Se and As/Mo contents in pyrite are the most robust potential vectors toward mineralization. Bulk geochemical paleo-redox proxies (Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce*, Mo, Re/Mo, and Ni/Co) indicate that an anoxic – dysoxic water column and euxinic porewater conditions persisted during the deposition of the Lower Earn Group strata. &#xd;
A Ba-horizon was identified in rocks that are distal and time-equivalent to Pb-Zn mineralization. The Ba-horizon contains Py2 with anomalous metal (Tl, Co, Mn, Cd, Zn, Sb) contents and abundant barite, and is interpreted to represent the distal expression of hydrothermal activity. Two models are proposed to explain the formation of the Ba-horizon. In the first model, venting hydrothermal fluid debouched into the water column, ponded at the seafloor and infiltrated downward into the sediment. In the other model, hydrothermal fluid did not vent into the water column, it travelled up the fluid conduit and then migrated laterally within the unconsolidated sediment column to the distal locations. Both models invoke hydrothermal fluid metal contributions to Py2 within the Ba-horizon, and barite formation is facilitated by biological activity that is stimulated by warm, hydrothermal fluid.</description>

   <subject>Homogeneously-Catalyzed Coupling Reactions in Switchable Solvents</subject>
   <description>Due to the increasing environmental impact of society, it is imperative that current industrial processes be modified and new industrial processes be implemented in order to reduce environmental harm. However, these new or modified processes must be more energy-efficient, materials-efficient, and cost-effective so that they are more economically beneficial than the other processes. The described research was inspired by these two ideas and is comprised of two projects, both focused on the creation of recyclable, CO2-switchable methods of separating organic products, inorganic byproduct and catalyst.&#xd;
For the first part of the project, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings were tested in switchable water, concentrating on the activation of aryl chlorides and product separation techniques. Switchable water, which is an aqueous solution of an amine, was used as solvent with the amine functioning as the base for the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of activated aryl chlorides with phenyl boronic acid, using TPPTS (a water-soluble phosphine ligand). The use of Schlenk techniques resulted in conversion of 99% and isolated yields of 87% with the absence of homocoupling. &#xd;
For the second part of the project, the development of an easily prepared CO2-switchable polymeric ligand is described. The polymeric ligand was used in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for the synthesis of a biaryl product using 4-iodobenzaldehyde and phenylboronic acid pinacol ester in water. With the help of this switchable polymeric ligand, organic product, inorganic byproduct, and catalyst were separated into three fractions.  A catalyst recycling system was developed for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The catalyst was able to be recovered and reused, albeit with lower activity.</description>

   <description>In response to recent challenges facing the Southern Ontario automotive industry, including disruptive changes in vehicle product technologies, federal and provincial Canadian governments have sought to transition the sector’s strategic focus from manufacturing to innovation and new product development. In doing so, they have established numerous innovation programs and formulated a supercluster strategy designed to enhance levels of corporate automotive research and development (R&amp;D). Consequently, several observers suggest that the Southern Ontario automotive industry has embarked on a new developmental path.&#xd;
Employing the GPN 2.0 approach, this study evaluates these claims and the efficacy of current government policy by examining the regional-level impacts of recent technological advancements in the Southern Ontario automotive parts industry. A 2015 plant-level survey of parts producers competitive and innovation strategies and corporate interviews are used to investigate the extent to which the sector is adapting current products and processes, at what scale automotive innovation occurs and the location factors which attract new automotive technology investments. Three primary research findings follow from this analysis. First, regulatory, technological and safety concerns are inhibiting industry advancement and supplier investment in components for electrical propulsion and CAVs. Second, few auto parts producers engage in early-stage innovation or compete based on product differentiation. Third, global parts suppliers continue to locate their primary corporate R&amp;D facilities outside of the province.&#xd;
Subsequent chapters explore the implications of these findings for economic development in Southern Ontario. Corporate interviews reveal that automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and global automotive suppliers shape which early-stage R&amp;D investments are made, where associated automotive innovation activities occur, and how new&#xd;
product design and engineering information is transferred within the sector. The overwhelming majority of new technology investments are observed to cluster in Michigan and serve to reinforce Southern Ontario's interconnection with the Great Lakes automotive region (GLR). Due to built-up manufacturing skill and expertise in the province, many parts suppliers continue to transfer product specification information both to their own plants in Ontario and those of their lower-tier suppliers. The concluding chapter identifies three pillars upon which the resiliency of Canadian automotive parts manufacturing can be secured.</description>

   <description>Hyper-enriched black shale (HEBS) deposits, such as those hosted in Devonian black shales of northern Yukon, are a globally significant source of a variety of economically important metals, particularly nickel, copper, zinc and platinum group elements (PGE). The Yukon HEBS occurs as a thin (&lt;10 cm) but laterally extensive (1000s km) stratiform and stratabound mineralized horizon that is enriched in a number of metals, significantly, Ni-Mo-Zn-PGE. The genesis of such deposits and the ambient paleoenvironment in which they formed are the subject of vigorous debate. Two genetic models, seafloor hydrothermal alteration and seawater scavenging have the most traction. These models invoke euxinic conditions for the formation and preservation of semi-massive sulfides. &#xd;
Non-traditional isotopes, particularly molybdenum and thallium, are robust paleoredox indicators, especially where bulk geochemical paleoredox indicators exhibit ambiguities. Systematic sampling and Mo and Tl isotopic analysis of a 200 m stratigraphic section through the Yukon HEBS mineralization and the footwall and hanging-wall strata at the Peel River north and south bank showings give δ98Mo -1.24 to -0.53‰ and ε205Tl -8.1 to -5.2 for the mineralization, and 0.05 to 0.60‰ and -4.8 to -4.4 for the unmineralized strata, respectively. These values preclude a hydrothermal origin, but, together with rare earth elements (REE) and several bulk geochemical redox indicators, indicate that the mineralization formed from seawater in a quiescent, euxinic basinal paleoenvironment.</description>

   <description>An optimized recipe for a radiochromic micelle (RM) leuco-crystal violet (LCV) gel dosimeter was proposed using full-factorial designed experiments and model-based optimization. Linear regression models were used to optimize gel recipes with regard to high dose sensitivity (DS) and minimal dose-rate dependence. The proposed gel recipe contains 35 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 1.10 mM LCV, 173 mM 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE), 25 mM trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), 96 wt% water and 4 wt% gelatin. Results from replicate cuvette experiments showed that the proposed gel recipe is dose-rate independent and has an average DS equal to 0.0141 Gy-1 cm-1. No statistically significant energy-dependence was observed in cuvette experiments involving 12 MeV electrons and 6 MV photons. Preliminary 3-D dosimetry experiments were conducted in 1 L jars to study dose responses of the proposed recipe in large phantoms. The DS was 0.0110 Gy-1 cm-1 for a 1 L phantom irradiated with 12 MeV electrons, and 0.0115 Gy-1 cm-1 for a 1 L phantom irradiated with 6 MV photons. Further work on 1 L phantoms is required to test gel reproducibility and the statistical significance of any dose-rate dependent or energy-dependent behavior. &#xd;
A systematic study was performed testing the reusability and reproducibility of the optimized gel recipe. A large batch of gel material was made from replicates that were previously irradiated to doses up to 30 Gy. Three iterations of gel re-use were performed to study the effects of gel dosimeter recycling on initial background colour, DS and dose-rate-dependence. A statistically significant linear increase in background colour suggests that the proposed gel dosimeter might be suitable for storing and administering incremental radiation doses.  An apparent upward trend in DS with gel re-use was observed, which suggests that RM LCV gel dosimeters could benefit from a pre-irradiation step to help improve dosimeter sensitivity. Minor dose-rate dependent behavior was observed after multiple gel re-uses; however, no significant behavior was observed at the 95% confidence level. Additional testing on 1 L phantoms is required to determine the clinical relevance and reusability potential of the proposed gel dosimeter.</description>

   <description>Objective: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease of proliferative vascular occlusion that is strongly linked to heterozygous mutations in BMPR2, the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type II receptor (BMPR-II). The endothelial-selective BMPR-II ligand, BMP9, has been shown to reverse disease in animal models of PAH and suppress the proliferation of healthy endothelial cells. However, the impact of BMPR2 loss on the antiproliferative actions of BMP9 has yet to be assessed in endothelial cells from PAH patients. &#xd;
&#xd;
Approach: BMP9 responses were assessed in blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from PAH patients and controls, as well as human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) with or without BMPR2 silencing. Mouse pulmonary endothelial cells (MPECs), bearing a wildtype genome or a heterozygous or homozygous deletion of Bmpr2, were isolated from endothelial-conditional knockout mice (Bmpr2EC+/+, Bmpr2EC+/- or Bmpr2EC-/-). These mice were also assessed in vivo for altered retinal and lung angiogenesis following post-natal BMP9 administration.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: BMP9 suppressed proliferation in control endothelial cells, but increased proliferation in PAH patient BOECs, BMPR2 silenced HPAECs and Bmpr2-/- MPECs. This proliferative shift was not linked to altered metabolic activity or interactions with canonical TGFβ signaling, but was associated with the prolonged induction of the canonical BMP targets, the inhibitor of DNA-binding/differentiation genes, ID1 and ID2. In vivo, BMP9 administration reduced neonatal retinal and pulmonary vascular density in controls, but enhanced both measures in Bmpr2EC-/- mice. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: Loss of BMPR2 results in a shift of the endothelial BMP9 response towards enhanced proliferation. This finding has potential implications for the clinical translation of BMP9 for the treatment of PAH.</description>

   <description>Segmentation is a ubiquitous operation in radiation therapy (RT) and in medical image computing (MIC) in general. Various data representations can describe segmentation results, such as binary volumes or surface models. Conversions between them are often required, which include complex data processing. There are challenges involved in managing multiple representations, which pose a hindrance to research application development and usability. The challenges are related to conversion method selection, data provenance, consistency, coherence of in-memory objects, and fidelity.&#xd;
The fundamental contribution is a software methodology for dynamic management of multiple segmentation representations, which facilitates RT and MIC research software development and improves end-user experience. At the core, a complex data container preserves identity and provenance of the contained representations and ensures data coherence. Conversions from one representation to another are executed automatically. A graph containing the conversion algorithms determines each execution, ensuring consistency between representations. The accuracy of the core conversion algorithms was evaluated.&#xd;
The software infrastructure is made available as an open-source library, based on which a manual and semi-automated segmentation application was created that has become one of the most versatile segmentation tools available, corroborated by the number of projects using it worldwide. Numerous clinical research applications have also been developed based on the proposed framework, facilitating different aspects of radiation therapy research: gel and film dosimetry analysis, MRI-ultrasound contour propagation, and external beam planning system.&#xd;
An issue related to a typical conversion step is explored, focusing on the calculation of a universal RT plan evaluation metric. Accuracy depends on spatial resolution and thus the conversion parameters, which need to be different based on structure size and complexity. A fuzzy-based algorithm is presented to calculate the parameters for each structure.&#xd;
In summary, a software methodology is proposed for dynamic management of representations in image segmentation, offering a solution to the challenges that arise when working with multiple representations. The implemented infrastructure facilitates rapid and robust application development, and allows creating more user-friendly software. The community impact of the applications developed using the framework and the ongoing research and education projects show its potential in the clinical and research community.</description>

   <description>In-app advertisements have become a major revenue for app developers in the mobile app economy. Ad libraries play an integral part in this ecosystem as app developers integrate these libraries into their apps to display ads. However, little is known about how app developers integrate these libraries with their apps and how these libraries have evolved over time.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we study the ad library integration practices and the evolution of such libraries. To understand the integration practices of ad libraries, we manually study apps and derive a set of rules to automatically identify four strategies for integrating multiple ad libraries. We observe that integrating multiple ad libraries commonly occurs in apps with a large number of downloads and ones in categories with a high percentage of apps that display ads. We also observe that app developers prefer to manage their own integrations instead of using off the shelf features of ad libraries for integrating multiple ad libraries.&#xd;
&#xd;
To study the evolution of ad libraries, we conduct a longitudinal study of the 8 most popular ad libraries. In particular, we look at their evolution in terms of size, the main drivers for releasing a new ad library version, and their architecture. We observe that ad libraries are continuously evolving with a median release interval of 34 days. Some ad libraries have grown exponentially in size (e.g., Facebook Audience Network ad library), while other libraries have worked to reduce their size. To study the main drivers for releasing an ad library version, we manually study the release notes of the eight studied ad libraries. We observe that ad library developers continuously update their ad libraries to support a wider range of Android versions (i.e., to ensure that more devices can use the libraries without errors). Finally, we derive a reference architecture for ad libraries and study how the studied ad libraries diverged from this architecture during our study period.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our findings can assist ad library developers to understand the challenges for developing ad libraries and the desired features of these libraries.</description>

   <description>Background: Ventricular arrhythmia is a prevalent and dangerous cause of sudden cardiac death. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are devices that can detect and terminate ventricular arrhythmia, but current risk stratification methods offer limited prediction of arrhythmic events when selecting patients for ICD implantation. Furthermore, better methods are needed to identify ICD patients at greater risk of ventricular arrhythmia than others. Layered Symbolic Decomposition frequency (LSDf) is a signal processing metric that quantifies abnormal frequency content in signal-averaged electrocardiogram recordings. The aims of this study were to 1) determine if LSDf is predictive of adverse outcomes in an ICD patient cohort 2) identify if LSDf is related to known electrical parameters. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods and Results: For Aim 1, fifty-two ICD patients were recruited from 2008-2009. These were followed for a mean 8.5±0.4 years for the primary outcome of first appropriately treated ventricular arrhythmia or death. Thirty-four subjects met the primary outcome. LSDf was significantly lower and 12-lead QRS duration was significantly greater in patients meeting the primary outcome (12.14±3.97%, n=34vs. 16.45±3.73% n=18; p=0.001) and (111.59±14.96 ms, n=34 vs. 97.69±13.51 ms, n=18; p=0.012) respectively. A 13.25% LSDf threshold (0.74 sensitivity and 0.85 specificity) was selected based on Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted; patients above the 13.25% threshold demonstrated significantly better survival outcomes (p&lt;0.001). Cox multivariate regression analysis compared the LSDf threshold (13.25%) to LVEF (28.5%), 12-lead QRSd (100 ms), age, % male sex, NYHA classification, and antiarrhythmic usage. LSDf was a predictor of the primary outcome (p=0.005) and just ventricular arrhythmia (p=0.002). Subsequent physiological experiments for Aim 2 were conducted to determine if LSDf was related to ventricular conduction velocity (n=7), ventricular effective refractory period (n=13), or the presence of abnormal substrate (n=10) These patients were recruited from June 2011, March 2018, and April 2018, respectively. LSDf did not significantly change in normal patients after administration of procainamide or ibutilide. Patients undergoing catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmia had significant greater LSDf following ablation (7.78% vs 9.40%, n=10 p&lt;0.001). Electroanatomic mapping of low-voltage areas indicated LSDf may have an association with low-voltage areas in the ventricles (Spearman r= -0.81).</description>

   <description>Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder of pregnancy, characterized by new onset hypertension and the presence of specific organ dysfunction such as proteinuria. While the etiology remains elusive, it is believed to be a disease of placental origin. Carbon monoxide (CO) is actively being studied as a potential therapeutic for PE due to its vasodilatory, angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties, with the aim that CO can improve placental function and maternal vascular dysfunction during pregnancy. CO has been shown to increase uteroplacental vascular growth and prevent PE-like signs in mice. How CO acts to promote vascular changes during pregnancy is unclear. Thus, the objectives of this research were to determine the effect of low-dose CO on markers of angiogenesis and inflammation at both the maternal-fetal interface and systemically during mouse pregnancy, and to characterize the effect of CO on histomorphological changes at the implantation site. &#xd;
&#xd;
The hypothesis that CO increases angiogenesis during pregnancy via modulation of major angiogenic/inflammatory pathways was tested using healthy, pregnant CD-1 mice. Following chronic administration of 250 ppm CO, genes encoding VEGF and angiopoietin receptors, eNOS, and cell adhesion molecules were upregulated at the implantation sites at gestation day (GD)10.5; no changes in gene expression were observed at GD16.5. Furthermore, CO treatment did not reveal any measurable changes in pro-inflammatory or angiogenic cytokines in the plasma or tissue lysates from implantation sites. Additionally, histological analysis at GD10.5 and GD16.5 implantation sites demonstrated no difference in cell markers characteristic of placental health and function, including trophoblast invasion (pan-cytokeratin), cellular proliferation (Ki67), and uterine natural killer cell abundance (Dolichos biflorus lectin). &#xd;
&#xd;
Collectively, the data presented in this thesis suggest that CO acts to potentiate uteroplacental vascular growth via the angiogenic axis at midgestation, without impacting pregnancy specific adaptations including local/systemic immune function and histomorphological changes at the maternal-fetal interface. Understanding how low-dose CO modulates angiogenesis and inflammation during normal pregnancy is crucial prior to its use therapeutically. Future studies are required to validate the safety and efficacy of CO as a potential therapeutic for vascular insufficiency diseases such as PE.</description>

   <description>Co-contraction is a common strategy when performing difficult or unstable motor tasks. For example, we co-contract muscles of the arm when generating downward force to turn a screw and co-contract muscles of the leg when walking on a slippery surface. It is thought that the primary benefit of co-contraction is to directly increase the mechanical impedance (stiffness and damping) of muscle to generate greater instantaneous restoring forces when a limb or joint is perturbed. However, this explanation ignores the role of neural feedback in corrective responses. Characterizing the effects of co-contraction on motor function is important to understanding its use in common tasks and its role in pathologies such as knee osteoarthritis. A series of experiments were performed to investigate the effects of co-contraction on the motor response to physical perturbations. First, participants performed an upper limb postural control task in which a random torque pulse perturbed the elbow. Muscle activity was increased in the elbow flexors or extensors independently by resisting a background load or in both muscle groups simultaneously by co-contracting. Rapid corrective responses were generated without overshoot even at the lowest level of co-contraction, whereas activating a single muscle group more than double that amount resulted in poorer performance. Thus, it was not the total muscle activity, and thus the increase in limb impedance, that improved performance when co-contracting, but the fact that both muscle groups were simultaneously pre-activated before the disturbance. It was shown that the primary benefit of co-contraction was the ability to engage both the stretched and shortened muscles in the corrective response. This behavior was also observed in an upper limb tracking task, demonstrating that it was not a simple strategy invoked only for stationary postural control, but a strategy that also improved performance during movement. Further work expanded the generalizability of this behavior in the upper limb and extended it to the lower limb. Finally, the benefits of this strategy were examined using an optimal feedback control model. The results of this work indicate that co-contraction engages a unique motor strategy, providing new insight into its role in motor function.</description>

   <description>Plant and microbial alkaloids have a rich history stemming from their structural diversity and&#xd;
medicinal applications. Accordingly, these natural products and their derivatives continue to pique interest&#xd;
within the synthetic and biosynthetic communities. Heterocyclic motifs are common among the alkaloids;&#xd;
the unique chemical transformations and biosynthetic origins of these systems thus present a versatile&#xd;
platform for the generation of structurally diverse molecules.&#xd;
Chapter one of this thesis describes the development of an efficient route to key cularine alkaloid&#xd;
intermediate, Manske’s ketone. Optimization and scope studies were conducted leading to a robust and&#xd;
general two-step synthesis of functionalized dibenzo[b,f]oxepin-10(11H)-ones via nucleophilic aromatic&#xd;
substitution (SNAr) and palladium-catalyzed intramolecular α-arylation. We have demonstrated the utility&#xd;
of these ubiquitous heterocyclic systems by further cross-coupling chemistry. The scope of the α-arylation&#xd;
methodology was additionally expanded to provide 11-substituted dibenzoxepinones; application to benzofused nitrogen- and sulfur-containing 7-membered heterocycles is also described. Studies into the curious&#xd;
formation of a trimethoxy-substituted xanthone, the major product under previously described&#xd;
intramolecular α-arylation conditions, are currently ongoing.&#xd;
Chapter two describes the evaluation and synthesis of two related classes of bioactive pyrrole-containing alkaloids, the prodiginines and tambjamines. The proton affinity of cyclic tambjamine MYP1&#xd;
was compared to linear analogue BE-18591 through determination of the apparent pKa values. The&#xd;
increased basicity of the macrocyclic derivative was rationalized by its structural rigidity. This chapter also&#xd;
details adjacent investigations into the chemoenzymatic synthesis of prodiginines. The substrate tolerance&#xd;
of the terminal condensation enzyme involved in prodigiosin biosynthesis, PigC, was demonstrated for a&#xd;
brominated monopyrrolic substrate. In contrast, the production of this novel analogue was unsuccessful by&#xd;
a purely synthetic approach. Preliminary studies into the functionalization of related pyrrolic compounds&#xd;
are also described.</description>

   <title>The maternal effects of haemosporidian infection in red-winged blackbirds</title>

   <description>Vector borne diseases present a substantial selective pressure to many animals, as they can impose direct fitness costs and intensify trade-offs between immune function and other life history traits, like reproduction. Haemosporidian parasites, a family of blood-borne parasites that include the causative agent of malaria (Plasmodium spp), are spread by insect vectors. In populations with endemic malaria, chronic infection can have a significant impact on individuals through changes to physiological condition, reproductive success, and survival. In addition to the individual effects on host physiology and success, there can also be associated impacts on the offspring of the host, where maternal infection can affect offspring in both negative and adaptive ways. The maternal effects of malaria on wild populations have not been studied extensively through experimental means, though they could play an important role in offspring success and phenotypic expression in future generations. We estimated the maternal effects of chronic haemosporidian infection in free-ranging red-winged blackbirds by medicating females with antimalarial medication or a control solution before reproduction. We measured egg mass, hatching success, and fledging success for each female, and a suite of measures to determine nestling condition. We found that females who received antimalarial medication laid heavier eggs, and fledged more young per nest, but we did not detect differences in hatching success between groups. We also found that nestlings from medicated mothers were heavier, and had higher haematocrit and lower plasma glucose when females were in good condition before treatment. This is one of the first studies to experimentally quantify the maternal effects of chronic malaria infection on offspring condition in birds, and one of few studies to describe fitness effects of chronic maternal infection in a population with endemic haemosporidian infection. This study demonstrates that the maternal effects of infection have the potential to shift individual and population phenotypes through changes to offspring size and physiological condition as a result of chronic maternal infection. Understanding the effects of maternal infection on offspring condition and fitness furthers our knowledge of the maternal effects of disease, which will continue to be important as pathogens colonize new areas and naïve hosts.</description>

   <description>A technique for making varactors in the form of parallel plate overlay capacitors, using barium strontium titanate (BST): a ferroelectric, polymer composite thick film, has been developed in this work. BST was selected due to the commercial availability of powder. This involves the use of standard air brush techniques to deposit ferroelectric thick films, and planarization of printed circuit boards (PCB) using soldermask to allow for film deposition which was not reported in the literature. A new method to have the PCB prepared appropriately at the manufacturing stage was employed. A bandpass filter on PCB was designed for high frequency measurements and BST composite material electrical characterization. This is due to relative permittivity changing with frequency. The BST composite film recipes were developed using commercial powder and two types of polymer. An existing recipe using cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) was adapted for spray coating, while a new recipe based on poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) was designed for spray coating.&#xd;
To complete the capacitors, a metal layer was deposited using a Voltera V-One printer with the Elegant Eel conductive ink of thickness 120 𝜇𝑚. Ferroelectric film thicknesses were measured using a Mitutoyo micrometer to be 15−120 𝜇𝑚. Surface profile sweeps were taken with a profilometer as high texture made the profilometer unsuitable for thickness measurements. The capacitor area was measured with a calibrated optical microscope. Low frequency measurements were conducted with a Solartron 1170 Frequency Response Analyzer and were consistent with capacitor theory. High frequency measurements used a TR5048 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) from Copper Mountain to measure passband characteristics, during which a Sentry 500VA Hipot Tester was used to apply bias to the filters for tunability measurements. The structures were simulated using High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS), to provide a relationship between frequency shift and relative permittivity. The relative permittivity of the BST-COC films was 𝜀𝑟=11 at 1.98 𝐺𝐻𝑧, while the BST-PMMA film was 𝜀𝑟=20.5 at 2.09 𝐺𝐻𝑧. The tunability of the films was a 5% relative tuning at 17.5V/ 𝜇𝑚 for BST-PMMA films while the BST-COC films had a 3% tunability at the same field intensity.</description>

   <description>Domestic violence is a pressing social issue in Canada. How the news media covers this violence has the potential to generate social responsibility or reinforce misconceptions about its causes, prevalence, and solutions. In this dissertation, I answer two questions. How are contemporary Canadian newspapers covering domestic violence? And, what explains the patterns of coverage? To answer the first question, I conducted an extensive content and discourse analyses of a sample of 823 domestic violence stories published between 2014 and 2016 in a range of English-language newspapers across Canada. To answer the second question, I interviewed over 120 news workers, police, and anti-violence advocates, shadowed five journalists, and observed three newsrooms in four select case study cities (Thunder Bay, Kingston, Toronto, and Ottawa) in Ontario, Canada. From these data, I argue that Canadian newspapers reinforce individualized notions of responsibility and racialized conceptions of belonging. The news communicates that Canada does not have a violence-against-women-cultural problem; there are just a few bad apples, women who make poor decisions, and violent Indigenous, immigrant, and non-Canadian ‘cultures’ that are responsible. The news subsequently focuses on depoliticized state and carceral state responses through ample attention to police, trials, prisons, and punishment. I further argue that that Canadian newspaper framing patterns of domestic violence are constrained, but not predetermined, by neoliberal logics. The reliance on market logics opens the door to strong source influence. Canadian police are able to take advantage of the weakening of newspapers with their increased communications sophistication, while anti-violence organizations receive insufficient funding to match police influence. Drawing together the political-economic realities of both the media and sources exposes the intimate link between neoliberalism and carceral expansion. Neoliberal economic and discursive restructuring, however, does not tell the whole story. Other factors also strongly influence domestic violence framing, including journalism’s ideology, newsroom culture, and women journalists as potential survivors of gendered violence. The implications are clear: Canadian newspapers are also not living up to their ideal role as the fourth estate and the framing patterns are not conducive for the social change needed to reduce and prevent domestic violence in Canada.</description>

   <description>One of the great challenges in chemical engineering is to predict physical&#xd;
properties from molecular structure. Predicting transport properties presents&#xd;
special challenges, especially for macromolecular structures. This thesis focuses&#xd;
on the properties governing momentum transport in polymeric liquids, and&#xd;
specifically those properties conferring elasticity to such liquids.&#xd;
In the first part of this thesis, we examine the second order orientation tensor&#xd;
for the simplest molecular model relevant to a polymeric liquid in largeamplitude&#xd;
oscillatory shear flow (LAOS), the rigid dumbbell suspension. From&#xd;
the second invariant of the order parameter tensor, we calculate the scalar, the&#xd;
nematic order, and examine its evolution for a polymeric liquid in LAOS. We&#xd;
find this nematic order, our main result, to be even. We use Lissajous figures to&#xd;
illustrate the roles of the Weissenberg and Deborah numbers on the evolving&#xd;
order in LAOS. We use the low frequency limit of our main result to arrive at an&#xd;
expression for the nematic order in steady shear flow. This work gives a first&#xd;
glimpse into macromolecular order in LAOS.&#xd;
In the second part of this thesis, we explore general rigid bead-rod theory, which&#xd;
explains polymer viscoelasticity from macromolecular orientation. By means of&#xd;
general rigid bead-rod theory, we relate the complex viscosity of polymeric liquids&#xd;
to the architecture of axisymmetric macromolecules. In this work, we explore the&#xd;
zero-shear and complex viscosities of 24 different axisymmetric polymer&#xd;
configurations. When non-dimensionalized with the zero-shear viscosity, the&#xd;
complex viscosity depends on the dimensionless frequency and the sole&#xd;
dimensionless architectural parameter, the macromolecular lopsidedness. In this work,&#xd;
in this way, we compare and contrast the elastic and viscous components of the&#xd;
iii&#xd;
complex viscosities of macromolecular chains that are straight, branched, ringed, or&#xd;
star-branched. We explore the effects of branch position along a straight chain,&#xd;
branched-chain backbone length, branched-chain branch-functionality, branch&#xd;
spacing along a straight chain (including pom-poms), the number of branches along&#xd;
a straight chain, ringed polymer perimeter, branch-functionality in planar stars, and&#xd;
branch dimensionality. In addition, we study diblock copolymers by exploring the&#xd;
effects of linear density, macromolecular length, and bead number ratio on&#xd;
relaxation time.</description>

   <description>The appeal of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine (TACM) is growing among persons living in developed countries. Personal beliefs and traditional values about health and healthcare are deemed significant motivations for the use of TCAM. While existing studies have focused on diverse population groups, including persons of European and Asian descent, TCAM use and behaviour among persons of sub-Saharan African (SSA) descent living in Canada and other developed countries remains unknown. Existing studies on TCAM and healthcare-seeking behaviour of racial or ethnic minorities suggests possible alienation due to sociocultural health beliefs and practices. These studies fail to investigate the role of context in the identity construction and sociocultural belonging and how this ultimately affects the choice of healing practices. Anthias' (2002, 2008, 2012a) asserts that immigrants and their descendants have complex relationships with different locales – country of residence (or naturalised countries) and country of origin. This complex relationship entails social, cultural, symbolic and material ties between homelands and destinations. This research seeks to examine TCAM use among persons of SSA origin living in the GTA and to understand how ethnocultural identity informs the use of TCAM remedies using Anthias’ translocational positionality as a theoretical framework.&#xd;
&#xd;
The study uses a sequential mixed-method approach to garner data on sociodemographic characteristics, transnational relationships, health status and health care-seeking behaviours of persons of SSA origin living in the Greater Toronto Area. Lifetime prevalence of TCAM use among respondents of SSA descent is ~57.14% and 12-month prevalence of TCAM use is ~23.81%. About 48.72% of the respondents indicated the TCAM used are of their ethnocultural origin. A sizeable proportion of respondents had unmet TCAM need (~20.88%) and engaged in transnational healthcare-seeking behaviour or medical return (~39.56%).  &#xd;
&#xd;
The findings of the interview show the meaning associated with ethnocultural identity and the broader contextual factors that influence the utilisation of ethnocultural identity in health promotion or healthcare-seeking. The findings of the interviews challenge the alienation assumption and show the ability of participants to transcend and transition between ethnocultural identities in different contexts.</description>

   <description>With the increased demand for high efficiency wireless communication systems, there is a requirement to develop the antenna systems that are effective and dependable. Instead of a traditional metallic antenna, a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) could be a better solution to meet these applications.&#xd;
As a tiny and compact antenna is desired for current applications, more and more on-chip designs are being developed. A rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (RDRA) set on printed circuit board (PCB) with a finite ground plane is prototyped to demonstrate on-chip application. One benefit of the on-board RDRA is that it allows for circuits underneath, both for on-chip and multi-chip applications. This makes for an efficient design and a more compact system. For modeling purposes, the on-chip circuit was designed on printed circuit board.&#xd;
The prototype DRA has a resonant frequency at 10GHz with a bandwidth about 200MHz. It is coupled by using coplanar feed under the DRA. The DRAs are made of Barium Strontium Titanate (𝐵𝑎2𝑇𝑖9𝑂20) ceramic. Two types of RDRA were prototyped, a full size circuit ground plane as an initial design but with possibly some undesired radiation, and a T-shaped circuit ground plane design to study the ground plane effect.&#xd;
The two RDRA prototypes were optimized in HFSS to obtain the dimension of the PCB as well as the dielectric resonator. Then the RDRA was constructed from a 𝐵𝑎2𝑇𝑖9𝑂20 ceramic and a FR4 PCB.&#xd;
The simulated S11 for both were around -25dB and the measured S11 for both RDRA were around -35dB. The resonant frequencies for constructed RDRAs shifted from 10GHz to around 10.6GHz when using wax to bond the DR. When using sol-gel composite to bond, the resonant frequency shifted to around 11GHz for T-shaped circuit ground RDRA. The gain was -4dB for the full circuit ground RDRA in TEδ21 mode at 10.5GHz, 0dB for the T-shaped circuit ground RDRA in TEδ21 resonant mode at 10.6GHz, and 3.6dB for the T-shaped circuit ground RDRA in TE1δ1 mode at 8.6GHz.</description>

   <description>The present research sought to develop a dimensional model of forgiveness, and develop a questionnaire consistent with this model. Drawing from the tripartite theory of attitudes, this dimensional model focused on three aspects of forgiveness: behavioural, cognitive, and affective. In Study 1, I collected a set of 64 items from volunteers who generated potential items based on definitions of the three dimensions of forgiveness, and reduced the number of items to 43 by assessing item-total correlations. In Study 2, I reduced the items and assessed factor structure with factor analysis. I also assessed correlations between dimensions and transgression severity. In Study 3, I further reduced the scale while also assessing correlations with transgression severity (as rated by the participants and as rated by independent coders), self-esteem and attachment orientation. In Study 4, I assessed the fit of the reduced set of items with confirmatory factor analysis. I also assessed the convergent validity with the Transgression-Related Interpersonal Motivations and Rye forgiveness scales and further explored correlations with the big five personality traits. The hypothesized three-dimensional scale showed acceptable fit indices and convergent validity with other forgiveness measures. I refer to this final scale as the Multidimensional Forgiveness Inventory (MDFI). The dimensions of the MDFI also showed unique relationships with several individual difference variables. For instance, only affective forgiveness was consistently negatively correlated with subjective and objective transgression severity. As another example conscientiousness was correlated with behavioural and cognitive forgiveness but not affective forgiveness. These relationships demonstrate the merit of differentiating these three dimensions instead of measuring forgiveness as a global construct. Preliminary findings offer many future directions for the assessment of forgiveness, particularly the specification of existing associations (e.g., what specific dimensions of forgiveness correlate relationship satisfaction, commitment and longevity?). Future research could also use this dimensional model as a common language to integrate and contrast existing ideas of incongruent forgiveness.</description>

   <description>Pheochromocytomas (PCC) are highly heritable neoplasms of the adrenal gland, carrying germline mutations in approximately 40% of cases. PCC susceptibility genes have been subdivided into two clusters: hypoxia-related genes, and kinase-signalling genes, which include the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and Transmembrane protein 127 (TMEM127). RET is an established oncogene that causes aberrant activation of PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK signalling in various neuroendocrine cancers. Both wildtype (WT) RET and TMEM127 localize to multiple subcellular compartments including the Golgi apparatus, early endosomes and lysosomes. TMEM127 has been suggested to play a role in endosomal transition, however the function of TMEM127 has yet to be elucidated. In this study we evaluated the relationship between the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and TMEM127. We have identified a potential role of TMEM127 in RET protein maturation and transport to the plasma membrane. We were able to rule out a relationship between RET and TMEM127 at the transcriptional level, and at the level of RET protein folding. We also observed a relationship with TMEM127 mutants and total RET protein expression, which may correlate with TMEM127 mutant diffuse localization. Overall, the findings presented here suggest a novel interplay between RET and TMEM127 that may lead to a more thorough understanding of aberrant protein trafficking in human neoplasms and contribute to our overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PCC susceptibility genes.</description>

   <description>Background: A moderate amount of time spent in the sun has been hypothesized to be protective against several internal cancers, including breast cancer. This project summarized and synthesized existing literature on this topic and identified sources of heterogeneity (manuscript 1). Secondly, this project examined this relationship using data from Canadian prospective cohort studies (manuscript 2). &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: First, a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies was conducted to investigate the relationships between time spent in the sun, and ambient UVR with breast cancer risk. Heterogeneity was quantified with I-squared statistics and potential sources were investigated through subgroup analyses. Second, a prospective cohort study was conducted using self-reported questionnaire data from the Alberta Tomorrow Project (ATP) and Quebec’s CARTaGENE (CaG) that was linked to cancer registry (ATP) and administrative (CaG) data. Cox proportional hazards models, using age as the time-scale were employed to investigate the association between solar UVR exposure and pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer with control for relevant confounders. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: In a dose-response meta-analysis, spending 1-2 hours in the sun per day was protective against breast cancer, with no additional benefit for >2 hours per day. Few studies performed analyses stratified by menopausal status. In manuscript 2, a suggestive protective effect for greater than 2 hours spent in the sun per day during summer months was observed in postmenopausal women only. No significant interactions between time spent in the sun and ambient UVR, vitamin D intake, or skin tone were observed.</description>

   <title>Hays Gone By: The Proto-Feminism of Pre-Code Hollywood and the Films of Mae West</title>

   <description>Pre-Code Hollywood has famously been described as an alternative universe of American cinema, as looser censorship restrictions allowed filmmakers to explore adult themes of violence and sexuality far more openly than would be permissible under Joseph Breen and the Production Code Association. My thesis addresses how this era gave rise to a proto-feminist cinema through the transgression of Production Code rules pertaining to gender and sexuality. Though the Pre-Code era was no stranger to virulently misogynistic works, the lack of strict censorship allowed filmmakers to put forth depictions of independent women who were sexually active and in control of their lives. The epitome of this archetype is Mae West, who not only portrayed sex sirens with tremendous agency on-screen, but also took an active role behind-the-scenes as a screenwriter and should be considered the primary author of her films. Though West’s independence on and off-screen would diminish as the Pre-Code era ended, her work remains a trove of proto-feminist cinema through its subversion of male gaze and its consideration of a female spectator. Understanding West’s films, and the era which produced them, helps provide insight on the challenges faced by women in Hollywood, and more specifically, how women-centric art is often devalued and dismissed.</description>

   <description>Closely related species interact often, typically competitively, aggressively, and asymmetrically, with a consistent dominance hierarchy among species. Competition for resources appears to be a rate-limiting step in diversification, but beyond this, we know little about the ecological role of aggression in facilitating or constraining the coexistence of species due to the difficulty in observing natural interactions. To examine how closely related species in a dominance hierarchy aggressively interact, and how those interactions may facilitate coexistence, we documented vocalizations of Song (Melospiza melodia) and Swamp (M. georgiana) sparrows during natural and simulated territory settlement to answer the question: How does vocal behaviour of a dominant species change when first faced with a subordinate competitor on shared breeding territory? Though sample sizes were too low for statistical testing, we saw slightly increased rates of “Swamp Sparrow-like” songs sung by Song Sparrows in relation to Swamp Sparrow presence, as well as trill syllable lengths of Song Sparrow songs approaching average lengths of Swamp Sparrow trill syllables. These trends may suggest syllable sharing or vocal shifts in Song Sparrows as a response to Swamp Sparrow competitors – this vocal convergence may be beneficial in mediating conflicts over shared resources. We also provide novel descriptions of Swamp Sparrow behaviour during settlement on territories overlapping Song Sparrows. Further descriptions of vocal interactions can inform how closely related species interact aggressively, and will contribute to our understanding of how aggression might relate to coexistence on shared territories.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is two-fold: to study the relationship between microstructural parameters and the work hardening and back-stress that develops in dual-phase (DP) steels using an in-plane shear test, and to use tools such as micro-computed X-ray tomography and scanning electron micrography (SEM) to examine the potential effect of damage on back-stress at higher pre-strains. Five microstructural variants were prepared using various thermo-mechanical processing methods and inter-critical (IC) annealing. These variants were then subjected to uniaxial tension until failure to measure work-hardening behaviour, and to forward-reverse in-plane shear tests to measure the back-stresses at varying shear pre-strains.&#xd;
The high-volume fraction of martensite in the DP steel microstructures meant that all variants exhibited continuous yielding in both uniaxial tension and in in-plane shear. Microstructures with uniform distributions of martensite particles exhibited the most uniform elongation, while higher strengths were observed when a mixture of large and small martensite particles was present. Similarly, the highest back-stress was observed in microstructures with mixtures of large and small martensite particles. In all microstructures, back-stress initially increased with increasing shear pre-strain. At higher shear pre-strains the rate of increase decreased until a plateau was reached. Historically, this saturation can be attributed to void damage in the microstructure, the annihilation of GNDs around the hard martensite particles, and plastic deformation of the martensite.  &#xd;
When examined with micro-CT imaging, no voids could be resolved in the deformed samples of the microstructures; hence, SEM imaging was conducted. While some voids were observed in all the microstructures, they were too few and too small to fully account for the saturation of the back-stress at high pre-strains. Furthermore, plastic deformation of martensite particles was not observed.</description>

   <title>A Study of Immigrant International Medical Graduates’ Re-Licensing in Ontario: Their Experiences, Reflections, and Recommendations</title>

   <subject>Re-licensing in Ontario</subject>
   <description>This study is about the lived re-licensing experiences of immigrant international physicians in Ontario who are commonly referred to as International Medical Graduates (IMGs). The study had a two-fold purpose, the first purpose was to investigate whether the conclusions of the previous research were still relevant at the time of this study, and the second purpose was to examine the re-licensing experiences of a specific subset of Immigrant IMGs.&#xd;
A comprehensive systematic review identified 12 selected papers on IMG issues (2008 - 2017), and these research papers highlighted that some Immigrant IMGs were successful in becoming re-licensed and working as physicians in Ontario. However, many of them had to make unpalatable choices such as transitioning into other health-related careers, accepting entry-level jobs or returning to their home country due to the systemic and financial barriers, and the lack of training opportunities and residency positions.&#xd;
This study used mixed methods design with two research instruments (survey and individual interviews), two theoretical frameworks (Self-Determination Theory and Transformative Learning Theory), two sampling methods (purposeful sampling and snowball sampling), and two samples of Immigrant IMGs for two research purposes.&#xd;
The 31 participants in the survey were a sample of the heterogeneous Immigrant IMG population in Ontario whereas the four interview participants were a sample of subset Immigrant IMG population in Ontario who had not been researched in the previous literature.&#xd;
The findings of this research verified that the barriers documented in the previous empirical literature still exist. The qualitative component of this research revealed some additional barriers.  The interview participants' perceptions of how the embedded systemic barriers disadvantaged them and set them up for failure added new information to the research. Based on the participants’ experiences, reflections and recommendations presented in this research, it seems that the current re-licensing system should undergo a fairness review in the light of Canadian/Ontarian policies of equality, inclusion and human rights to help Immigrant IMGs survive and thrive.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the performance of a new deep burial facility through numerical modelling and physical experiments. A numerical investigation was conducted to investigate the influence of the loading scheme and boundary conditions on the pipe behaviour in this new facility using both two – dimensional and three – dimensional analyses. The numerical analyses suggested that two independent grillages on the surface produced a more uniformly distributed ‘overburden’ pressure and friction treatment must be used in this facility to minimize the impact of sidewall friction on the pipe response. Two large diameter culverts, a 3.05 m diameter composite pipe and a 2 m steel pipe, were tested to study their strength limit states while evaluating the facility. The 3.05 m diameter composite pipe supported a maximum overburden pressure of 224 kPa and reached its ultimate limit state at a total overburden pressure of 258 kPa. The pipe failed as a result of local buckling of the steel ribs in the vicinity of both springlines. The 2 m diameter corrugated steel pipe did not reach its ultimate limit state at a total applied pressure of 358 kPa, but plastic hinges were seen to have occurred in the vicinity of both haunches. The plastic hinges observed in this experiment could lead to a failure mechanism that is not considered in the existing design models for structures of this type. A series of model erosion void experiments were conducted to investigate the potential for using the new facility to investigate the development of erosion voids. The results indicated that an erosion void stabilized in the vicinity of the pipe shoulder when erosion occurred through holes in the pipe haunch due to groundwater infiltration. The erosion extended to the ground surface when it was driven by simulated rain water flow through the holes in the pipe haunch. The final geometry, width and height, of the erosion void also depended on the elevation of the groundwater table, initial condition of the backfill, and the backfill material.</description>

   <description>Despite the known benefits of physical activity (PA), only 22% of adolescents in Antigua are meeting the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 60 minute a day moderate to vigorous physical activity  (MVPA) guidelines (Aguilar-Farias et al., 2018); relatedly 28.5% of adolescents in Antigua are overweight or obese (Walwyn &amp; Hunte, 2012). The school has been recognized as a critical environment for providing opportunities for youth to engage in PA. However, little information is known about the PA context in secondary schools in Antigua. The purpose of this study was to explore the current PA opportunities and related facilities and features available in schools, the barriers and facilitators to engaging in these physical activities and ultimately gather recommendations to promote student PA in secondary schools in Antigua. Nine secondary schools were identified by the Antiguan Ministry of Education. An assessment of the PA environment in schools was completed using the ISCOLE School Audit Tool (ISAT; Broyles, 2015). In addition, eight interviews and nine focus groups were conducted with Physical Education (PE) teachers and first form (grade 7) students from each school, respectively. A socioecological model (McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, &amp; Glanz, 1988; Stokols, 1996) guided the development of the interview and focus group questions; this approach allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the individual, environmental and policy-level factors that can influence student engagement in PA opportunities at school. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the ISAT data and thematic analysis was used to analyse the focus group and interview data. PA opportunities within secondary schools are influenced by factors within the social, physical and policy-level environments. More barriers than facilitators to student PA opportunities were identified by teachers and students, which was supported by the ISAT findings. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the PA environment in secondary schools in Antigua. Findings and associated recommendations serve as a call to action for school bodies and relevant Ministries in Antigua. Findings may be used to guide discussions on improving the PA opportunities within secondary schools in the Caribbean.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines East Kilbride between 1968-1979. East Kilbride was the first New Town in Scotland, a postwar reform initiated by the British government in 1946 to relocate residents of Britain’s over-crowded cities into new suburban towns. Receiving this distinction in May 1947, the former village of East Kilbride grew from 2,500 residents to nearly 60,000 in 1968. This thesis utilizes East Kilbride as a case study through which to illuminate elements of postwar Scottish history. This is accomplished through an analysis of a key decade in postwar Scottish history from the perspective of three primary forms of identity: Scottish, British and global. Employing techniques from place marketing studies, analysis of these identities reveals the town’s connections to many well-studied events and phenomena in contemporary Scotland. The archival research conducted in this thesis principally examines sources found in the South Lanarkshire Council Archive’s East Kilbride facility, interrogating how these identities are portrayed and contested in these materials.</description>

   <description>Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) are two highly regulated cytokines with a variety of roles in the immune system. One of their most impactful roles is in influencing the proliferation, differentiation, and polarization of macrophages. These cytokines have been implicated in a variety of diseases ranging from autoimmune diseases such as lupus to inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis or even viral infections like HIV. The CSFs can be used to differentiate murine macrophages in vitro, however the differences between these two types of macrophages have not been extensively studied, especially in the area of viral infection. Additionally, the nature of GM-CSF and M-CSF’s competing effects when administered to macrophages simultaneously has not been well defined. This work explores the differences between M-CSF and GM-CSF derived bone marrow macrophages in terms of innate immune signaling via TLR activation and cytokine production after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a well-defined model of viral infection in mice. My results show that LCMV is capable of modulating phosphorylation of TLR associated signaling proteins in different ways between these two cell types, and that LCMV blocks further phosphorylation of these proteins by the TLR7 ligand resiquimod (R848). This work also shows the effects of mixing differing proportions of GM-CSF and M-CSF and administering them to macrophages differentiated using one CSF or the other, along with the effects of differentiating macrophages from bone marrow under these different CSF proportions. The data indicated that GM-CSF holds a partial dominance over the polarization of macrophages to produce certain proinflammatory cytokines and a strong dominance in governing macrophage morphology. This thesis contributes to the overall understanding of these two important cytokines, their differing influences on macrophage polarization, and how they can be used to modulate macrophage cytokine production and response to viral infection, potentially informing future study of these cytokines as treatments or targets for treatment in diseases where macrophages have been implicated.</description>

   <title>The role of surface fossil magnetic fields in massive star evolution</title>

   <description>Models describing the evolution of massive stars have advanced significantly due to understanding and including key physical phenomena in the calculations, such as mass loss and rotation. As stellar magnetometry has progressed very rapidly in the past decade, recent efforts have begun to focus on characterizing magnetic properties of massive stars and including their effects in evolutionary model calculations. &#xd;
&#xd;
By implementing established scaling relations of surface fossil magnetic fields, we account for magnetic braking, mass-loss quenching, and time evolution; using a simple, coherent prescription. In our study, we use two well-known hydrodynamical stellar evolution codes: the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software instrument and the Geneva stellar evolution code (GENEC). &#xd;
&#xd;
We show that the incorporation of the effects of surface fossil magnetic fields impacts the model predictions, and, as a consequence, implies that the previous analysis of observed magnetic massive stars, which utilized non-magnetic evolutionary models for comparison, may need to be revised. We reinforce that magnetic braking and rotational mixing produce stars that can be identified as Group~2 (slowly-rotating, nitrogen-enriched) stars on the Hunter diagram, and we place constraints on their observable magnetic field strengths. We identify a unique feature of initially fast-rotating magnetic stars: following their initial blueward evolution, their rapid spin-down leads to apparently similar evolutionary tracks as if the star initiated its evolution as a slow rotator. This can, amongst others, affect the age determination of magnetic massive stars. &#xd;
&#xd;
Metallicity affects the stellar mass-loss rates, which are reduced if the star is in a low-metallicity environment. We show that surface fossil magnetic fields can also greatly reduce the mass-loss rate of the star. Therefore, even in high-metallicity environments, magnetic massive stars may follow an evolutionary path that resembles that of stars in a low-metallicity environment. As a consequence, astrophysical phenomena that are canonically attributed to massive stars in distant galaxies could potentially be produced by magnetic progenitors in the Milky Way.&#xd;
&#xd;
We conclude that the inclusion of new physical ingredients advances state-of-the-art model predictions, and therefore these models provide a basis for a platform to further investigate the nature of magnetic massive stars.</description>

   <description>Purpose: The transition to competency-based medical education from an apprenticeship model requires a greater amount of human resources to evaluate trainees. Therefore, there is an increased need for tools that can evaluate trainees and provide feedback without the need for an expert observer. This thesis describes the development of a system for training central venous catheterization. The procedure includes many tasks that must be performed in a predetermined order. This system, Central Line Tutor, is able to provide trainees with feedback about their performance by evaluating their compliance to proper workflow when practicing in a simulated setting. &#xd;
Methods: Central Line Tutor uses a combination of electromagnetic tracking and tool recognition from a webcam video to analyze trainees’ workflow compliance. Critical tasks such as inserting the needle into the vessel are recognized by tracking the tools’ positions. The remaining workflow tasks were recognized by identifying the tools used in the given tasks. In the proof of concept implementation of the system, we used a color-based approach. This method has some limitations including: insufficient accuracy, and a long setup time. To improve Central Line Tutor’s task recognition, we also implemented a more robust method for tool recognition that involved training a convolutional neural network. We evaluated two different networks, Inception-V3 and MobileNet, and compared their accuracy to the initial color-based approach.&#xd;
Results: Central Line Tutor was designed, implemented, and tested. The system was able to successfully recognize all tasks in the central venous catheterization workflow with a delay of 1.46 ± 0.81s compared to human reviewers. The system was able to recognize all tools using a color-based method, but the convolutional neural networks recognized tools with significantly higher accuracy. Inception-V3 and MobileNet had an average accuracy of 79% and 77% respectively. The color-based method was only able to achieve 8% accuracy. &#xd;
Conclusions: Central Line Tutor is capable of evaluating trainees based on their adherence to procedure workflow. While all tools can be recognized using a color-based method, the use of convolutional neural networks is far more accurate. Overall, Central Line Tutor shows promise as a useful adjunct in competency-based medical education.</description>

   <description>With Charlotte Brontë’s bicentennial in 2016, neo-Victorian texts that seek to retell the narratives of Jane Eyre’s marginalized characters have emerged. These texts engage with Brontë’s most famous novel in ways that address the triumphs and challenges of Brontë’s long-debated feminist sentiments. My thesis focuses on three of these neo-Victorian texts and questions why authors feel compelled to adapt Jane Eyre, and what about retelling Brontë’s nineteenth-century novel enables authors to see their own ideological conditions in a new or different way. I argue, based on Cora Kaplan’s assertion that the debate surrounding Brontë’s feminism is significant due to the emotion it evokes, that the tension between the feminist and non-feminist implications of Brontë’s text renders Jane Eyre an ideal site for revisiting the nineteenth century in terms of gender, race, and class. Focusing on gender in Lyndsay Faye’s Jane Steele (2016), race in Sarah Shoemaker’s Mr. Rochester (2017), and class in Helen Dunmore’s “Grace Poole Her Testimony” (2016), I argue that neo-Victorian texts that retell Jane Eyre critique nineteenth-century ideologies through a twenty-first century feminist lens and comment on modern female experience. Collectively, the novels analyzed here position themselves within the context of Jane Eyre’s ambiguous feminism to engage with the role of fallen women, racially different women, and women bound by class demarcations in order to ask questions about whose voices are heard and whose are silenced, and about the conditions of womanhood in both the Victorian age and the present-day.</description>

   <description>El Alto is a young Bolivian city with a majority young population mainly formed by migrants of rural/indigenous origins. Historically, social research based on El Alto has focused on extracting pain narratives. Research focussing on pain requires such narratives from participant subjects as evidence of authenticity, and targets marginalized and at-risk groups. Methodologically, such research also extracts results and rarely disseminates them in formats that are accessible or appealing to the subjects. This thesis project articulates and communicates pride narratives. In so doing, it enables a framework of analysis in order to be able to engage with more complex and dynamic understandings of what one, or a community, comes to know through lived experience. This approach does not deny pain but brings motifs of pride and hope to the forefront as alternatives. To counterbalance this existing trend in subject and method, this project  adopted a Community-based approach to grant agency to participants in all stages of the project and to collectively design, deploy and disseminate its findings to answer the following questions: What are the narratives of pride amongst youth in El Alto? Does collectively constructing definitions of pride and pride narratives change participants' notions of pride? And what are the best channels to communicate and harness this newly constructed, shared knowledge?&#xd;
The channel chosen for results dissemination was YouTube. Workshops were organized over ten weeks around audiovisual skill training and participants’ collection and categorization of data in the form of photographs and videos. We defined pride as a collection of interrelating categories showing the most important components: Nature &amp; Landscape, Culture &amp; Art, and Work &amp; Family. With this definition, participants filmed and produce 5 shorts that would depict different elements of pride through visual narratives. Additionally, one making-of short documentary depicting the workshop process was also uploaded to the same YouTube channel. Interviews with the participants by the end of the project show that their notion of pride changed towards a broader more inclusive conception and that participation in the project ignited the spark in some of them to continue communicating narratives of pride through audiovisual media.</description>

   <subject>Major Depressive Disorder</subject>
   <description>Background: There is a compelling association between childhood adversity and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adulthood, including more severe and treatment-resistant presentations of illness. Childhood adversity is also related to deficits in neurocognition, smaller hippocampal volume, and changes in structural and functional brain connectivity. At the same time, neurocognitive impairment accompanies many cases of MDD, but the extent to which childhood adversity accounts for cognitive variance has not been investigated. Furthermore, it is unclear whether adversity is related to plasticity, indicated by response to neurocognitive treatment, and if the relationship between cognition and functioning differs among individuals based on their history of childhood adversity. Objective: The current research sought to clarify how early adversity and select characteristics of illness relate to cognitive differences in MDD, as well as response to Cognitive Remediation (CR), a treatment that promotes neurogenesis and plasticity through cognitive exercise and compensatory strategies. In addition, this project examined the moderating role of adversity in the relationship between cognition and skills required for everyday functioning. Method: Thirty-nine individuals with MDD who previously completed a 10-week CR intervention, as well as neurocognitive and functional skills testing, were re-recruited to engage in a retrospective interview on childhood adversity. Results: More adversity endured as a child and repeated depressive episodes were associated with poorer cognition in adulthood, B = -.45, t(36) = -3.34, p = .002, and B = -.33, t(36) = -2.53, p = .017, together accounting for 37.4% of variance in cognition. Childhood adversity was associated with more improvement following CR, but this relationship was small in magnitude, ∆R2 = .05, ∆F(2, 36) = 4.36, p = .044. A significant association between cognition and functional performance was apparent only among individuals who experienced high levels of adversity, b = .63, SE = .25, p = .018. Conclusions: Our findings highlight childhood adversity and multiple depressive episodes as factors associated with cognitive impairment in MDD. We emphasize early trauma as an important variable to be addressed in neurocognitive treatment and research.</description>

   <subject>UGT2B17</subject>
   <description>Background: In the Mammary Prevention.3 (MAP.3) trial of exemestane (EXE) for breast cancer prevention, postmenopausal women commonly reported physical menopause-related symptoms, such as joint and muscle pain and fatigue. UGT2B17 contributes to the elimination of EXE-induced activity; however, approximately 10% of Caucasians are carriers of the UGT2B17 homozygous deletion and have impaired elimination of the active EXE metabolite, 17-DHE. This homozygous deletion is hypothesized to have a detrimental effect on physical health-related quality of life (HRQL) in Caucasian postmenopausal women randomized to EXE.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: The objectives of this thesis were to characterize the relationship between the UGT2B17 homozygous deletion and 1) very bothersome prevalent physical HRQL with effect modification by HRT use and 2) meaningful decline in physical HRQL with effect modification by EXE use. This thesis also explored the relationship between glucuronidation of 17-DHE and meaningful decline in physical HRQL. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: HRQL data in MAP.3 was collected using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) at study entry, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Multivariate logistic regression and log-binomial regression was used to assess the association the UGT2B17 homozygous deletion and adverse prevalent and incident physical HRQL, respectively. Log-binomial regression was used to investigate the association between glucuronidation of 17-DHE and decline in physical HRQL. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: The UGT2B17 homozygous deletion was significantly associated with meaningful decline in physical HRQL among women in the EXE arm only (RR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.67), although effect modification by EXE was not significant (PEM=0.14). Higher glucuronidation of 17-DHE exhibited a significant linear association with meaningful decline in physical HRQL (RR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.74-0.94). There was no statistically significant association between the UGT2B17 homozygous deletion and prevalent very bothersome physical HRQL prior to treatment allocation (RR=0.79 95% CI: 0.39-1.62), nor was there significant effect modification by HRT use (PEM=0.51). &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: The UGT2B17 homozygous deletion appears to have a detrimental effect on physical HRQL among women taking EXE only, but not prior to treatment allocation. Furthermore, higher glucuronidation of the active metabolite, 17-DHE, is protective against meaningful decline among women using EXE. Further research is needed to support the utility of UGT2B17 screening for breast cancer chemoprevention.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis was to explore alternative sample introduction techniques for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES). This work was conducted as part of a Collaborative Research and Development project with Activation Laboratories Ltd., Ancaster, Ontario.&#xd;
1. The first approach involved the development of a sample preparation method for the direct analysis of lithium borate fused X-ray fluorescence (XRF) discs by ICPMS with a mixed-gas plasma and flow injection for the introduction of slurries into the ICP. Three dispersing agents were initially explored, however a 4% (m/m) solution of Triton-X in 2% HNO3 DDW was found to homogenously suspend the ground particulate in solution, yielding highly reproducible injection peaks. External calibration by aqueous standards did not yield consistent results to the certified values at high slurry concentrations, regardless if matrix matching of the standard was performed. Calibration by standard addition was also explored and was found to be most accurate when the slurry concentration was well diluted and that the flow rate of the carrier did not exceed 1 mL/min, as it was suspected that particle agglomeration was occurring at higher slurry concentration and higher flow rates.&#xd;
2. The second approach involved electrothermal vaporization (ETV) coupled to ICPOES for the analysis of solid fire assay buttons. A nebulization/pre-evaporation system was initially explored to prevent plasma overloading due to the mass of the button, however a N2 sheath gas was selected as it provided higher plasma robustness conditions to that of the previous approach. External calibration by aqueous standards were improved upon through utilization of the internal ETV temperature program and a venting valve system for the drying of solution. Significant Ag2S deposition along the inner transfer tube prevented accurate agreement of calculated to certified values by both aqueous and solid external calibration due to the differences in transport efficiencies. The addition of an optimized H2 gas flow rate into the reaction gas aided in reducing Ag2S deposition along the transfer tube to the plasma, however non-proportional signal to mass intensities were still observed as Ag2S deposition was not eliminated.</description>

   <description>Background: Natural depletions of estrogens during menopause are likely associated with symptoms and declines in health-related quality of life (HRQL). For women taking exemestane in the Mammary Prevention 3 (MAP.3) trial, symptoms may have been exacerbated, as exemestane works to further suppress estrogen levels to prevent breast cancer. Women with the UGT2B17 gene deletion have limited ability to metabolize and eliminate steroid molecules and are therefore hypothesized to have elevated estrogen levels prior to randomization (baseline) and be at increased risk of worsened HRQL during treatment. &#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: This thesis project aimed to investigate the effects of natural estrogen levels and exemestane-induced estrogen suppression on HRQL in postmenopausal women. UGT2B17 genotype was assessed regarding its role in natural estrogen levels and effect modification between estrogen suppression and worsened HRQL during exemestane treatment. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and UGT2B17 genotype were characterized for a subsample of MAP.3 participants. HRQL was assessed from Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) responses at baseline and follow-up visits. Multiple logistic and log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the association between estrogen levels and HRQL at baseline and exemestane-induced estrogen suppression and worsened HRQL one year after randomization, respectively. The association between UGT2B17 genotype and natural log-transformed estrogen levels was tested with multiple linear regression. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: At baseline, overall vasomotor, physical, and sexual HRQL were not associated with E1, while E2 was significantly associated with sexual HRQL (p&lt;0.05). Increasing E1 and E2 suppression during exemestane treatment was associated with increased risk of worsened vasomotor and sexual HRQL (p&lt;0.01). E1 suppression was also associated with worsened physical HRQL (p&lt;0.01). UGT2B17 genotype was not associated with natural estrogen levels and did not modify the effects of estrogen suppression on HRQL decline.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Natural estrogen levels may continue to play a role in HRQL of older postmenopausal women. Increasing estrogen suppression by exemestane is associated with increased risk of experiencing worsened HRQL. Future studies should determine if baseline estrogen levels can predict worsened HRQL during treatment with the goal of increased adherence of exemestane in the chemoprevention setting.</description>

   <title>Filter Stability, Observability and Robustness for Partially Observed Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>

   <subject>Stochastic Dynamical Systems</subject>
   <subject>Observability</subject>
   <description>Filter stability refers to the correction of an incorrectly initialized filter for a partially observed stochastic dynamical system with increasing measurements. In this thesis, we study the filter stability problem, develop new methods and results for both controlled and control-free stochastic dynamical systems, and study the implications of filter stability on robustness of optimal solutions for partially observed stochastic control problems. We introduce a definition of non-linear stochastic observability and through this notion of observability, we provide sufficient conditions for when a falsely initialized filter merges with the correctly initialized filter over time. We study stability under different notions such as the weak topology, total variation, and relative entropy. Additionally, we investigate properties of the transition kernel and measurement kernel which result in stability with an exponential rate of merging. We generalize our results to the controlled case, which is an unexplored area in the literature, to our knowledge.&#xd;
&#xd;
Stability results are then applied to stochastic control problems. Under filter stability, we bound the difference in the expected cost incurred for implementing an incorrectly designed control policy compared to an optimal policy and relate filter stability, robustness, and unique ergodicity of non-linear filters.</description>

   <title>Mechanisms Behind Directed Forgetting: Exploring the Selective Rehearsal and Attentional Inhibition Accounts Using the Double-Item Method Paradigm</title>

   <description>In an item-method directed forgetting paradigm, participants are instructed to remember some items from the study list and forget others. On a subsequent memory test, participants demonstrate better memory for remember items than forget items. This difference in performance is referred to as the directed forgetting effect. Two major accounts have emerged to investigate the underlying mechanisms for this effect. The selective rehearsal account states that the elaborative rehearsal of remember items followed by the passive decay of forget items is the primary process of directed forgetting. The attentional inhibition account suggests that the directed forgetting effect arises from the inhibition of forget items, which allows for remember items to be further processed. The current thesis explored the extent to which both of these accounts may contribute to directed forgetting. We used a novel variant of the paradigm where we presented participants with unrelated word pairs: On pure trials, participants were instructed to remember or forget both words; on mixed trials, participants were instructed to remember one word but forget the other. In Experiment 1, we found evidence in support of a selective rehearsal process with no evidence for passive decay or active inhibition of forget items. In Experiment 2, we introduced a novel neutral condition, and replicated and supported our findings of Experiment 1. Our findings suggest that selective rehearsal is the primary account of directed forgetting but that it must be modified to account for the fact that selection of information to be rehearsed is flawed.</description>

   <description>This thesis was designed to investigate the potential use of barium (Ba) concentrations as well as strontium (Sr) concentrations and Sr isotope ratios as freshwater tracers in southeastern Hudson Bay with an emphasis on the Belcher Islands. Ba concentrations ranged from 40 to 672 nM with higher concentrations observed near river mouths in the winters of 2015-2017. This contrasts with Sr concentrations where the higher levels were found offshore (up to 105 µM). Both surface profiles and depth profiles of Ba concentrations in conjunction with coloured/chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient and salinity showed clear signs of freshwater mixing in the southeastern side of the Belcher Islands sourced from nearby rivers. A three-endmember Ba mixing model was applied to determine fractions of freshwater, seawater, and sea ice melt at various sites. Based on the fraction of freshwater determined using oxygen isotope ratio, La Grande River was identified as the major source of freshwater to the Belcher Islands whereas the influence of the Great Whale River was found to be only locally important. Sr concentrations were successfully employed to identify mixing between freshwater and seawater when used in conjunction with CDOM absorption coefficients (a[355]) and salinity. 87/86Sr ratios (ranging from 0.7092 in open ocean to 0.7100-0.7340 near river mouth) were also used in a two-endmember model to assess mixing processes.  The predicted 87/86Sr ratios were within 0.002% of the observed ratios in the Nelson, Winisk and Great Whale estuaries. Although the two-member model was less robust around the Belcher Islands, it found that the Great Whale river was not the main contributor in the region, confirming the Ba results. Together these results showed that both Sr and Ba can be used in a complementary fashion to other freshwater tracers (salinity, a[355], δ18O) and make for great tools in modelling freshwater fractions. However, due to their low sensitivity of freshwater detection, they should not be used as a standalone tracer. These tracers used in a complementary fashion can suggest which rivers have the greatest impact to the freshwater environment and ultimately need to be more seriously preserved.</description>

   <description>Evolution can occur rapidly on timescales of years to decades. In addition to adaptive responses to natural selection, stochastic processes such as gene flow and genetic drift may influence rapid evolution in many species. Invasive species are good candidates to study rapid evolution because they experience novel selective pressures in their introduced range, as well as founder effects, population bottlenecks, and long-distance dispersal. Consequently, I studied adaptive and stochastic evolution in Lythrum salicaria and Alliaria petiolata – two species that have rapidly expanded their introduced range in North America.&#xd;
&#xd;
Previous common garden and field studies in Lythrum salicaria showed that invasive populations have locally adapted to their environment, resulting in a latitudinal cline in flowering. To test whether latitudinal clines are replicated in other parts of North America, I analyzed phenological development using herbarium specimens in a ‘virtual common garden’ analysis that controlled for variation in sampling date and local growing conditions. After controlling for time of establishment, I found repeated latitudinal clines in phenology across North America. A non-linear least squares model of phenological development showed phenological curves shift over time, particularly in populations with short growing seasons.&#xd;
&#xd;
North American populations of Alliaria petiolata reproduce primarily through self-pollination, making it a good system to examine rapid evolution at the genome level. Molecular genetic markers are helpful for reconstructing the history of invasion to account for stochastic processes that may affect evolution during invasion (i.e. colonization, drift, gene flow). I analyzed restriction-site-associated DNA sequences (RAD-Seq) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 95 inbred lines from eastern North America. Analysis of allele balance (i.e. proportion of each SNP at a heterozygote locus) showed that most individuals are likely hexaploid. I compared two variant callers, the diploid gstacks, and freebayes, which can call polyploid genotypes. I found gstacks was biased towards calling homozygote loci compared to freebayes. Lastly, I found significant population structure, despite the short history of this species in North America. Moreover, I found two distinct genetic clusters in eastern North American populations, which suggests at least two separate introductions.</description>

   <description>Introduction. Data sovereignty in Indigenous research recognizes the authority of Indigenous peoples over research data and processes. Data sovereignty is an important tool for the self-determination of Indigenous communities, as it fosters the collection of relevant data that aligns with community goals and interests. While guidelines exist to support Indigenous community-academic research partnerships in facilitating community-controlled research and data sovereignty, these guidelines often lack practical clarity, and could benefit from practical examples of successful partnerships. Purpose. The purpose of this study is to explore how The Kahnawà:ke Schools’ Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP), a mature and successful Indigenous community-academic research partnership, operationalizes data sovereignty and facilitates research in a community-controlled manner. Methods. Eight individuals having various roles within the KSDPP participated in semi-structured interviews. The interview guide was theory-informed using indicators of data sovereignty extracted from literature on data sovereignty in community-controlled research. The KSDPP Code of Research Ethics and letters of information/consent forms from past KSDPP studies were also reviewed. These data were collected and analyzed using a thematic analysis. Results. Seven themes were identified related to research benefits, collaboration and communication, capacity and growth, respectful relationships, data stewardship, defining community control, and growth through adversity. Discussion. The community controls the KSDPP research process and accordingly the content, management, and use of data created. The community values the cooperation and roles played by academic partners and defines control as appropriate and beneficial to their culture and context.</description>

   <description>Background: Severe post-operative malnutrition after bariatric surgery is believed to be very rare, but little is known about its incidence and risk factors. Post-surgical follow-up attendance at a bariatric centre reduces the risk of many bariatric surgery-related complications, but its impact on the occurrence of severe post-operative malnutrition has not been studied.&#xd;

Aims: 1) Describe incidence and factors associated with severe nutritional complications following bariatric surgery. 2) Investigate the relationship between attending follow-up during the first post-surgical year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and severe nutritional complications.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Retrospective population-based cohort study of Ontario adults undergoing bariatric surgery from 2009 to 2015. The primary outcome was a severe nutritional complication, defined as hospital admission with malnutrition. Patient, institution, and surgical factors were obtained from administrative databases and the Ontario Bariatric Registry (OBR). In the first study, we describe incidence and patterns of severe nutritional complications after bariatric surgery, including association with other post-surgical complications, mortality patterns and healthcare use. In the second study, we examine the relationship between follow-up at a bariatric centre during the first year after surgery, and occurrence of the primary outcome after the first year using Cox Proportional Hazards multivariable modeling in patients who had RYGB and participated in OBR. Datasets were linked and analyzed at ICES Queen’s.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: 18,783 Ontario adults underwent bariatric surgery during the study period (88.8% RYGB). Mean age was 45.1 years, 81.8% were female and 57.1% participated in the OBR. 2% of the cohort had severe nutritional complications, with an incidence rate of 4.5 per 1000 person-years of follow-up. Risk was constant over time. Factors associated with severe nutritional complication included more major comorbidities, post-surgical complication, and imperfect follow-up. 9105 patients met inclusion criteria for the second study. Compared to patients with perfect follow-up, those with no follow-up (HR 3.09) and partial follow-up (HR 1.94) had significantly increased risk of severe nutritional complications.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Severe nutritional complications after bariatric surgery occur at rates similar to many bariatric surgery-specific complications. Adherence to follow-up during the first year after RYGB is independently associated with a reduction in risk of subsequent severe nutritional complications.</description>

   <description>As demand grows for rail transportation, so too does the stress on Canada’s rail infrastructure, and improved monitoring technologies are needed to prevent track failure and assist in the bridge rehabilitation process. Currently, most quantitative methods of stress detection disrupt service traffic and are impractical for widespread implementation. Thus, there exists a need for sensor systems that can facilitate more comprehensive condition assessments of rail infrastructure. This thesis investigates the potential for discrete and distributed strain sensors to fulfill this objective.&#xd;
	The buckling or breaking of continuous welded rail due to constrained thermal movement leads to derailments and is currently largely undetectable. Thus, there is a requirement for novel sensing tools capable of identifying these issues. In response to this, a series of laboratory tests were performed to assess the ability of two fibre optic sensors (FOS) to measure axial strain in rails under various boundary and environmental conditions. The presence of temperature-induced error on measured strains led to the development of thermal correction factors for each technology and fibre combination tested. The application of these factors in subsequent laboratory and field tests demonstrated their necessity for successful long-term rail monitoring with FOS.&#xd;
	The combination of discrete and distributed strain sensors have the potential to improve current monitoring techniques for railway bridges. To investigate this, two experimental campaigns were undertaken on a steel railway bridge in North Bay, Canada, with the added intention of investigating longitudinal force transfer and the effect of traction bracing, installed as part of the structure’s rehabilitation. Data from both pre- and post-rehabilitation tests suggested that most axial force in the rail is distributed over its length, rather than being transferred immediately into the superstructure and that the bridge experienced undesirable bi-axial bending. Furthermore, data from the post-rehabilitation tests suggested that the added traction bracing did not affect the behaviour of the bridge. Finally, a full-scale three-dimensional finite element model of the instrumented bridge span was developed to aid in the understanding of the bridge’s behaviour due to both gravity and longitudinal loads.</description>

   <description>Atopic diseases like allergies and asthma are mediated by several types of immune cells such as Regulatory T cells (Treg), and T helper type 1, 2, and 17 (Th1, Th2, and Th17) cells. Reductions in Treg numbers and the Th1:Th2 ratio and increases in Th17 cells have been related to atopic disease pathogenesis; however, whether these are a cause or result of disease remains unclear. Moreover, researchers have identified several early life environmental exposures that contribute to allergic disease development. However, these is a lack in understanding of how these exposures relate to changes at the cellular and genetic level, and how these exposures contribute to atopic disease progression.&#xd;
We polarized T helper cells from umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) samples from children with high (n=3) and low (n=4) atopic risk. We gathered information on the home environment of 92 mother child pairs, determined the odds ratio (OR) of a positive SPT (SPT) at 2 years with exposure to indoor air pollutants, and compared the number of different exposures between SPT positive and negative at 2 years. Lastly, we attained prenatal and current exposure data to air pollutants of 39 mother child pairs at 6 to 7 years of age and collected a blood samples from the 24 children. We determined the relationships between exposure to air pollutants with sensitization, cough/wheeze, plasma cytokine levels, Treg and Th17 frequencies, and FOXP3 expression. &#xd;
	High atopic risk CBMC samples had higher Th17 frequencies following T cell polarization. The OR of a positive SPT at 2 years was increased with exposure to candles, cats, and environmental tobacco smoke. 2 year old children with a positive SPT had more exposures at each time point than children with a negative SPT. Children with atopic disease at 6 to7 years had reductions in the regulatory/inflammatory cytokine ratios and children with exposures to cats and high levels of indoor air pollutants had lower plasma cytokine levels. FOXP3 expression was elevated in atopic children and in children with exposure to air pollution. &#xd;
	This work provides evidence supporting the importance of the early life environment to atopic disease development.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, a second-order continuous-time saddle-point dynamics is introduced that mimics Nesterov's accelerated gradient flow dynamics. We study the convergence properties of this dynamics using a family of time-varying Lyapunov functions. In particular, we study the convergence rate of the dynamics for classes of strongly convex-strongly concave functions. For a class of quadratic strongly convex-strongly concave functions and under appropriate assumptions, this dynamics achieves global asymptotic convergence; in fact, further conditions lead to an accelerated convergence rate.  We also provide conditions for both local asymptotic convergence and local accelerated convergence of general strongly convex-strongly concave functions.</description>

   <description>Chemistry for introducing a long-chain branch (LCB) architecture to linear, isotactic polypropylene (PP) is described, wherein degradation of the polymer matrix through β-scission of macroradicals is inhibited by an additive comprised of a nitroxyl that bears a polymerizable functional group. Trapping of alkyl macroradicals by the nitroxyl yields a macromonomer derivative that crosslinks when exposed to residual initiator-derived radicals. As such, formulations containing 4-acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (AOTEMPO) and a peroxide transform linear PP into a gel-free, long-chain branched derivative (LCB-PP) that exhibits exceptional strain hardening with minimal loss in matrix molecular weight.&#xd;
&#xd;
The chemistry is extended to produce PP bearing pendant anhydride and/or imide grafts. Formulations containing 4-vinyl ether-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (VETEMPO), maleic anhydride (MA), and peroxide produced anhydride-functionalized polypropylene (PP-g-MA). Following macroradical trapping by VETEMPO, pendant vinyl ether groups undergo a strictly alternating copolymerization with MA, thereby introducing anhydride without incurring large-scale matrix degradation. At a given melt viscosity, this technology provided PP-g-MA derivatives with higher graft content than standard peroxide-only reactions. Moreover, when combined with the difunctional monomer N,N’-1,3-phenylene-dimaleimide (PDM), VETEMPO enabled the production of highly crosslinked PP with an appreciable gel fraction.</description>

   <description>Background: In 2004, the UN sanctioned The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to address Haiti's political instability. Reports of sexual misconduct perpetrated by peacekeeping personnel, including children fathered by peacekeepers, were made during the course of MINUSTAH. To date no epidemiological studies have analyzed the distribution and determinants of civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions.&#xd;
&#xd;
Objectives: (1) Analyze gender differences among perceptions of civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions; (2) Explore the association between location (rural, semi-urban, urban) and the presence of narratives about civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions; (3) Investigate the relationship between narratives of civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions and the willingness to engage with the UN. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: In 2017, a cross-sectional survey was administered by Haitian research assistants using SenseMaker®, a rapid mixed-methods data collection tool that allows participants to share a narrative on a topic of interest. In total, 2541 self-interpreted narratives pertaining to the experiences of women/girls in relation to the UN were collected across Haiti. Secondary data analysis using log-binomial regression modeled the relationships of interest. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: (1) Compared to males, female Haitians were more likely to perceive civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions as relationships and to perceive the peacekeeper as wealthy and able to provide support. (2) After adjustment, Haitians living in rural areas were more likely (RRrural: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.38) to share a narrative about sexual interactions with peacekeepers, compared to Haitians living in urban areas. (3) The association between narratives of civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions and the willingness to engage with the UN was modified by who the narrative was about. Haitians who expressed personal experiences of sexual interactions were more likely (RRsex: 4.52; 95% CI: 3.34, 6.12) to reject the UN/MINUSTAH, compared to Haitians who shared personal positive/neutral narratives of MINUSTAH.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusion: Narratives of civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions were perceived differently by men and women, geographically distributed, and associated with rejecting the UN/MINUSTAH. This epidemiological analysis is an empirical steppingstone to understanding the distribution and determinants of civilian-peacekeeper sexual interactions.</description>

   <description>Despite their ability to overcome most geographic barriers to dispersal and to fly long distances, many seabird species exhibit strong population genetic structure. For this project, I quantify population differentiation within a pelagic seabird, the Leach’s storm-petrel species complex (Hydrobates spp.). This species complex covers a wide geographic range in the northern Atlantic and Pacific, comprising three species (H. leucorhous, H. socorroensis, and H. cheimomnestes) and two subspecies (H. l. leucorhous and H. l. chapmani). Hydrobates socorroensis and H. cheimomnestes both breed on Guadalupe Island in the Pacific, and may have undergone a form of sympatric speciation known as allochronic speciation, or speciation via differences in breeding time. As species classifications for the Leach’s storm-petrel are only based on phenotypic distinctions, further genomic work is needed to elucidate processes driving their diversification. Using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing of 141 individual Leach’s storm-petrels from 13 breeding populations throughout the species’ ranges, I identify five genetically differentiated groups, although some gene flow may still occur between subspecies and between populations separated by ocean basins. Allochronic sister taxa, H. cheimomnestes and H. socorroensis, are highly differentiated from all other populations, as is a common pattern for populations of other organisms residing on Guadalupe Island. I discovered that the Guadalupe populations first diverged from all other H. leucorhous, and then diverged from one another, supporting allochronic divergence as a viable mode of speciation. I also discovered that H. l. chapmani in the south Pacific genetically diverged from H. l. leucorhous in the north Pacific before Pacific and Atlantic H. l. leucorhous diverged, suggesting either parapatric speciation along a genetic cline, or non-geographic barriers to gene flow between north and south populations. Finally, I found 12 putatively adaptive loci possibly implicated in either local adaptation or conserved selection pressures across populations. Overall, the Leach’s storm-petrel species complex has a complicated evolutionary history, influenced by both geographical and non-geographical barriers to gene flow. My thesis also provides a framework for classifying species versus subspecies, and how these classifications can be used for conservation management.</description>

   <description>Multicellular tumor spheroids are a three-dimensional model of cancer with a variety of applications. Spheroids are the preferred preclinical model in drug screening because they recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Gaining a better understanding of how spheroids form can provide insights into tumor formation in patients, which can ultimately lead to uncovering additional therapeutic targets. However, the analysis of spheroids can be challenging. Developing a more precise definition of a spheroid and automating analysis can reduce human error, save time, and improve the accuracy of results. Previously, we have shown that spheroids measuring at least 60µm can be generated from DU145 prostate cancer cells using cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide modified with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide, or cRGDfK(TPP). We showed that sialylation, a post-translational modification involving the attachment of sialic acids to glycoproteins, facilitates the formation of spheroids generated with cRGDfK(TPP). Here, the role of a closely related glycosylation event called fucosylation was investigated in spheroid formation. It was found that DU145 cells expressed higher cell-sruface alpha-1,6- compared to alpha-1,2-fucose. Only blockade of the alpha-1,6-fucose linkage with Aspergillus oryzae lectin (AOL) prior to the addition of cRGDfK(TPP) to monolayer prostate cancer cells resulted in a statistically significant reduction in prostasphere volume on day five following treatment. Moreover, two improvements to the spheroid model were implemented: a statistically-supported minimum spheroid diameter of 40µm and an automated image object detection system. Using 40µm as the diameter threshold confirmed the role of alpha-1,6 fucosylation in reducing spheroid volume on day five following treatment with AOL. Finally, a state-of-the-art, image object detection system called You Only Look Once version 2 (YOLOv2) was used to automate the analysis of 156 prostaspheres. Preliminary results showed that YOLOv2 corroborated manual MCTS detection and volume estimations with high precision and acceptable accuracy. Refining the definition of a spheroid and implementing YOLOv2 are important improvements to our spheroid model, helping in the study of the role of fucosylation in spheroid formation. The optimization of the MCTS model can ultimately expedite the drug discovery process.</description>

   <description>In the nearly three decades of research, washback research has explored a range of factors such as teachers, students, and social contexts in order to understand how testing influences teaching and learning globally.  However, little research has been done on how (mis)aligned assessment systems may create test washback on classroom teaching and learning.  In South Asian contexts, test washback is especially noticeable due to the region’s extremely examination-oriented education system, yet studies on washback in this part of the world are extremely limited especially in Bangladesh.  This doctoral dissertation attempted to bridge this gap in the literature by investigating the alignment of curriculum, textbook, and examination in Bangladesh to examine how alignment or misalignment relationships created washback effects on classroom teaching and learning. The Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination is the most high-stakes examination in Bangladesh.  Approximately two million students take the SSC examination each year.  High scores on this examination, particularly SSC English-language scores, are needed to gain admission to higher education and top universities; high SSC scores can also help students obtain better jobs.  Also, getting a better grade in the English subject is a badge of status marker for students and their parents. Thus, securing the highest possible score on the SSC English examination is essential for test takers.  To explore how the SSC English examination influenced English classroom teaching and learning, this study used a multimethod, qualitative approach.  &#xd;
Drawing on an adapted argument and evidence-based validation framework (Pellegrino et al., 2016), I collected evidence from multiple stakeholders to build the instructional validity of the classroom instruction. Instructional validity seeks evidence about the alignment of examination with the defined knowledge and skills in the curriculum, and how examination guides classroom teaching and learning (Pellegrino et al., 2016). Data were collected through documents, interviews, classroom observations, and focus groups.  Three main findings of the study highlight the complex and non-linear nature of washback in the context of Bangladesh.  First, the SSC English examination was largely misaligned with the national English curriculum and the prescribed textbook because of bureaucratic and contextual problems in the country’s educational system.  Second, because of this misalignment, teachers taught to the test rather than the curriculum.  Since high SSC English examination scores were the most highly valued outcome, English skills not on the examination were ignored by teachers.  Third, students prepared only for the examination, fulfilling their short-term goal of high SSC English scores while neglecting their long-term goal of improving English proficiency. While students took intense test preparation, they were privy to the fact that test preparation was not going to improve their English skills. For national curriculum and textbook developers, these washback effects were unintended.  However, for teachers and students, these results were intentional and what they wanted, as students and teachers prioritized high SSC examination scores over English proficiency which was the original goal in the English curriculum.</description>

   <description>Bermuda grass pollen is a prevalent allergen that flourishes in subtropical climates, such as the southern United States. Bermuda grass exposure is traditionally believed to be relatively low in Ontario due to the colder environment. However, high rates of Bermuda grass sensitization have been observed in Kingston. We sought to investigate whether Bermuda grass pollen extract can provoke allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms in sensitized participants. We also examined if the nasal allergen challenge (NAC) model is appropriate to study Bermuda grass-induced AR and biomarkers in allergic participants from south eastern Ontario. Twenty-one Bermuda grass sensitized and 12 non-allergic consenting participants successfully completed a titrated nasal challenge with increasing concentrations of Bermuda grass allergens. Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) were collected before allergen exposure and 10 minutes after the delivery of each concentration. Twelve allergic participants that met the qualifying criteria (TNSS≥8 and PNIF fall≥50%) and 11 non-allergic controls returned for a single dose NAC. Peripheral blood, nasal lavage, and nasal tissue were collected before and after NAC to investigate AR biomarkers. The mean Bermuda grass wheal size was significantly greater in sensitized participants compared to healthy controls (sensitized=6.7mm, non-allergic=0.0mm). Nineteen out of 21 sensitized participants met the criteria of a clearly positive allergic response when Bermuda grass allergen was administered to the nasal cavity. During the NAC visit, Bermuda grass allergic participants had significantly greater TNSS between 15 minutes and 3 hours post NAC compared to non-allergic controls. Bermuda grass sIgE was significantly increased in allergic participants when comparing screening to NAC visits (screening=3.46 kUA/l, baseline=9.16 kUA/l, 6 hours=8.86 kUA/l). Likewise, allergic participants significantly increased in the percentage of nasal eosinophils at both 1 and 6 hours post NAC. Mean concentration of peripheral leukocytes (baseline=5.48x109/l, 6 hours=6.63x109/l), neutrophils (baseline=3.23x109/l, 6 hours=3.89x109/l), and lymphocytes (baseline=1.64x109/l, 6 hours=2.07x109/l) were significantly increased 6 hours post NAC in Bermuda grass allergic participants. Although Bermuda grass pollen is a non-native allergen in Ontario, Bermuda grass extract can induce AR symptoms in sensitized participants during allergen challenge. The NAC model is appropriate to study Bermuda grass-induced AR and associated biomarkers.</description>

   <title>Biopsychosocial Predictors of Suicide Risk in Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>

   <subject>suicide risk</subject>
   <description>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a debilitating chronic medical condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Epidemiological data suggest suicidal behaviour is a persistent concern in IBD populations, but little research examines suicide risk (i.e., ideation and attempts) in this population. This study examined how patient history, biomedical, psychosocial, and theory-driven predictors of suicidal behaviour interact to predict suicide risk in individuals with IBD. Consenting participants completed two online self-report surveys one month apart (NTime 1 = 324, NTime 2 = 147). Based on SBQ-R clinical cut-off scores, over 30% of individuals in this sample were at-risk for suicide. Hierarchical regression analyses (N = 285) explained 48% of the variance in suicide risk, with theory-driven variables (i.e., psychache, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide) emerging as the strongest predictors. A parallel mediation (N = 324) revealed that psychache and perceived burdensomeness, but not thwarted belongingness, mediated the relationship between IBD symptoms and suicide risk. A cross-sectional model of the progression of IBD symptomatology to suicide risk was also examined (N = 282). Biomedical variables (i.e., IBD symptoms, average pain) predicted distal mental experiences of suicidal behaviour (i.e., shame, depressive symptoms, hopelessness), which predicted proximal mental experiences of suicidal behaviour (i.e., psychache, perceived burdensomeness), which then predicted suicide risk. The final analysis examined the ability of baseline biopsychosocial variables to predict suicide risk one month into the future (N = 128). Baseline variables were similarly associated in the longitudinal model as in the cross-sectional model. However, after controlling for baseline suicide risk, baseline psychache and perceived burdensomeness were not significant predictors of suicide risk one month later, suggesting that previous suicide risk is the best predictor of future suicide risk. The alarmingly high number of individuals clinically at-risk for suicide in this study may indicate a general trend in IBD populations worldwide. These novel results may be of high clinical and research interest as they suggest variables for possible interventions targeting distal predictors of suicidal behaviour in order to mitigate their downstream effects.</description>

   <title>The role of von Willebrand factor in the pathogenesis of immunothrombosis</title>

   <subject>immunothrombosis</subject>
   <description>Pathologic immunothrombosis is the formation of arterial, venous or microvascular thrombi in response to dysregulated activation of the immune system. Inflammatory diseases such as sepsis and obesity are associated with a hypercoagulable state that significantly increases the risk of thrombosis. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a hemostatic glycoprotein that mediates platelet aggregation at the site of vessel injury and carriers the coagulation cofactor, factor VIII, in circulation. The plasma concentration and procoagulant function of VWF are influenced by inflammation and elevated VWF levels are an established risk factor for thrombosis. The mechanisms by which inflammation interacts with VWF and other procoagulant effectors to promote thrombosis are incompletely understood. &#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis I describe VWF as both an effector of inflammation and a potentiator of immunothrombotic disease. We first showed that extracellular histones are potent inducers of endothelial cell VWF and mediate subsequent platelet capture in vitro. We also characterized the relationship between VWF levels and inflammatory mediators in murine and human models of acute and chronic inflammatory disease. We next used a mouse model of deep-vein thrombosis to assess the underlying prothrombotic phenotype associated with stabilin-2 deficiency, a scavenger receptor that was recently associated with increased risk of unprovoked venous thromboembolism. Deficiency of stabilin-2 produced a hypercoagulable state that was independent of VWF levels and was significantly associated with increased venous thrombogenicity. Finally, we used a mouse model of diet-induced obesity to study the role of VWF in a complex, thrombo-inflammatory disease. We demonstrated that VWF is critical for obesity-mediated immunothrombosis and is integral to both thrombus initiation and propagation. &#xd;
&#xd;
These findings add to the growing rationale for targeting VWF-specific interactions in the context of immunothrombotic disease.</description>

   <description>During the twentieth century, business executives perceived a troubling trend amongst their employees and the general public: Americans appeared ignorant to the workings of the business system and were therefore susceptible to un-American political and economic philosophies. The major events of the century, including the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, further fuelled the business community’s fears that a sweeping tide of government regulation, high taxation, and creeping socialism was threatening its traditional interests. In response, corporations launched public relations campaigns intended to correct what executives understood as misconceptions about the American economic system, and in turn, developed a public culture that championed free enterprise, production and consumption. &#xd;
The chemical research company, Du Pont, also turned to public relations in the 1930s. Executives were spurred into action by negative press garnered by the Nye Commission, which branded the firm “merchants of death.” In 1935, the company launched its “Better Living” campaign, which lasted well into the 1960s. “Du Pont’s Wonder World of Chemistry: Corporate Culture as Public Culture in the Twentieth Century” details the ways in which Du Pont used public relations and its corporate sponsored-media as an opportunity to legitimize the firm’s existence and its corporate culture within the existing American socio-economic landscape. By examining the firm’s public relations materials intended to provide its employees and the general public with a better understanding of the American economic system, this dissertation explores how corporate public relations reverberated into a shared American public culture. &#xd;
Throughout the twentieth century, Du Pont’s radio and television programs, films, company magazines, fair exhibits, press releases, and internal memorandums consistently and pragmatically asserted the necessity of big business within the American socio-economic landscape by conflating American history, and economic terms such as competition and production, with business-sponsored definitions of American liberties. Ultimately, Du Pont’s public relations is a window into corporate value creation, exploring the ways businessmen’s private interests translated into a public culture that valued free enterprise, consumption, and production as the only American way during the twentieth century.</description>

   <title>The Sacred Nature of Signs: A Study of Christian Symbolism at the Site of Humayma, Jordan</title>

   <subject>Classics</subject>
   <subject>Near Eastern Archaeology</subject>
   <description>This project presents a catalogue of symbols that are (or could be regarded as) Christian from the archaeological site of Humayma – a town in southern Jordan that transitioned from a Nabataean caravan stop and Roman military fort into a prominent Christian settlement during the Byzantine period. The aim of this study is to contextualize the presence of Christianity within the multi-cultural framework of Humayma, to highlight the role of symbolism in the practice of Christianity, and to create a concise and comprehensive guide to both obvious and possible Christian symbols for future researchers in this field. The catalogue includes symbol types with documented Christian value from the Byzantine period, including crosses, stars, and monograms, which are presented on a variety of media throughout the site, including marble panels, jewellery, amulets, tomb stones, and coins. My contribution to this field is predominantly based in the assessment of style, symbolism and meaning for those symbols identified as Christian.  Based on the evidence presented within this project, I suggest that a petroglyph carved into the Eastern Cascading Plateau of the Jebel Qalkha is a monogram for Saint Michael the archangel. This is a particularly significant finding, because the Plateau, an area with a long history of Nabataean, Roman and Islamic use, has never before been associated with Christianity. I also show that the area west of the Roman fort, D128, may contain a Christian cemetery and/or church, based on the high concentration of Christian symbols found on spolia in that particular field.</description>

   <title>Exploring the Washback Effects of the Chinese National Matriculation English Test (NMET) on Student Learning and Their Test Anxiety</title>

   <subject>NMET Washback Test Anxiety</subject>
   <description>Washback refers to the effects of language testing on teaching and learning (Alderson &amp; Wall, 1993). Washback studies have been frequently conducted in educational fields in the past several decades (Alderson &amp; Wall, 1993; Cheng, 1997; 2005; Green, 2006; 2007; Qi, 2007). And those studies focus more on teaching and less on learning, so do the washback studies in the Chinese context (Gu, 2007; Gu &amp; Peng, 2010; Qiao, 2006; Qin, 2012). The National Matriculation English Test (NMET) is the most populated large-scale high-stakes test in China with approximately 10 million test takers involved annually for admission to higher education. Thus, it offers a meaningful context to conduct research on washback as tests that have important consequences will have more intensive washback. Also, such important consequences as not being admitted to universities could lead to a potential source of heightened test anxiety, which was less researched. This study investigated the effects of the NMET in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province [hereafter referred to NMET (ZJ)], China on secondary school students’ learning and their test anxiety. &#xd;
A quantitative data analysis (descriptive statistics, factor analysis and regression analysis) was conducted on 406 NMET (ZJ) test takers in Hangzhou in 2017. Results from the study are as follows: (1) Negative washback effects were observed on what and how students learned about English. (2) There existed a negative effect on students’ test anxiety. (3) Both a social context aspect of test anxiety (peer-related test anxiety) and a cognitive aspect of test anxiety (worry) were observed. Additionally, one of the two test anxiety factors (test unconfident) negatively predicted students’ English level. As students’ English level decreased, their confidence on the test also decreased. &#xd;
The results indicate that the NMET reform in Zhejiang did not achieve its intended purpose of decreasing students’ test anxiety and promote their English learning. Both teachers and students should be aware of the negative effects of the test. Learning focus should be on genuine English learning instead of just learning for the test. Additionally, results on how changes of the test format negatively affect students also provide empirical evidence to test designers for future test development.</description>

   <title>Exploring Photochemical and Redox Reactivity of Four-Coordinated Organoboron Compounds</title>

   <description>The works described herein are broadly concerned with exploring the characteristic reactivities and properties of four-coordinated organoboron systems, to fully understand and cultivate their utility and applicability. In particular, two different classes of chelate boron compounds are studied, namely N,C- and N,O-, with emphasis on investigating their response to external stimuli and unveiling the unique photophysical/optical properties inherent to these systems.&#xd;
The first section of work described in this thesis focuses on the synthesis and study of new unsymmetrical N,C-chelate organoboron systems bearing two different aryl groups at the boron centre. These phenylpyrazolyl-chelated compounds have been found to undergo a rare, two-stage regioselective photoisomerization. The initial transformation is a di-π-borate rearrangement that affords yellow azaboratabisnorcaradiene isomers which are subsequently converted to unprecedented 14aH- diazaborepins. Spectroscopic and computational studies provide insight into the formation and properties of these unique systems.&#xd;
A new series of N,O-chelate methylaminoanthraquinone-bridged diboron complexes have also been synthesized and their redox behaviour studied via cyclic voltammetry, EPR, and UV/Vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry. It was found that coordination of boron to a commercial dye offered a redox- stabilizing effect, as well as tuning of the compounds’ colors and electron-accepting/-donating ability based on the substituents attached to boron. BF2 chelation induces a unique and rare golden lustre property, which was not inherent to the ligand itself and shows potential for future application.</description>

   <title>Understanding links between access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and gender empowerment: Evidence from Ghana</title>

   <description>Empowering women and girls is an important development goal as well as a way to improving access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) outcomes. However, empowerment is a complex and multi-dimensional concept, and it is often not clear how it is understood and presented in WASH sector programing. To address this gap, this dissertation broadly explores the meaning and dimensions of the concept of empowerment within the WASH sector. The data on which this dissertation is based were drawn from two sources: scoping review of existing studies and in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with 15 local stakeholders in the Asutifi North District, Ghana (chapter 4). Five major interrelated empowerment dimensions were identified in the review: 1.) access to information, 2.) participation, 3.) capacity building, 4.) leadership and accountability, and 5.) decision-making. Results from the interviews show that participants conceptualized empowerment in terms of four themes: availability of resources; WASH Information; social and cultural factors; and agency. The findings revealed that dimensions of empowerment are related and continuously interact as empowerment in one dimension could lead to (dis)empowerment in another. In addition, cultural and social contexts both shape and are influenced by the concept of empowerment. Findings from this research would provide researchers and practitioners with a greater understanding of dimensions of empowerment that are relevant for strengthening WASH interventions, as well as for tracking progress towards gender inclusion outcomes. This is particularly important to ensure inclusive WASH service delivery in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).</description>

   <description>The Canadian oil sands contain a viscous form of crude oil known as bitumen. This research aimed to understand how contaminants from the oil sands industry can impact the growth and development of juvenile native amphibians.  The extraction of bitumen contributes to the atmospheric deposition of metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) to snowpack which may be released to aquatic ecosystems upon snowmelt. Furthermore, due to increases in Canadian bitumen production and demand, transport via pipeline has amplified across North America, increasing the probability of bitumen spills in freshwater ecosystems. Using a common native species, the wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica), the &#xd;
 developmental effects of contaminated snowmelt (Chapter 2) and a simulated diluted bitumen spill (Chapter 3) were tested in two semi-natural mesocosm-based experiments. Wood frog embryos were exposed to six snowmelt samples collected from the Athabasca oil sands at different distances from industrial operations for a period of 25 days. In addition, free-swimming wood frog tadpoles were exposed to lake water contaminated with seven environmentally relevant concentrations of diluted bitumen for a period of 21 days. Wood frog embryos exposed to contaminated snowmelt sampled from within a 50 km radius of mining operations accumulated PACs, displayed the altered expression of metamorphosis associated genes, experienced reduced development, impaired growth, an increased frequency of malformations, altered behaviour and delayed effects on growth and development after the end of the exposure. Wood frog tadpoles exposed to lake water contaminated with diluted bitumen had no measured change in thyroid hormone tissue concentrations (T3 and T4) and cytochrome P450 activity or expression. In addition, diluted bitumen contaminated lake water had no effect on the growth, development, or survival of tadpoles during the exposure period. Overall, contaminated snowmelt may impair the normal growth and development of wood frogs inhabiting wetlands near oil sands mining operations. However, the dissolved fraction of contaminants following a diluted bitumen spill may not impact the normal growth and development of wood frogs, provided the spill is rapidly and effectively remediated.</description>

   <description>Climate warming has led to a need for improved estimates of aboveground carbon accumulation (CA); in Ontario, this is particularly true for uneven-aged, mixedwood temperate forests, where there remains high uncertainty. This study investigated the feasibility of using LiDAR-derived tree lists to initialize a Growth and Yield (G&amp;Y) model at the Petawawa Research Forest (PRF) in eastern Ontario, Canada. We aimed to see if models based on LiDAR-derived estimates of tree attributes provide comparable predictions of aboveground CA in complex temperate forests to those from inventory measurements.&#xd;
Applying a local G&amp;Y model (i.e., FVSOntario), we predicted aboveground carbon stock (CS; tons/ha) and CA (tons/ha/yr) using recurring plot measurements from 2012-2016, FVS1. We then used a suite of statistical predictors derived from LiDAR to predict stem density (SD), stem diameter distribution (SDD), and basal area distribution (BA_dist) using an algorithm. These data, along with measured species abundance, were used to construct tree lists and initialize a second G&amp;Y model (i.e., FVS2). Another G&amp;Y model was tested using LiDAR-initialized tree lists and Forest Resource Inventory (FRI) estimates of species abundance (i.e., FVS3). Models were validated using inventory data at years zero (2012) and four (2016).&#xd;
The inventory-based model predicted equivalent CS at year four compared to validation data at all size-class levels, while LiDAR-based models did not; however, models were statistically dissimilar to validation data for CA. There was no significant difference between LiDAR-based models using inventory and FRI species through a 9-year period at the plot level (p&lt;0.05), although forest type groupings were not always equivalent. We found equivalency of inventory and photo-interpreted models for size classes ≥17 cm.&#xd;
Our results demonstrate the importance of precise tree size information when initializing G&amp;Y models using LiDAR-derived estimates, the possibility of circumventing precise species abundance information when using G&amp;Y models for CA, and that more work is needed on the use of LiDAR to quantify individual tree measurements in G&amp;Y models for accurate predictions of CA. These results provide insight into techniques that can be applied regionally to quantify and forecast CA changes in Ontario, and for more informed carbon mitigation strategies.</description>

   <description>Physical and biogeochemical observation in Lake Erie, and a field-scale numerical model was applied to study the turbulent dissipation and mixing, sediment resuspension and bottom stress parameterizations.  In Chapter 2, temperature microstructure data were processed and grouped to represent characteristic turbulent kinematic energy (TKE) dissipation rate (ε) and turbulent diffusivity (K_z) profiles in distinct regions of Lake Erie. The presence of a seasonal thermocline can increase ε up to 10^(-6)  (m^2  s^(-3)) and decrease K_z to molecular diffusivity in the bottom layer of the western basin and metalimnion of the central and eastern basins. The TKE budget shows efficiency of turbulent energy transfer from the wind decreased with increasing wind stress, and 36 - 54% of energy transferred from wind dissipated beneath the surface mixed layer, which was larger than that observed in smaller lakes.  In Chapter 3, a three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation model, coupled with a water quality model, was applied to simulate sediment resuspension in Lake Erie. The model was qualitatively validated and able to reproduce the timing of resuspension. The model showed surface wave-induced bottom shear stress dominated sediment resuspension in shallow western basin, and with contributions from up- and down-welling events, and internal Poincaré wave motions, the importance of mean current-induced bottom shear stress increased in central basin. Resuspension in the deeper regions (>25 m) of the central and eastern basins was not modelled.  To improve the prediction of sediment resuspension in field and model, bottom shear stress parameterizations, including surface wave stress method (τ_w), quadratic stress method (τ_c), log-law method (τ_L) and turbulent kinetic energy method (τ_TKE), were assessed in Chapter 4. In 2008-09 observations, resuspension induced by surface waves, bottom mean currents, and combination of them could be predicted by total bottom shear stress (τ_b), represented by τ_w+τ_c, τ_L, and τ_TKE. Considering required model setups (computing power, grid, etc.), τ_b= τ_w+τ_c is still the most practical parameterization method within field-scale RANS models.

   <description>N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are carbon-based organic molecules that have been extensively employed as ligands for transition metal complexes for the past twenty years. They form stable metal complexes that can be used under conditions where other complexes would decompose. Despite their widespread use in transition metal chemistry, until recently, the employment of NHCs on metal surfaces has remained largely unexplored. This thesis describes the use of NHCs as novel ligands to functionalize planar metallic surfaces, curved gold nanoparticles and nanoclusters. We developed novel methods for the synthesis of air-stable benzimidazolium bicarbonates as single-source NHC precursors that were used to form high-quality films on gold surfaces. This enabled the facile preparation of identical monolayers to those formed using free NHCs but in the air, using undried solvents, with a single component precursor. Subsequently, we employed this simple generation of NHC monolayers to prepare various gold biosensors and functionalize other metals such as copper, platinum, and magnesium enabling unprecedented insight into structure-property relationships. In addition, we described the synthesis of amphiphilic NHC-functionalized gold nanoparticles where their self-assembly in polar solvents allowed the tuning of the collective optical properties and boosted the overall stability. Furthermore, we reported the first examples of gold superatoms, known as nanoclusters, protected by NHCs either by a displacement reaction or by the direct reduction NHC-gold complexes. The resulting NHC-phosphine-protected Au11 clusters were significantly stable and electrocatalytically activate toward the reduction of CO2 whereas the all NHC-stabilized Au13 clusters had exceptionally high photoluminescence greater than the most luminescent ligand-protected gold nanoclusters. We also obtained the first crystal structures of this new class of materials and showed the effect of the NHCs design on the cluster properties. The reported NHC-stabilized metallic materials in this thesis have unique properties that can open the door for further potential applications in biosensing, bio-imaging, microelectronics and catalysis.</description>

   <description>Three studies were conducted to examine how dialectical thinking may contribute to meaning-making in negative experiences (MINE) tendencies and subsequently to people’s coping styles as they confront stressful situations. We examined dialectical thinking in two ways: (1) by comparing two cultural groups—Chinese and Euro-Canadians—that are well known to differ in dialectical thinking styles, and (2) by manipulating dialectical thinking in a single culture. Using a nine-item MINE scale with established measurement invariance across both cultures, we found that dialectical Chinese were more likely than non-dialectical Euro-Canadians to engage in meaning-making in negative experiences and to adopt acceptance and positive reframing coping styles (Study 1 and 2). Study 3 further demonstrated the causal effect of dialectical thinking on individuals’ tendency to engage in meaning-making in negative experiences by manipulating Euro-Canadians’ dialectical thinking. Compared to participants in the control condition, participants primed with dialectical thinking reported a higher tendency to engage in meaning-making in negative experiences and to adopt acceptance and positive reframing coping styles. The current research highlights the importance of the role of dialectical thinking in individuals’ tendency to engage in meaning-making in negative experiences and coping.</description>

   <description>Solar neutrinos are an irreducible background for the SNO+ double beta decay experiment. Neutrino interactions in the SNO+ detector produce directional Cherenkov light which, if separated from the dominant scintillation light, would allow for neutrino direction reconstruction and elimination of solar neutrino signals. Other liquid scintillator detectors can benefit from direction information and understanding the factors that enable Cherenkov discrimination would be valuable. A Monte Carlo simulation was developed to determine whether this scintillation/Cherenkov discrimination is in fact possible. The effects of various factors including photomultiplier tube concentration and size, as well as different timing properties on the ability to perform photon discrimination were examined. Should it prove possible to distin- guish between the signals this will allow for a major improvement in the sensitivity of the SNO+ experiment and possible applications in other liquid-scintillator based detectors.</description>

   <description>Social Identity refers to the extent to which people define themselves based on the groups to which they belong (Tajfel, 1981). Despite an extensive body of literature spanning several fields of psychology, most research on social identity has involved membership with only one group. Considering that humans are a social species, often belonging to several groups concurrently, investigating implications for multiple memberships is warranted. The purpose of this study was to explore social identity compatibility in interuniversity athletes, with a specific interest in assessing associations with quality of life and academic and athletic performance. A total of 235 interuniversity athletes (57% female; Mage = 19.98 years; SD = 1.77) completed an online social identity mapping tool (oSIM; Cruwys et al., 2016), and questionnaires assessing the criterion variables. Results indicated that two mediation models were statistically significant. First, general health quality mediated the relationships between the proportion of very incompatible groups and individual perceived athletic performance. Second, a specific dimension within health quality, emotional health quality, also mediated the relationships between the proportion of very incompatible groups and perceived athletic performance. These results are discussed in terms of both their theoretical and practical implications within the thesis. However, as a generally summary, our findings suggest the importance of experiencing harmony among group memberships, and that this is particularly important in populations with overt group affiliations. Within the thesis, limitations are also acknowledged (i.e., cross-sectional research design) and suggestions are made to promote future research using the novel online oSIM tool in sport.</description>

   <description>As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the opportunities for malicious attacks and vulnerabilities grows equally. Constant monitoring of networks is required to prevent attacks, even in networks without any external connections. We often use software known as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to parse, analyze, and constrain data in a network to follow normal traffic patterns. Combined with specifications detailing the form of that traffic and real-time learning, they are effective at detecting attacks.&#xd;
&#xd;
Achieving near-perfect results in intrusion detection is not an easy task. Many of the current top IDS technologies have the analysis infrastructure required of such a task but fall short of the goal. Inefficient algorithms, communication, and architectures cause these systems to process data at a rate slower than their input.&#xd;
&#xd;
Improvements to the parsing and analysis components of any IDS is the key to improving their detection-rate. Current systems attempt to incorporate efficiency into their design such as dedicated parse routines or detect profiles to avoid duplicate traffic. However they are often not general, offering improvement only in certain scenarios, or not impactful enough.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose several dynamic optimizations for Intrusion Detection Systems as a whole, implementing them in a state-of-the-art test system. We develop parser side optimizations capable of analyzing protocol specifications to decode them more efficiently. A deep grammar analysis investigates conglomerate data structures that should be separated and treated as individual entries. A lookahead process then follows to prevent inefficient backtracking parse algorithms.&#xd;
&#xd;
We additionally investigate the concept of parallelism through a decoupling of the parser and analysis components of the IDS. Using multi-threading synchronization, we are able to dispatch multiple instances of each process. This allows additional data to flow through the system to further reduce the chance of data overflow. Our parallel architecture itself includes multiple optimal algorithms and efficiencies, including memory pools, lock reduction, and intelligent threading. The entire parallel system, including optimizations is dynamically generated from an input set of network protocol descriptions. Therefore allowing parallelism access to any developer who implements the IDS, avoiding the traditional large development cost of parallel programming.</description>

   <title>A Socio-Spatial Analysis of Communities Affected by Public School Closures in Ontario</title>

   <description>The prevalence of public school closures in Ontario is growing. Though schools provide&#xd;
extensive social benefits for communities they, the current Ministry of Education (MOE) model&#xd;
for determining school closures called Pupil Accommodation Review Guidelines (PARG),&#xd;
principally relies on economic efficiency as criteria. In response to growing concern surrounding&#xd;
the inequity of the current model – with apprehension that vulnerable communities are the&#xd;
disproportionate targets —a moratorium on school closures was declared in June 2017 to&#xd;
revamp the model. The proposed research aims to fill the existing gaps in data and research on&#xd;
Ontario school closures to inform the creation of a model that minimizes hardship on&#xd;
vulnerable communities. Specifically, this research will produce a comprehensive and publicly-&#xd;
available dataset of pending and completed school closure locations in Ontario since the&#xd;
establishment of PARG in 2006 and a subsequent analysis that identifies socio-spatial inequities&#xd;
in Ontario school closures. This research will consist of four phases (school closure dataset&#xd;
creation; acquisition of community socioeconomic profiles; data harmonization; and spatial&#xd;
analysis) and will draw from Ontario public school board website archives for data creation and&#xd;
the 2017 Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg), for existing socioeconomic data. This&#xd;
research will make important contributions to research, policy, and practice in its production of&#xd;
data and analysis that are presently non existent and its tremendous potential to influence&#xd;
policy that can protect vulnerable communities from the permanent loss of public schools.</description>

   <description>Modern aerospace castings consist of highly complex geometries that require solidification simulations to optimize fill pathways so to control the thermal evolution and thus microstructure during solidification. Accurate solidification simulations require knowledge of the melt physical properties, mold-filling sequence, mold material properties and subsequent validation by thermal and microstructural measurements. The present work describes the most significant challenges and detailed methodology to maximize a multi-thermocouple acquisition system used to measure transient temperatures during solidification of aluminum alloy A205, and to correlate the measured transients to microstructural observations for three complex full-scale castings and a control refractory cone geometry. The control geometry was used to directly correlate a continuous gradient in cooling rate to variations in the microstructural grain size. The resulting microstructures and their morphologies in the local regions surrounding the thermocouple tips were linked via an empirical relation to the calculated cooling rates. The empirical relation incorporates the TiB2 grain refiner level and an approximation of the A205 alloy-specific growth restriction factor, Q. Results indicated that there was a high correlation (R^2=0.99) to an inverse square root relationship in the measured grain sizes (d) with respect to the calculated initial cooling rates (T ̇) during solidification of the primary α-Al phase for material from all sampled molds as&#xd;

with the fitting parameters A=55.0±9.2 μm∙[wt.%]^(1⁄3) and B=1371±121 μm∙K^(3⁄2)∙s^((-1)⁄2). This relationship is important because it allows for the average as-cast grain size to be predicted in A205 alloy for initial cooling rates commonly observed during sand casting. The microstructural knowledge of A205 alloy was also extended into the 3rd dimension through micro-computed tomography, indicating that the cast microstructure is isotropic and granular in nature, even in the presence of large thermal gradients.</description>

   <description>A series of computational studies of surface phononic crystals on cubic gallium arsenide are explored to elucidate the behaviour of surface acoustic waves in such systems. The enhanced understanding of surface acoustic wave propagation in phononic crystals may contribute to practical application in quantum well devices. A wet-etched phononic crystal waveguide in gallium arsenide with approximately two micron deep inclusions is studied numerically and compared experimentally for controlled surface acoustic wave propagation. The computed filter response of the phononic crystal confirmed that the phononic crystal was an effective stop band filter in the interval of 400 MHz and 450 MHz. An L1 linear defect waveguide with a stepped funnel entrance design is shown to perform well at a surface acoustic wave frequency of 410.344 MHz and in agreement to simulated results.&#xd;
&#xd;
Next, surface acoustic waves in two-dimensional phononic crystals consisting of shallow void inclusions are studied via its eigenmodes. For the [110] propagation direction on a (001) gallium arsenide half-space, the conventional Rayleigh wave modes, the layered substrate-associated Sezawa and Lamb modes, the high frequency longitudinal surface waves and bulk waves exhibit hybridization and modal interaction. The longitudinal and vertical shear bulk wave dispersions are observed to be significant thresholds for surface acoustic waves on a shallow phononic crystal exemplified by strong attenuation and mode anticrossings while the shear horizontal wave functions as a more weakly interacting sound line. However, surface modes with low attenuation and exceptional surface boundedness do exist above these sound cones similar to those in thin film coated substrates. These surface modes consist of either Rayleigh-Sezawa or Rayleigh-longitudinal hybridized modes. Phononic viscosity augmentation  of stiffness, finite substrate depth and off-angle with respect to [110] propagation are contrasted for surface acoustic wave propagation. Finally, finite-width, defect-free waveguides on gallium arsenide are explored in contrast to earlier linear defect waveguides. The phononic crystal itself provides the medium of the waveguide core, whereas the cladding is provided by the surrounding gallium arsenide substrate. A finite-width waveguide shows promise for further development in charge and spin transport on gallium arsenide.</description>

   <description>Ultrafast optics technology involves the development and application of femtosecond optical pulses. The work presented in this thesis consists of two research objectives which exploit these aspects of ultrafast optics technology.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Part I of this work, we implement a method for probing the excitonic response of 2D MoS2. Excitonic properties of samples are investigated through photoluminescence (PL) mapping, which we demonstrate as a valuable characterization method. PL mapping is used to determine the number of layers present in samples of 2D MoS2. Monolayer MoS2 exhibits a PL peak intensity ∼ 5 times that of bi-layer, with a blue-shift of 18 ± 3 meV. We demonstrate the influence of MoS2 sample growth and preparation mechanisms on its excitonic response. The Exciton A peak of mechanically-exfoliated MoS2 (at 1.8958 ± 0.0006 eV, with FWHM 46 ± 2 meV) is narrower and blue-shifted compared to that of a sample grown via chemical vapour deposition (at 1.845±0.005 eV, with FWHM 110±5 meV). We also observe evidence of an increase in total PL intensity for regions of localized rips and tears in exfoliated samples, and a decrease in trion activity for samples isolated via hBN-encapsulation. Finally, we present initial measurements of ultrafast exciton lifetimes in monolayer MoS2 (0.99 ± 0.18 ps and 14.78 ± 1.94 ps) via femtosecond excitation correlation (FEC) spectroscopy.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Part II of this work, we demonstrate the “carving out” of polarization-switched ultrafast optical pulses (424 fs in duration) from a continuous beam of light, through the optical Kerr effect. In addition to establishing this as a reliable technique for measuring intrinsic switching speed, we demonstrate the configurability of our switch. Our switch is capable of generating ultrashort pulses (with tunability in spectral bandwidth of 1.6–2.9 nm) and switched 2- and 4-pulse trains (with 2.2 ps temporal separation). Our all-optical switch holds potential in a number of technologies, particularly in optical communication and as a new ultrafast light source.</description>

   <title>Monitoring Laser Material Processing by Simultaneous Inline Coherent Imaging and Integrating Sphere Radiometry</title>

   <description>Understanding the underlying physics of laser welding and metal additive manufacturing (AM) is crucial to the advancement of laser-based manufacturing. One aspect that especially requires careful attention and control is the formation and evolution of vapour depressions, or keyholes, within the melt pool. The dynamic geometric behaviour of these depressions is intrinsically linked to the instantaneous energy coupled into the system, and therefore has a dramatic effect on the final properties of the material. In this work, we combine integrating sphere radiometry (ISR) and inline coherent imaging (ICI) to simultaneously measure time-resolved absorptance and vapour depression depth during stationary, high-irradiance laser illumination of a metal (AISI 316 stainless steel). This allows, for the first time, the exploration of the complex interdependence between energy coupling and geometry that underpins important industrial processes such as laser welding and additive manufacturing. Vapour depression depth measurements are acquired at a rate of 200 kHz and the time resolution of absorptance measurements is 4.4 µs. Time-resolved data reveals a general correlation between vapour depression depth and absorptance at high laser irradiance, showing that greater depth leads to an increase in absorptance from about 0.4 up to 0.9. There is also specific correlation with temporal features such as vapour depression initiation and oscillation frequency during periods of instability. An understanding of traditional welding regimes (conduction and keyhole mode) is enhanced by revealing distinguishing time-resolved features, and a transition mode is shown that exhibits behaviour of both regimes. Finally, the experimental results are compared with ray-tracing simulations that provide validation and explanation of the results, most notably revealing the first experimental observation of an incremental increase in number of laser beam reflections due to increasing vapour depression depth. The work presented here provides new insight into the underlying physics of laser-based manufacturing that can be used to advance progress towards deterministic control of the process.</description>

   <title>Correction of AB Variant GM2 Gangliosidoses Using AAV9 Viral Vector Gene Therapy in a Mouse Model</title>
   <creator>Vyas, Meera</creator>

   <subject>AB-variant GM2 gangliosidoses</subject>
   <description>GM2 Gangliosidoses are a group of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the brain. In humans, these diseases are characterized by rapid neurological deterioration and death before 4-years of age. GM2 gangliosides are normally degraded in a cell’s lysosomes through the action of three gene products, HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A. A defect in any one of these genes can result in a deficiency of Hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme activity, which then cannot breakdown GM2 gangliosides. The rarest form of these diseases, the AB-variant (AB- GM2), is characterized by a mutation in the GM2A gene encoding the GM2-activator protein (GM2AP), which is a required co-factor for the HexA protein. The aim of this study is to give a one-time treatment of single stranded (ss) AAV9/GM2A viral vector therapy at a dose of 1 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram of mouse and to see at least biochemical reduction in GM2 ganglioside storage in both the short- and long-term treated cohorts. ssAAV9/GM2A plasmid was created and tested in vitro on a GM2AP-deficient patient cell line to confirm the expression of the protein using Western Blot analysis. Later, treatments were given to 1-day old pups via the superficial temporal vein, as well as 6-week old adult mice via tail vein, to correct AB- GM2. These mice underwent monthly behavioural testing, as well as biochemical and molecular analysis performed at 20- and 60-week end-points. We hypothesized that an optimized ssAAV9/GM2A treatment can correct the gene mutation as well as phenotype of AB- GM2 in mice. Biochemical data for both end-points showed reduction in GM2 gangliosides storage in the treated cohorts compared to the vehicle cohorts for both the neonatal and adult treated cohorts. Behavioural data for the 20- and 60-week end-points, as well as the neonatal treated and adult treated mice, showed the treated cohorts inconsistently outperformed the vehicle cohorts. Almost uniform biodistribution of the hGM2AP vector was also seen across the rostral section, caudal section, mid-section and liver. This proof of concept study is a step forward towards the development of a therapeutic approach for AB-GM2 and towards our goal of human clinical gene therapy trials.</description>

   <title>Assessing the Effectiveness of a Transformational Coaching Workshop on Athlete Outcomes</title>

   <description>Positive youth development (PYD) through sport is a person-centered approach that aims to develop a variety of assets. Coaches can play a significant role in this process but often require training to develop their professional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal skills and knowledge. Recently, a coaching development program (CDP) grounded in Transformational Leadership theory (TFL) has been shown to increase coaches’ interpersonal behaviors that focus on the development of the person. However, how this training affects athletes’ outcomes has yet to be tested. The purpose of this thesis, therefore, is to test the effects of a Transformational coaching workshop for developing athletes’ competence, confidence, connection, and character—also known as the 4Cs. Fifty-three soccer athletes (Mage = 13.7, SD = 1.91 ) completed four questionnaires before and after their coaches participated in the workshop. Seventy-two soccer athletes (Mage = 14.24, SD = 1.27 ) served as a comparison group and had coaches that did not participate in the workshop. Four separate tests were run to analyze differences in the 4Cs at two time points during the season across the two groups. Two repeated measures ANOVAs were run for competence and confidence, while two repeated measure ANCOVAs were run for connection and character while controlling for age and gender respectively. The results show that the intervention had no significant effects on athletes 4Cs. Athletes in both groups appeared to be situated in a nurturing environment before the workshop and continued to benefit from this environment after the workshop. The findings add to the growing body of research that shows CDPs may not benefit those who are already developing optimally and who perceive their environment positively. However, the high averages for both groups at both time points indicate that the ceiling effect and social desirability bias might be influencing the findings. These constraints on the results appear to be a growing trend in CDP and PYD research and thus open a discussion to suggest the need for more sensitive instruments and rigorous methodologies in future studies.</description>

   <description>My dissertation includes three research papers on disability, career advancement, and leadership. With limited prior research on the lived experience of leaders with disabilities, I begin with a qualitative study on career advancement and leadership facilitators in Chapter 2. Twenty-one leaders with disabilities participated in this study. Participants explained how they benefited from three types of facilitators during their career advancement, including career self-management strategies, organizational and societal factors, and social networks. These facilitators are synthesized with a metaphor called the three-legged stool. This metaphor portrays the importance of three foundational pillars that underlie career advancement and leadership among persons with disabilities. Directing attention to an understudied element of one of those pillars—social networks—I report how leaders’ external networks (e.g., family, friends, acquaintances, and role models) facilitated their career advancement and leadership as well. Having explored facilitators of career advancement and leadership in Chapter 2, I move on to study the relationship between disability and career advancement with a quantitative, archival study in Chapter 3. The literature provides varied reports on this relationship, and importantly, this stream of research has tended to focus on disability as a homogenous construct. However, in reality, disability is multifaceted and complex. Therefore, I examine whether disaggregating disability by type (physical, sensory, mental, and multiple disabilities) might better predict promotion rates. This analysis includes data from 4025 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 respondents. Although initially promising, data limitations result in a discussion focused on future research. My final empirical chapter, Chapter 4, includes experiments on how observers perceive leaders with and without a disability. These studies focus on when bias is expected to arise. Overall, 578 Amazon Mechanical Turk users participated in the studies of this chapter. Results illustrate how the stereotype-fit (good-fit/poor-fit) of a focal leader’s role and disability influence hiring expectations of that leader. However, only after the leader has made a mistake. Findings on leaders without a disability were not consistent with those on leaders with a disability. This dissertation has implications for research, practice, and persons with disabilities that I discuss in the following chapters.</description>

   <description>The works described herein are focused on the investigation of photo, thermal and CO2 responsive properties of boron-containing π-conjugated systems in order to develop an in-depth understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and photophysical properties and to further expand the application fields.&#xd;
Rapid progress in the field of N,C- and C,C-chelate organoboron photochromic materials over the past ten years has been focused on the impact of different π-conjugated backbones and the effects of different substituents on the chiral boron center. Despite the well-developed nature of this field, limitations still exist such as the need to have at least one bulky mesityl group present on the boron atom. To remedy this deficiency, we investigated a series of N-alkyl substituted benzylideneamines with boryl groups attached at the 2-position with the goals of simplifying the starting material structures of photoactive organoborates. Furthermore, we hoped to increase their reactivity in order to generalize their photoreactions for the preparation of a variety of B=N containing 7- and 8-membered ring systems with four different substituents on the B=N unit. Chiral N,C-chelate organoboron compounds bearing two different aryl groups (phenyl, tolyl,  naphthyl) at the boron center have been found to undergo regioselectivie photoisomerization, generating various 7-membered ring systems via H-atom transfer. Furthermore, functionalized with non-bulky heterocycle substituent (thienyl) of this kind of N,C-chelate organoboron compounds enables quantitative phototransformations yielding chiral N,B,S-embedded heterocycles. &#xd;
The impact of intramolecular H bonding and n-π* interactions on photophysical properties of laterally appended D-π-A triarylboron compounds with biphenyl units were studied systematically. Some of these compounds have been found to display fluorescent response toward CO2. To further improve the CO2 sensing properties, three new alkylamino-appended D-π-A triarylboron have been found with the ability to capture CO2 with the formation of carbamic acid and detect CO2 with, obvious fluorescent color change, high sensitivity and good reversibility. In addition, this system is also effective as fluorescence “turn-on” temperature probes due to the dynamic B ← N bond dissociation/association.</description>

   <description>Fast, cost-effective, portable and simple to use devices are highly relevant in the current field of medicine. “Lab-on-a-chip” devices are of special interest, as they enable the user to quickly perform tests with small concentrations of sample/analyte. The invention of affordable solutions to accurately perform sample preparation and analysis without the need for expensive equipment and trained personnel is of significant importance to our society. Specifically, the accurate distribution of microliter-sized volumes onto microfluidic systems is a process that needs to be streamlined to make the use of “lab-on-a-chip” devices as straightforward as possible.&#xd;
This work focuses on the development of a platform that utilizes surface tension induced pumping based on Young-Laplace pressure, which allows modifiable transport of fluids without external modules, making it an attractive approach for microfluidic applications. Using 3D-printing, a platform was developed that enables the distribution of specific liquid volumes onto a superhydrophobic chip that is modified with (super)hydrophilic areas called surface energy traps (SETs). The SETs are fabricated by a facile picosecond laser micromachining ablation method out of commercial NeverWetTM coated glass slides. The 3D printed platform allows for simultaneous initiation of Young-Laplace induced pumping on a chip. Furthermore, the flowrate of Young-Laplace induced pumping is adjustable through different designs and SET parameters (including length, width, and radius), allowing detailed flow control over liquid transport. Droplets within the range of 10-140 μL (7.3% deviation) can be distributed using adjustable and interchangeable component designs. Moreover, it is shown that the advantages and flexibility of this platform can be employed to enable and simplify the process of simultaneous on-chip experiments for silver nanoparticle and nanocluster synthesis. This work builds a promising groundwork for future lab-on-a-chip devices. An approach is discussed that can be employed to design and develop on-chip bio-immunoassays (e.g. employing sandwich-ELISA) for pathogen detection utilizing the platform developed in this work, thus creating a portable affordable and simple to use point of care lab-on-a-chip device that possesses significant value and interest to the field of medicine and to society overall.</description>

   <title>Performance analysis of attack-resistant trust computation schemes in multi-hop vehicular ad-hoc networks</title>

   <description>With the development of the autopilot technology, the autonomous vehicles mainly rely on the in-car cameras to monitor the surrounding environments. A wider view will make the autonomous vehicles safer while driving. In order to extend the view of the autonomous vehicles based on messages sharing with others, security issues should be considered.&#xd;
The traffic condition warning application of the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) could alert the road conditions ahead and assist drivers to avoid the potential dangers on the highway. An event on the traffic will be detected and reported by the vehicles passed by. The rear vehicles derive the evidence from the reports and combine them through decision logic mechanisms. The decision logic classified as the data centric trust management scheme is applied for mitigating the misleading of the untrusted reports and assisting the vehicle drivers to make correct decisions. The reputation parameter may further improve the accuracy of the decision logic mechanism by evaluating the trust of a single report. However, due to the large-scale and ephemeral properties of the vehicular networks, a secure trust computation mechanism is required for the trust assessment of the reports forwarded over multiple hops.&#xd;
We adopt the conventional trust computation mechanisms into the vehicular scenarios and simulate the attack-resistant performance. We mainly focus on the bad-mouthing attack and randomize the behaviors of the honest and malicious nodes based on this attack. The directed trust graph for the trust computation is generated based on the network topology of vehicles on highway. The simulations consist of the influences of the distinguishable ability of the honest nodes, the positions of the attackers in the directed trust graph, and the number of attackers in the network. Furthermore, we study the performance of the trust computation mechanisms and derive useful insights. Based on the insights, we further adjust the trust computation mechanisms and conclude their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we derive the applicable conditions for different trust computation mechanisms.</description>
