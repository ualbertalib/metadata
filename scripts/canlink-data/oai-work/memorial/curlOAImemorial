# curlOAImemorial ()
# This script executes the first OAI request to Memorial University Research Repository.
# curlOAImemorialResume () will execute subsequent requests that require a resumption token.
# 74797065733D746865736973 is the identifier for the "Thesis" OAI set for Memorial University.
# Available formats: etd-ms mets oai_bibl oai_dc rdf
# oai_bibl may be a flavour of oai_dc, but the records are empty.
# None of the formats include subject values (the subject element etd-ms is empty), although lcsh subjects and geo_location metadata are embedded in <meta> tags for the eprints html landing pages.
# Comparing creator values in etd-ms to oai_dc: etd-ms has an authorized name (with dates on the end), while oai_dc has a plain form. Both forms are found in the embedded <meta> tags.
# Supervisor information is not apparent in any of the metadata formats.
# Conclusion: etd-ms has slightly richer metadata. Additional elements such as subject can be sourced from embedded metadata in the html pages of Memorial University Research Repository.
