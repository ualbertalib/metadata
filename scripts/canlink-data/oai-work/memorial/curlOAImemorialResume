# curlOAImemorialResume ()
# This script executes OAI requests to Memorial University Research Repository other than the initial request.
# The first request can be executed with the script curlOAImemorial ().
# The resumption token includes escaped characters. Note that the escaped string is the correct token value, even though the same characters (= and &) are not escaped in the rest of the OAI call string.
# The script will need to be called with a value for $token.
# For reference, the value of the first token is "metadataPrefix%3Detd-ms%26offset%3D904%26set%3D74797065733D746865736973"
