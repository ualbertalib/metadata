These positive and negative feelings people have about psychiatry are often seen operating as persons are forced to live, work or play with one of their fellows who has been discharged from a hospital for the mentally ill. This project is an attempt to view some of the attitudes and reactions to psychiatry that emerge in the social intercourse that can exist between the person discharged from a psychiatric hospital and the public, as represented by employers and co-workers.</description><creator>Willis, Jackson.

This approach was stimulated by a Dr. E.J. Perry, who was investigating the kinetics of the formation of Triphenylmethyl and other Triarylmethyl free radicals in solution by the action of certain metals on the appropriate triarylmethyl halide. That is to say, he was trying to obtain information which would permit preparation of Triphenylmethyl free radicals in maximum concentration with minimum expenditure of time, preliminary to a projected investigation of certain reactions of the radicals themselves.</description><creator>Williams, Roscoe.

Although he left a comparatively small body of work, he has received nearly as much attention from the critics as his more prolific contemporaries. His fame, however, was not attained during his lifetime. Butler was never a leader with a following, the spokesman for a group. Typically his position was that of the solitary assailant of a theory otherwise unchallenged.</description><creator>Whimster, Eleanor. J.</creator><contributor>Dudek, L.

They are not mentally defective girls or delinquent girls, but "normal" adolescents who have been referred to the Mental Hygiene Institute of Montreal because they displayed some symptom of disturbance. They have normal intelligence and normal physical capacities; they come from supposedly normal homes where one parent or both parents are present. They belong to the group which the child guidance centre is best able to help.</description><creator>Watson, Mary. T.</creator><contributor>Younge, E.

A new selection rule for magnetic multipole radiation is derived, which depends for its validity on the assumption that the orbital angular momentum of the individual particles is a good quantum number. It is found that the ground-state transitions are in general agreement with the shell models provided that the interaction between unpaired nucleons is taken into consideration.</description><creator>Vosko, Seymour.

Some attempts have been made in recent years to solve this problem by substituting the unstable xanthate groups by the much more stable methyl groups, using diazomethane, and by studying the structure of the resulting methylcelluloses.</description><creator>Vincent, Donald.

Different editors have different views on Lucretius. Bailey holds that the most important single characteristic of Lucretius is his lofty and noble diction. Smith sees in the archaic tone of the poem the keynote of Lucretius' style. All, however, agree that the poem presents an uninterrupted sucession of varied and colourful pictures.</description><creator>Vallillee, Gerald. R.</creator><contributor>Carruthers, C.

(Normally, the United States manages to achieve a yearly gain of 2% in productivity.) In view of this it is insufficient to compare lost time, commonly called waiting time, of say ten years ago, with that of today and assume, because there has not been an increase, that the control system is operating satisfactorily. A much better indication of the effectiveness of the control system is a ratio of waiting time to productive time since the latter will likely have been decreasing steadily for the same unit of product.</description><creator>Tweed, William.
