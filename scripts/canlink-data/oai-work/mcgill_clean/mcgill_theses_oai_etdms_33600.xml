In a bid to improve theoretical understanding, this work presents the generalized symmetry-adapted form of the exchange superoperator, which allows for proof of the macroscopic symmetry principle. The results obtained for an $A sb2$-AB type exchange are used to explain the presence of paradoxical symmetry-forbidden signals in the spectra of parahydrogen labeled symmetric substrates such as acetylenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. The implementation of the chemical exchange for the magnetic resonance simulation platform GAMMA is reported. The simulations of the novel experiment aimed at the detection of the slow intermolecular exchange through the decay of the multispin modes are presented. The exchange model is also employed to elucidate the role of intermolecular spin coherences in liquid phase. In the second part of this work, the derivation of the Redfield equations adapted for spin evolution under the time-dependent Hamiltonian is presented. The results are used to discuss the limitations of the Redfield theory as applied to relaxation measurements in the rotating frame. Rigorous spin-algebraic analysis makes it possible to establish the selection rules for the intermolecular relaxation thus clarifying the scope and the structure of relaxation coupling for the multicomponent solutions. Obtained results suggest the formulation of a Coupled Solute-Solvent Relaxation model, more compact than the complete system of Redfield equations, yet more precise than the External Random Field approach. The exact expressions for the intermolecular relaxation in AX-AB and AX-ABX type mixtures are derived and subsequently used to confirm the excellent precision of the Coupled Solute-Solvent approximation, distinctly superior to</description><creator>Skrynnikov, Nikolai R.</creator><contributor>Sanctuary, B.

These lepidosaurs have unique characters never present in related forms suggesting that they have evolved in isolated environments far from immediate ancestors, indicating the insular nature of the quarry. The sphenodontid Pamizinsaurus tlayuaensis is covered with unique rows of small rounded osteoderms that could have protected it against predation in open environments. Ankylosphenodon pachyostoseus has unusual teeth ankylosed deep into the dentary with probable continuous growth, which combined with propalinal action of a deep lower jaw suggest herbivory. Unique pachyostotic ribs and vertebrae, delay in the ossification of the epiphyses, and zygapophyses horizontally oriented to stiffen the vertebral column could be related to aquatic behavior. The unique morphology of Pamizinsaurus and Ankylosphenodon argue against the concept of low morphological diversification of sphenodontians. The lizard Huehuecuetzpalli mixtecus shows most iguanian features, but still retains a divided premaxilla, amphicoelous vertebrae, thoracolumbar intercentra, and the second distal tarsal, supporting a phylogenetic position as sister-group of squamates. Although late in the fossil record, Huehuecuetzpalli provides important information on early transformation of characters in lizard evolution. Tepexisaurus tepexii is an early scincomorph relatively more primitive to all known scincoids. The lack of osteoderms indicates that Tepexisaurus and some paramacellodids are not scincoids, suggesting that the Paramacellodidae is not monophyletic. The relative primitive morphology of Tepexisaurus in Albian deposits can be correlated with the late presence of sphenodontians and the relictual nature of Huehuecuetzpalli in Tlayua. This suggests that TIayua was a refuge for archaic terrestrial forms. Character transformation at the origin of the Squamata was explored through a phylogenetic analysis including basal lepidosauromorphs, the best known early squamates, and extant squamate "families". Results using a rigorously reviewed data set, show that many characters suggested to be squamate autapomorphies are certainly along a lineage basal to the Squamata, which includes Marmoretta, Tamaulipasaurus, the Ardeosauridae (redefined to include Bavarisaurus), and Huehuecuetzpalli. The name Squamatoidea to group all taxa basal to Squamata + squamates is suggested. The Total Branch Support index obtained falls between values of other published phylogenies. The low values seem to be affected by the inclusion of several fossil taxa with incomplete information and the redistribution of a limited number of characters in a greater number of branches.</description><creator>Reynoso, Víctor-Hugo.</creator><contributor>Carroll, R.

Primary minerals are transformed by a variety of processes related to their crystallization history. The most important of these processes are: magma evolution, magma degassing and metasomatism. These processes are commonly associated with the evolution of peralkaline granitic and carbonatitic-alkaline complexes, and with the formation of associated mineral deposits (e.g., fluorite in the Amba Dongar complex; Zr-, REE- (rare-earth elements), Be-, Nb-and Y-rich deposit in the Strange Lake complex). Although all minerals in these complexes may be subject to these changes, the mafic silicates amphibole, pyroxene and mica are of particular interest, as they remain poorly studied and may comprise up to 10 vol.% of the rock. Moreover, they can contain significant quantities of high field-strength elements (HFSE), which may be mobilized following interaction with later fluids, and deposited as secondary minerals in the ore zone. In the Amba Dongar complex, Na-metasomatism followed by K- (or Mg-) metasomatism resulted in the formation of fenites, with mobilization of HFSE, among other trace elements. Vermiculite was formed by a subsequent stage of hydrothermal alteration, which is also responsible for formation of the fluorite deposit. In the Strange Lake complex, enrichment of the primary arfvedsonitic amphibole in HFSE and REE is related to magmatic evolution, whereas later degassing released sufficient amounts of volatiles and Na that the amphibole became more potassic and aegirine crystallized. This amphibole acted as a sink for trace elements such as Li, HFSE and REE. These elements were remobilized during Na-metasomatism through replacement of amphibole by aegirine, and deposited as secondary, generally Ca-rich, minerals (e.g., winchitic amphibole and biopyriboles) during later, lower-temperature Ca-metasomatism. Primary mafic silicates in alkaline complexes can thus undergo metasomatic reactions that result in the mobilization of elements that contribute to formation of related ore deposits. These findings concerning the solid phases involved in both localities correlate very well with indications of mixing of two distinct fluid phases.</description><creator>Roelofsen, Jeanette N.</creator><contributor>Martin, R.

Four factors are considered from a theoretical perspective as variables that have affected the success of these firms. Regimes define the international and national environment. State support is studied as a strategic factor at the domestic level. Networks are considered as both strategic and organizational factors at the firm level. The study of internal factors considers organizational capability and strategy at the firm level. The empirical research was conducted through field studies and a questionnaire that was completed during an in-depth interview with the president, founder or principal officer of 21 firms in the cross-sectional sample (in Ontario and Quebec) and telephone interviews for the 13 firms in the supplementary sample (in Nova Scotia and British Columbia). All interviews in Ontario and Quebec were videotaped and case records were developed for each firm. Additional data are based on information from the Industry, Science, Technology (Canada) data bank and the researcher's observations of principal actors and operations of the sample firms. A Technological Skill and Product Maturity Typology is developed to categorize firms into quadrants according to product maturity and technological sophistication. The typology has been designed as an analytical tool to categorize firms according to strategic focus. This typology provides a framework for the analysis of firm needs and for the evaluation of the usage and effectiveness of support programs by firms. This study offers a typology for classifying firms by start-up mode: the entrepreneur with a classic start-up, with a spin-off, with an acquisition, and with experience in an established firm. Mode of start-up was not significantly associated with specific strategic sectors. Results suggest that the qualities of the entrepreneur responsible for successful start-up are imprinted on successful small firms. This entrepreneurism provides significant strategic advantage for firms competing in international markets. The results of this study indicate that small firms in diverse industries, with very different products and strategic advantages can use entrepreneurial leadership, strategy, and innovation to take advantage of changing international regimes, favourable domestic factor conditions, and state support to compete successfully in international markets.(Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Richardson, Rob.</creator><contributor>Jorgensen, Jan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Small business -- Canada.</subject><subject>Export marketing -- Canada.</subject><title>The entry of Canadian small businesses into international markets /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js95k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t761</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wh78p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:40:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This research examined how an invasive macrofouling organism, the Eurasian zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), alters benthic communities in a riverine ecosystem. Controlled field experiments using artificial substrates showed that macroinvertebrate abundance is significantly enhanced within Dreissena beds, and that the physical habitat provided by mussel shells has a greater impact on macroinvertebrate abundance than biological factors (e.g., food provided by mussel biodeposits). Data collected at field sites before and after the establishment of dense Dreissena colonies suggested that these colonies alter macroinvertebrate communities on hard substrates primarily by enhancing populations of deposit-feeding organisms (e.g., amphipod crustaceans) and predators (e.g., flatworms), and by displacing fauna that are poorly adapted to interstitial substrate (e.g., large gastropods, net-spinning caddisfly larvae). Freshwater sponges were the only organisms found to compete successfully with Dreissena for hard substrate; sponge overgrowth caused significant local mortality of zebra mussels at all sites where sponges were abundant. The capacity for Dreissena to displace native freshwater mussels (Family Unionidae) in the St. Lawrence River was examined over a four year period by quadrat sampling at selected sites. Dreissena preferentially colonized unionid mussels in the river. Mean infestation loads (number of zebra mussels per unionid mussel) in the St. Lawrence were 10-100 times lower than in the Great Lakes,.but resulted in similar high mortality. Severe declines in unionid species richness and abundance occurred in areas of the river that supported dense Dreissena populations ($&gt;$4,000 mussels/m$ sp2).$ Analysis of data from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River system suggests that mass mortality and extirpation of unionid populations typically occurs within 4-5 years following initial colonization of unionids by Dreissena, and that Dreissena infestation will increase the future tate of extinction of North American unionids by nearly 10-fold.</description><creator>Ricciardi, Anthony.</creator><contributor>Rasmussen, J.

This approach is based on the fact that the transition time and the delay at the far end of an interconnect segment are, respectively, independent and linearly dependent on the driving repeater's input transition time, as long as the ratio of the output to input transition time does not exceed a pre-defined value. In this context, we first derive simple closed form expressions for the optimal repeater spacing and sizing. Then, we propose a bottom-up "pseudo" hierarchical quadratic programming method for inserting and sizing repeaters in RC interconnects. This method, unlike Van Ginneken's [30], although largely based on it, is able to account for transition times at every potential repeater insertion point along the RC line of interest. The resulting technique can be readily incorporated in a more general RC network optimization scheme (through repeater insertion) where, eventually, wire sizing can be formulated either as an objective or a constraint. Accurate moment matching techniques for computing the RC delays and transition times are used in addition to an accurate CMOS inverter/repeater delay model that takes into account short channel effects that are prevalent in deep submicron (DSM) technologies. In particular, a new delay metric, based on the first two moments of the impulse response of the interconnect RC circuit, is derived. Also, a new empirical ramp approximation that takes into account the inherent asymmetry of signals in signal distribution networks in DSM technologies is presented.</description><creator>Oulmane, Mourad.</creator><contributor>Rumin, Nicholas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>On-Chip global interconnect optimization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr390.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g196w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xg64q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:40:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of four shear wall specimens was tested in order to evaluate a seismic retrofit that has been proposed for the core wall of an existing building in Berkeley, California. Like many reinforced concrete shear walls that were built in the 1960s and early 1970s, the core wall in this building was constructed with reinforcement details that would result in a non-ductile seismic response. These poor details include lap splices in the longitudinal reinforcement in regions where flexural yielding is expected, inadequate confinement of the boundary regions, and inadequate anchorage of the transverse reinforcement. The proposed seismic retrofit involved the use of headed reinforcement, carbon fibre wrap, and reinforced concrete collars at the base of the wall. The four shear wall specimens were tested under reversed cyclic loading. Two of these walls had a lap splice in the longitudinal steel at the base of the wall and the other two had a lap splice 600 mm from the base of the wall. One of each of these specimens was tested in the 'as-built' condition and the other two were retrofit prior to testing. The test results show that the retrofit strategies were successful in improving the ductility and energy dissipation of the shear walls.</description><creator>Paterson, James, 1974-</creator><contributor>Mitchell, D.

It is there-fore of interest to examine their performance in fading channels, specifically for the scenario where the channel state information is not available at the receiver. The scheme studied in this thesis is based on combined modeling of the convolutional code and the channel state uncertainties using a finite state machine. The combined model forms a supertrellis, whose structure is exploited in the SISO MAP (Soft Input Soft Output Maximum A Posterior) module. Properties of convolutional codes with respect to the reflection invariance are studied. It is shown that only certain type of codes are capable of resolving phase ambiguities which exist at the receiver. Bit error rate results are presented for phase-noisy non-fading channel and a correlated fading channel. It is shown that the scheme shows robust performance over a wide range of Doppler fading rates.</description><creator>Nikolic, Jelena, 1971-</creator><contributor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Turbo decoding for fading channels with unknown CSI at the receiver</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sj05m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx86q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s4655j36x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:40:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Emerging wireless communication systems strive for very high data rates, increased coverage and good quality of service. To achieve these goals under harsh conditions on many wireless channels (e.g., due to fading, multipath interference, power constraints and bandwidth limitations), both antenna diversity schemes and channel coding should be utilized. This thesis focuses on achieving reliable transmission over a class of multi-input multi-output Rayleigh faded channels at very low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). The transmitter and receiver designs are based on turbo coding, multiple transmit/receive antennas and turbo equalization. Simulation studies were performed for systems with different coding rates, numbers of antennas and interleaving strategies.

This trend has been a major driving force in trying to find new approaches for designing common analog building blocks. One such block is the bandgap voltage reference. This common circuit serves the purpose of generating a fixed DC voltage reference and has uses in a wide variety of applications. This thesis introduces a new way of generating a programmable DC voltage reference with similar performance to the traditional means. This voltage reference generator is based on periodic bit-stream modulation and relies on simple digital logic combined with a low pass filter (LPF) to demodulate the DC reference level. The advantage of the proposed DC voltage reference lies in its immunity to technology scaling as it is mostly digital. The programmability of the proposed circuit also makes it usable as a digital to analog converter (DAC). Through simulation and experimental results obtained using a set of integrated circuits implemented in 0.35 mum, 0.25 mum and 0.18 mum CMOS technologies a number of conclusions are reached. The tradeoffs between the two different bit-stream modulation scheme, pulse width modulation (PWM) and pulse density modulation (PDM), are compared yielding PDM as the best approach. The analysis and simulation of a new synthesis method will demonstrate that high-order passive RC filters yield the most attractive realization of the LPF. Experimental results will also demonstrate that performance due to temperature variations comparable to bandgap references can be achieved.

Chlorination experiments were carried out in a batch stirred tank reactor. The determination of the MgCl2 concentration as a function of chlorination time indicated that the chlorination of MgO to MgCl2 occured through an intermediate step. The intermediate species was assumed to be MgOHCl forming according to the reaction: MgOs+HCl g→MgOHCl d Alkalimetric titration and thermal decomposition by injection of dry nitrogen were used to confirm the existence of MgOHCl in the molten salt during chlorination. Infrared spectrometry was also tentatively used to identify MgOHCl but, without success due to the hygroscopic nature of the material. Conventional mass transfer theory was used to develop a model for the reaction of solid MgO particles with HCl dissolved in the molten salt to form MgOHCl. The model assumed shrinking particle behaviour for the MgO and was confirmed by the data from the chlorination experiments. Moreover, experiments conducted at different HCl flow rates showed that the reaction was controlled by mass transfer of HCl dissolved in the molten salt across the liquid film surrounding the MgO particle to the surface of the particle. The following rate law was obtained CMgOCi MgO1/3=1-K nt the constant Kn was found to vary between 0.04 and 0.08 s-1 when the gas flow rate was varied from 2.5 to 7.5 SLPM at constant temperature and agitation speed of 500°C and 500 RPM, respectively.</description><creator>Lamy, Martin.</creator><contributor>Harris, Ralph L.

The analysis was based on the information collected from an exhaustive literature review, the visit of 23 smelters, 14 electrorefineries and consultations at 15 different institutes specialized in the field. Data was collected for several types of matte smelting furnaces such as Outokumpu flash, INCO flash, Mitsubishi S-furnace, Teniente Converter, Noranda Process Reactor, Isasmelt and reverberatory. Behavior in Peirce-Smith converting furnaces, Mitsubishi C-furnace, Noranda Continuous Converter and Kennecott-Outokumpu Flash Converting Furnace was also discussed. The effect of various matte smelting furnace operating parameters such as matte grade, oxygen enrichment, concentration in feed, other minor constituents and temperature on minor element partition to gas and distribution coefficient (wt% matte/wt% slag) was analyzed theoretically and validated with industrial data when possible. Because fewer data were available, only a brief comparison between the elimination in traditional batch converting and new continuous converting processes was performed. The behavior of minor elements in electrorefining was described from a theoretical viewpoint.

Unfortunately, most enhancement schemes have difficulty eliminating noise from speech without introducing distortion or artefacts. Many of the disturbances originate from poor parameter estimation and interframe fluctuations. This thesis introduces the Enhanced Signal Subspace (ESS) system to mitigate the above problems. Based on a signal subspace framework, ESS has been designed to attenuate disturbances while minimizing audible distortion. Artefacts are reduced by employing an auditory post-filter to smooth the enhanced speech spectra. This filter performs averaging in a manner that exploits the properties of the human auditory system. As such, distortion of the underlying speech signal is reduced. Testing shows that listeners prefer the proposed algorithm to traditional signal subspace speech enhancement.</description><creator>Klein, Mark, 1977-</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Signal subspace speech enhancement with perceptual post-filtering</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n0412.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cg051</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jq52p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:40:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mathematical models and numerical solution methods for the computer simulation of solid particle trajectories in flows of molten aluminum subjected to steady, uniform, electric and magnetic fields are presented in this thesis. The underlying subject is electromagnetic (EM) filtration of molten metals. Attention is focused on steady, laminar, fully developed flows of molten aluminum inside a straight separation chamber of uniform rectangular cross-section. The walls of this chamber are assumed to be electrically non-conducting. The investigation is limited to solid inclusions (particles) that are electrically non-conducting and have an effective diameter in the range 5 mum to 100 mum. Steady, uniform, electric and magnetic fields are prescribed, and the induced currents are assumed to be negligible. Mathematical models of three-dimensional parabolic (developing) and fully developed flows of molten aluminum in the separation chamber are provided, nondimensionalized, and discussed. A rudimentary model of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow is proposed, in which Maxwell's equations are decoupled from the Navier-Stokes equations. The particle momentum equation is presented, nondimensionalized, and discussed in detail. The fluid flow problem is solved using a control-volume finite element method (CVFEM). The particle momentum equation is solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method. An efficient method is proposed for locating the particle in the finite element mesh during the RK integration of the particle momentum equation. The proposed methods are applied to four test problems, and the results are compared to those obtained using analytical and numerical solutions available in the literature. Finally, the scope of the proposed methods and some of the possibilities they offer are explored by applying them to a simple electromagnetic system for the separation of solid inclusions from molten aluminum.</description><creator>Blaskovich, Timothy D.</creator><contributor>Baliga, B.

The most accurate approach would be to solve Maxwell's equations for the unknown field strength at every point. Traditional computational methods require dividing space into N subregions (e.g. finite elements) that are no longer than about half a wavelength across, and introducing several unknowns per subregion. This thesis investigates computationally efficient methods of solving such problems on electrically large domains and as a result, the Multi-Level Fast Multi-pole Method (MLFMM) is implemented to resolve two-dimensional problems and predict cellular signal strength. The simulation tool computational cost is of O(N ln N) per iteration, as compared to O(N2) for more straightforward methods. The tool was successfully tested in the case of cylindrical scatterers for whom analytical solutions are available for comparison. It was then used to predict the field strength in a simple urban model.</description><creator>Barakat, Khalil.</creator><contributor>Webb, Jonathan P.

It is shown that the injection of circulation resulting from the rotation of the leading edge cylinder caused the shear layer deflect into the cavity and re-attach to the cavity floor at greater cavity depths; also, the additional momentum caused a delay of the formation of shear-layer vortices, interrupting the cavity vortex formation-impingement feedback phenomenon. Higher leading-edge cylinder rotation speeds induced rapid laminar-to-turbulent transition, precluding any of the periodicity associated with laminar shear-layer flow. Furthermore, though the trailing-edge is the source of the feedback information for the self-sustained vortex formation, rotation of a cylinder at the trailing edge had little effect on the flow fields. Experiments were carried out with a ratio of separating boundary layer momentum thickness to impingement length of 6.07 x 10-3 .</description><creator>Birch, David M.</creator><contributor>Lee, T.

The purpose of this thesis is to develop a deflection based design approach for composite sheet pile wall, based on the traditional free-earth support method, but modified to allow the use of deflection criterion. With a simplified earth pressure loading on the wall, the relationship between maximum bending moment and maximum bending deflection and the relationship between maximum shear force and maximum shear deflection were established. 16 case studies were carried out to include walls ranging from 1.5m to 4.5 m tall and water level to wall height ratio from 0.1 to 0.4. Two deflection limits, L/60 and L/100 were employed in developing the design charts. To implement the deflection based design, the proper characterization of flexural rigidity (EI) and shear rigidity (KAG) of the sheet pile panels was vital. Tests were conducted on the connected panels to obtain the rigidities.

The present project specifically takes The Globe and The Toronto World, two of the major daily newspapers of Toronto, as its combined object of analysis. It selects particular events and periods during the emergence of early film as popular amusement as the contexts for the study of articles, reports, columns, and editorials that centred around urban cultural issues as well as cinema. It explores the extent to which these particular events and periods figured in the papers' attention upon the new medium and its place in the everyday life of the city. These contexts were selected with an assumption of their newsworthiness for the daily press. However, upon examination it became evident that, while the majority of them did produce a concentrated attention in both dailies, not all of them did. Still, because they instantiated profound shifts in urban entertainment at the turn of the century, they were kept as historical backgrounds for the analysis of the newspapers's construction of modern culture.

The present research builds on Lightbown and Spada (2000) by comparing their findings to those of older and more proficient francophone ESL learners (12--16 years old) in secondary school. As observed with the younger learners in Lightbown and Spada (2000), the interlanguage of the older learners revealed a clear influence of transfer of French even though they were more accurate in their overall performance. The results also indicated that the older learners were capable of considerable metalinguistic awareness regarding the target features (question formation and adverb placement).

In the current critical field there is an absence of textual and editorial criticism that needs to be redressed. It is important for Fante criticism to acknowledge the fact that Black Sparrow Press has not only republished Fante, but has re-invented him. Following the example of textual and editorial critics such as Lawrence S. Rainey, Jerome McGann, and George Bornstein, I address Black Sparrow's influence on the institutional, bibliographic, and linguistic codes of the Black Sparrow editions of Fante's work. By focussing on textual and editorial issues, I open up new areas of critical assessment---such as Black Sparrow's influence on critical and popular receptions of Fante.

In Experiment 1, we found that presentation of a mask 3 s before onset of a reference Gabor patch caused selective interference in a subsequent discrimination task. However, a 10 s interval abolished this masking effect. In Experiment 2, the mask was associated with a second spatial frequency discrimination task so that a representation of the mask had to be coded into short-term perceptual memory. The presence of this second discrimination task now caused similar interference effects on the primary discrimination task at both the 3 s and 10 s ISI conditions. The different results from these two experiments are best explained by a two-step perceptual memory mechanism.

She demonstrates how the authors refused the usual accepted practices in literature at that time to claim a right for women to develop their intellect in the way men could develop theirs. Therefore, she compares the contents of the essay with two important visions of women in literature: one of a strong women, as exposed in the literature linked to the "Querelle des femmes", and one of a weeping mistress screaming out all of her pain and sorrow, inspired from the Heroides d'Ovide. She shows how the text of the Scudery is different from the ones related to the "Querelle des femmes". She studies the formal characteristics of the harangue and she compares a rhetoric analysis of the scuderian texts with a quick study of the latin epistles. By doing so, the author wants to make the originality emerge out of the female characters of the Femmes illustres. She wants to emphasize the fact that the authors of that essay allowed women to become the subjects rather than the objects of the speeches. They gave them a chance to express their courage, their pride and their ambitions rather than confining them exclusively to family, love and religion matters, breaking out the traditional scope of the female speech.</description><creator>Dionne, Karina.</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Women -- Biography.</subject><subject>Women in literature.</subject><subject>Scudéry, Madeleine de, 1607-1701.

Character culture is a hybrid of the characters that are created and sold by authors with artistic and legal concerns, and the character-affect-relationship of the audience users of those characters. This study examines the law and industry practices in the United States and Canada as it relates to character and the limited scope of the law in defining just what exactly a character is. Also, I examine the major issues in the cultural bargain between the ownership of characters of authors, and the appropriation of characters by audiences, through the dominate arguments for both authors and audiences and the issue of privileged accessibility to characters. By "appropriate", I am referring to any act of an audience member, utilizing a character they do not own, in new ways, that the original author of the character did not give permission for, or approve. Finally, I present my analysis of how the cultural bargain may experience a balance between both authors and audience, by defining characters using the audience affect interpretation as criteria.</description><creator>Chinappi, Franco.</creator><contributor>Hamilton, Sheryl (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Logos (Symbols)</subject><subject>Cartoon characters.</subject><subject>Characters and characteristics in literature.</subject><subject>Trademarks.</subject><subject>Industrial property.</subject><title>Character culture : the cultural bargain between ownership and appropriation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m843k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q5861</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m900nw40v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:40:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose was to develop a valid and reliable survey to determine if physical educators provide students with opportunities for self-determination. It was based on the self-determination model of Wehmeyer et al. (1998) and interviews with four university professors and five physical educators. The survey was sent to 153 physical educators from Montreal and Halifax; a 63.4% return rate resulted. The most frequent aspect of self-determination included in their teaching was the opportunity to "develop a sense of belonging in the class", while "choice-making" was provided least frequently. Class size and inadequate resource material were the most detrimental barriers to self-determination. The temporal stability of the survey was .49 for the elements of self-determination and .84 for barriers to self-determination. Finally four physical education teachers were observed in gymnasium settings, two had scored high on self-determination and two had a low score. Systematic observation techniques revealed that their teaching was consistent with their survey score. It was concluded that the survey had sufficient reliability and validity to warrant further development.</description><creator>Donovan, Lauren.</creator><contributor>Reid, Greg (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Physical education for children with disabilities.</subject><subject>Active learning.</subject><title>Providing the opportunity for self-determination : the development and validation of a survey</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204091r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw40v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):33625</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
