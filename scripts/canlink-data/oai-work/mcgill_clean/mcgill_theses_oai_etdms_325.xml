With the aim of identifying the receptor subtypes through which this neuropeptide may be exerting its neuroendocrine actions in the brain, we have examined by in situ hybridization the distribution of the mRNA for the $ rm sst sb1$ and $ rm sst sb2$ receptors in the hypothalamus of adult male and female rats. Several reports focusing on peripheral cells have indicated that somatostatin can be internalized after binding to membrane associated somatostatin receptors. Moreover, it has recently been reported that the neuropeptides neurotensin and substance P, both of which interact with G protein coupled receptors, can be internalized into central neurons by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In light of these reports, we investigated what role the G protein coupled $ rm sst sb1$ or $ rm sst sb2$ receptors might play in mediating the internalization of somatostatin.

The first chapter is devoted to an investigation of the mutational heritability $ rm (V sb{M})$ of fitness in asexually propagated populations. This is the rate at which novel variation for fitness accumulates in a population. In two trials, values of $ rm V sb{M}$ = 4.5 and $4.7 times 10 sp{-3}$ of the environmental variance $ rm (V sb{E})$ were obtained. These values were at least an order of magnitude greater than estimates from other organisms of $ rm V sb{M}/V sb{E}$ for fitness or for quasineutral variation. The possibility that this was due to disruptive selection for types specialized for different parts of the culturing environment was investigated, and rejected. Other possible explanations, and future avenues for research, are discussed. The second chapter extends the investigation from normal culturing conditions into stressful ones. Specifically, it considers the hypothesis that C. reinhardtii might increase its mutation rate as a general response to environmental stress. Stressed lines were found to display reduced mean fitness and an increased variance of fitness after being returned to normal culturing conditions. This was interpreted as evidence for increased mutation rates in treated lines relative to controls. Possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are discussed, along with suggestions for further research.</description><creator>Goho, Shaun.</creator><contributor>Bell, Graham (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii -- Adaptation.</subject><title>The accumulation of variance in fitness in clonal populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in normal and stressful environments /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010s121.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t122q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214r10m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During a two years study (1993-1994) in southwestern Quebec, Artogeia rapae and Plutella xylostella were found to be the most important lepidopterous pests of cruciferous crops, followed by Trichoplusia ni and four minor species. The relationship between plant sampling and the use of degree-days, pheromone traps (P. xylostella) or butterflies counts (A. rapae) was assessed for A. rapae and P. xylostella. Three generations of A. rapae were observed annually, with a duration of 319.7 degree-days above $ rm 10 sp circ C (DD sb{10}),$ while P. xylostella had three to four generations with a duration of 277.7 $ rm DD sb{10}.$ Captures of P. xylostella were not linked to the level of infestations. By the end of summer, A. rapae was the most abundant species, especially on broccoli, while P. xylostella was often abundant early in the season. The complex of lepidopterous pests' natural enemies was identified, and the data were analyzed using an illustrated parasitoid web. Fourteen parasitoid and three hyperparasitoid species (12 Hymenoptera, 2 Diptera) were identified. The most important parasitoid, Cotesia rubecula, is a larval parasitoid of A. rapae that is newly established in Quebec. Overall, parasitism of lepidopterous eggs is almost not existent, whereas parasitism and infection of larvae and pupae by pathogens are important, but not significant to reduce butterfly populations. In order to evaluate the potential of oophagous parasitoids, the parasitism of up to 42 species/strains of Trichogramma was studied with different development stages of P. xylostella, A. rapae and T. ni eggs. Generally, Trichogramma females attacked preferably young eggs of a given host species. Females modified the number of offspring according to host size and host age, as fewer offspring emerged from the smallest or the oldest hosts. Host age had no impact on sex allocation.

Axonal projections were identified in the optic nerve, the olfactory nerve, the internal peritentacular nerve, the external peritentacular nerve, the cerebral-pedal connective and the cerebral commissure. A rare characteristic of the cell was the multibranching of axons in the neuropil and the exiting of this bundle of fibres into the cerebral-pedal connective. Dendritic arborizations were observed branching from the cell body, the axon hillock and the dorsal main axon. In addition, tufts of dendrites were seen to branch from the ventral axon. Based on its morphology, C3 is probably a central component in the avoidance behaviour, receiving sensory input at extensive dendritic sites and sending axons to a number of key effector sites to co-ordinate the chain of reactions that constitutes the snail's avoidance behaviour.</description><creator>Gill, Nishi.</creator><contributor>Chase, R.

The language was designed with simple and expressive extensions to C, which provide some information about control parallelism and data locality to the compiler. EARTH-C is compiled using EARTH-McCAT compiler, which generates EARTH Threaded-C as its target code. Although EARTH-C appears to be quite useful for expressing irregular parallelism, it does have some limitations when we try to access variables concurrently. In this thesis, we discuss the expressibility problem and the consistency problem. The expressibility problem limits the programmer's ability to implement some parallel programming techniques in EARTH-C, while the consistency problem prevents the programmer from accessing variables concurrently. To solve those problems, we introduce shared variables and atomic functions into the EARTH-C language. These extensions to EARTH-C were designed and implemented within the EARTH-McCAT compiler. We discuss both the language extensions and a set of benchmarks used to test them. Our solution strategy proved to be simple and effective. It did not destroy any part of the EARTH-McCAT compiler and added more power to the EARTH-C language.</description><creator>Ghobrial, Shereen.</creator><contributor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Supporting shared variables and atomic functions in the earth-C language</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx81b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816p49j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z733z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A prospective, randomized, experimental study was performed to assess the treatment of mandibular continuity defects by distraction osteogenesis, using the rabbit model. This method of treatment was compared to a control group, which had treatment by traditional means, using a fixation plate. Eight animals were randomized into one of the two groups. The treatment methods were assessed by clinical, radiographic, and histologic examinations. Clinically, the experimental specimens had greater dimensions of bone formation in the defects than their matched controls. Radiographically, there was a higher percentage of radiopacity in the defects of the experimental group compared to the controls, although not statistically significant. Histologically, there was a statistically significant higher percentage of bone fill in the defects of the experimental group compared to the controls. Three of the four experimental specimens (75%) developed bony union at the 'docking site'. A cost-efficient animal model was developed for the study of bifocal distraction in the treatment of mandibular continuity defects. The critical-sized mandibular defect in the rabbit model was found to be a minimum of 4mm.</description><creator>Gervais, Normand Laurier.</creator><contributor>Clokie, Cameron (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>The use of bifocal distraction osteogenesis for the treatment of continuity defects in the rabbit mandible /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s1618204.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z733z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7m01bn72h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease associated with substantial morbidity. Complications arising from this disease affect many organ systems. In particular, hepatitis, pancreatitis, blood dyscrasias, and renal disease are believed to occur more frequently in patients with Crohn's disease. The incidence of these conditions is also believed to be increased by some of the medications used to treat Crohn's disease. Sulfasalazine as well as mesalamine have been associated with hepatitis, pancreatitis, renal disease, and blood dyscrasias. In addition to characterizing the demographics and severity of Crohn's disease in Saskatchewan, the purpose of this study was also to determine if, in patients with Crohn's disease, there is an increased risk of developing these adverse conditions associated with the medications used to treat this condition. In this study 1999 patients with Crohn's disease who met inclusion criteria, were identified in the Saskatchewan Healthcare datafiles.

Losses of c-met alleles have been documented in human carcinomas. In breast carcinoma c-met has been suggested to be a potential inactivated tumour suppressor gene (TSG). In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) a general reduction of c-met expression in squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs), as well as overexpression in adenocarcinomas (ADCs) have been revealed. Furthermore, many SQCCs and ADCs had undetectable c-met mRNA and protein. These results prompted us to explore c-met allelic alterations in NSCLC. Our main goal was to address the possible involvement of inactivated c-met alleles in the development and progression of NSCLC. In this LOH analysis two polymorphic-sensitive probes corresponding to the c-met gene, p-metH and p-metD, were used to analyze normal and tumour DNA samples from patients with primary NSCLC. Of 110 cases examined with p-metH, 56 (50.9%) were informative and 4 (7.1%) exhibited LOH. Among 109 patients examined with p-metD, 28 (25.7%) were informative and 1 (3.6%) was LOH-positive. The combined LOH incidence for c-met was 7.4% (5/68 informative cases). Lastly, since a locus adjacent (distally) to c-met on chromosome 7, D7S95, was shown to exhibit a significant LOH frequency in gastric carcinoma (43.3%), we also sought to determine if loss of this locus was common in NSCLC. Of 104 patients examined at D7S95, 45 (43.3%) were informative and 1 (2.2%) exhibited LOH. These findings suggest, firstly, that c-met does not have a possible role as an inactivated TSG in the tumourigenesis of NSCLC nor is it closely linked to a putative TSG, and secondly, D7S95 does not contain a detectable inactivated TSG or a closely-mapping TSG in NSCLC.</description><creator>Gebien, Darryl Jordan.</creator><contributor>Zhu, Hong (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Loss of heterozygosity analysis of c-met and an adjacent locus, D7S95, in human non-small cell lung carcinoma</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53wx86g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k9214</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dr57x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents results of a case-control study investigating the excess risk of ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma associated with the use of oral, inhaled and nasal glucocorticoids. Data on 9,793 cases and 38,325 control subjects were obtained from the computerized administrative health databases of the province of Quebec, Canada. For oral glucocorticoids, a 40% increase in the risk of ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma was observed. The risk increased with higher daily doses and increasing duration of treatment. Exposure to inhaled glucocorticoids was not associated with an elevated risk, except when they were administered in high doses over extended periods of time. No elevated risk was observed for exposure to nasal glucocorticoids. The study results are discussed in view of pharmacological data for different forms of glucocorticoids and compared to findings for ophthalmic glucocorticoids.

Using the operator formalism with supersymmetric transformations, relations are found among processes containing different numbers of gluinos. Explicit calculations are made for the four-point functions as a demonstration of this approach. To further separate these relations, off-shell calculations are made from which a diagrammatic algorithm is derived. This algorithm is shown to reproduce the standard relations among processes.

Experimental sites were a Ste-Rosalie clay (Humic Gleysol) and an Ormstown silty clay loam (Humic Gleysol). Results obtained from fall 1992 to spring 1995 showed that tillage had no effect on soil N levels under corn. Soil N levels under corn showed a linear response to added N, specially in the fall. Soil N levels under corn did not change considerably during the non-growing season. Higher spring NO$ sb3$-N levels, particularly in plots under conventional tillage and alfalfa or soybean, compared to fall values indicated greater nitrification and/or mineralization than denitrification, immobilization or leaching. Low NH$ sb4$-N levels indicated that nitrification processes were active. No consistent estimation could be made of fertilizer N credits for corn from either soybean or alfalfa based on NO$ sb3$-N levels in soil.</description><creator>Galiano, Norma Graciela.</creator><contributor>MacKenzie, A.

With four days of cold acclimation, PEPC activity increased to 3.5-fold and 2-fold the control levels in Anik and Trek, respectively. This was associated with an increase in the level of a 110 kD PEPC protein and a decrease in the amount of a 120 kD PEPC polypeptide in both cultivars. The role of reversible phosphorylation in regulating PEPC activity was demonstrated by in vitro phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which caused partial activation and deactivation of PEPC, respectively. In vivo phosphorylation experiments revealed that the 110 kD PEPC subunit is phosphorylated on serine residue(s) during cold acclimation in Anik but not in Trek. Increased PEPC activity could account for the 70% increase in the non-autotrophic or dark fixation of carbon observed in cold acclimated Anik seedlings. A possible role for dark carbon fixation in the cold-induced development of freezing tolerance is through the production of NADPH. Such a source of reducing power may be required for the repair of cold-induced damage and restoration of normal cellular functions.</description><creator>Frank, Scott, 1971-</creator><contributor>Dhindsa, Rajinder (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Phosphorylation.</subject><subject>Alfalfa -- Effect of cold on.</subject><subject>Cold adaptation</subject><subject>Plant enzymes.</subject><title>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and cold acclimation of alfalfa</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cg41w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d856n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m613n065n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many low molecular weight chlorinated organic compounds produced by the pulp and paper industry during kraft bleaching of the wood pulp are toxic. Mass balance studies suggest that mineralization of chlorinated organics is occurring in pulp and paper mill wastewater treatment systems. To understand the nature of dechlorination activity, molecular tools such as oligonucleotide primers and corresponding DNA probes were developed to monitor the presence of microorganisms possessing key genes (dehalogenases) responsible for the degradation of chloroaliphatic organics in kraft pulp mill effluent treatment systems. Oligonucleotide primers designed from the coding sequence of known dehalogenases and a methane monooxygenase gene, which is known to catalyze dehalogenation reactions, were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, using genomic DNA extracted from dehalogenating bacterial isolates and total community DNA extracted from water and sediments of lagoon treatment systems. PCR amplification with dhlB oligonucleotide primers, designed from the haloacid dehalogenase of Xanthobacter autotrophicus, revealed the presence of dehalogenase genes in both aerated lagoons and stabilization basins. Similar results were obtained with mmoX primers designed from the methane monooxygenase gene of Methylococcus capsulatus. DNA sequence analysis of several PCR fragments showed significant similarity to known dehalogenase genes. The molecular tools developed in this study revealed the presence of different types of microorganisms with dechlorination potential in the microbial community of pulp mill effluents.</description><creator>Fortin, Nathalie.</creator><contributor>Greer, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Wood-pulp industry -- Waste disposal -- Environmental aspects.</subject><subject>Sewage -- Purification -- Biological treatment.</subject><subject>Wood-pulp -- Bleaching -- Environmental aspects.</subject><title>Molecular characterization of dechlorination potential in kraft pulp mill effluent treatment systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Nathalie Fortin, 1996</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732db94z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n065n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n204114v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The use of a direct method for measuring respiration and transpiration rates may lead to better storage control systems and closer observation of storage losses. A laboratory scale environmental chamber was constructed and provided with a fan and adjustable louver to obtain variable ventilation flow rates. Flow rates were determined using a pressure sensor and fan characteristic curves which were determined experimentally. A regression equation representing the flow rate versus pressure relation was derived and used for estimating the flow rates throughout the study. Respiration and transpiration were simulated using precision heat sources ranging from 15 to 105W in 15W interval and an evaporative pad. Measured wet and dry bulb temperatures and ventilation flow rates were used for the estimation of heat and moisture generated inside the chamber. The work was performed in two parts. In the first, precision heat sources were used and the heat balance equation components were solved. In the second part, heat and moisture were generated inside the chamber, heat and moisture balance equations as well as psychrometric equations were solved.

The gross anatomy of the adrenal glands are species-specific, with the left gland being most variable. There were differences found in the number of cortex capsular layers and zona glomerulosa between species. Extensive capsular trabeculae penetrates deep into the cortex in only the largest antelope, i.e. eland and gemsbok, and are representative of these species. In all species the zona glomerulosa form variations in types of cellular cord structures, with the greater kudu having the most unique architecture of horizontally stratified, highly columnar cells that form winding cords which arches at the capsular end, and resemble those observed in equine species. Medullary capsules were observed in the eland, and incomplete capsules in the gemsbok and greater kudu. The medulla is characterized by an outer, adrenaline secreting zone that encapsulates a inner noradrenaline secreting zone in all species. The corticosteroid patterns are typical of bovids, with cortisol and corticosterone present, however significantly larger amounts of 18-hydroxy-corticosterone were found in all species of antelope. The total identified corticosteroid contents had interspecies differences, which are possibly based on species body size.</description><creator>Fazakas, Andrew S.</creator><contributor>Bider, J. R.

Three dietary treatments were offered to the birds: commercial pellets (control), feeds consisting partially of food waste, and feeds consisting entirely of food waste. The two experimental treatments each had a dry pelleted diet and a wet mash diet. Twenty-four carcasses from each breed were analyzed to determine the effects of the experimental diets compared to those of the control (commercial pellets). In addition to corn and soybean meal, a total of nine food waste ingredients were tested. The precise-feeding technique was performed to establish DM, fat, and fibre digestibility as well as N retention, AME, AMEn, TME, TMEn values for the 11 feedstuff ingredients. The results of this study provide reliable data for formulation of duck diets using the tested food waste ingredients as well as corn and soybean meal in both Pekin and Muscovy ducklings at 2 different ages during growth.

A previous study by Burki-Cohen et al. (1987) showed that bilinguals' categorization of a cross-language continuum that varied from a French word to an English word was different when the words were presented in the context of a French or an English carrier phrase. Using the same stimuli the present study examined whether the effects of base language (i.e. the carrier phrase) are due to processing specific to bilinguals or are mediated by general phonetic or auditory processes. Results showed that all three groups were affected by the base language in the same way, suggesting that general processes were involved. These findings indicate that manipulating a carrier phrase does not ensure that a level of language processing is invoked which can reveal categorization processes that are particular to bilinguals.</description><creator>Entwistle, Miranda L.</creator><contributor>Polka, Linda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Psychology, Experimental.</subject><subject>Language, Linguistics.</subject><subject>Psychology, Cognitive.</subject><title>Categorical perception in bilingual and monolingual adults</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t8300.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wm27j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qt97q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The paradox of tropical forests is that they are simultaneously the most diverse, the least understood, and the most imperiled terrestrial ecosystem in the world. Dramatic increases in the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO$ sb2$) concentration threaten to adversely affect fundamental climatic and ecosystem processes, gradually changing many things which we do not yet understand. Although the impacts of this rise have been studied in temperate areas, little research has investigated tree responses in the tropics, especially under natural frost conditions. This thesis examines three central issues in tropical ecophysiology and global change. First, it investigates the feasibility of in-situ measurements of several physiological traits under heterogeneous environmental conditions in a Panamanian rainforest. Second, it studies whether physiological traits differ among species and which traits are most consistent with ecological niche. Finally, it explores how variable species are in response to elevated CO$ sb2$. If ecologically-defined functional groups were to remain physiologically similar under increased CO$ sb2$, they could be used in accurately representing the variation at the species level in a global change model of system-level responses.

We focus on the optimistic synchronization protocol, Time Warp. A distributed load balancing algorithm was developed, which makes use of the active process migration in Clustered Time Warp. Clustered Time Warp is a hybrid synchronization protocol; it uses an optimistic approach between the clusters and a sequential approach within the clusters. As opposed to the centralized algorithm developed by H. Avril for Clustered Time Warp, the presented load balancing algorithm is a distributed token-passing one. We present two metrics for measuring the load: processor utilization and processor advance simulation rate. Different models were simulated and tested: VLSI models and queuing network models (pipeline and distributed networks). Results show that improving the performance of the system depends a great deal on the nature of the simulated model. For the VLSI model, we also examined the effect of the dynamic load balancing algorithm on the total number of processed messages per unit time. Performance results show that dynamically balancing the load, the throughput of the simulation was improved by more than 100%.</description><creator>El-Khatib, Khalil M.</creator><contributor>Tropper, Carl (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Dynamic load balancing for clustered time warp</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vm94t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps50k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p6691</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that NC is involved in nicotinic receptor mediated muscle cell degeneration. As a model to study nicotinic receptor mediated myopathy, neonatal skeletal muscle cultures prepared from one day old Sprague-Dawley pups were used. Skeletal muscle cultures were exposed to different concentrations of nicotine. The results demonstrate a significant dose dependent decrease in the number of muscle branch points with increasing nicotine concentrations. The degenerative effect(s) of nicotine were prevented by preincubating the muscle cultures with d-tubocurarine, a nicotinic receptor blocker, suggesting that the effects of nicotine are receptor mediated. Experiments were then done to assess an involvement of the NO generating system in the nicotine induced degeneration. NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors prevented/inhibited the nicotine induced degenerative effects on myotube size and branching, while exposure of the cells to sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an agent which releases NO spontaneously, resulted in myotube degeneration. As another approach to determine an involvement of NO in the myopathy, the effect of nicotine on NOS activity was determined. NOS activity increased in a time and tissue dependent manner in neonatal rat skeletal muscle cultures. NOS activity was then determined in the absence or presence of nicotine.

The disease can be treated with pharmacologic doses of oral biotin (biotin-responsiveness). The cDNA for HCS contains a biotin-binding domain deduced by analogy with the sequence and crystal structure of the E. coli BirA biotin ligase. E. coli birA$ sp-$ mutations causing biotin-auxotrophy all localize to this region. Of six point mutations I have identified in MCD patients, four localize to the biotin-binding region. In order to assess the HCS activity associated with patient mutations, I used an assay based on the expression of mutant HCS in E. coli. The method is based on the ability of mutant HCS to biotinylate the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in a temperature-sensitive birA$ sp-$ E. coli strain using 3H-biotin as tracer. I have shown that all of the mutations cause a severe decrease in HCS activity. In addition, I have shown that five of the mutant HCS are biotin-responsive. These findings are a major contribution to the understanding of the mechanism of biotin-responsiveness.</description><creator>Dupuis, Lucie.</creator><contributor>Gravel, Roy A.

High erucic acid rapeseed oil, a principle representative of triglyceride based oils suitable for biodegradable lubricating applications and mineral oil were used to test the methodology developed. The FT-NIR PV method is based on a well defined stoichiometric reaction of triphenylphospine (TPP) with hydroperoxides to form triphenylphospine oxide (TPPO). A partial least squares calibration model for the prediction of PV was developed using the NIR spectral region where TPP and TPPO co-absorb. The resulting calibration was highly linear over the analytical range of 100PV. Validation of the method carried out by comparing the PV of PLS prediction to the results of AOCS iodometric procedures indicated an excellent concurrence between the two methods. By programming the FT-NIR spectrometer, the analytical procedure simply consists of the addition of TPP stock solution to oil sample, mixing, taking its spectrum and predicting PV value. Through selected testing procedures, the prototype COAT system utilizing FTIR spectroscopy, advanced sample handling system designs, and computer programming was proved to be effective in monitoring the oil quality and behavior of antioxidants in real time. Both approaches offer combined advantages of speed, accuracy, low labor cost, automation, and environmental friendliness mainly derived from FTIR spectroscopy, and can serve as convenient means for routine quality control applications in oils and fats industry. Potential application based on the joint usage of the two methods in the obtaining of true value of oil stability was also presented in this text.

Such fonts allow, e.g., to come closer to simulating true handwriting, by rendering its freedom, spontaneity, and unpredictability. This method allows the generation of random letterforms with different overall shapes, derived from single letterform descriptions, according to specified parameters and constraints. Letterforms generated in this manner remain closely related--to a certain extent--to the original letterforms, and preserve the continuity and thickness of the strokes. Several examples of a typeface family designed with this method, implemented as PostScript Type 3 font programs, are presented.

Notch signaling controls the differentiation of a variety of tissues in invertebrates and vertebrates. To examine the role of the TLE genes in mammalian development, the expression of one of them, TLE 1, was analysed during mouse embryogenesis. This gene is expressed during a number of cell-determination events, including embryonic segmentation, central and peripheral neurogenesis, and epithelial differentiation. This pattern resembles groucho function in Drosophila and suggests that Groucho and TLE 1 protein may play similar developmental roles. These results also show that TLE 1 is co-expressed during a variety of cell - fate choices with several vertebrate homologs of genes implicated in the Drosophila Notch cascade, suggesting a role for the TLE 1 protein in mammalian Notch signaling.</description><creator>Dehni, Ghassan.</creator><contributor>Miller, Freda (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Stifani, Stefano (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>TLE 1 expression correlates with mouse embryonic segmentation, Neurogenesis and epithelial determination</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827d61v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g938j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f324h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:04:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Food frequency questionnaires and twenty-four hour recalls were conducted with a random sample of 104 Ojibwe adults in Mille Lacs, Minnesota and Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin to assess traditional and market food use.

The importance of the traditional food system was evident, with at least 50% of people engaging in hunting and fishing practices. Traditional food was among the top ten food sources of protein, zinc, iron and folate. The cultural significance of traditional food was apparent. Obesity is prevalent, with almost 50% of the population studied over the 85$ rm sp{th}$ percentile for Body Mass Index (BMI). Nutrient densities were lower than those in the NHANES III sample, in particular for calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C, and folate. Mean intakes of fat, saturated fat, and sucrose exceeded American Heart Association and World Health Organization recommendations. Areas of focus for education and future research needs are suggested in order to reduce risks for nutrition-related chronic disease such as diabetes and heart disease.</description><creator>Gonzague, Bernadette de.</creator><contributor>Receveur, Olivier (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Ojibwa Indians -- Food -- Minnesota -- Mille Lacs Indian Reservation.</subject><subject>Ojibwa Indians -- Food -- Wisconsin -- Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation.</subject><subject>Food habits -- Minnesota -- Mille Lacs Indian Reservation.</subject><subject>Food habits -- Wisconsin -- Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation.</subject><subject>Food -- Social aspects -- Wisconsin -- Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation.</subject><subject>Food -- Social aspects -- Minnesota -- Mille Lacs Indian Reservation.</subject><title>Traditional and market food use among adults in two Ojibwe communities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301333q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f324h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):350</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
