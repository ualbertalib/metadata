In the second section of the critical part, we outline the defining traits of the omniscient "I"; by proposing this figure, we fill in a gap in current narratological theory. The second part of this thesis, a short piece of prose fiction, is written in the first-person singular and uses simultaneous narration. The "I" is omniscient and occasionally exercises this power. The text begins when the heroine, Sarah, decides to tell the story of the rest of her life. No particular event justifies that she begin her story where she does, other than a sudden impulse to communicate what will be the story, that she still doesn't know, of her life.</description><creator>Major, Mélissa.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>First person narrative.</subject><title>Le narrateur &amp;quot;je&amp;quot; pouvant posséder les capacités d'un narrateur omniscient, faisant son récit fictif au présent dans une narration simultanée : suivi de, Le reste de ma vie</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h59c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b27740235</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rz25w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>VPW, a community-access television station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, hosted an array of programming ranging from the pragmatic to the truly bizarre, from 1971 until the station was bought out and dismantled in 2001. Grassroots media does not have the same institutional and archival frameworks as its mainstream counterpart; its losses often go unremarked, or must be reconstituted and memorialized in improvisational, provisional ways. In recent years, several Winnipeg artists have begun a kind of reclamation project around the station. This paper considers the various threads of nostalgia, political economy, and decline narratives at work in VPW's reclamation. It argues that thinking about why certain things are celebrated and others thrown away is itself a problem of aesthetics, politics, and publics. It examines why certain shows are remembered and others not, and the role of unanticipated uses of public infrastructure in such a dynamic.</description><creator>Leventhal, Anna Rebecca.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Popular culture -- Manitoba -- Winnipeg.</subject><subject>Public-access television -- Manitoba -- Winnipeg.</subject><title>From garbage to Garbage Hill : public culture, memory, and community access television in Winnipeg</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333598v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz25w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vg092</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This cross-cultural study examined the preferences of 137 Taiwanese EFL students and 97 ESL Quebecois students for specific types of corrective feedback, as well as their attitudes and beliefs about error correction, and those of 12 Taiwanese English instructors and 12 native English teachers in Quebec. All participants completed two questionnaires, the first eliciting overall preferences and attitudes for corrective feedback, and the second eliciting preferences for specific types of feedback aurally modeled through a digital recording designed for the purpose of this study. In addition, a subsample of participants was selected for follow-up interviews. Descriptive analysis of the initial questionnaire coupled with trends found in interview data revealed cross-cultural differences in preferences for types of errors to correct, the use of correction, rates of correction and affective reactions to error correction. However, statistical analysis of the data yielded by the main elicitation instrument revealed similar preferences within both cultural groups, with explicit correction being ranked highest, followed by recasts and then prompts.</description><creator>Lennane, B.

When these patients stay at home, family caregivers are often directly implicated in pain management. There are few studies that examine the process that these family caregivers engage in when they take on the responsibility of pain management. This means we need information on whether or not these family caregivers are prepared for management to ensure proper support and optimal pain control. The purpose of this qualitative study was to study the process used by family caregivers at home to manage the pain of palliative cancer patients using a grounded theory approach. A total of 24 family caregivers with differing relationships to the patient and differing lengths of caregiver experience participated. Family caregivers were recruited using purposeful then theoretical sampling. The data sources were taped, transcribed (semi-structured) interviews, field notes, and memos. Data analysis used Strauss &amp; Corbin’s (1998) suggestions for substantive coding: open, axial, and selective coding.[...]</description><description>Les patients atteints de cancer en fin de v1e eprouvent souvent des douleurs qui doivent etre traitees.

We start with the hypothesis according to which this dynamic, based on the succession "confinement-escape-return/re-creation of same", constitutes the frame of the text, giving it cohesion and structuring the narrative plot. Using thematic analysis tools, we attempt, first of all, to demonstrate the recurrent presence of the theme in the tremblayen text in line with two quite precise angles, that of spatial and family confinement in which the protagonists live. While underlining the different demonstrations of the theme, our analysis of the writing work aims to show that the author uses confinement, and precisely the confinement dynamic, as a dramatic motor (narrative function). Creating "la loi du roman", this never-ending structure on which would rest the tremblayen text, while preventing all escape attempts from the protagonists, would condemn them to wander eternally in search of a unreachable happiness.</description><creator>Lacharité, Marie-Josée.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Tremblay, Michel, 1942- Chroniques du Plateau Mont-Royal.</subject><subject>Tremblay, Michel, 1942- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La dynamique d'enfermement dans les Chroniques du Plateau Mont-Royal de Michel Tremblet [sic] /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537465f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g620b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58ph53v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The late 19th and early 20th century was a time of change for the Jewish people of Baghdad. Cultural influences from Europe and North America were making their presence felt and some Jewish Baghdadis actively sought to incorporate these into their personal and professional lives. To facilitate this process of acculturation, the Jewish community established schools that provided both a western education and a Jewish one. This essay studies these schools and considers the larger challenges that the community faced in seeking to be both western and Jewish while living in the Arab world. A brief history of the Jews of Baghdad and their standing in the city through the ages is also included.</description><creator>Korin, Tania.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Jews -- Education -- Iraq -- Baghdad -- History -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Jews -- Education -- Iraq -- Baghdad -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Jews -- Iraq -- Baghdad -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Jews -- Iraq -- Baghdad -- History -- 20th century.</subject><title>Tradition and modernity -- : what it meant to be an educated Baghdadi Jew in the late nineteenth to early-mid twentieth century</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d570119f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58ph53v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r494vp59n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Poetry by Russian women which has been published since the fall of the Soviet Union reveals that the quest to explore female identity and experience is no longer inviolable in Russian literature. This thesis examines female personae, gender and cultural identity in the work of Russian poets Nina Iskrenko (1951--1994), Tatiana Voltskaia (b. 1960), and Iuliia Kunina (b. 1966). Although the poetics of these writers' texts are broad-ranging, all of their work takes up the subjects of gender and cultural identity. Their poems explore identity as a discursive practice, rather than a fixed construct within the strictures of authoritative metanarratives' binary oppositions (male/female, feminine/masculine, Russian/non-Russian). This lends their poetry to postmodern analysis, an approach that heretofore has rarely been applied to poetry by Russian women. Within this theoretical framework, Judith Butler's formulation of "performativity" and Mikhail Epstein's theory of "transculturalism" are particularly well-suited to the task, as each entails non-essentialist conceptions of identity. Donna Haraway's formulation of "woman" as cyborg" is also a fitting theoretical complement, as it suggests the hybridization of identity, as well as the increasing role of the Internet in contemporary and future developments in Russian literature. The rapid changes in the late- and post-Soviet cultural landscape have engendered in contemporary poetry by Russian women powerful, new expressions of gender and cultural identity, which are resulting in startling subversions of authoritative discourses while at the same time forging coalitional "transmodern" identities.</description><creator>Knazan, Jennifer.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Women poets, Russian -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Russian poetry -- Women authors -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Gender identity -- Russia (Federation).</subject><subject>Gender identity in literature.</subject><title>A vague and lovely thing : gender, cultural identity and performativity in contemporary poetry by Russian women</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322j34w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp59n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd473107d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis I examine the notion of ethical subjectivity as characterized by an original relationship to alterity.

Motivation to engage in such violent and anti-nonnative behavior has yet to be understood. The two studies described in the present thesis examined what psychological motivations might account for peoples' involvement in terrorism. Study 1 explored the collective narratives of participants with ties to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Participants' narratives conveyed the explicit theme of justice and the implicit theme of identity as motives for extreme violence. Based on these findings, study 2 investigated if social identity and justice motives would exceed a control condition in inciting participation in terrorism. In a laboratory setting, participants were recruited to partake in a fictitious terrorism plot. Recruitment that emphasized social identity motives was relatively more compelling for participants than justice motives. Results for both studies warrant further research into the psychological role that justice and identity might play in the use terrorism.</description><creator>King, Michael, 1977-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Terrorism -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Tamil̲īl̲a Viṭutalaippulikaḷ (Association)</subject><title>Justice and identity : psychological motives for terrorism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2688916.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q793v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rs54v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the theology of pregnancy within the Eastern Orthodox Church. In particular, it explores the understanding of the pregnant body as an image of the church, as well as the Orthodox view of biological pregnancy. Drawing upon some patristic sources, as well as the writings of contemporary Orthodox theologians including John Zizioulas, John Breck and Vigen Guroian, it reveals that, though the Orthodox Church opposes abortion, this opposition cannot be grounded in an appeal to the idea of the "rights of the foetus." This is because an emphasis upon the individual's "rights" undermines much of the Eastern Church's understanding of personhood. Rather, the Orthodox Church's opposition to abortion is grounded in a eucharistic approach to justice, and in its positive theology of pregnancy, wherein particular pregnancies within the church are contextualized by the pregnancy of Mary the mother of Christ, and therefore stand as an icon of the larger church body.</description><creator>Humphrey, Meredith.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Abortion -- Religious aspects -- Orthodox Eastern Church.</subject><subject>Pregnancy.</subject><subject>Orthodox Eastern Church.</subject><title>Corporeal theology and the politics of pregnancy : abortion and the pregnant body in eastern Christian thought</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52jc48c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rs54v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fq550</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although there is a marked increase in the number of surviving motets from the early sixteenth century, the context in which they were performed remains a mystery. The first five printed anthologies of motets, published by Petrucci in Venice between 1502 and 1508, include a significant proportion of Marian motets (95 of the 174 pieces). In the first chapter I provide evidence that these polyphonic Marian motets were used in the Venetian confraternities, or "scuole." The second chapter draws connections between the musical needs of the scuole and the Marian text types of the motet anthologies. The final chapter looks at settings of the most common devotional prayer of the early sixteenth century, the Ave Maria. This thesis thus proposes a new context---the Venetian scuole---for the consumption of printed motet books and the performance of motets, with a special emphasis on their role in lay Marian devotions.</description><creator>Hatter, Jane Daphne.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Motets -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Petrucci, Ottaviano.</subject><subject>Mary, Blessed Virgin, Saint -- Songs and music.</subject><title>Marian motets in Petrucci's Venetian motet anthologies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nf798.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fq550</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80j023m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explored elite female adolescent swimmers' perceptions of the motivational influences of their coaches, parents, and peers using qualitative methods. Nine elite female swimmers (aged 13--15 years) participated in two semi-structured interviews that were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data was gathered and analyzed according to Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003). Six categories emerged including: individual factors, and assistance, informational, esteem, emotional, and network support. Results indicated girls' interpretations and unique, salient aspects of social support types provided by coaches, parents, and peers. Findings are related to past self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) motivational research. In particular, swimmers social support experiences were uniquely linked to their perceptions of competence, autonomy, relatedness, and motivation in elite competitive swimming. Findings support main SDT tenets and offer new insights into the important and differential social support influences in sport.</description><creator>Hassell, Kristina A.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Teenage girls -- Psychology.</subject><subject>Sports -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Swimmers -- Psychology.</subject><title>Elite female adolescent swimmers' perceptions of the motivational influences of coaches, parents, and peers : an interpretative phenomenological analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g8663.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80j023m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd3761317</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Framework Convention on Climate Change has yet to deal with tropical deforestation although it represents an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2005 negotiations on a possible regime to reduce emissions from deforestation resume under the impulse of a regime proposal based on the concept of compensated reduction. Over the course of 2006 Panamanian policy-makers working within the National Environmental Authority (ANAM) determine that such a regime is in the interest of Panama given that the integrity of the Kyoto Protocol's existing flexibility mechanisms is protected. However reducing its deforestation rate is not currently possible for Panama due to ANAM's limited institutional capacity to act on the field and limited political capacity to influence the national agenda. Important up-front flows of funds from developed countries combined with the adoption of a progressive project based compensation mechanism could contribute to reverse this trend.</description><creator>Guay, Bruno.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Climatic changes -- Government policy -- Panama.</subject><subject>Deforestation -- Panama.</subject><title>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation : the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and policy-making in Panama</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558h819.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd3761317</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537466q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), is a key calcium (Ca++) regulatory hormone. It is also associated with functions unrelated to Ca++ homeostasis. Here, special attention is paid towards the anticancer properties of 1,25D. 1,25D strongly inhibits the growth of well-differentiated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) derived cell lines. However, advanced, less differentiated, HNSCC cell lines (e.g. SCC4) are partially resistant to 1,25D. Resistance to nuclear receptor (NR) agonists is a common event that occurs in other NR-related treatments. For example, some leukemias develop resistance to the usually effective retinoic acid (RA) treatment. However, treating RA-resistant cells with HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) sensitizes them to RA. Thus, this study aims to investigate how treatment with TSA, an HDACi, would affect the response of SCC4 cell lines to 1,25D. We found that TSA had a variety of effects on 1,25D-regulated gene expression. Combined treatment with 1,25D and TSA increased the expression of cell-cycle regulating proteins, but also enhanced the downregulation of key target genes. Given the potential of the 1,25D/HDACi combination in combating cancers, two chimeric compounds, each containing parts of 1,25D and an HDACi, were synthesized in collaboration with Dr. James Gleason (Dept. of Chemistry, McGill). These 1,25D analogs have the HDACi-like structure replacing the 1,25D side chain. Both compounds proved to be agonists of the vitamin D receptor. Moreover, the TSA-substituted compound, called triciferol, effectively induced a-tubulin as well as histones acetylation. This study underlines the potential of combining 1,25D and TSA in cancer treatment, and reveals that bi-functional 1,25D analogs can be produced with potentially enhanced therapeutic activity.</description><creator>Dabbas, Basel.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Receptors, Calcitriol -- agonists.</subject><subject>Histone Deacetylases -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</subject><subject>Calcitriol -- analogs &amp; derivatives.</subject><subject>Antineoplastic Agents -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Drug Resistance, Neoplasm.</subject><title>Combined effects of vitamin D receptor agonists and histone deacetylase inhibition on vitamin D-resistant squamous carcinoma cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b2385.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537466q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7h149t305</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We present the 1.4-GHz catalog of the galaxy cluster field RCS J022434-0002.5, at a redshift of z = 0.773. A total of 194 sources were found within a ~0.28 degree2 region to a 5sigma depth of ~75 muJy. We show that the differential source counts for the cluster field are in good agreement with other radio surveys, and therefore do not indicate a strong excess of radio sources in the cluster compared to the field. We find 13 sources have optical counterparts with photometric redshifts within 1sigma of the cluster redshift and an additional 5 within 2sigma, and we consider these objects to be candidate cluster members. We use their radio luminosities to attempt to diagnose the presence of active galactic nuclei or star formation activity. We find that the cluster candidates are statistically more likely to be powered by active galactic nuclei, rather than star formation.</description><creator>D'Alfonso, Nadia.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Galaxies -- Clusters.</subject><subject>Red shift.</subject><title>A radio study of the high-redshift galaxy cluster field RCS J022434-0002.5 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53x048n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149t305</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bn999b31f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While providing non-invasive tissue detection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presently possesses limited sensitivity for protein target recognition. This limitation was addressed for the target beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) by constructing three beta-gal-specific MRI probes. The probes are based on a bipartite design in which a vasoactive moiety known as a diazeniumdiolate (NONOate) is bound to a specifier, specifically galactose. Upon galactose' interaction with beta-gal, the NONOate is cleaved from galactose, and actively generates nitric oxide (NO). The released NO leads to microvascular permeability changes in surrounding tissues affecting localized T1 measurements. These changes serve as a quantitative index of beta-gal detection. The three beta-gal-specific NO-releasing probes constructed include GALPYRNONO, GALPIPNONO and a 'bi-functional' probe, which is similar to the first two but with glucose additionally incorporated so that the third probe may easily cross cellular membranes. Synthesis and characterization of this novel class of MRI probes are described in this work.

The development of this disease is dictated, in part, by a set of genes governing susceptibility. Knowledge of such genetic modifiers offers novel therapeutic targets and improved understanding of the pathways involved in the disease process. Our method integrates different data types to identify genes that have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) disrupting a transcription factor binding site that modifies the outcome of BIPF. Our current approach examines over 7 million SNPs, phenotypes from 11 inbred mice strains, mRNA expression data, linkage data, and over 600 transcription factor binding sites from the TRANSFAC database. Each gene is scored with respect to each data type and then integrated using a weighted multiplicative model. Our integrative method produces a list of potential genetic modifiers that will be validated using allelic imbalance tests, existing knockout mice if available, siRNA or antibodies. By investigating these genes, we have identified several that are related to known genetic modifiers or others that make biological sense such as H2-Q2, an antigen presentation gene, and Runx1, a transcription factor known to interact with the known BIPF genetic modifiers Smad3 and Cdkn1a.</description><creator>Cory, Sean M.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Bioinformatics.</subject><subject>Bleomycin.</subject><subject>Pulmonary fibrosis -- Genetic aspects.</subject><title>Integrative bioinformatics for the discovery of genetic modifiers of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3335994.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zf73m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nj38d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis is to explore the use of reinforcement learning (RL) in commercial computer games. Although RL has been applied with success to many types of board games and non-game simulated environments, there has been little work in applying RL to the most popular genres of games: first-person shooters, role-playing games, and real-time strategies. In this thesis we use a first-person shooter environment to create computer players, or bots, that learn to play the game using reinforcement learning techniques. We have created three experimental bots: ChaserBot, ItemBot and HybridBot. The two first bots each focus on a different aspect of the first-person shooter genre, and learn using basic RL. ChaserBot learns to chase down and shoot an enemy player. ItemBot, on the other hand, learns how to pick up the items---weapons, ammunition, armor---that are available, scattered on the ground, for the players to improve their arsenal. Both of these bots become reasonably proficient at their assigned task. Our goal for the third bot, HybridBot, was to create a bot that both chases and shoots an enemy player and goes after the items in the environment. Unlike the two previous bots which only have primitive actions available (strafing right or left, moving forward or backward, etc.), HybridBot uses options. At any state, it may choose either the player chasing option or the item gathering option. These options' internal policies are determined by the data learned by ChaserBot and ItemBot. HybridBot uses reinforcement learning to learn which option to pick at a given state. Each bot learns to perform its given tasks. We compare the three bots' ability to gather items, and ChaserBot's and HybridBot's ability to chase their opponent. HybridBot's results are of particular interest as it outperforms ItemBot at picking up items by a large amount. However, none of our experiments yielded bots that are competitive with human players. We discuss the reasons for this and suggest improvements for future work that could lead to competitive reinforcement learning bots.</description><creator>Coggan, Melanie.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Reinforcement learning.</subject><subject>Computer games.</subject><title>Reinforcement learning in commercial computer games</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cf516.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nj38d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579w954</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:14:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The ultramafic cumulate rocks of the Raglan horizon in the Proterozoic Cape Smith fold belt of northern Quebec have a common parental liquid in equilibrium with olivine of Fo89 composition. Cumulate olivines have experienced a trapped liquid shift to lower forsterite composition proportionally to the fraction of trapped liquid in the cumulate. Anomalously low nickel contents in analyses of both olivine and whole-rock chemistries are observed only in cumulates with the most modal olivine and which are proximal to known Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits. The calculated compositions of the trapped liquid fraction indicate that most of the Raglan cumulates formed from Fe-rich high-MgO basalts, which are restricted to the base of the Chukotat volcanic stratigraphy. We propose that a lower degree of adiabatic partial melting of a mantle source accounts for the Fe-rich nature of these parental liquids and may provide an explanation for the presence of numerous Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits in the sills of the Raglan horizon.</description><creator>Clark, David, 1979-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Ultrabasic rocks -- Québec (Province) -- Nord-du-Québec.</subject><title>Petrogenetic and economic significance of the whole-rock chemistry of ultramafic cumulates in the Cape Smith foldbelt, northern Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w5924.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w954</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pn89db120</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:14:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is the predominant means of dopamine deactivation within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain locus implicated in Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dopamine dysregulation is a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of ADHD and Methylphenidate (MPH), an effective treatment for ADHD, and acts at least in part, through modulation of dopamine levels in the PFC. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val108/158 Met polymorphism modulates behavioral dimensions relevant for ADHD and/or response of these behavioral dimensions to MPH and/or neuropsychological functions considered relevant for ADHD. No genotype or genotype by treatment interaction effects were observed for behavioral response to MPH. No genotype effects were observed using the family-based approach. Marginal genotype effects were observed between the Met/Met genotype and some but not all aspects of executive functioning. Overall, these results do not support the implication of the COMT Val108/158 Met polymorphism in ADHD, ADHD relevant behaviours or response to methylphenidate, but weakly implicate COMT gene in some aspects of executive functions in children with ADHD. Given that gene effects on behaviours are likely to be very small, a much large sample would be needed in order to establish these results, both negative and positive, with better confidence.</description><creator>Choudhry, Zia Ulhaq.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Child.</subject><subject>Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity -- genetics.</subject><subject>Catechol O-Methyltransferase -- genetics.</subject><subject>Methylphenidate -- therapeutic use.</subject><title>Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val 108158 Met polymorphism and ADHD : pharmaco-behavioural genetic and neurocognitive study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vx611.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89db120</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr172184x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:14:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Adult rats produce two main types of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), occurring at 22 and 50 kHz USVs. These calls are associated with aversive and rewarding stimuli, respectively. The neural mechanism of amphetamine-induced calling was examined in lesion and antagonist studies. We also tested whether amphetamine-induced 50 kHz USVs could predict individual differences in intravenous self-administration or conditioned place preference behavior. Further experiments examined whether 50 kHz USVs could be evoked by amphetamine-conditioned sensory stimuli and by rewarding electrical brain stimulation. Overall, our experimental findings: (1) identify certain experimental conditions that increase amphetamine-induced 50 kHz calling, (2) provide evidence that these calls may be dependent on mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission, (3) relate individual differences in 50 kHz vocalizing to other behavioural measures of drug reward, and (4) show that in some situations, 50 kHz calls reflect anticipation of expected rewards.</description><creator>Chehayeb, Diala.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Amphetamine -- administration &amp; dosage.</subject><subject>Conditioning (Psychology) -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Vocalization, Animal.</subject><subject>Vocalization, Animal -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Reward.</subject><title>Factors affecting amphetamine-induced 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in adult rats</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h8091.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr172184x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848v108</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:14:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this thesis is to develop a novel technique for the estimation of firing rate dynamics from single-unit recordings of neural pulse trains. This method applies an offline digital filtering technique to extract information transmitted by a neuron in teens of a rate code. While there is increasing evidence that the traditional rate coding cannot account for all the information transmitted by a cell, and that information may also be contained in the precise timing of spikes, the firing rate signal remains the benchmark by which the vast majority of electrophysiological studies relating neural activity to functional behaviour have been interpreted. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be an agreement on a single definition of a rate code let alone a consensus on an optimal estimation method. This study raises significant concerns about the validity of some of the most common methods in systems neuroscience, and proposes a simple yet more robust alternative. This latter is based on the convolution of the spike train with an optimally designed Kaiser window. Using computer-simulated as well as experimental data obtained from single-unit recordings of vestibular canal afferents, the proposed technique is shown to consistently outperform the current methods and even to permit robust estimations under time-varying conditions. These results suggest that estimates acquired with the conventional methods are biased and hence models of neural dynamics based on these latter may not be reliable.</description><creator>Cherif, Sofiane.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Action Potentials -- physiology.</subject><subject>Computer Simulation.</subject><subject>Models, Neurological.</subject><subject>Vestibule, Labyrinth -- physiology</subject><subject>Synaptic Transmission -- physiology.</subject><title>An improved method for the estimation of firing rate dynamics using a Kaiser window /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n81x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848v108</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913t48b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:14:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis presents a comparison of four techniques used for stereotactic radiosurgery, consisting of the static conformal beam, static cone-based, proton therapy, and the Gamma Knife techniques. The comparisons involved six test cases in which phantom target lesions were created in the center of the modified anthropomorphic RandoRTM head. The phantom lesions presented in the study were extreme irregular cases that ranged in shape and volume and were near a critical structure to receive minimal dose during treatment planning. The best treatment plans from each technique for all studies were selected and the extracted data was analyzed using physical and biological parameters. Correlations between integral biological effective dose (normal brain) and normal tissue complication probability were analyzed as a function of dose conformity (PITV), and correlations between tumor control probability and integral biological effective dose (tumor) as a function of dose homogeneity (MDPD) were analyzed, as well. These parameter pairings showed strong links. The static conformal beam and the proton SOBP techniques consistently provided low PITV and MDPD values for all cases, including the most irregular and complicated cases. Higher PITV and MDPD values, typically associated with static cone-based and the Gamma Knife techniques, were due to normal tissue and tumor tissue, respectively, being irradiated at higher dose levels than the prescribed dose. For these cases, as the PITV increased, the NTCP increased, as well, due to high doses created within the normal tissue found within the prescription isodose surface.</description><creator>Charpentier, Pierre E.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Brain Diseases -- surgery.</subject><subject>Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted -- methods.</subject><subject>Radiotherapy Dosage.</subject><subject>Radiosurgery -- methods.</subject><title>Dosimetric evaluation of four techniques used in stereotactic radiosurgery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qt57b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913t48b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73q0751</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:14:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We compute, to next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, the rate of energy loss suffered by a heavy quark moving nonrelativistically in the quark-gluon plasma. This quantity is essentially a measure of the scattering rates of this quark against plasma constituents, and of their efficiency in slowing it down. The next-to-leading order correction is sensitive to the physics of overlapping scatterings, as well as to the self-interactions of gauge fields with small momenta (of order the electric screening scale).

Because AA and DHA enhance neonatal bone mass, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary 0.5% AA and 0.2% DHA (w/w) prior to weaning on bone and growth. 40 guinea pigs were randomized to either a control (C) or low-protein diet (LP) during pregnancy and the C diet or the C diet with AA+DHA during lactation. Measurements included bone mass, metabolism, and strength, and erythrocyte lipid of sows and offspring from birth to 16 wk post-partum. The LP diet induced IUGR, while the AA+DHA increased bone mass by 5-20% in sows and offspring and corrected growth and bone mass in IUGR pups. Thus, AA+DHA provided in lactation rescues the growth trajectory in an IUGR state and is beneficial to maternal and neonatal bone mass.</description><creator>Burr, Laura Lynn.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Fetal growth retardation.</subject><subject>Bones -- Growth.</subject><subject>Lactation -- Nutritional aspects.</subject><subject>Guinea pigs.</subject><subject>Arachidonic acid.</subject><subject>Docosahexaenoic acid.</subject><title>Diet enrichment with arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid during the lactation period attenuates the effects of intrauterine growth restriction from birth to maturity in the guinea pig and improves maternal bone mass</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bx98q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806374v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):17125</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
