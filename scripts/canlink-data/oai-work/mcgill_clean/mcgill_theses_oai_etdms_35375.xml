The impacts of an invading species often vary  across systems, making their prediction difficult. When data from multiple invaded  sites are available, statistical models can be developed to correlate an invader's  distribution and abundance with local environmental variables; such models could  then provide managers with useful tools to help prioritize efforts to control the  invader. The introduction of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga  mussel (D. bugensis) to North America ranks among the most ecologically and  economically disruptive aquatic invasions ever documented. While some attempts have  been made to predict zebra mussel occurrence and abundance, none have been made for  quagga mussels. Furthermore, few studies have been based on river systems, which  possess the bulk of North American freshwater biodiversity. I related zebra and  quagga mussel occurrence and biomass to physical habitat variables (calcium  concentration, substrate size and depth) in the St. Lawrence River. I then developed  predictive models of abundance for each species from combinations of these  variables. Each variable explained a significant amount of variation in mussel  biomass, but different combinations of variables were obtained for each species.  Although these models do not account for all of the variation in abundance, they do  provide a useful basis for predicting dreissenid distribution and abundance in other  invaded river systems.</description><creator>Jones, Lisa A., 1976-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Zebra mussel -- Saint Lawrence River -- Geographical distribution</subject><subject>Quagga mussel -- Saint Lawrence River -- Geographical distribution</subject><subject>Shellfish populations -- Saint Lawrence River</subject><title>Influence of physico-chemical factors on the distribution and biomass of invasive mussels in the St. Lawrence River</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h004j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp49d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440s98b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is predominantly found in foods  of ruminant origin such as milk and processed cheese, and has gained much interest  recently due to its beneficial health and biological effects on animals and  humans. The bioconversion of linoleic acid (LA) and linolenic acid (LNA)  by a selected Bifidobacterium from healthy infant feces was studied. Bifidobacterium  breve JKL03 had the ability to convert linolenic acid (0.2 mg/ml) to CLNA in  fermentation of skim milk medium for 24 h up to a yield of 72.0% (up to 74.7% under  aerobic conditions) and linoleic acid (0.2 mg/ml) into CLA by fermentation in skim  milk medium for 24 h up to a yield of 23.9% (up to 28.0% under aerobic  conditions). B. breve JKL03 was also co-fermented with Lactobacillus  acidophilus (NCFMRTM strain), a commonly added starter culture, to observe the  resulting effects on growth during fermentation for yogurt production. Fermentation  of LNA in skim milk with B. breve JKL03 and L. acidophilus (NCFM) maintained high  CLNA production level. On the other hand, CLA production in the same media with both  strains did not exhibit as high level as with the single B. breve. These results are important for the advancement of knowledge on  the production of CLA and CLNA in dairy products and for knowledge on the basic  metabolic mechanisms for such conversion.</description><creator>Jung, Yun-Kyoung, 1979-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Linoleic acid -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Linolenic acids -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Bifidobacterium -- Industrial applications.</subject><title>Production of conjugated linoleic acid and conjugated linolenic acid by Bifidobacterium breve JKL03 and its application</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698807d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440s98b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fp505</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. The intention-to-treat (ITT) approach is an analytic  approach for the analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) in which patients  are analysed as randomized regardless of the treatment received. Objective. To evaluate the (1) proportion of articles describing  a randomized trial in main medical journals in 2002 reporting the use of ITT, (2)  proportion violating a major component of ITT, (3) distribution and management of  missing data in the analysis of the studies reporting an ITT  analysis. Method. We conducted a cross-sectional literature review of RCTs  reported in 10 medical journals in 2002. A single rater, using a standardized form,  evaluated all articles. A second rater evaluated a 10% sample to assess reliability.  The proportion of articles reporting the use of ITT was calculated. Among these, the  proportion of articles that "analyzed patients as randomized" and the  proportion and management of missing data was evaluated using standardized  definitions. Results. Of the 403 articles, 249 reported the use of ITT. Among  these, available patients were analyzed as randomized in 192 articles (77+/-5%).  However, more than 60% of the articles had missing data in their primary analysis.  The main reason for missing data was loss to follow-up. Few articles reported a  strategy for missing data. Conclusion. This study emphasizes the fact that authors use the  label "intention-to-treat" quite differently. Its most common use refers  to the analysis of all AVAILABLE subjects as randomized.</description><creator>Gravel, Jocelyn</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Evaluation of the use of the intention-to-treat-approach in randomized controlled trials. : do authors say what they do and do what they say?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000058d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp505</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vr47f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The upper Bay of Fundy's Cumberland Basin contains an estimated  16,500 hectares of salt marsh, nearly all of which have been diked and converted to  agricultural lands since the arrival of the Acadians in the late 17 th century. John  Lusby Marsh is a 600 ha salt marsh that was diked and farmed for approximately 250  years, until dikes breached in the late 1940s and the marsh was restored to tidal  conditions. A sediment core that contained the reclamation surface was extracted in  John Lusby Marsh, and a trial set of eight fossil pollen spectra was compared to the  modern analogues. Discriminant analysis classified the fossil samples into a  plausible sequence of historic land uses which included phases when the marsh was  diked and farmed. A comparison of the soil characteristics and pollen spectra from  this study to those in a previously published study of a nearby salt marsh at  Amherst N.S. suggest that flooding of a dikeland was misinterpreted as a sudden  increase in the rate of sea level rise. Historical air photos support this  conclusion by showing that the sampling location was indeed diked and farmed before  the 1940s.</description><creator>Graf, Maria-Theresia</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Reclamation of land -- Nova Scotia -- Beaubassin Region -- History.</subject><subject>Palynology -- Nova Scotia -- Beaubassin Region.</subject><subject>Dikes (Engineering) -- Nova Scotia -- Beaubassin Region -- History</subject><subject>Salt marshes -- Nova Scotia -- Beaubassin Region.</subject><title>Using palynological modern analogues to locate a buried dikeland soil in a recovering Bay of Fundy salt marsh</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf13p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr47f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88ch04n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pitx2 is a homeodomain transcription factor. Three functional  protein isoforms are encoded by the Pitx2 gene that differ only in their N-terminus.  Functional studies have demonstrated that the Pitx2c isoform is the most downstream  component of the left-right patterning cascade that is responsible for positioning  the internal organs relative to the midline. In all vertebrates, mRNA for the Pitx2c isoform is expressed  asymmetrically in the left lateral plate mesoderm and in organs that become  asymmetrically positioned. A Pitx2c isoform specific antibody was created and used  to determine the pattern of Pitx2c protein expression in the chick embryo. Pitx2c  protein expression appears to be identical to the pattern of Pitx2c mRNA  expression. I hypothesized that the Pitx2c N-terminus would be able to  independently act as a dominant negative and interfere with the left-right  patterning activity of endogenous Pitx2c protein. To test this hypothesis, the  Pitx2c N-terminus was overexpressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm. The first  morphological sign of left-right asymmetry is the rightward looping of the heart.  The heart looped to the left side in 30% of the infected embryos suggesting that the  Pitx2c N-terminus was acting as a dominant negative protein and interfering with the  activity of the endogenous Pitx2c. Mutation analysis indicated that the amino acid  residues 41 to 45, LAMAT, were required for the dominant negative activity of  Pitx2cN.</description><creator>Di Giorgio, Luciano</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Identification of critical amino acids in the N-terminus of Pitx2c</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n857g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch04n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rh57k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The somatotopic organization of the motor fibers within the  posterior limb of the internal capsule (IC) in humans remains unclear. Several  electrophysiological (EP) atlases created from stimulation during stereotactic  neurosurgery have suggested that there is considerable overlap between  representations of body parts. Overlap reported in these studies may have been due  to the linear scaling methods applied to the data. In the current work, a  three-dimensional EP database that accounts for inter-subject anatomical variability  through the use of a nonlinear registration technique was developed. The somatotopic  organization was explored at two levels of the IC using EP data acquired during  stereotactic procedures on the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus and the  subthalamic nucleus. This work has resulted in a functional atlas demonstrating the  locations of body part representations at two levels of the IC that accounts for  individual anatomical variability. These analyses suggest a face-anterior to  leg-posterior somatotopic organization, with increasing overlap and less separation  between adjacent representations at lower levels of the IC.</description><creator>Duerden, Emma G.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Three-dimensional electrophysiological database of motor responses obtained from the human internal capsule</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn444.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rh57k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cq98b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study was to apply the WEND model, a  nutrient mass balance model, to the Castor watershed in southern Quebec to evaluate  phosphorus movement, storage and export over time. The WEND model was customized to  run on a field-scale and then individually applied to 266 fields on the watershed  for a 30-year simulation period. Field-specific information for the period of  1997-1999, was used as basic inputs to the model. Climatic information was obtained  from local sources. The additional information required to run the model was derived  from the literature. Model outputs were analysed at three different levels: (i) the  overall watershed impacts, (ii) by cropping system, and (iii) for field management  practices presenting a high risk of P losses. Specific outputs examined were: soil  test Mehlich-III P, soil P saturation with aluminium, RUSLE soil loss potential and  TP export. The model was used to examine the impacts of crop rotations,  fertilizer application and tillage management on TP export. For the Castor  watershed, the soil test P increased at a mean rate of 3.71 kg Mehlich-III P ha -1  yr-1, equivalent to a mean input of about 32 kg P2O5 ha-1 yr-1 in excess of plant  requirements, assuming current field management practices remain  constant. If TP export is considered the most important parameter in terms  of P contamination, crop rotations are a good alternative to continuous corn  monocropping under which losses could reach as high as 3.36 kg TP ha-1 yr -1. Crop  rotations were shown to be an important management practice that should be more  carefully examined when establishing field management practices. Just one year of  grassland within a rotation can greatly improve the overall environmental health of  a watershed. The management of P inputs is also an important target for improvement,  as fertiliser inputs often surpassed plant requirements by two- or  three-fold.</description><creator>Choquette, Carolyne</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Agricultural pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Castor River Watershed.</subject><subject>Nonpoint source pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Castor River Watershed.</subject><subject>Phosphorus -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Castor River Watershed.</subject><subject>Castor River Watershed (Québec)</subject><title>Evaluating management practices to limit phosphorus losses from agricultural fields in the Castor watershed using the WEND model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/707958274.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cq98b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kn68q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The signaling peptide Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) is secreted by  prehypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate, the growth center of long bones.  It functions to negatively regulate differentiation and positively regulate  proliferation of chondrocytes. Thus, Ihh ultimately controls the rate of bone  growth. The transcriptional regulation of the Ihh gene, however, remains  uncharacterized. In order to study the gene's regulation, the genomic Ihh sequences  from several species were aligned to identify conserved regions that may contain  regulatory sites. Two putative Stat transcription factor binding sites were  identified, one of which is conserved across all species studied while the other is  rodent-specific. In addition, an in vitro system was established to test the  upstream region of the gene for transcriptional activity. ATDC5 chondrogenic cells  were stably transfected with a plasmid containing 5kb of sequence located upstream  of Ihh as well as a luciferase reporter gene. The presence of the Ihh sequence  induced expression of the luciferase reporter 50 fold above expression from a  control plasmid. COS7 and ATDC5 cells transiently transfected with similar  Ihh-luciferase constructs resulted in unique induction patterns. Thus, the Ihh  upstream genomic region contains sequences that regulate expression in a  tissue-specific fashion.</description><creator>Ciarallo, Anthony</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>A study of the transcriptional regulation of the mouse Indian Hedgehog gene in ATDC5 and COS7 cells /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f875w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn68q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831ck51x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a common progressive  neurodegenerative disorder that results in impairment of memory, thinking and  behavior (dementia). Objective. To delineate the patterns and extent of EpoR  expression in the brains of patients with sporadic AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment  (MCI; a frequent harbinger of AD) and normal elderly controls (NEC). Results. (A)  Temporal cortex: Percentages of GFAP-positive astrocytes co-expressing EpoR were (i)  significantly increased in AD and MCI vs. NEC (p&lt;0.05) in layers II and III,  (ii) increased in MCI, but not in AD, vs. NEC in layer I, and (iii) unrelated to  diagnosis (p&gt;0.05) in layers IV, V and VI and the subcortical white matter. (B)  Hippocampus: Percentages of GFAP-positive astrocytes co-expressing EpoR were (i)  significantly increased in AD and MCI vs. NEC (p&lt;0.05) in the stratum oriens  and pyramidal layer, (ii) increased in MCI, but not in AD, vs. NEC in the granular  layer, stratum radiatum and dentate gyrus, and (iii) unrelated to diagnosis  (p&gt;0.05) in the molecular layer. Conclusions. (1) Up-regulation of astrocyte EpoR  in certain cortical and hippocampal regions is an early event in the pathogenesis of  sporadic AD. (2) Based on in vitro and whole animal studies, glial EpoR induction  may confer protection against oxidative stress in the brains of patients with MCI  and AD. (3) Clinical neuroprotection trials using Epo or its derivatives in MCI/AD  may be warranted.</description><creator>Assaraf, Michael I.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The role of erythropoietin and its receptor in Alzheimer disease /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xs237.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck51x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sg897</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The polyglutamine diseases are caused by an expansion of a CAG  repeat sequence. This group of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders is  characterised by neuronal cell death and the accumulation of  polyglutamine-containing proteins. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed  that may explain disease pathogenesis. In this study, we propose a new pathogenic mechanism for these  neurodegenerative diseases. We have demonstrated that expanded CAG stretches are  prone to frameshifting to the -1 alanine-encoding GCA frame, and we propose that  this phenomenon is due to ribosomal slippage during translation. This slippage  depends on the presence of long CAG tracts, and generates polyalanine-containing  proteins. We showed that polyalanines increase cell toxicity. Finally, we tested the  effects of a ribosome-interacting drug and its ability to reduce or inhibit -1  translational frameshift and hence reduce cell toxicity. This drug introduces an  avenue of potential treatment for these disorders.</description><creator>Au Yeung, Faith Yung-Man</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Translational slippage and polyalanine toxicity in a cellular model for expanded CAG repeat disorders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s77k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sg897</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tv611</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The transmission of speech and audio over communication channels  has always required speech and audio coders with reasonable search and computational  complexity and good performance relative to the corresponding distortion  measure. This work introduces a coding scheme which works in a perceptual  auditory domain. The input high dimensional frames of audio and speech are  transformed to power spectral domain, using either DFT or MDCT. The log spectral  vectors are then transformed to the excitation domain. In the quantizer section the  vectors are DCT transformed and decorrelated. This operation gives the possibility  of using diagonal covariances in modelling the data. Finally, a GMM based VQ is  performed on the vectors. In the decoder part the inverse operations are done. However, in  order to prevent negative power spectrum elements due to inverse perceptual  transformation in the decoder, instead of direct inversion, a Nonnegative Least  Squares Algorithm has been used to switch back to frequency domain. For the sake of  comparison, a reference subband based "Excitation Distortion coder" is  implemented and comparing the resulting coded files showed a better performance for  the proposed GMM based coder.</description><creator>Vakil, Sam</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Gaussian mixture model based coding of speech and audio</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b598.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv611</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bk128b49s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The performance of a device, for certain design parameters, can  be modeled using finite element analysis (FEA); however, this can be computationally  complex and time consuming. But because this performance can be modeled as a  continuous function over the parameter ranges, it is efficient to combine FEA with  interpolation to rapidly estimate the performance for any variables. While there  exists many interpolation techniques, FEA can provide sensitivities at little extra  cost, so these methods should take advantage of this information. In this thesis, a  new adaptive interpolation scheme is proposed which uses radial basis functions  (multiquadrics) while making use of sensitivities. Results demonstrate the greater  accuracy of the new scheme compared to a previous multiquadric algorithm without  sensitivities. Test cases include artificial functions, and an example combining FEA  and the interpolation of the reflection coefficient for a rectangular waveguide  containing a partial height metallic post.</description><creator>Tsao, David, 1980-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Construction of device performance models using adaptive interpolation and sensitives</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j8619.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b49s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17ct50j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An experimental study of minor element elimination from copper  smelter dust by vacuum calcination was carried out. The rationale for the study was  to test the feasibility of vacuum calcination as a treatment to separate minor  elements from copper smelter dusts and to recover the copper values in the  dust. The physical, chemical and mineralogical nature of copper  smelter dust as received was characterized using ICP, AA, XRD, EDS etc. The  prevailing mineralogical components of the dust were copper sulfate, lead sulfate  and magnetite. It was observed that the dust particles consisted of spherical and  irregular shaped agglomerated solid droplets. Experiments were performed to measure the extent of removal of  bismuth, arsenic, lead and zinc from copper smelter dust exposed to a vacuum in the  range from 50 to 110 Pascal in the temperature range from 600 °C to 950  °C and for a time in the range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. Fifty gram  samples of smelter dust were used in each test. It was found that up to 97 % Bi, 99  % As and 99 % Pb eliminations from the dust were achieved in experiments, performed  at 900 °C, in the pressure of 50~110 Pa and for a period of 60  minutes with the addition of copper concentrate in different ratios.

The algorithm employs a  model-based approach that was developed by Rey and Galiana (1991). The improved  classification algorithm consists of two essential stages. In the first stage the  eye velocity response is classified to obtain best possible estimates of the slow  phase eye velocity intervals. In the second stage, the slow phase estimates are used  to identify a response phase shift and non-linearity, and compensate for their  effects. Multiple tests on simulated data and experimental data obtained from  clinical subjects are presented. The results of the tests demonstrate that the  algorithm is able to analyze the patient data with a high accuracy even in the  presence of noise, eye-blinks and other artifacts.</description><creator>Radinsky, Iliya</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Improved algorithm for classification of nystagmus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg263.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mc58h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f6442</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many a robotic pitch-roll wrist uses a bevel-gear differential  train to drive the gripper. The innovative design of pitch-roll wrists using  spherical cam-roller pairs is currently underway at McGill University's Centre for  Intelligent Machines, with the aim of overcoming the drawbacks of bevel-gear trains.  This innovative design relies on Speed-o-Cam, a new concept of speed-reduction  mechanisms based on cams and pure-rolling contact, intended to replace gears and  harmonic drives in applications where backlash, friction, and flexibility cannot be  tolerated. The new mechanism consists mainly of a spherical conjugate cam  subassembly and two roller-carrying disks. We start with a study of cam curvature, with special focus on  its machinability. Drawing from experience, we introduce the hypothesis that high  curvature changes of a cam profile are at the source of the concentration of  machining errors. As a consequence, the machining accuracy of the concave regions in  a cam profile is substantially lower than that of its convex regions. To produce a  more accurate cam we developed the geometric condition that guarantees a fully  convex spherical cam profile. The optimum design of the pitch-roll mechanism based on  cam-roller pairs is reported here. The optimization is intended to simplify the  subassembly of spherical conjugate cams of the old design by means of a layout of  two pairs of spherical mechanisms of the Stephenson type and two conjugate cams  mounted on distinct shafts. We focus on the optimum design of both the spherical  cam-roller mechanism and the spherical Stephenson mechanism.</description><creator>Hernandez, Sergio</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>The optimum design of epicyclic trains of spherical cam-roller pairs /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d957m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f6442</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xs24h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A seizure warning system for intracerebral EEG is proposed. It  is designed for clinical use with the intention of identifying sections of EEG  containing seizure activity and alerting medical staff as a seizure occurs. The  system is based on data filtering, spectral feature extraction, probability analysis  using Bayes' theorem, spatial and temporal context analysis, and user  tuneability. The system was designed using 407 hours of EEG from 19 patients  having 152 seizures. Once developed, the system was tested with a different set of  EEGs from 19 patients having a total of 100 seizures during 389  hours. Average results for the testing data were promising, with 86%  sensitivity, a false detection rate of 0.47/hour, and a delay time of 16 seconds.  Compared to current clinical systems, this shows a 9% enhancement in sensitivity,  and a false detection improvement by a factor of 9.6. The aim of tuneability was  also reached.</description><creator>Grewal, Sukhjit</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>An automatic warning system for epileptic seizures recorded on intracerebral electroencephalograms /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182k69n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs24h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w050t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As sexualities educators, we rarely examine the broader social  context our sexualities are shaped within, nor do we often give meaningful  instruction to students on how to come to terms with emotions and desire or choosing  and being good partners. Some of the ways we 'do' masculinity, femininity and gender  in this culture can compromise our ability to fully engage in loving relationships  with our selves and others. Teaching sexualities as transformational learning,  critical theory challenges us to do better, both as individuals and as a society  aware of and resisting oppression.

This group of women was a "community" in  the sense that their contact, sociability, friendship and poetry writing were  meaningfully intertwined in their lives. The thesis is divided into three  interconnected chapters. Two separate biographical accounts of Gu Taiqing's  life---one centered around the relationship with her husband, and the second around  her relationship with her female friends---are reconstructed in the first chapter.  This biographical chapter underlines the importance of situating Gu in the women's  community to understand her life and poetry. The second is comprised of a  reconstruction of this women's community, delineating its members and distinctive  features. In the third chapter, a close-reading of Gu's poems in relation to the  women's community focuses on the themes of xian (leisure), parting, and friendship.  This chapter shows how each of these themes are represented by Gu and how her  representations are closely related to the experiences of this women's  group.</description><creator>Huang, Qiaole, 1976-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chinese poetry -- Women authors -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Women poets, Chinese</subject><subject>Gu, Taiqing, 1799-1877 -- Biography</subject><title>Writing from within a women's community : Gu Taiqing (1799-1877) and her poetry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97kr04h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977v447</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n174h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Mill on the Floss, by Victorian novelist George Eliot, is a  polylinguistic novel in Bakhtine's sense of the word in that it integrates the  linguistic diversity of the society which it depicts. This novel published in 1860  was translated six times into French but never enjoyed a great reception in France.  We examine three translations in this thesis: the first is by Francois  D'Albert-Durade (1863), the second is by Lucienne Molitor (1957) and the last is by  Alain Jumeau (2003). D'Albert-Durade's translation evacuates the linguistic diversity  in order to shape the novel to the requirements of the target literary polysystem.  Molitor, by homogenising the eliotian prose, turns the canonised English novel into  a French popular novel. Jumeau, for his part, by rehabilitating the peasant  sociolect in his translation, marks the beginning of a rehabilitation movement of  George Eliot in France. This study, through the analysis of the voice of a few key  characters, attempts to follow the French "translative journey" of The  Mill on the Floss.</description><creator>Henri-Lepage, Savoyane</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Eliot, George, 1819-1880.

Mathematics is a gatekeeper course in  high school, and students who are not successful with this subject are at a distinct  disadvantage, both in terms of their education and in their future careers. A  persistent source of difficulty for these students is related to language; students  often struggle both to understand what is being taught, and how to explain concepts  or problem solutions in their own words. Interactive journal writing was initiated  as a means of addressing this situation, and of meeting the objectives proposed by  the Quebec Education Plan, which specifies three closely related competencies: (1)  solve situational problems; (2) use mathematical reasoning; (3) and communicate by  using mathematical language. There is ample proof in the research literature that  communication plays an important role in supporting learners by helping them  clarify, refine and consolidate their thinking. This study demonstrates the importance of allowing and  encouraging students to use writing as part of their learning processes. By writing  about what they are being taught, students are forced to slow down, examine and  reflect on the steps they use to solve problems. Sharing what they write promotes  meaningful dialogue and personal engagement, essential ingredients of successful  learning.</description><creator>Alleyn, Suzanne</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Mathematics -- Study and teaching (Secondary)</subject><subject>Diaries -- Authorship</subject><subject>Remedial teaching</subject><title>Learning the language of mathematics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vp159.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt98k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vq27zn97b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the character of the unhappy bride in three  French novels of the 19th century: Le Lys dans la vallee (1836) by Honore de Balzac,  Madame Bovary (1857) by Gustave Flaubert and L'Assommoir (1877) by Emile Zola. It  compares the heroines' tragic destinies based on the following points: childhood;  education; marriage; the philosophy of love and psychology; and escapism and death.  We are shown that it is education that leads to the philosophy of love, which is  filled with ideas of platonic love, and that unhappy marriages involve compensation.  Research by psychoanalyst Karen Horney is applied to the characters found in the  novels to explain their deviant behaviour (masochism, bovarism, narcissism,  detachment). Each heroine demonstrates a tendency towards the ideal and illusions  inherited from romanticism. Their fates are sealed with the failure of their dreams  and the victory of reality over fantasy.</description><creator>Aubry, Sophie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Zola, Emile, 1840-1902.

The methodology consists in  applying histogram analysis for the initialization of parameters, using Simpson's  rule for the approximation of numerical integration and describing methods of skull  stripping and neighborhood information encoding. The two most significant  contributions are suggestions for speeding up current methods and a newly proposed  method that ignores spatial information for parameter estimation.

Complex  concurrent activities and interactions however make the development, i.e.  understanding, analyzing, designing and implementing, of such systems extremely  difficult. It is important to have a systematic approach to treat the many issues  when developing concurrent systems. In this thesis, we describe an approach that addresses  concurrency in all phases of object-oriented software development. We show how to  identify inherent concurrency at early stages of the development, and we propose a  way to systematically refine the resulting declarative specification into an  object-oriented design, which controls concurrency and provides data consistency  using transactions or monitors.</description><creator>Xiong, Jie, 1974-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Addressing concurrency using UML-based software development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296wz64c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v850s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977v45h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The standard genotyping technique in tuberculosis molecular  epidemiology is IS6110 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Several  public health organizations intend to switch from IS6110 RFLP to spoligotyping and  Mycobacterium Interspersed Repetitive Units - Variable Number Tandem Repeats  (MIRU-VNTR); however, the relevant test characteristics have not been studied.  Objective. Estimate the sensitivities and specificities of spoligotyping and  MIRU-VNTR using IS6110 RFLP as the reference standard. Population. Residents of the island of Montreal diagnosed with  active tuberculosis between 1996-1998, who were culture positive for Mycobacterium  tuberculosis and had ≥6 copies of IS6110 upon RFLP. Outcomes. Sensitivity,  specificity, percent transmission. Estimated sensitivities. spoligotyping 83% (95% CI 63%-95%),  MIRU-VNTR 52% (31%-72%), MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping used in combination (clustered  = both identical) 50% (29%-71%). Estimated specificities. spoligotyping 40%  (35%-46%), MIRU-VNTR 56% (51%-62%), combination 70% (65%-76%). Percent transmission  increased from 4% (IS6110 identical RFLP) to 23% (combination), 33% (MIRU-VNTR), and  53% (spoligotyping). There was evidence of misclassification. The poor test characteristics of spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR  typing suggest that these methods are not suitable for population-based molecular  epidemiology studies.</description><creator>Scott, Allison</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Sensitivity and specificity of spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing in tuberculosis molecular epidemiology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wq77j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fq977v45h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35400</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
