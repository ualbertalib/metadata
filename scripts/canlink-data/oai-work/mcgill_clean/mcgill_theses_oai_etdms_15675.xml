The Runge-Kutta fourth order method, the "Prep" system, the Number Series method and Trapezoidal Convolution are selected and compared using data obtained on a test control system. The necessary criteria concerning solution speed and accuracy are established. A method for converting a transfer function into an equivalent linear differential equation is presented. This method permits the use of a Laplace-transformable driving function with a set of initial conditions in formulating the differential equation. An improved version of Adams’ "close the loop" number series technique is proposed.</description><creator>Kwan, Robert. K-L.</creator><contributor>Milsum, J.

WHO has contributed greatly to our understanding of this problem by establishing simple, standardized and reliable techniques for assessing the susceptibility levels of populations of insects of world health importance to current chemical controls. Only by having an extensive record of such levels, at both different times and places, can changes or trends e.g., developing resistance, be detected. Lack of such standardized techniques makes it difficult to ascertain whether control failures are a result of poor application methods or increasing resistance.</description><creator>Kumar, Virendra.</creator><contributor>Morrison, F.

This politico-cultural unity further reinforced by Christianity was preserved through all the civil wars and invasions of the later Empire.

However, in 1900, Lewis (1) discovered that when a condensed electrode discharge was passed through nitrogen, at low pressure, the gas issuing from the discharge tube was characterised by a yellow afterglow. It was later shown by Strutt (2) that the discharged nitrogen had greatly enhanced chemical reactivity, as a consequence of which he termed it 'active nitrogen'. Active nitrogen has been obtained by several methods e.g. (I) a condensed electrical discharge through nitrogen or ammonia or nitric oxide at low pressures (3); (II) a microwave or electrodeless discharge through nitrogen, first used by Burke (4); (III) arc discharge through nitrogen at pressures as high as 20 cm Hg (5); and (IV) bombardment of nitrogen with electrons of energy greater than 16.3 ev (6).</description><creator>Khawaja, Nazir.

Of major importance in this study is the compound nucleus theory - a concept which was first proposed by Bohr. When an incident particle bits the nucleus, the compound nucleus is formed. This compound nucleus decays subsequently, and the decay is independent of the mode of its formation. In other words the compound nucleus has no memory of the past. This is called 'The Independence Hypothesis' by Weisskopf. Experiments do indicate that at low energies the compound nucleus is very often formed. The compound nucleus picture explains the very narrow resonances observed in elastic scattering of slow neutrons.</description><creator>Kembhavi, Vadiraj.</creator><contributor>Margolis, B.

The model materials considered were assumed to be more reactive than the minerals, but behaved similarly under suitably reduced physico-chemical conditions. A review of the literature of the sciences related to geology, especially salt chemistry, glaciology, metallurgy, ceramics and glass technology revealed that many cheap and readily available substances could be used as model materials. The "model structures" of the silicates, the fluoberyllates, were also investigated. Twenty simple physico-chemical modelling experiments concerning crystallization, recrystallization, solution, melting and deformation were performed. These experiments utilized alums, salts, iodine, and inert and reactive markers.</description><creator>Katz, Michael.</creator><contributor>Saull, V.

The first of these involves the attenuation of the CER that occurs following septal lesions (Brady &amp; Nauta, 1955), and the failure of the CER to develop when Ss are reinforced for an operant response by septal stimulation (Brady &amp; Conrad, 1960 b). The PAR and CER can be considered related responses since in both cases the S ceases to perform a highly motivated response (learned or unlearned), but only in the PAR situation can the painful conditioning stimulus be avoided by so doing. The second line of evidence concerns the drastic impairment in the development or the PAR following bilateral septal lesions (Kaada, Rasmussen &amp; Kveim, 1962; McCleary, 1961).</description><creator>Kasper, Phyllis.

However, same tissues are insufficiently supported in this way and have developed a supporting apparatus of their own, which is quite different from that provided by connective tissue. One component of this supporting apparatus is a system of intracellular fibrils. Well known examples of such intracellular fibrillar systems are the tonofibrils of epidermal cells and the terminal web of intestinal epithelial cells. These intracellular fibrillar systems are often intimately associated with intercellular attachment sites, namely desmosomes and terminal bars.</description><creator>Kallenbach, Ernst.</creator><contributor>Clermont, Y.

The rumen microorganisms, chiefly the bacteria, synthesize microbial protein of high biological value from non-protein nitrogen sources in the rumen, and this becomes available to the host animal by normal processes of protein digestion in the abomasum. The animal is therefore not entirely dependent upon dietary protein to satisfy its nitrogen requirements; indeed expansive dietary protein may be conserved by feeding cheaper non-protein supplements to ruminants.</description><creator>Jones, Graham.

In 1900, E. P. Lewis (2) made a study of the glowing gas and was able to identify its emission spectrum as that of nitrogen. The most extensive early work was that of R. J. Strutt, who later became Lord Rayleigh. During the years 1911 to 1942, he studied various properties of the yellow nitrogen. These studies included the effects of pressure, temperature, and wall conditions on the decay of the afterglow. He also studied its extensive chemical activity, as a consequence of which he termed the gas “Active Nitrogen". The golden yellow glow, which is characteristic of active nitrogen, is now known as the "Lewis-Rayleigh" afterglow in recognition of the work done by these two men.</description><creator>Jones, William.

The economic significance of pasture in relation to ruminant production is of paramount importance since pasture forage furnishes a natural basal feed and provides one of the cheapest sources of nutrients for these animals. The efficient utilisation of pastures and the problems associated with the assessment of their nutritive value are complicated however by the impact of certain botanical and animal inter-relationships. Within the last few decades there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of pastures and an awareness of some of the shortcomings regarding the assessment of their nutritive value.</description><creator>Jeffers, Hugh.

About 250 modal analyses and associated optical and X-ray determinations, 17 semiquantitative spectrographic iron-formation analyses, 2 chemical analyses of gabbro and amphibolite, and other analyses are reported on. A granitic basement complex is overlain unconformably by metamorphosed, over lapping, stable, shelf-type rocks of the Labrador Geosyncline such as quartzmica- plagioclase schist, graphitic schist, meta-orthoquartzite, silicate-oxidecarbonate iron-formation, and amphibolite of possible volcanic origin. These rocks were probably folded when the Ungava Fold Belt was formed. Later, the area was profoundly affected by the Grenville orogeny. Basic intrusions were emplaced and amphibolized, and minor granitic intrusions were emplaced later during the same orogeny.</description><creator>Jackson, Garth. D.</creator><contributor>Gill, J.

Unlike the cow or the eve, the sow owes her value solely to her ability to produce and rear many young. The more young she can produce which are viable to marketable age, the greater her value. The ideal sow is defined as the one which begins to breed as early as is compatible with her future productivity, continues to breed as often as possible for as long a life as possible, and produces large litters of healthy pigs rearing them to good weaning weight without loss. In brief, fertility, fecundity, mothering ability and milk yield must all be high.</description><creator>Holness, Donald. E.</creator><contributor>Macdonald, M.

Inclusions of foreign sedimentary rock are extremely scarce. Diabase inclusions of undetermined age and intrusions of Upper Cretaceous age are common. The diapirs can be classified into three main groups, based on the structural setting in which they occur: domical diapirs, anticlinal diapirs and fault diapirs. They do not appear to be underlain by rock salt. The hypothesis that these diapirs originated from a thick gypsum layer which was subsequently dehydrated to anhydrite best explains the available data.</description><creator>Hoen, Ernst.

The doctrine was brought into new focus with the recent scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union, particularly by the acquisition of a thermonuclear capacity in 1953 and a missile advantage in 1957. Since Malenkov' s announcement in 1953 that the Soviet Union had broken the United States’ monopoly of thermonuclear weapons, the major powers have been faced with the threat of nuclear destruction in any future war. Khrushchev, having recognized the implications of war in the nuclear age, has asserted that all states must accept the principle of peaceful coexistence and has challenged the West to a contest of economic strength. </description><creator>Hobbs, Alan.

As well as preventing life threatening loss of blood during surgery or accidental wounding, the process is concerned with the more subtle preservation of the integrity of small blood vessels and quickly plugs vessels when a solution of continuity occurs. Hemostasis depends on a combination of three factors. These are the integrity of the capillary and blood vessel wall, circulating blood platelets and a number of clotting factors of which eleven have been isolated. Inefficiency of one or a combination of these factors leads to athrombocytopenic purpura, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia and various other abnormal bleeding states.</description><creator>Hinchey, Edward.

Computations are made at every five degrees of latitude from 30N to SON at 860, 700, 600, 300, 200, 100, and 26 mh. Fourier analysis is employed to determine the spectral distributions of heat transport. Intense cyclogenesis occurs during the period and significant changes are produced in hoth the spectral distributions and the total transports. The behaviour of the beat transports in the tropoaphere and stratosphere suggests that a high degree of inter-relation existed hetween these layers.</description><creator>Hill, Charles.

The central problem is to compare the content of department store advertising in English and French newspapers and to examine certain factors which affect the selection of this content. This is a problem in Montreal because of the bilingual and bicultural setting of this city and the fact that the stores seek customers from both groups. The advertising could be handled in two general ways: (1) by conducting two seperate advertising campaigns (one in each language) with seperate departments for each; or (2) by setting up one advertising department which would employ translators to translate directly from one language to another.</description><creator>Hill, Mary.
