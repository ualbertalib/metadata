Tumor histology and growth pattern remained essentially unchanged, although a progressive loss of the striking host eosinophile response to the first generation tumors occurred in subsequent intraocular generations. The transplants were able to induce new vessel formation even in such avascular structures as the cornea. Spontaneous intratumor hemorrhages were characteristically seen. Radioautography with tritiated thymidine showed labeling of all nuclear types, though most commonly medium sized moderately vesicular nuclei. Demonstration of labeled mitosis indicated an average tumor cell generation time of 7 ± 0.5 days and a calculated DNA synthesis time of 7.5 ± 0.5 hours.</description><creator>Garretson, Henry D.</creator><contributor>Feindel, W.

The radiospecific activity of the ribose moieties of guanine and uracil were the highest; that of adenine was somewhat lower, while the specific activity of the ribose of cytosine was about ten times lower than the above three. It has been shown that the specific activities of the various nucleotides of RNA are a reflection of the labelling of the corresponding nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction.

Using high resolution semi-conductor gamma-ray and conversion electron detectors, detailed studies of short-lived isomeric activities were undertaken. Improved data were obtained concerning a 90 micro-seconds isomer previously assigned to 121I . New information includes multipolarity determinations, relative intensity measurements, a revised assignment (to 122I), improved energy measurements, and the detection of at 1east one new transition (51.9 keV) and possibly two others. A new 293 micro-seconds M2 isomeric transition of 117 keV energy was assigned to 190Ir. New isomeric transitions, 166.5 keV (E2) and 47 keV (M2, or possib1y E2), were found in 189Pt (149 micro-seconds) and 191pt (100 micro-seconds), respectively; and two longer-lived transitions, 319.9 keV and 205 keV, were attributed to the decays of 189m-Au (5.0m) and 190m2-Ir (3.5 h), respectively. Tentative decay schemes are proposed which include these isomeric transitions.</description><creator>Fraser, Ian A.</creator><contributor>Bell, R.

No marked effects of GABA on potassium-stimulated oxygen uptake or on electrolyte accumulation or binding were found. Intraperitoneally-administered large volumes of hyperosmotic solutions of amine acids, sucrose or succinate delayed or protected against convulsions induced in rats by high oxygen pressure, picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol. The effect was found to be associated with increased serum osmolarity and consequent dehydration of the brain. Labelled amino acids and other substances were collected from small areas of the exposed cerebral cortex of animals after subcutaneous injection of or perfusion of the brain with labelled glucose solution.

Fasting diminished the incorporation of radioactively labeled glucose and palmitate into intact adipose tissue lipids. This effect was not altered by the addition of insulin to the incubation medium. The decrease in esterification of labeled palmitate could also be detected in free adipocyte preparations and adipose tissue homogenates, incubated under optimal conditions, although to a lesser extent than in intact tissue. The following enzymes involved in esterification of fatty acids by adipose tissue were characterized and optimal conditions for the determination of their activity established: coenzyme A ligase (AMP), acyl-CoA: L-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, acyl-CoA deacylase, L-a-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and acyl-CoA: diglyceride acyltransferase. The activities of these enzymes tested under optimal conditions were not altered by 48 hour fasting. Fatty acyl-CoA deacylase activity on the other hand was significantly decreased in the adipose tissue of the 48-hour fasted rat. The possibility is discussed that accumulation of long chain fatty acyl-CoA causes the decrease observed in esterification by the adipose tissue from fasted rats.</description><creator>Daniel, Anna M.</creator><contributor>Rubinstein, D.

Various aspects of the latter two processes have been investigated in mouse pancreas in vitro. (1) The uptake of amino-isobutyric acid and L-lysine over a wide range of concentrations may be explained in terms of one transport site, whereas kinetic analysis of L-tryptophan uptake suggests that at least two sites are involved. In addition to competition among neutral amino acids during transport, there is also competition between neutral and basic amino acids. Uptakes of ail the amino acids are inhibited by 0.1 mM 2, 4-dinitrophenol to about the same extent. The uptake of several neutral amino acids is scarcely sensitive to pH, white the uptake of L-lysine (basic) is significantly decreased at low pH.

Lancefield and Fuller extracts of eight enterococcus strains, representing four species, were investigated in double diffusion in agar for antigenic pattern and relationship. Cell fractions of S. faecalis were examined for antigenic components by latex agglutination, passive hem agglutination and double diffusion. A group specific antigen was demonstrated in a cytoplasmic fraction. The isolated and partially purified antigen was analyzed chromatographically and electrophoretically. Cell wall components of representative strains were isolated by different methods and analyzed serologically and by paper and thin layer chromatography. Hexosamine, D(+) glucose and L(+) rhamnose were identified. The amino acid composition varied but DL alpha alanine was consistently present. A peptide consisting of seven amino acids was demonstrated. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of such extracts appeared promising. Separation of components by gel filtration was unsuccessful. The G+C percentage composition of the strains was determined in cesium chloride density gradient.</description><creator>Cantor, Ena D.</creator><contributor>Kalz, G.

The alveolar cell is the metabolically most active cell of the interalveolar septum but the Clara cell is the metabolically most active cell of the peripheral airway system. The Clara cell contains relatively large amounts of firmly bound choline-base phospholipids. The alveolar cell also contains choline-base phospholipids but these are present in a free or loosely-bound form. 2. The oxidative enzyme pattern is the same in serous and mucous cells of the tracheobronchial glands. Oncocytes in tracheobronchial glands show stronger enzymatic reactions than serous and mucous cells. 3. The enzymes of the glycolytic scheme, Krebs cycle and hexose monophosphate shunt are functional in the urethane induced pulmonary adenoma. 4. The histochemical pattern of the free macrophages around the urethane adenomas and those induced by the intratracheal injection of iron is different from that of the tumour cell or alveolar cell.</description><creator>Azzopardi, Alfred.</creator><contributor>Thurlbeck, W.

Chemical analyses showed that the hexosamine and hexuronic acid content of aorta and skin was decreased as was also the glucosamine content of liver in the treated animals. The activity of fructose-6-p-D-glutamine amidotransferase was decreased in supernatants from the liver homogenates of rats treated with cortisone for three days or longer. Similarly, the amidotransferase activity was decreased on addition of the soluble hydrocortisone succinate to normal liver supernatants, although the two effects may have different mechanisms of action. Studies with glucosamine-14C indicated that cortisone treatment caused no additional block in the hexosamine pathway. Thus, one way by which cortisone exerts its influence on MPS metabolism is by inhibiting the first step of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.</description><creator>Anastassiades, Tassos.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

When the spheres are in contact with one another, the chain should behave like a single rigid rod; quantitative confirmation was provided at low velocity gradients by experiments with chains of spheres formed in an electric field. At high gradients the chains broke. The periodic stretching of chains with non-zero gap width was in qualitative agreement with the theory. Chains of spheres held together by liquid menisci behaved like flexible threads and formed disordered aggregates at high velocity gradients. Aggregates of dises (rouleaux) behaved like deformable rods and were easily broken as the discs slid apart. Fore-aft symmetrical chains of non-uniform spheres and symmetrical but non-linear aggregates of spheres and aggregates of rods were also studied.</description><creator>Zia, Isaac Y.</creator><contributor>Mason, S.

Cholesterol synthesis from L-14-C-acetate was demonstrated in the fetal adrenals and liver. Minute amounts of pregnenolone and 17-alpha-hydroxy-pregnenolone were isolated from the adrenals of one perfusion study, suggesting that neither acetate nor cholesterol serves as an efficient precursor for the formation of neutral steroids in the human fetus. Under identical experimental conditions, 7-alpha-3H-cholesterol sulfate was perfused in a previable human fetus and it was not metabolized by any of the tissues analysed, indicating that the human fetus at midterm does not seem to utilize cholesterol sulfate to any appreciable extent in the biosynthesis of neutral steroid sulfates.</description><creator>Young, Peter C.</creator><contributor>Solomon, S.

Extraction of peptides was effected by percolation with a d1scontinous gradient of alcohol, acetic acid and water. Peptides in the percolates were fractionated by methods of gel filtration on Sephadex columns and ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE- and CM-Cellulose. Two major polypeptides, designated P-64 and P-32, were isolated in a highly purified state. Their molecular weights were estimated to be about 9,000. Their amino acid compositions were marked by high contents of cystine and glyc1ne but no histidine and tryptophan was found.

Retrograde fallout after hypophysectomy occurs exponentially, leveling off after one year. Because of the exponential nature of neuron fallout, the time required for maximal loss probably has been grossly underestimated in many localization studies employing the method. In man approximately 80 percent of neurons in both the supraoptic and paraveatricu1ar nuclei project to the neurohypophysial posterior lobe.

Single cells and c1umps of cells present in normal guinea pig peritoneal exudate, similar to macrophages in appearance, produced plaques when incubated with sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA) and guinea pig serum lacking the first component of complement (R1). Occasionally similar c1umps of cells produced plaques with EA and serum lacking the fourth component of complement (R4). Optimal plaque formation occurred when R1 or R4 was present at the start of incubation. Plaque formation was inhibited by KCN and dinitrophenol. No plaques were produced by spleen cells. Bone marrow cells produced plaques with both non-sensitized and sensitized erythrocytes only after prolonged incubation. Bone marrow and spleen cells produced plaques when incubated with nonsensitized erythrocytes and cobra venom. The lysis of red blood cells by cobra venom and guinea pig serum was investigated. Other possibly useful methods to detect the production of complement by single cells were examined.</description><creator>Moore, Dorothy L.</creator><contributor>Vas, S.

This strain was inducible by ultraviolet light and differed from the phage indicator strain by the absence of a haemolysin and pathogenicity for guinea pigs. Preliminary experiments did not reveal a phage-haemolysin relationship. One-step growth curves conducted in broth containing a reducing agent revealed latent and release periods of 45 minutes each. Phage yields were variable but, in general, quite low. Plaques produced on solid medium were small and possessed turbid centers. Lysogenization of the indicator strain occurred. The phage had a polyhedral head 80 x 70 mu and a striated tail 200 mu long as determined by electron microscopy. Experiments involving temperature, ultraviolet light and pH stability of the phage as well as adsorption experiments were performed. The phage nucleic acid, as determined by the diphenylamine reaction, acridine orange staining and sensitivity of phage multiplication to mitomycin C, was deoxyribonucleic acid.</description><creator>Mahony, David E.</creator><contributor>Reed, R.

It has been suggested that acetyl-I-camitylcholine could play an important role in nerve metabolism. In order to verify the hypothesis, this compound was chemically synthesized and its pharmacodynamic properties were compared with acetylcholine. Acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was labile to alkali treatment, hydrolyzed by true cholinesterase, and had an equipotent molar ratio of two when compared to acetylcholine on five different pharmacological test preparations. Its acetylcholine-like activity was potentiated by eserine and blocked by d-Tubocurarine and atropine. I-Carnitylcholine, a possible hydrolysis product of acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was found to be a potent neuromuscular blocker on the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation when compared to succinylcholine, acetyl-I-camitylcholine and acetylcholine. Paper and thin-layer chromatographic techniques were used to identify acetylcholine and acetyl-I-carnitylcholine in rat brain extracts.</description><creator>Kato, Gabor.</creator><contributor>Hosein, E.

The findings recorded in this thesis relate to their use and mode of action in thymectomized, sham-thymectomized and non-thymectomized rats and mice. No method is at present available for the in vitro standardization of ALP in terms of immuno-suppressive potency. Potency cannot be related to either, agglutinating and cytotoxic antibody titres directed against lymphocytes or to the ability of ALP to depress lymphocyte counts. The latter property of ALP has been found to be largely dependent on normal adrenal function in the recipient. The ability of ALS to prolong allograft survival times can be significantly improved if the recipient is thymectomized prior to the administration of serum and grafting performed after the completion of the course of ALS. An additional finding is that rats thymectomized in adult life show a progressive decline in immunological competence with the passage of time.</description><creator>Jeejeebhoy, Homi F.</creator><contributor>Irvine, W.

A commercially available dehydrated medium proved satisfactory for the production of the active material. Gel filtration was used to divide crude extracts, prepared from the diffusible portion of culture filtrates, into two major fractions. One of these, representing the higher molecular weight components, contained most of the nephritogenic activity as evidenced by the development of hypertension and acute glomerulonephritis in rabbits injected with the fraction. Physical and chemicals studies indicated that the active fraction consisted of at least four peptide components separable by high-voltage electrophoresis on paper. Automatic amino acid analysis of an acid hydrolysate of this fraction revealed 17 different amino acids. Carbohydrate was not detected by anthrone and orcinol tests.
