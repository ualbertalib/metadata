By studying the dramatized narrative persona utilized by Yeats--a persona constituting the ideological and societal contexts of the poem, and effecting, through the choice of perspective, the selection of historical materials--the particular contents of Yeats's history-making are brought into focus. Yeats was both a romantic poet uneasy with the political component of verse, and an Irish nationalist for whom these events were essential ingredients of his life's work. In these poems we find the collision of Yeats's own conflicting ideals about poetry, politics, and history; a collision which produces a complex portrayal of Irish political violence.</description><creator>Manicom, David, 1960-</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Violence in literature</subject><subject>Politics in literature</subject><subject>Yeats, W.

The focus of this thesis is on three particular aspects of such techniques, using the multipole operators as the basis for spin dynamics calculations. Composite pulses, developed from exact analytical expressions to minimize resonance-offset and phase distortion effects, are proposed with ramifications in applications such as broadband decoupling. Theoretical and experimental studies of half-integer quadrupolar nuclei solid systems, using simple multipulse sequences, permit the indirect detection of zero-quantum and multi-quantum polarizations and their characteristic relaxation behaviour, and provide preliminary evidence for the existence of the multipole operators. The final aspect is a theoretical investigation of scalar-coupled spin-1/2 systems, in which the density operator approach is generalized, in the multiple basis, to an n-spin system and applied to polarization transfer sequences involving small spin systems. The visualization of spin dynamics is given in frequency space rather than time space.</description><creator>Lee, Nelson Y.

It is proposed that the licensing requirements apply across components, in the spirit of the Projection Principle of Chomsky (1981). Under the extended view of licensing proposed here ("Universal Licensing"), maximal projections must comply with the appropriate licensing requirements at every syntactic level of representation. This allows for a more constrained model of grammar, under which a number of facts follow in a principled way; this is the case particularly with respect to constructions involving null operators. Thus, from the D- and S-Structure conditions on null operator licensing, we derive the cross-linguistic as well as the language-internal distribution of resumptive pronouns. Furthermore, some of the well-known, but so far stipulated, constraints on parasitic gap (PG) constructions are shown to follow from general principles: we explain for instance the fact that PGs must be sanctioned at S-Structure, as well as the inability of adjunct movement to license PGs. The consequences of Universal Licensing on the distribution of PGs are examined with particular reference to adnominal PGs in French genitival relatives. It is shown that the properties displayed by these little-studied ("double dont") constructions, in conjunction with the Universal Licensing Principle, shed significant light on a number of issues, among which the thematic structure of nominals, and the nature of the locality constraints on null operator identification.</description><creator>Tellier, Christine</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Government-binding theory (Linguistics)</subject><subject>Generative grammar -- Research</subject><subject>Universals (Linguistics)</subject><title>Universal licensing : implications for parasitic gap constructions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt50g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf45f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494914p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation offers a revaluation of Walter de la Mare's poetry; it counters two common critical misconceptions; escapism and lack of development. The overall pattern of imagery in the poetry reflects de la Mare's understanding of reality. It outlines a universe of four interpenetrating "worlds": this world, the other world, the child world and the adult world. This pattern is used as a frame of reference. Key poems are closely read so the complexity beneath apparent simplicity is pointed up. The poetry divides into three chronological stages, with two peaks of maturity. In the early peak, The Listeners (1912) and Peacock Pie, (1913) a distinctive, dense symbolic mode is perfected. After a transitional period of formal experimentation, a late peak is achieved with Bells and Grass (1941) and The Burning-Glass (1945), where symbolic imagery forms the core for a quiet, reflective, conversational mode. Throughout, the children's and adult poetry are considered as a unit.</description><creator>Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline, 1951-</creator><date>1988</date><subject>De la Mare, Walter, 1873-1956 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>The burning-glass : a developmental study of Walter de la Mare's poetry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b18n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494914p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wd427</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis proposes a quantitative model of fatigue crack initiation and early propagation based on a plastic strain intensity factor $ Delta{K} sb{p}$. In this model, the crack growth rate in the initiation region is simplified as a straight line on the log-log scale of da/dN verses $ Delta{K} sb{p}$ curve. A turning point which divides crack growth into the initiation and propagation regions is introduced as the plastic crack propagation threshold, $ Delta{K} sb{pth}$, whose value is determined by the plastic crack propagation threshold in the $ Delta{J}$-integral form, $ sqrt{ Delta{J} cdot{E}} sb{pth}$. The crack propagation style in the initiation region up to the plastic crack propagation threshold is Stage I propagation. This thesis also proposes a Stage I crack propagation model for cyclindrical specimens which consists of a model of sub-microcrack propagation prior to the sub-threshold and a model of the subsequent microcrack propagation. Crack profile changes and closure effect in the initiation region are also qualitatively proposed. The results of an experimental study carried out on smooth cylindrical specimens of polycrystalline OFHC copper at room temperature are compared with the proposed models. The coated and shadowed replicas viewed by SEM traced a fatal or main surface crack in a specimen back to a size of less than one micron. A combination of the replication technique and post-mortem specimen surface and fractographic surface examination by SEM provided good information of crack initiation and Stage I propagation. The results support the proposed models. The integration of the crack growth rate as a function of the plastic strain intensity factor yields a fatigue crack initiation life estimate whose error is less that 5%. For comparison, the experimental data presented in this paper is also discussed on the basis of $ Delta{K}$ and $ Delta{K} sb{eff}$ parameters proposed by other researchers.</description><creator>Zhai, Zhen-Hua</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>A study of fatigue crack initiation and early propagation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pg92t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wd427</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wg644</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mouse L cell mutants defective in receptor mediated endocytosis were isolated using selection with modeccin followed by screening for loss of mannose 6-phosphate (Man 6-P) dependent uptake or for resistance to Pseudomonas exotoxin.

Paste backfill was recently introduced as a superior support system for underground hard rock mining operations. The aim of this study is to examine the applicability of paste backfill to full scale underground operations. The Tailspinner system was developed to produce paste backfill. This system dewaters the full stream tailing material from approximately 55% to 24% water content. These densified tailings are mixed with cement prior to placement in a stope. The utilization of paste backfill possesses several economical and mechanical advantages. Paste backfill however, contains a high proportion of ultra fine solids, which results in a material of very low permeability. Hence, the question of liquefaction susceptibility of this material becomes important. This investigation is directed primarily towards the behavior of paste backfill when subjected to static and dynamic loading conditions. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the liquefaction resistance of paste backfill. However in order to accomplish this goal, studies also have to be made into the static characteristics. The behavior of both reconstituted and undisturbed samples were investigated. A comprehensive testing program on paste backfill samples was carried out. The static testing program was conducted to define the strength and deformation characteristics of paste backfill. The influence of cement and water content on static properties of paste backfill were investigated. The liquefaction resistance of paste backfill was evaluated based on several mechanisms. The results of a comprehensive study on the liquefaction potential of paste backfill are presented. The effect of variation in void ratio, confining pressure and cement content on the liquefaction resistance of backfill were investigated. The in situ tests were conducted on a paste backfilled stope at Dome Mines. A unique in situ testing program using a piezometer friction cone was carried out. This enabled the determination of the geotechnical characteristics and the evaluation of the liquefaction potential of paste backfill. The dynamic properties of the paste backfill were also investigated through a series of blasts adjacent to the backfilled stope. The resultant energy transfer and peak particle velocity transmitted through the rock and paste backfill was monitored with a series of accelerometers. The liquefaction analyses show that liquefaction resistance increases with increasing cement content and decreasing void ratio. Various curves were developed to present the influence of the above parameters for paste backfill application. The laboratory and in situ results obtained in this study should improve the understanding of backfill properties for design and operational purposes.</description><creator>Aref, Khosrow.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>A study of the geotechnical characteristics and liquefaction potential of paste backfill /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096774w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s191</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386j93v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chlorination of kraft black spruce pulp was studied in a fixed bed reactor. Breakthrough curves of the reactant chlorine and the products TOC, chloride and methanol were measured. The flow residence time distribution was determined by performing a stimulus response tracer experiment preceding chlorination of each pulp pad. The chlorine and methanol break-through curves were well described by a parallel plug flow model and instantaneous chlorine-lignin and first order chlorine-carbohydrates reactions. The representation of the residence time distribution by plug flow through segregated channels rather than by axial dispersed plug flow was confirmed by the effect of operating variables on the residence time distribution and by comparison with theory and numerical predictions. The good representation of the actual flow by the parallel plug flow model can be explained by poor radial mixing and a relatively large scale of variation in radial velocity. The latter is a direct consequence of the large aspect ratio of pulp fibers and their associated tendency to flocculate. This also explains why the dispersion in pulp pads is larger than in beds of regular shaped particles which have the same equivalent diameter as pulp fibers. Chlorine-lignin and methanol-lignin stoichiometries were determined as a function of operating conditions. The chlorine-lignin stoichiometry is a function of mean residence time and temperature, but not of chlorine feed concentration. The values of the chlorine-lignin stoichiometry are lower than found for corresponding batch chlorination of softwood pulps. The methanol-lignin stoichiometry is not influenced by any of the operating variables. The methanol concentration in the effluent can be used as an indicator for the completion of the chlorine-lignin reaction. Pulp properties such as lignin content, kappa number and viscosity were measured at the end of an experiment. Maximum delignification in any channel is obtained at chlorine breakthrough. Recycling of reconcentrated spent filtrate did not hinder delignification rates. The reciprocal intrinsic viscosity is proportional to the chlorine charge on pulp. Higher pulp viscosities are obtained at lower temperatures and mean residence times and at higher chlorine feed concentrations for the same chlorine charge on pulp. Viscosity protection agents like chlorine dioxide are effective in dynamic chlorination.</description><creator>Ali, Omar Feroze.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Dynamic chlorination of kraft pulp</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w522.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j93v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p31s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Natural Killer (NK) cells are able to recognize and lyse tumor cells without prior immunization or sensitization. The initial events leading to target cell lysis by NK cells involves a poorly defined recognition and binding phase. It has been hypothesized however that human NK cells may recognize transferrin receptors as target structures on tumor cells. To determine the possible involvement of transferrin receptors in human NK cell specificity, a correlation study between transferrin receptor expression and competitive activity for NK cell mediated lysis was undertaken. We have determined that the level of transferrin receptors expressed by different populations of K562 cells correlated well with their level of competitive activity for NK cell mediated lysis. To investigate if these transferrin receptors could be recognized and bound by NK cells, a solid phase receptor binding assay was developed. As a model system, it was demonstrated that nitrocellulose immobilized transferrin retained its specific functional receptor binding capacity. This technique was quantitative and proved to be sufficiently sensitive to specifically detect nanogram quantities of transferrin receptor protein. Binding was assessed using an ELISA based system. Human PBL were fractionated by discontinuous Percoll density centrifugation, bound to nitrocellulose, and evaluated for transferrin receptor binding capacity. A sample aliquot of cells from each Percoll fraction was retained to assess NK cell activity. It was observed that there was no positive relationship between NK cell activity and transferrin receptor binding capacity in these Percoll fractionated cells. These findings indicate that while transferrin receptors may be involved in human NK cell specificity, they do not support a role for transferrin receptors in a high affinity mechanism between NK cells and tumor target cells.</description><creator>Lazarus, Alan H.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Involvement of transferrin receptors in human natural killer cell specificity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vk701.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p31s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848r31d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chopped alfalfa and chopped whole-plant corn were ensiled and the proteolytic changes which occurred during ensiling were investigated. Proteolysis was measured in terms of end-products of protein degradation and by protein isolation followed by electrophoresis. The effects of formic acid and ammonia, applied at the time of ensiling, on proteolytic changes were investigated. Alfalfa treated with formic acid contained significantly reduced levels of NH$ sb3$-N and NPN compared to control silage; ammonia (NH$ sb3$)-treated alfalfa silage had significantly less NPN (P $&lt;$ 0.05). After 90d of storage, formic acid-treated and NH$ sb3$-treated alfalfa silage contained lower levels of both branched and non-branched amino acids, sulfur containing, and basic amino acids compared to control silage; formic acid-treated and NH$ sb3$-treated corn silage contained lower levels of branched chain amino acids and sulfur containing amino acids after the same time period. Formic acid and ammonia were most effective in the reduction of proteolysis in alfalfa silage and corn silage, respectively. The protein ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase (RuDPCase) was depleted completely after 2d of fermentation in control silage. Conditions in NH$ sb3$-treated alfalfa silage stabilized RuDPCase during the first 24h of storage.</description><creator>Fairbairn, Robert L.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Silage -- Fermentation.</subject><subject>Alfalfa -- Silage.</subject><subject>Corn -- Silage.</subject><title>Proteolysis associated with the fermentation of ensiled forage</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f85d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r31d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jv326</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The conventional approach in the theory and econometrics of investment is the partition of gross capital investment in two components: expansion (or net) investment and replacement investment. This thesis examines the latter component. A critical assessment of the literature and the empirical evidence reveal that the prevailing view of replacement known as the "proportional replacement hypothesis" is incorrectly specified and unsatisfactory. This thesis examines a variety of data brought together under the same focus for the first time and comes up with two important findings. First, firms maintain the operating capacity of their equipment not by replacing the whole of the machine but by replacing worn out or defective parts. The cost of new parts along with that of labour and materials incurred in restoring the operating efficiency of machines are known as "repair expenditures". Data on these expenditures have been collected by Statistics Canada in its investment survey since 1947. Although in effect replacement expenditures, these data are not capitalized by firms and hence do not appear in our conventional investment statistics. Although they account for a significant proportion of capital expenditures they are completely ignored in the theory and econometrics of replacement. Second, expansion and maintenance of production capacity are not the only purposes for which firms invest funds. They also invest for a variety of other purposes, such as modernization, upgrading, retooling, revamping and pollution abatement, for example. These activities lower unit costs of production and enhance the profitability of the firm by initiating or responding to changes in the structure of demand, technology, the prices of factor inputs or the market structure. Such capital expenditures entail changes in capital-output and capital-input specificity. As the real world is characterized by capital and output heterogeneity, structural change therefore implies structural investment. Important policy implications arise from the above findings. Tax incentives may be more effectively utilized when targeted toward firms undertaking structural investment rather than either expansion or replacement. Since repair expenditures are not included in standard investment statistics, the level of investment spending is significantly higher than conventionally thought. Also our capital stock data, particularly net capital figures, may be more deficient than previously presumed.</description><creator>Matziorinis, Ken N.

The demonstration of DNase-sensitive 4$ sp prime$-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence and DNA-like fibrils in the nucleomorphs strongly support this hypothesis. Cryptomonads and red algae, the proposed ancestors of cryptomonad chloroplasts, contain phycobiliprotein pigments. Although immunological and amino acid sequencing data indicate the phycobiliproteins of these two algal groups are evolutionarily closely related, they differ in their intracellular location. In red algae, phycobiliproteins are attached to the stromal surfaces of thylakoid membranes, while in cryptomonads, immunoelectron microscopical results indicate the proteins are located in the thylakoid lumen, in close association with the membrane.</description><creator>Ludwig, Martha</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Chloroplasts.</subject><title>Cytochemical and structural evidence for a eukaryotic endosymbiotic origin of the chloroplasts of cryptomonads and chlorarachnion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr88z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k563d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w5498</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nature of truth has occupied philosophers since the very beginning of the field. Our goal is to clarify the notion of scientific truth, in particular the notion of partial truth of facts. Our strategy consists to brake the problem into smaller, more manageable, questions. Thus, we distinguish the truth of a scientific theory, what we call the "global" truth value of a theory, from the truth of a particular scientific proposition, what we call the "local" truth values of a theory. We will present a new local theory of partial truth and will have few things to say about the global level. Moreover, we will also introduce some purely formal results, the most important being the introduction of a new class of algebraic structures which have some interesting connections with classical logic.</description><creator>Marquis, Jean-Pierre</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Truth</subject><title>Towards a theory of partial truth</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq32k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w5498</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jp38n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cp$ sb2$Ti(C))$ sb2$, where Cp = $ eta sp5$-cyclopentadienyl, reacted with RSSSR to give the catenated sulfur complexes Cp$ sb2$Ti(SR)(SSR), where R = CMe$ sb3$, CHMe$ sb2$, CH$ sb2$Ph, p-C$ sb6$H$ sb4$Me and CPh$ sb3$.

Experiments were carried out in a tube having a 0.19 meter inside diameter and a length of 0.93 meter, and 1.86 meter with both ends closed. A dispersion system was developed giving a good quality uniform dust suspension. A comparative method for the estimation of dust flame characteristics, based on well defined methane-air flame characteristics, was developed and employed to estimate the characteristics of a flame propagating in a cornstarch dust-air mixture. A systematic study of the influence of dispersion-induced turbulence on the dust flame propagation was carried out. The influence of obstacles on flame propagation also was investigated. Some mechanisms of flame propagation in a cornstarch dust-air mixture have been proposed and discussed. In the conclusion, general remarks concerning the dust flame characteristics and the influence of turbulence on flame propagation are made. The future direction of research is also indicated.</description><creator>Pu, Yi Kang</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Flame spread</subject><subject>Cornstarch -- Combustion</subject><subject>Dust explosions.</subject><title>Fundamental characteristics of laminar and turbulent flames in cornstarch dust-air mixtures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg37m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r859h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z903066s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Airborne electromagnetic methods were developed in the early 1950's, mostly by Canadian mining exploration companies as a means of economically and successfully searching large areas for conductive massive sulfide mineralisations. As new technologies developed they have become more and more sophisticated. They can detect conductors at depths in excess of 200 m and are routinely used for overburden mapping. The data is digitally recorded and processed. One of the most successful methods is the time domain airborne INPUT$ sp1$ system, for numerous mineral deposits were found by this system in the Canadian Shield. Present interpretation techniques are based on the use of nomograms (i.e. families of pre-computed characteristic responses) and the method is easily amenable to digital processing as it is easy to program and economic to use. For high accuracy interpretation however it is necessary to develop quantitative interpretation techniques that can make full use of all the data available. Inverse theory has been used with great success in all branches of geophysics, but to date in mining exploration it has been used for the interpretation of airborne E.M. data using only the one layer earth model. Use of inverse theory for the plate model has been limited by the high cost of numerically solving the forward problem. In this thesis we show how to use inverse theory to interpret time domain E.M. data with the rectangular thin plate model by introducing some economies. It is then possible to estimate parameter errors, the correlation matrix and to assess the validity of the model. This is extended to the joint inversion of magnetic and aeromagnetic data a case that often arises in mining problems. It is finally shown that under some assumptions the late time channels can be used to interpret time domain E.M. data in the presence of conductive overburden. ftn$ sp1$Registered trademark of Barringer Research Ltd.</description><creator>Keating, Pierre B.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Electronics in surveying -- Computer programs</subject><subject>Aeromagnetic prospecting</subject><title>The inversion of time-domain airborne electromagnetic data using the plate model /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g3406.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903066s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geological Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tq035</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The reaction of sulfate with six podzolic horizons of the Southern Laurentians (Quebec) was investigated using batch reaction techniques. It was demonstrated that sulfate sorption increased with decreasing solution pH to a maximum sorption capacity at around pH 4.0; below this pH retention decreased. This drop in sorption capacity was related to the partial dissolution of Al surface coatings. Indeed, the amount of native sulfate and the maximum sorption during the experiment were positively correlated (R$ sp2$ = 0.982, 0.800) with the oxalate extractable Al content of these forested soils. In all six horizons, the increase in sulfate sorption as a function of equilibrium sulfate concentration was best described by the Gunary equation. Kinetic experiments showed the presence of two major stages in both sorption and desorption reactions with an initial quick change (first 6 h) in solution concentration being followed by a second step where the reactions between sulfate and the soil matrix were much slower. The time-dependence of these reactions emphasized the appropriateness of kinetic equation in describing field situations. Moreover, kinetics studies performed under highly acidic conditions demonstrated that the amount of sulfate sorbed decreased with time after an initial sorption step due to the partial dissolution of Al surface materials. Thermodynamic calculations further suggested the subsequent precipitation of jurbanite. It was then concluded that surface dissolution and mineral formation should be considered in the interpretation of results obtained from experiments aimed at determining the effect of pH on sulfate retention.</description><creator>Courchesne, François</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Acid sulfate soils -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Podzol -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Soils -- Sulphur content -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>Mechanisms regulating sulfate movement in some podzols from Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w28h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq035</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xs37k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Given a finite set X of states, a finite set of transformations of X (generators), and another transformation f of X, we analyze the complexity of the membership problem, which consists in deciding whether f can be obtained by composition of the generators. This problem is studied for various classes (pseudovarieties) of monoids. It is shown that the complexity is NP-hard for monoids of threshold 2 or more, and NP-complete in commutative, J- and R-trivial monoids. For idempotent monoids (aperiodic of threshold one), the problem is NP-complete in the general case; subcases are analyzed, and a largest class of aperiodic monoids is identified for which the problem is in FL, as well as a largest class for which the problem is not NP-hard. The problem which consists in characterizing an idempotent monoid is also addressed: given a set of transformations, it can be decided in NC$ sp2$ whether the monoid they generate is idempotent. Similar tests are given for three subclasses of idempotent monoids: R$ sb1$, L$ sb1$, and N$ sb3$; in all three cases, the complexity is NC$ sp1$.

Optical activity from intrinsic molecular dissymmetry, polymer conformation and cholesteric reflection properties are considered. The chiroptical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals are interpreted according to deVries' theory. Lyotropic liquid crystalline phases formed by (hydroxypropyl)cellulose in methanol display anomalously high optical rotation at low wavelengths. The anomalies disappear on the addition of a dipolar aprotic solvent, and are absent for the ethyl ether derivative of the polymer, indicating a chiral hydrogen bonded structure is contributing to the optical activity. Investigation of the chiroptical properties of cellulosics by circular dichroism requires the presence of a suitable chromophore, either as a chain substituent or as an added dye. Congo red exhibits induced optical activity in dilute aqueous solutions of methylcellulose and cellulose oligomers, providing evidence for the presence of a helical conformation. CD spectra of two new biphenyl derivatives also exhibit exciton splitting characteristic of a helical arrangement of chromophores. Conformational dissymmetry is not indicated in spectra of cellulose acetate although the sign of carbonyl CD band is solvent dependent. The sign of this band is interpreted in terms of the orientation of the ester substituent relative to the anhydroglucose ring. Congo red, bound in cholesteric cellulose films prepared by the deacetylation of cellulose acetate cast from mesophase solution, shows induced optical activity which, in this case, reflects the cholesteric nature of the matrix. Similar results for cellulose gels regenerated from LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide solution indicate that cellulose adopts a supramolecular helicoidal arrangement on slow precipitation from solution. The optical properties of the thermotropic cholesteric liquid crystalline phase formed by a new cellulose derivative, (ethoxypropyl)cellulose, are examined by circular reflectivity measurements. The cholesteric reflection properties of mesophase solutions of cellulose acetate in trifluoroacetic acid are characterized. The polymer undergoes rapid trifluoroacetylation in this solvent and the presence of trifluoroacetate substituents alters the handedness and the magnitude of the pitch. Although the pitch is sensitive to the nature of achiral substituents, it is not influenced by the addition of chiral solvents.

Experimental characterizations of planar waveguide with respect to a wide range of fabrication conditions have been carried out, including detailed measurements of the refractive index anisotropy resulting from the large induced surface stresses. Parallel to this, the non-linear diffusion process of ion-exchange was simulated numerically to provide, along with the results of the characterizations, a complete description of the refractive index profile from any set of fabrication conditions. The magnitude of the maximum surface index change observed was shown theoretically to be almost entirely due to the induced stress at the surface of the substrate, arising from the presence of the larger potassium ions. Finally, a novel class of single-mode channel waveguides, made by a "two-step" ion-exchange was analyzed. A simple model for these waveguides was developed and used in the design of two directional coupler structures which were fabricated and measured. The two-step process was conceived because it relaxes waveguides' dimensional control, yielding single-mode guides of larger size, better suited for low-loss connections to optical fibers. It also provides an additional degree of freedom to adjust device properties.</description><creator>Albert, Jacques</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Refractory materials -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Optical wave guides -- Design and construction.</subject><subject>Directional couplers -- Design.</subject><title>Characterizations and design of planar optical waveguides and directional couplers by two-step K+ -Na+ ion-exchange in glass</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430547m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg11x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn009z53g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis undertakes a critique of Canada's Stratford Festival as an institutional site of theatre production in the years 1953 through 1967. I propose to identify the major recurring "statements" of the institutional discourse; those statements which were circulated through various printed documents, including commentaries on the Festival and its work and the Festival's public relations material. The exercise of critique reveals that the Festival discourse became a hegemonic discourse, circulating a set of normative and prescriptive understandings as to what should constitute theatre and culture for Canada. The ideology dominating the discourse was that identified by Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno by the term the "culture industry." This ideology allowed for the autonomy of the Festival's productions to be eliminated, such that they functioned as commodities in which all capacity for critique has been abrogated. It will be shown that the Festival discourse privileged an aesthetic of spectacle and effect throughout these years, an aesthetic which implied a concept of cultural experiences as passive spectatorship and the easy consumption of effects; in short as commodity. In conjunction with this aesthetic, the discourse registered a concept of culture as affirmative--as an experience which affirms existing social relations in offering an apparent, if false, resolution or catharsis of conflict and of social inequality. When the Festival was identified as proof of Canada's cultural maturity and the focus of the nation's "life of the mind" these values were established as the nation's dominant cultural values. Moreover, this discursive portrayal of the Festival established it as Canada's foremost cultural commodity. And so the discourse simultaneously conveyed a concept of culture and of the Festival as commodities. By the 1960's the Festival was being identified as not simply a leading voice in Canadian culture, but as the institution on which the development of Canadian culture depended, thereby positioning the Festival as hegemonic. The Festival discourse thus articulated the Festival's central duality, its capacity to function as both cultural commodity and authority. The position of the Festival and its discourse as cultural authority ensured that it was the Festival concept of affirmative culture, marked by the displacement of the political, philosophical and existential role of culture, which dominated the discourse on theatre and the wider discourse of Canadian culture. In this respect the Festival failed to offer an active-critical experience which would counter the tendency towards the ethos of spectatorship and passivity which followed from the developing mass media.</description><creator>Groome, Margaret E.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Theater -- Canada -- History</subject><title>Canada's Stratford Festival 1953--1967 : Hegemony, commodity, institution</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hg12h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z53g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ns064670p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Patients with unilateral temporal- or frontal-lobe excisions and normal control subjects were tested on four kinesthetic and two visual recall tasks. The first two studies required subjects to monitor peripheral feedback, in order to duplicate the distance or the end-position of examiner-defined arm movements. In the next two tasks, the subjects selected the movements to be recalled, and hence reliance on feedback was reduced. On the visual tests the subjects had to recall the distance traversed by a dot on a screen, or its end-position. Temporal lobectomy did not interfere with performance of the tasks, except for examiner-defined kinesthetic location. On this task, large left- or right-hippocampal resection produced an impairment following 30 s of counting. Patients with left frontal-lobe or small right frontal-lobe excisions performed normally on all tests, whereas those with large right frontal-lobe removals were impaired with both hands on the examiner-defined kinesthetic tasks. Patients with large right frontal-lobe lesions also demonstrated a delayed-recall deficit for visual distance. The results point to an important role played by the right frontal lobe in the monitoring of kinesthetic feedback both during the presentation of the movements and during the recall attempt.</description><creator>Leonard, Thomas Gabriel</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><title>The role of the frontal lobes in the encoding and recall of kinesthetic information /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kt51r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064670p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mq42b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation deals with the organized commuting of native labour in northern Saskatchewan, it causes, and the economic consequences for the communities involved. A neo-marxist approach is used towards those objectives. The search for explanations is carried out through the analysis of the scenario of implementation of the commuting programs: the role of Capital, the initiator of the programs, is examined in the light of its imperatives (accumulation, legitimation); State action is discussed with respect to its roles of integration, legitimation, support to accumulation, and that of a capitalist; the participation of the native people is seen from a perspective where their culture and social fabric have been altered, in spite of apparently strong idiosyncrasies. The consequences of participation in commuting, and of the revenues thereby brought to the communities, are consistent with already existing trends among northern native population: a decline of reciprocity; an assimilation to capitalist society (consumption and monetization); a local circulation of income which varies in importance from a place to another, but which everywhere favors exclusively the local bourgeoisie; the survival of subsistence economy; and the enhancement of dependence and economic vulnerability.</description><creator>Gagnon, Jean, 1953 Oct. 27-</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Commuting -- Saskatchewan -- Social aspects</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Saskatchewan -- Economic conditions</subject><subject>Community life</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Saskatchewan -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Indigenous labor</subject><title>Le navettage de travailleurs autochtones et sa portée économique pour les communautés du nord de la Saskatchewan /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429988v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq42b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fm19h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thin-layer flow-cell incorporated an array of 32 gold strip electrodes in a serial configuration opposite a platinum counter electrode. The cell body was made of Macor glass ceramic. A photolithographic procedure for etching the Macor and a simple method of applying a gold ink was devised. Resistive feedback current-to-voltage converters independently controlled the potential difference between the electrodes of the array and the common counter electrode. A microcomputer and a customized high speed data acquisition interface recorded the current response of each electrode. An expression for the faradaic response of a single electrode within a rectangular flow channel was modified to predict the behavior of the multi-electrode flow-cell. The quinone/hydroquinone redox system was used to evaluate the performance of the detector. Summing the signals from the array when all electrodes were held at the same potential improved the signal-to-noise ratio. Hydrodynamic curves were reconstructed from the currents measured at each electrode when a ramp potential profile was applied to the array.</description><creator>DeAbreu, Michael Paul</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Voltammetry -- Computer simulation</subject><subject>Electrochemical apparatus -- Design and construction</subject><subject>Potentiostat -- Design and construction -- Evaluation</subject><title>The development of a microcomputer controlled multielectrode potentiostat and a 32-electrode thin-layer flow-cell /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vk719.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm19h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vc042</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Anthropological classics such as E. H. Man's On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands (1883) and A. R. Radcliffe-Brown's The Andaman Islanders (1922) are generally regarded as products of an emergent nineteenth century social science. These anthropological classics were accepted by contemporaries as authoritative statements in their authors' fields of competence, and the ethnographic 'pictures' of the aborigines they presented were accepted as accurate descriptions of indigenous life. The following thesis argues for an alternative approach to the history of the production of anthropological knowledge. It begins by exploring the gradual codification of observational practices in the nineteenth century British anthropology. The codification of ethnographic observation is examined in the case of anthropological manuals published between 1840 and 1892, and their methodological impact on the possibilities of data collection are discussed. Ethnographic observation is then approached from the point of view of media use, and the relationship between drawing and photography is discussed in relation to nineteenth century physical and cultural anthropology. The codification of ethnographic observation and the anthropological use of various representational media are the problematic for an intensive exploration of the production of anthropological knowledge in the Andaman Islands. The approach adopted focuses on unacknowledged strategies and marginalized knowledge which were nevertheless directly implicated in the production of ethnographic texts. Following this approach, the discipline of Anthropology comes to seem less an isolated intellectual activity, and more a residue of broad social, cultural, and political processes. Drawing on this perspective, the works of Man and Radcliffe-Brown on the Andaman Islanders are treated as the culmination of a history of representation that is built on and incorporates administrative strategies, representational media and s</description><creator>Tomas, David.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Ethnology -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century</subject><subject>Observation (Psychology)</subject><subject>Ethnology -- Methodology</subject><title>An ethnography of the eye : authority, observation and photography in the context of British anthropology 1839-1900</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d29s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vc042</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):36225</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
