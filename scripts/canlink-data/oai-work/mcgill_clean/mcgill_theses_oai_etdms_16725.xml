The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is made asymmetrical with respect to the direction of incidence or the beam and the resulting polarization computed. Only one parameter is used to fit the curves to the experimental results. Coulomb interference is taken into account but transparency properties are neglected. The positions of the maxima and minima are well predicted but due to the transparency in many cases the magnitude of polarization is not in the right range. The existing experimental results of scattering on carbon are analyzed in detail showing the importance of the separation or elastic from inelastic scattering.</description><creator>Felvinci, John.

Is there an effective procedure which will enable us to decide, for any sentence of the theory, whether or not the sentence is valid in that theory? This is referred to as the decision problem for that theory. If it is answered in the affirmative we say that the theory is decidable. If the answer is negative, then we say that the theory is undecidable.

To fulfil this function the cost accountant has to adapt his thinking and methods to reflect the underlying economic conditions and abandon his stock-in-trade of conventional ideas.

With the isolation during the present century of other naturally occurring phosphate esters, it has become apparent that phosphorylated compounds are invariably associated with the production of chemical energy.</description><creator>Ellis, Daniel.

Sometimes, the nucleus resulting after decay will be left in a metastable state and will lose its excitation energy by emitting a multipole radiation. If the excited state has a measurable half-life (&gt;10^-11sec.), the nuclear metastable state is called a nuclear isomer.

The withdrawal can be triggered off by a variety of stimuli: sudden reduction in light intensity; shock waves in the water; tactile stimuli. The withdrawal in response to a reduction in light intensity is usually referred to as the "Shadow reflex". Similar reactions are present in other closely related Polychaete families. The rapidity of the withdrawal is made possible by the rapid transmission of nerve impulses from the receptive regions of the body to the contracting muscles by the giant axons present in the central nervous system.</description><creator>Downer, Peter.

Although she stated that Makarenko’s educational thought is “indissolubly interwoven into the economic structure of the socialist society and reflects its ideology,” she nevertheless maintained that Makarenko’s teachings could very profitably be put to use by Western “educators and parents of good will,” who are sincerely desirous of creating a sane and happy childhood for the youth of today.</description><creator>Dorotich, Daniel.</creator><contributor>Munroe, D.

Their specialisation as forage consumers is dependent on the capacious nature of a portion of their digestive tract (rumen), and the microorganisms living in a symbiotic relationship within this organ. It is these microflora and microfauna which are the actual converters of the cellulosic forage components into nutrients which can be absorbed and utilized by the host animal.</description><creator>Donefer, Eugene.</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.

Since rocks have finite conductivities it follows that a definite quantity of heat travels upwards through the crust. This quantity of heat flowing up across unit area of surface in unit time is called the terrestial heat flow. The amount of this heat flow and the areal distribution of these values have an important bearing on a number of problems involving the physical nature of the earth and its history. Unfortunately, relatively few measurements of the heat flow have been made.</description><creator>Doig, Ronald. P.</creator><contributor>Saull, V.

The corresponding problem of general extensions in groups, although studied quite extensively, has not yet reached that point. The aim of the present thesis is to generalise some of the results obtained in the case of normal extensions to the general case. It was proved by Baer [1] that the cosets of a group H modulo an arbitrary subgroup G can be given a structure called a mixed group.</description><creator>Dixon, John.

The air was injected through a wall of 41.4 per cent porosity at varying rates into the main stream, whose temperature varied from 580 to 1000°rt and whose velocity ranged from 60 tc 110ft./sec. The internal heat transfer coefficient per unit volume of porous wall, and the combined thermal conductivity of the matrix and the coolant were determined. The film heat transfer coefficient through turbulent boundary layer with coolant injection was calculated. A qualitative analysis of the boundary-layer temperature and velocity profiles was made. An investigation of the pressure drop through porous bronze plugs was made.</description><creator>Diakunchak, Ihor. S.</creator><contributor>Stachiewicz, J.

A theory for the determination of the dispersion characteristics of these structures has been outlined. Various methods for modifying the characteristics of a slow wave structure to suit travelling wave maser applications are also discussed. Propagation along open comb and meander line structures was studied in the L band. A method was developed for the direct measurement of group velocity. Experimental results indicated that both the modified comb and meander line structures could be used in travelling wave maser circuits in conjunction with solenoids.</description><creator>Desai, Rajni.

Roundness indices based on visual recognition and counting of four grain types were used to study sands from the Alfold in Hungary and the Great Sand Hills in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan sand showed a significant increase in roundness within about five miles. All the sands in the sand plateau of the Alfold are eolian and increase in roundness with the distance from their source (the Duna (Danube) Valley).</description><creator>David, Peter.

Its foundations have so far not been fully investigated. There are, perhaps, many such branches of mathematics, but the calculus of probability is unique among them regarding the specific course of the development of its fundamental principles. This is bound up with what H. Steinhaus calls the “tavern” origin of probability. A theory of gambling games at first, it gradually extended its range of applicability, becoming finally a mathematical theory of great practical and theoretical importance.</description><creator>Csorgo, Miklos.</creator><contributor>Waugh, W.

He showed that amount of exploration decreases over successive trials (Montgomery, 1951). A review of more recent work by Berlyne and Slater (1957) indicates that there have been few advances in the understanding of the determinants of exploration since then. It is likely that this slow rate of progress is related to a common limitation in the treatment of data obtained with exploratory tests.</description><creator>Craig, Richard.
