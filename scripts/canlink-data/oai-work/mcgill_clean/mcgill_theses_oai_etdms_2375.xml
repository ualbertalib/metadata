Earliest Famennian clastics of the Sassenach Formation directly overlie the Ronde and this contact forms the Frasnian/Famennian boundary. Sampling for conodont biostratigraphy in three sections indicates that the Arcs and Ronde are Upper rhenana in age. Arcs, Ronde, and Sassenach strata were deposited on a gently sloping carbonate ramp to platform ranging from shallow subtidal to peritidal depositional environments. Argillaceous limestones and shales are the dominate lithotype of the Mount Hawk Formation. Shallow subtidal limestones consisting of floatstones and rudstones interbedded with packstones and wackestones comprise most of the Arcs Member. Arcs strata consist of at least 4 depositional cycles and represent a shallowing upward sequence from outer shallow slope fossiliferous limestones to back reef lagoonal grainstones. Two previously undocumented Arcs patch reefs were described, the limestone Brule reef or bank in the southern Boule Range and the dolomitized Moosehorn reef in the central region of the Bosche Range. The Ronde Member is comprised of shallow subtidal limestones and siltstones with intertidal silty limestones occurring less frequently and predominately at the top. The Ronde consists of two carbonate shallowing upward cycles. FA 6 A intertidal limestones and fine grained sandstones comprise the Sassenach Formation which consists of two main depositional cycles and ranges from 20 m thick in the Bosche Range to less than 5 m thick in the Boule Range.

Views, including recursive views, are also implemented. Support for nested relations is accomplished by means of four mechanisms. The first is the introduction of new syntax for the declarations of nested attributes and relations, the initialization of nested relations, and for nested updates. The second is the integration of relational expressions into domain expressions so that relational operations can be applied to nested attributes. The third is the definition of order among relations so that relation-valued attributes are treated the same way as attributes of primitive type such as integer and string. The fourth is to use a set of flat relations which are linked to each other by surrogates, to model a nested relation. With these mechanisms, our implementation provides uniform syntax and notation for the relational algebra and the domain algebra of nested relations. The Java programming language is used for the implementation. Therefore, it runs on any platform that supports the Java runtime environment.</description><creator>Hao, Biao.</creator><contributor>Merrett, Tim (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Implementation of the nested relational algebra in Java</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm58s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj1394144</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h415pc67p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Arid and semi-arid countries are facing the exhaustion of their water resources and are being forced to use saline water (brackish groundwater and drainage water) for irrigated agriculture. The result is often disastrous as extensive productive regions become salinized. Nevertheless, there is potential to expand irrigated agriculture through the increasing use of saline waters for irrigation. This study presents an analysis of the performance of a transient state, model for numerical simulation of water and solute transport, known as LEACHM-C. It is assessed for areas where saline water may be an option for crop production. The model estimates the salt and water balance of a soil profile given certain irrigation and crop rotation strategies. First, the predictive capability of the model was successfully tested using one year of data from a field experiment in a dry region of India. Second, potential usefulness of the LEACHM-C model as a tool in the planning of reclamation activities was examined for a semi-arid basin in Syria.

The dye was functionalized with alkoxysilane moieties to anchor it covalently into the silicate network. Co-condensation with the organically modified silicon alkoxide methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), gave transparent high-quality films that could be deposited up to 10 microns thick in one step. Corona poling was used during thermal curing to align the chromophores in a noncentrosymmetric fashion for second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) effects. The structure-property relationships of the sol-gel derived glasses were investigated by FT-IR, UV-vis, TGA, DSC and solid state 29Si NMR. From a poled and cured sample containing 0.5% (w/w) of the dye, we measure r13 = 2.2 +/- 0.4 pm/V. We also report on the simulation of artificial thin films using cellular automata. We show for a one parameter automaton that well-defined empirical mapping relationships exist between the rule table and surface physics like roughness. In addition, we report on similar results obtained for a stochastic automaton using neural networks to map between automaton space and surface parameters.</description><creator>Gurney, James A.</creator><contributor>Andrews, M.

Precursors to anions in the form of alcohol and amine adducts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron [RR'XH·B(C6F5)3] (where R, R'= H, alkyl, aryl; X = O, N) were synthesised and reacted with dimethylzirconocene (DMZ), leading to the formation of an active cationic catalyst [Cp2ZrMe]+[RXB(C6 F5)3]-. The results of propylene polymerisation with the simple, achiral [Cp2ZrMe]+[PhNHB(C 6F5)3]- system yielded a lower molecular weight polypropylene compared to the well-known [Cp2 ZrMe]+MeB(C6F5)3] - system, implying tight ion association during polymerisation. Formation of amine-substituted borates was attempted by reacting various lithium amides with B(C6F5)3. Reaction of N-perfluorophenyl-substituted amides with two equivalents of B(C 6F5,)3 led to the clean formation of LiB(C 6F5)4 and R(C6F5)NB(C 6F5)2 (where R = CH2Ph, CH(CH 3)Ph). This offers a new method to synthesise novel chiral Lewis acids such as (alpha-C6H5CH(CH3)(C6F 5)NB(C6F5)2.</description><creator>Guillemette, Virginie.</creator><contributor>Arndtsen, Bruce A.

However, by 10--12 months of age, infants' discrimination performance becomes more like that of adults in that they show difficulty discriminating non-native, but not native phonetic contrasts. In the present study, infants (6- to 8- and 10- to 12-months-old) and adults from two language environments (French and English) were compared on their perception of two English stop-fricative contrasts, /b - v/ and /d - th /. The present findings show trends that replicate patterns of results observed in previous developmental cross-language studies, supporting the conclusion that phonetic perception shifts from a language-general to a language-specific direction within the first year of life. The findings illustrate the benefits of conducting direct language comparisons and using similar test procedures across different age groups when studying speech perception development.</description><creator>Colantonio, Connie.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Psychology, Developmental.</subject><subject>Language, Linguistics.</subject><title>Developmental patterns in speech perception : a cross-language comparison of French and English subjects</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t71g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fn841</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d221w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the treatment of Parkinson's disease some cases require the ablation of a specific region in the basal ganglia. The accurate localization of this region inside the patient's brain is essential and because direct visual anatomical information for such deep brain structures is not available, the surgeon has to rely on other sources of information such as MRI, CT and x-ray of the patient's brain. However these imaging techniques do not provide sufficient anatomical information, requiring the use of a subcortical brain atlas book to assist in the localization of the different structures. This way of proceeding is cumbersome and results in a certain lack of accuracy in the localization of the different brain structures. We developed a method that aids the surgeon to obtain the sufficient anatomical information in a simpler and more accurate manner. We provide him with a segmentation of the patient's MRI scan based on the Schaltenbrand and Wahren subcortical atlas. To achieve such segmentation a volumetric version of the atlas was obtained and was then mapped to a model brain MRI using landmark matching. Using an automated tool for the three-dimensional registration of two MRI volumes the deformation transformation between the model brain MRI and the patient's brain MRI was obtained. By applying this same transformation to the volumetric atlas, we obtain a superposition of a volumetric subcortical atlas onto the MRI of the patient's brain in the stereotactic space. This method results in a more accurate localization of the surgical lesion, thus reducing the number of additional interventions which are often necessary when the results of the first procedure are shown to be unsatisfactory. The whole guidance system is now used routinely at the Montreal Neurological Institute and is part of the standard surgical procedure.</description><creator>Clonda, Diego.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Automatic thalamic labeling for image guided neurosurgery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w454h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d221w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kv994</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Computer methods have proven very useful in many medical imaging studies and applications. The advantages of using computers for the analysis of the images of different modalities have raised the interest of researchers from different fields of science and medicine. An image analysis application which aims to quantify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lession in human brains based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been developed. In this thesis, image analysis based on statistical theory applied in medical imaging studies is reviewed. A three-dimensional method has been developed to compare the classification probability distribution of two groups of subjects. Using random field theory, regional difference of two three-dimensional classification probability maps is assessed statistically. The method can be applied to the comparison of probability distributions of multiple sclerosis lesion in human brains under different conditions. The sensitivity of the method is presented, and it is shown that the method can effectively and reliably detect the regional difference between two populations. In addition, a novel algorithm is introduced to automatically register a T 2-weighted MRI into a T1-weighted MRI acquired from the same human brain.</description><creator>Chui, Hing Cheung.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Three dimensional registration and voxel-based analysis in magnetic resonance imaging</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r315h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv994</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jt449</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A potential vorticity (PV) analysis is performed using a 60-h simulation of a family of mesoscale frontal cyclones which occurred over the Western Atlantic ocean from 0000 UTC 13 to 1200 UTC 15 March 1992. The frontal cyclogenesis events were characterized by an upper-level ring of PV anomalies of stratospheric origin, located on the cyclonic side of the jet stream. The shape of the "PV ring" resembled the tracks of the surface frontal cyclones, implying its role in determining the initiation and the tracks of the surface cyclones. Piecewise PV inversions indicate that low-level baroclinicity contributed most to the intensity of two of the frontal cyclones, followed by low-level latent heating, and upper-level PV anomalies (trough/ridge system). The upper-level PV anomalies contributed most to the depth of a third frontal cyclone. The major frontal cyclone (MFC), underwent explosive deepening (27 hPa in 24 h) and eventually absorbed the low-level circulation of the parent cyclone. The explosive deepening of the MFC can be attributed to the phase-locking between the upper-level and low-level PV anomalies. A series of full physics sensitivity experiments is performed to test the impact of removing upper-level PV anomalies on the development of the MFC. It is found that the delay in the genesis of the MFC, as well as weakening in its final intensity, is directly related to the proximity of the removed upstream PV anomaly. In another series of "dry" experiment with the removal of upper-level positive PV anomalies, the model fails to generate the MFC when the upstream PV anomaly closest to the pre-MFC is removed. From the results of piecewise PV inversion and sensitivity experiments, low-level thermal advection induced by the flow of the upper-level PV ring appears to initiate and sustain the development of the MFC.

In rats sacrificed 4--11 days post injection, diI-labelled mononuclear cells were detected in cell preparations from the hemisphere ipsilateral and, to a lesser extent, contralateral to the injection site. No extravasation of cells from the blood to the brain was detected in rats injected intracerebrally with saline. By immunohistochemistry, many macrophages were detected in the hemisphere ipsilateral to injection of Corynebacterium paryum. In additional experiments, the dissociated CNS cell population was labelled with OX-42 antibodies to the type 3 complement receptor which is present on monocytes but not lymphocytes. Some cells in the brain were labelled with both diI and OX-42 and therefore were identified as monocytes that had entered the brain from the blood.

Visual censuses, experimental trapping, habitat measurements and tagging were performed at 10 sites on two nearly contiguous fringing coral reefs at the northern edge of the Barbados Marine Reserve and at 10 sites on the two fringing reefs closest to the boundary in the non-reserve. The visual censuses showed that overall density and size of fishes large enough to be caught in Antillean fish traps were higher on reserve reefs than on non-reserve reefs. The differences in density and size varied considerably among species and were not statistically significant for individual species. In contrast to a previous study, experimental trap catches were not higher in the reserve than in the non-reserve. Visual censuses, trap catches, and their ratio (trappability) were affected by habitat variables. Species mobility, estimated by the maximum distance between locations at which an individual was captured, corrected for the sampling effort at that distance, was highly variable among species (medians 0--116m). For the more mobile species, movements within fringing reefs and between the nearly contiguous reserve reefs was high but extremely rare among reefs separated by expanses of sand and rubble. For this discrete fringing reef system, there is no evidence that movement across the reserve boundary influences the relative density or size of fish between the reserve and non-reserve.</description><creator>Chapman, Matthew R.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Coral reef fishes -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Marine parks and reserves -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Fish populations -- Barbados.</subject><title>Coral reef fish movements and the effectiveness of the Barbados Marine Reserve</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t424k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967587c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r967588n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cytokines are known to be involved in mastitis, yet their production by bovine epithelial cells has so far not been reported. In this research a bovine mammary alveolar cell line (MAC-T) was used as a simplified model for mammary glands. Cultured MAC-T cells were stimulated with 1, 10 and 20 mug/ml of a bacterial cell wall component (lipopolysaccharide) to verify the production of epithelially derived bovine cytokines. Cytokine mRNA production was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using RNA samples isolated during the first 24 hrs of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Interleukin-1alpha/beta, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 mRNA production seemed to be time and dose dependent. Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR products confirmed the identity of the cytokines. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for interleukin-1 and interleukin-8 showed that the respective mRNA's were translated into proteins. Interleukin-8 protein was detectable 6 hrs after lipopolysaccharide stimulation; maximal levels of approximately 55 pg/ml were reached at 48 hrs post stimulation. Interleukin-1 was detected 1hr after stimulation; concentrations peaked between 500 and 600 pg/ml at 2, 5 and 12 hrs for 20, 10 and 1 mug/ml of lipopolysaccharide respectively. The amount of protein produced by the MAC-T cell line was relatively low and required high concentrations of lipopolysaccharide. Nevertheless, this model demonstrated a time and dose dependent cytokine production.

Growth charts of supplemented (n = 362) and control (n = 410) children were summarized by the intercept and slope from the regression of individual weight measurements on age. The 2 groups were stratified by gender, ethnicity (Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese), and age intervals 0--6, 6--24, and 24--30 months which corresponded to pre, during, and post supplementation periods, respectively. Supplemented Indo-Guyanese girls gained significantly (p &lt; 0.001) more weight than their controls: the difference being approximately 40 grams per month. No other differences were observed in the other gender/ethnic groups. Contextual information collected in a sub-sample of 60 mothers/caregivers of beneficiaries revealed that the supplement was mainly consumed with porridge, and tended to be shared more in the Afro-Guyanese than in Indo-Guyanese households. Over 90% of the beneficiaries were satisfied with the programme and wanted it to continue while 74% stated that it was of financial benefit. For future programmes, the use of locally produced infant cereal was recommended.</description><creator>Chan, Susan Deborah.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Infants -- Guyana -- Growth.</subject><subject>Infants -- Guyana -- Weight.</subject><subject>Dried milk.</subject><subject>Infants -- Nutrition -- Guyana.</subject><title>Impact evaluation of a milk supplementation programme on weight of children 6-24 months of age in Guyana, South America</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nd261.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zz71z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451k76r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effects of food availability and selective control of late instar larvae of Aedes aegypti on preimago population structure, mortality, adult abundance, sex ratios, and size of females were examined. Food availability i an important factor in determining preimago population structure and mortality. At optimal food availability more adults emerged, females were larger and in higher proportions than at suboptimal food availability. The effects of selective control on preimago population structure and post treatment larval mortality differed with food availability. At suboptimal food availability the type of control applied had a significant effect. Simulated pathogen-induced mortality resulted in a shift of the population to late instars and temporarily reduced density dependent mortality. The findings suggest that although both pathogens and predators reduce intraspecific competition by directly killing competitors, pathogens also provide an influx of food. Compensatory mortality may result from a reduction of intraspecific competition caused by biocontrol agents.</description><creator>Cermark, Paul M.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Plagiorchiidae.</subject><subject>Aedes aegypti -- Larvae.</subject><subject>Aedes aegypti -- Food.</subject><subject>Aedes aegypti -- Parasites.</subject><title>Aedes aegypti population dynamics : the effects of food availability and experimentally induced mortality of late instar larvae</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn874.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451k76r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr172039w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to determine the timing and extent of gains in strength, mobility, balance and functional status that follow a high-intensity strengthening program offered to two groups of institutionalized elderly subjects. Thirty two subjects were randomly selected and classified as a person with a HIGH or LOW mobility based on the timed "Up and Go" (TUG) score (&lt;20 sec or ≥20 sec respectively). The hypothesis was that the exercise regimen would have a greater impact on the LOW mobility group as compared to the HIGH mobility group. Dynamic strength, mobility, balance and functional level were evaluated by the one repetition maximum (IRM), TUG and average walking speed, Berg balance scale and the Physiotherapy Clinical Outcomes Variables (COVS) respectively. Following the 12 week intervention, strength increased in both the LOW and HIGH mobility group (121% and 81% respectively; p &lt; 0.05), whereas balance improved only in the LOW mobility group (49%, p &lt; 0.05). The mobility and functional level of the subjects did not change in either group. In conclusion, the high-intensity strength training was found to have a larger impact on the strength and balance of the LOW mobility group. However, in view of the small sample size and the presence of comorbidity the 12 week program failed to bring about gains in mobility or function.</description><creator>Ardman, Orly.</creator><contributor>St.-Pierre, Diane (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><title>The effects of strength training on strength, mobility and balance in two groups of institutionalized elderly subjects /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf77s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr172039w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720g09z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A climatology of high wind events (HWEs) affecting Sable Island (44°N, 60°W) and Halifax (44.5°N, 63.5°W) was constructed for the period 1979--1995. We then focussed on HWEs at Sable Island in more detail because of their high frequency relative to Halifax. Events were stratified into four groups based on the direction of the peak speed: NE (1°--90°), SE (91°--180°), SW (181°--270°), and NW (271°--360°). Synoptic structures and statistically significant atmospheric anomalies were identified in composites for each group. More detailed structures were found in composites constructed with the aid of a cluster analysis. NW HWEs were associated with rapidly deepening marine cyclones and lacked clear atmospheric predecessors. NE HWEs were linked to a slow moving offshore cyclone and prominent anticyclone near Labrador. An anomalously weak Icelandic Low was a dominant precursor signal and an important feature found in each of the groups. SE HWEs were related to the strong pressure gradient between a cyclone-anticyclone couplet. The anticyclone was evident four days before the HWE and played a crucial role in the development of the cyclone. SW HWEs were related to a variety of cyclone types, but were typically related to a low-frequency cold surge over eastern North America. The storms most difficult to predict may be NW HWEs, since they lack clear atmospheric precursor signals. They are also among the most dangerous storms affecting Atlantic Canada, since they move and develop rapidly, and have some of the highest wind speeds.</description><creator>Allan, Shawn S.</creator><contributor>Gyakum, John R.

The tested growth parameters, Mg and Ca content, and K+/Na + ratios in the laminae and the roots were negatively affected as [NaCl] increased. The salt stress was relatively severe on growth of RB plants whereas the salt-tolerant (S) variety was affected to a lesser extent. There were indications that Na in the plant may promote Na translocation. In both cultivars, 22Na was not distributed equally in all plant parts; the lower lamina accumulated the highest amount (216 and 183 DPM mg -1 FW) followed by stem (197 and 182), petioles (187 and 168), and the upper lamina (149 and 121) for RB and S, respectively. The salt resistance of S is associated not only with a superior capacity to accumulate high Na+ in the roots for osmotic adjustment, but also with resistance to Na movement to the shoot. The effect of [K] on plant growth showed two main characteristics. In non-saline media, increasing [K] enhanced growth of S, while RB showed optimum growth when the normal (20 mM) level was present in the MS medium. In saline media, elevating [K] alleviated the growth reduction of RB at low salinity, and S at both low and high salinity. This ameliorative effect of K may be attributed to the suppression of both Na+ uptake, and Na + translocation in the plant.</description><creator>Al-Hagdow, Moftah Moh.</creator><contributor>Barthakur, N.

The nebulizer of a conventional flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS) was modified to extend the range of metals amenable to on-line detection. The flow injection thermospray-FAAS (FI-TE-FAAS) interface provided efficient detection for a variety of less volatile elements (Co, Cr(III), Cr(VI), Fe, Ni, Mn and Al) present as ions in aqueous media or as complexes in the supercritical fluid (SC-CO2) carrier phase. The range of possible metal analytes that can be monitored has been increased over the nine elements (Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn) that could be detected with an all-silica interface. The acetylacetonate complexes offered considerable potential for metal detection in an SC-CO2 carrier phase.

Two new types of business agreements, which have been observed, are strategic contract-based alliances and strategic fuzzy alliances. While, contract-based alliances are new, in that firms are choosing non-traditional partners, strategic fuzzy alliances are quite unique as they involve trust. The aim of this thesis is to analyse these alliances and the role of trust in business-to-business relationships. This will be accomplished in two ways. First, using Shapiro et al.'s (1992) taxonomy of trust and a neo-classical framework, a theoretical model of governance choice involving strategic alliances is developed. Based on transaction theory, this model is then used to generate necessary and sufficient conditions for trust-based agreements and supports an empirical model. The second component of this paper is an empirical model testing the above theory. Using a survey of horticultural and pork processing firms, a multinomial logit model that explains governance choice is developed. Results indicate that: (1) strategic fuzzy alliances are less common than previously thought; (2) asset and contract-based alliances continue to be the alliances of choice; (3) firm behaviour, vis-a-vis strategic alliances is consistent with neo-classical notions of the firm; and (4) risk is a major determinant of governance choice.

This prediction of intake is learnt, i.e. based on the association of a food's sensory characteristics with some consequence(s) of ingesting it. Two pilot studies were conducted using male Sprague-Dawley rats in which (1) the ability of food texture to cue fasting duration was indicated by evidence of anticipatory satiety in the low-fat powder-long/paste-short group and in the high-fat paste-long/powder-short group and (2) the pattern of anticipatory satiety was seen only in the low-fat granules-long/powder-short group. In the main experiment (n = 9), anticipatory satiety was reached twice in the highfat powder-long/pellet-short group on days 16--23 (p ≤ 0.1) and once in the low-fat pellet-long group/powder-short on days 20--23 (p ≤ 0.1). The acquisition of texture-cued fasting-anticipatory satiety seems to depend upon high-energy density of the diet and the utilisation of textures which make it easier for the rats to eat.</description><creator>White, Jennifer.</creator><contributor>Thibault, Louise (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Food texture.</subject><subject>Rats -- Food.</subject><subject>Low-fat diet.</subject><title>Training in acquisition of texture-cued fasting-anticipatory satiety in rats using high- or low-fat diets</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892d13v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g9513</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c045r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nutritional and sociocultural significance of Canada Goose was documented through field research in Wemindji, Quebec and laboratory analyses (proximate composition, trace elements, fatty acids and heavy metals) at McGill University.

Corporations are increasingly free vis a vis is the state to set their own standards in fields as diverse as working conditions, environmental discharge and relations with aboriginal communities. At the same time, the power of organized labour to control corporate behaviour appears on the wane. The decline of the state and organized labour has left consumer pressure---backed by boycotts---as one of the few checks on corporate power. This thesis examines the boycott phenomenon and the common law reaction to this form of popular protest. Although drawing heavily on political, historical and sociological insights, ultimately the author proposes a common law response that does not deny the autonomous and apolitical nature of private law reasoning.</description><creator>Waters, Christopher P.

The paper identifies and describes four main trends currently affecting the aviation insurance industry: the globalization of aviation insurance and reinsurance undertakings, increased competition in aviation insurance sector, the liberalization of the European insurance market, and the evolution of the international and European air carriers liability regime. The implications of these trends for premium rates, and for insurance and reinsurance activities in general, are then assessed. This analysis indicates that the liberalization of the European insurance and reinsurance markets remains incomplete, given that certain essential aspects linked to the activities of insurance undertakings are not harmonized. This lack of consistency within the European regulatory regime is found to be a source of invisible barriers which hamper the effective application of the European freedoms of establishment and of providing services as established in the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore, the author identifies a potential for growing friction between the different international regulatory regimes governing air carriers liability. Looking to the future, the expected effects of the single European currency and the expansion of the WTO services disciplines is also examined. The author concludes that the effectiveness of traditional structures and organizations of insurance and reinsurance markets are being challenged by profound structural changes in the industry. In this context, the European liberalization could serve as a model for adapting to this changing environment on a regional level so as to benefit from the opportunities provided by competition and globalization.</description><creator>Vojtovic, Raphaële L.</creator><contributor>Milde, M.

The international community has agreed on those rules, ever since the appearance of the Warsaw Convention in 1929. Today, it would be chaotic for the air transport industry to operate without such a legal framework. In fact, the Warsaw instruments have been the pillars of harmonized international air transportation. However, the Warsaw System now faces a crisis, due to the fact that participants in the air transport industry consider the Warsaw Convention liability regime obsolete, inadequate and outdated. Both governments and air carriers have reacted against this obstacle by adopting unilateral actions in order to update the liability limits. Some of these unilateral actions have substantially increased the limits of liability; others have even considered their disappearance. In particular, IATA has recently adopted two agreements in which air carriers voluntarily waive the Warsaw Convention limits. At the same time, ICAO has presented for the approval of its Legal Committee, a draft text to modernize the Warsaw System. The intention of this proposal is to replace the Warsaw Convention with a new instrument that would modernize and harmonize the liability regime and other matters.</description><creator>Vasquez Marazzani, Claudia.</creator><contributor>Milde, M.

It is a sociological fact that many groups of minorities live in France and the gap between this reality and French law seems to be at the source of growing tensions. This study proposes to analyses the degree which international law can contribute to the evolution of France's position with regards to its minority groups. Since the end of the cold war, there have been significant developments of the international instruments relating to the rights of minorities. This fact notwithstanding, these instruments do not appear to have a direct impact on the French situation. An approach consisting of the development of the cultural fights, with the broader system of human rights, could contribute to augmenting the respect and protection of inter-states identities without challenging the universalist tradition to which France is particularly attached.</description><creator>Triboulet, Anne.</creator><contributor>Glenn, Patrick H.
