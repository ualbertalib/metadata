Based on a survey of the social, economic, religious and political activities of this sufi brotherhood and its involvement in the tribal system of the North Africa during the first three decades of this century, an attempt will be made to identify on the one hand the factors that contributed to the strength of its resistance to Italian invasion, and on the other, the elements that led to its failure. It is argued that its initial success in the resistance benefited from the network of the zawiyas where ikhwan from different tribes were integrated socially and economically in accordance with strong Islamic values. However, lack of military training and weapons, dependency on a prominent figure, competing ambitions within the Sanusi family and geographical distance ultimately weakened the resistance.</description><creator>Rahma, Awalia.</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric L.

Six texts are discussed: Pirandello's Il fu Mattia Pascal (1904), Quaderni di Serafino Gubbio operatore (1915), and Uno, nessuno e centomila (1925--6); and Frisch's Stiller (1954), Homo faber (1957), and Mein Name sei Gantenbein (1964). The comparison highlights the great similarities between Pirandello's and Frisch's treatment of the theme of identity as well as some important (and mainly structural) differences in their novelistic works. The analysis of the three pairs of novels shows the developments in narrative structure and the characteristic change of attitude towards the question of identity construction that took place from early-modernism to postmodernism.</description><creator>Remington, Rachel.</creator><contributor>Bauer, Karin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Pirandello, Luigi, 1867-1936 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Frisch, Max, 1911-1991 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Personal identity in the novels of Max Frisch and Luigi Pirandello</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f543t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n87d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10ws20t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis has explored two basic themes in post-Cold War international relations. The first is the transformation of the global and regional security environments leading to a projected decline in the importance of traditional realist-style security problems. The second is the supposed shift in state behavior with conflictual strategies giving way to accommodation. These presumed trends are explored in the context of Southeast Asia and, more specifically, China's security strategies and relations in the region. This study argues that conventional security problems have declined in Southeast Asia in the short term but still remain prominent. In terms of policies, while China's goals remained partly revisionist with regard to territorial issues and status/power relationships, its approaches became more accommodative in coping with disputed issues in the region. This was manifested above all in its gradual acceptance of a multilateral framework for dialogue on regional security issues and in its willingness to undertake some confidence building measures in the military area. This shift can be explained partly in terms of China's external political concerns at both the global and regional levels. The more fundamental explanation, however, lies in China's drive for economic modernization with an accommodative regional strategy intended to ensure the flow of external resources required for this purpose.</description><creator>Ma, Yansheng, 1956-</creator><contributor>Noble, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>ASEAN.</subject><subject>National security -- China.</subject><subject>Southeast Asia -- Foreign relations -- China.</subject><subject>National security -- Southeast Asia.</subject><subject>China -- Military policy.</subject><subject>China -- Foreign relations -- Southeast Asia</subject><title>Dynamics of regional (in)security in the post-cold war era : China and Southeast Asia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cz44n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws20t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tr198</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is broadly concerned with how individuals within German society, the German Resistance to Hitler and the German military reacted to persecution of Jews in Germany before the start of the Second World War and also to reports of German atrocities within German-controlled areas of Europe during the conflict. The specific focus of this study is an examination of the personal sentiments contained in the writings of Carl Goerdeler, Ulrich von Hassell and Helmuth von Moltke and the recorded reactions to the various and intensifying stages of Nazi persecution of Jews within German-controlled territory. These particular individuals were chosen, as a significant portion of their writings, in the form of diary entries, letters and memoranda have been published and offer a glimpse of personal sentiments and thoughts unaltered by the censors of the Nazi regime. In addition, this study examines the reactions of two German officers, Johannes Blaskowitz and Rudolf-Christoph von Gersdorff, to German atrocities committed in German-occupied Eastern Europe. Their reactions to and courageous protests against Nazi crimes are also a significant part of the overall context of German reactions to Nazi crimes.

The role that these various groups envision themselves having in this process was also investigated. Fifty-five subjects from the provinces of Quebec and Alberta responded to items on a written questionnaire. From within this subject pool, 19 subjects participated in a series of two interviews in order to gain further insight on various questionnaire items. Results demonstrated a moderate degree of similarity in responses from the stakeholder groups on numerous issues including the current status of music education programs, recommendations for future reform, and effective methods to enact such reforms. Results highlighted the need (a) to increase collaboration levels amongst all stakeholders involved in the process of music teacher training reform and (b) to better align the curriculum content of the university classroom with the needs of the teaching field.

Syed Nawab Haider Naqvi in Islam, Economics and Society (1994), presents an axiomatic approach to generating an Islamic economic theory from the ground up. Chapter one considers Naqvi's argument for a distinct Islamic economic system. Chapter two examines Naqvi's theoretical framework and the Islamic economic system which he derives from it. The chapter compares Naqvi's approach with that of M. Umer Chapra, who also adopts an ethical framework for the foundation of an Islamic economic theory. Chapter three examines the debate surrounding the definition of riba and the importance of riba in Islamic economics. This study concludes with a recommendation for a more systematic approach in interpreting the Qur'an, which is the source of Naqvi's economic axioms.</description><creator>Mapara, Shahina H.</creator><contributor>Turgay, U.

What is the nature of the local bourgeoisie? How capable is the state and how far does the East-Asian model of benevolent state autonomy apply to the case of Egypt? How has the adoption of economic liberalization affected business state relations? To address these questions, the industrial sector is analyzed as a case study. The approach adopted here is that of political economy and involves a comparison across the last three decades. Based on developments in the industrial policy, the distribution of private investment, the institutional environment and the structure of the manufacturing sector, the study demonstrates that state capacity in Egypt is low and the fundamental division among the bourgeoisie is size-based. The state's autonomy has not contributed to its ability to direct and undergo structural transformation. Further, its accommodation of the business sector has not been accompanied by private sector growth since discriminatory incentives favouring large enterprises and the prevalence of a system of 'crony capitalism', have impeded smaller firms from access to the available opportunities. Indeed, the leaders of the business power center, who contribute most to private investment, have been maneuvered by the state to support the political status quo.</description><creator>El Meehy, Asya.</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Industrial policy -- Egypt.</subject><subject>Egypt -- Economic conditions -- 1952-</subject><title>State, private industry and economic liberalization in Egypt</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vm88p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687k17t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4q77ft32r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis proposes to apply Queer theory as the framework for examining Michel Marc Bouchard's play Les Feluettes. This study is built around two methodological axes, one being the analysis of dialogue; the second, the application of Queer theory. Dialogue and staging are scrutinized in an effort to discover the Queer. The links between sex, power, language and knowledge will be specifically studied. The intention is to show how their relationship, based on opposition, can be modified by a subversive discourse. By way of introduction, a brief discussion of Queer theory will be presented to familiarize the reader with its origins, sources of inspiration and strategies of deconstruction. The first chapter will focus on the homosexual's interior monologue. Chapter two will focus on the homosexual's dialogue with other homosexuals. The third, and final chapter, will round out the analysis by studying the dialogue between the homosexual and heterosexuals.

Students in introductory undergraduate courses (English, psychology, education, engineering) had different levels of academic self-concept, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and the use of surface learning strategies. They did not differ however, in their subject motivation or their use of critical thinking or time management strategies. Course differences were found in how student academic self-concept and motivation related to their use of learning strategies, and in turn, how these variables predicted final course grades. Across disciplines, a higher-quality approach to the learning task, as emphasized by students and professors, related to academic achievement but in unexpected ways.

It studies a price leadership model as the one by D'Aspremont et al. (1983), where the dominant cartel acts as a leader by determining the market price, while the fringe behaves competitively. According to D'Aspremont et al.'s notion of cartel stability, a firm will not remain in a cartel as long as it prefers the outcome where it is the only member leaving the cartel for the fringe. Such an approach implies that the firm is myopic since it ignores whether its alternative is stable itself.

Before this landmark event, the study of accommodation as a security strategy hardly received its fair share of attention in international relations theories. This thesis attempts to add to the growing body of work on the dynamics of accommodation. Specifically, it analyzes accommodative moves of Pakistan vis-a-vis India, thereby studying the dynamics of accommodation in the context of developing states. Four cases are studied in depth: first, the Indus Waters Treaty (1960); second, the Tashkent Declaration (1966); third, Post-Brasstacks Accommodative Moves (1987); and finally, Post-1990 Accommodative Moves. This thesis argues that three factors are particularly important in the initiation of accommodation in the developing world, namely, (1) decision-makers' desire to minimize losses (in the external politico-military sphere, the internal economic sphere and the internal political sphere), (2) their commitment to serious domestic reforms and (3) the involvement of a powerful third party that exercises leverage over both adversaries.</description><creator>Bhatti, Haroon Haider.</creator><contributor>Noble, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>National security -- Developing countries.</subject><subject>National security -- Pakistan.</subject><subject>Pakistan -- Foreign relations -- India.</subject><subject>India -- Foreign relations -- Pakistan.</subject><subject>National security -- India.</subject><title>Pakistan's accommodative moves vis-à-vis India : a case study of the dynamics of accommodation in the developing world</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rn20h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh49c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225c896</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a comparative study of three spiritual female models recognized in the Islamic tradition: Maryam, the mother of `Isa, Khadija, the Prophet Muh&amp;dotbelow;ammad's first wife, and Fat&amp;dotbelow;ima, the Prophet's daughter. Although comparisons between these three women occur frequently in the Islamic literature of different periods, this research focuses on two works of the famous exegete and historian Abu Ja`far al-T&amp;dotbelow;abari (d. 310/923), i.e., Jami` al-Bayan `an Ta'wil al-Qur'an and Ta'rikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk . In the light of textual analysis of al-T&amp;dotbelow;abari's depiction of these three women, it appears that their images contribute towards the formation of an ideal type of the believing Muslim woman. Maryam, Khadija and Fat&amp;dotbelow;ima are consistently characterized by their obedience, motherhood and purity. This thesis analyzes al-T&amp;dotbelow;abari's comments on, and understanding of, each of these virtues. It also argues that the comparison between these three women, as found in al-T&amp;dotbelow;abari's works, serves a wider religious purpose. Paradoxically, Khadija's and Fat&amp;dotbelow;ima's comparison with Maryam allowed the early exegetes to establish Islam's continuity with respect to the existing monotheistic religions and, at the same time, to affirm its superiority over them.</description><creator>Bénard, Laure-Elina J.</creator><contributor>Turgay, U.

I make a feminist case for multiculturalism and argue for a relationship between the two which is positive- rather than zero-sum. The grounds for this case are those of women's agency in context. My concern is first and foremost with women as agents, situated in particular contexts, acting within multiple roles and thus enabled and constrained in multiple ways. I illustrate this concern by focusing on the agency of Muslim women in France and the "Affaire du Foulard". Consequently, my discussion takes place at two, interconnected levels: (1) The "general" debate over the relationship between multiculturalism and feminism, which is my primary focus; (2) The "particular" level of the "Affaire" and the "foulard" itself in the French context. At both levels, my central concern is women's agency. Feminism, I argue, must understand women as agents acting within multiple roles and thus constrained in multiple ways, as both vulnerable within cultural groups and members of these groups.

Much therefore depends on the workers' know how and skills to produce affordable and quality housing. In a country like India, where traditional home building technology is being fast replaced by building technology from the west, it is essential to know how and to what extent is this change imbibed by these producers of housing---the construction workers. How do people become construction workers? How and where do they learn and train? What are their sources of new technology? What are their systems and conditions of operation? These questions become significant if this resource has to be trained and deployed not only for improving quality of construction but also to actively involve them in the alleviation of the state of technology, diffusion of much needed technology innovations and development of a powerful and effective grass root level resource to upgrade the housing conditions of the country's poor. This dissertation pursues these issues with the aid of a study of skilled construction workers in the Pune region of India. It ends with a conceptual model to help overcome some drawbacks of the present system and points to other related issues that need immediate consideration in the interest of overall development of the home building industry.</description><creator>Dhongde, Sharvey.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Diffusion of innovations -- India -- Pune (District)</subject><subject>Construction workers -- India -- Pune (District)</subject><subject>Construction industry -- Employees -- Effect of technological innovations on -- India -- Pune (District)</subject><title>Technology and innovation diffusion : a workers' perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q608v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t106b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193b815</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The content of this thesis is two-fold. The first part takes the form of an essay while the second part presents a theoretical project for an architectural installation. Using these two modes as different ways to address similar issues, the present work proposes to question the instrumentalisation of geometry in today's architectural practice. The work of Lewis Carroll (Charles L. Dodgson) and, more specifically, his masterpiece, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, will be approached and interpreted in order to observe the participation of geometry---of Euclidean geometry---in our understanding of the notions of space and time, and to reveal their paradoxical aspect. The aim is to explore how geometry, language and nonsense bear intimate connections to our perception of space and time. Once revealed, these connections will enable us to address the following question: can architecture be comprehended and experienced as an event?</description><creator>Dionne, Caroline.</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Space and time in literature</subject><subject>Paradox in literature</subject><subject>Space (Architecture) -- Philosophy</subject><subject>Carroll, Lewis, 1832-1898.

With respect to trade in the global market, home manufacturers can greatly benefit by using E-commerce and digital networks to communicate with their foreign clients. The author proposes a software application to assist Canadian home prefabricators and manufacturers of building components to display their services and products in an interactive and electronic format. This tool would help these companies by increasing the size of their potential client base and the speed of their business interactions. The study concludes that specialised software to facilitate the export of prefabricated homes can easily take advantage of the Internet's speed and accessibility as a download or Website as well as be available on CD-ROM.</description><creator>Bilimoria, Cyrus M.</creator><contributor>Friedman, Avi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Prefabricated houses -- Canada -- Marketing -- Data processing.</subject><subject>Export marketing -- Canada -- Data processing.</subject><subject>Internet marketing.</subject><title>Use of computers and the internet to facilitate export of prefabricated housing from Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v743f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb23j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k4536</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This essay discusses Le Corbusier's Modulor through its appearance in the Poeme de l'angle droit. The Poeme reveals the architect's later thinking in a synthetic and precise way, offering precious help for its comprehension.

Less attention has been paid to social, economic, and political processes in Africa. The goal of this thesis is to explore perceptions of professionals from various disciplines working in different organizations and government institutions (N = 207) concerning the causes, effects, and solutions to child conscription in Africa. These professionals perceived that poverty, lack of educational resources, lack of community resources, economic hardships, dictates of international funders, corrupt governments, and unemployment were the major causes of child conscription into armed conflicts. With respect to the effects, the respondents perceived that physical and psychological issues, witnessing atrocities, and exposure to violence were the most important effects of participating in the armed conflicts. In order to prevent or stop further recruitment of children into armed conflicts, the professionals working in the field thought that more educational programs should be initiated, community resources should be mobilized, prevention programs should be established, employment and training opportunities programs should also be provided, strong international laws drafted, advocacy and empowerment promoted, support for families provided, and awareness campaigns facilitated. A striking result of this study is that professionals perceived counselling as a relatively unimportant solution to the problem of child conscription. Results are discussed in terms of the contrast between past research in the field, which has focused on individual-level effects and counselling solutions, and the societal-level effects, and solutions that professionals perceive are central to the problem.</description><creator>Atukoit-Malinga, Christine Grace.</creator><date>1999</date><subject>Child soldiers -- Africa.</subject><subject>Draft -- Africa.</subject><title>Child soldiers and child conscription into armed conflicts in Africa by Christine Grace Atukoit-Malinga.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m592d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h19g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920fz586</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There is an ongoing and polarizing discourse with respect to the impartiality of the criminal justice system in its transactions with visible minority populations. Much of the controversy centers on the cause of the controversy centers disproportionate number of minority youth cases in North America and the U.K. criminal justice systems. In Canada, there is a dearth of research into the overrepresentation of Black youths in the Young Offender System. An examination of Montreal's Young Offender court records from 1992--1998 (n = 1714) reveals that race is a strong predictor of charge (p &lt; .05) and disposition (p &lt; .0001), controlling for age, language and birthplace. The study further finds that Black youth are charged with more violent offenses and receive more restrictive dispositions. Impact and implications for youth, the criminal justice system and social work are discussed. Further research including socioeconomic factors and prior history is recommended.</description><creator>Johnson, Druscilla.</creator><contributor>Duder, Sydney (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Krane, Julia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>African American youth -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Criminals, Afro-American -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Juvenile delinquents -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Crime and race -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Examining the overrepresentation of black males in the young offender system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h370h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz586</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nn24v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In China, a standard of "relatively comfortable housing conditions" is set for the nation, but there is still a need for a parallel goal for outdoor spaces. So far, this issue has not received adequate attention from either the government or practitioners. The purpose of this study is to examine the space between buildings in Beijing's new housing developments. The space between buildings has been chosen as a starting point for this research because it covers largest amount of land and due to its close proximity to homes, it is closely related to people's daily lives. The quality of outdoor space is defined by a combination of factors. This study uses eight criteria to address the notion of quality: spatial hierarchy; usable space; safety and defense; health and comfort; privacy and territoriality; social contact; aesthetic appeal; and maintenance and administration. These correlated aspects are set as evaluation criteria for the six case studies included in this research. Data and analysis of case studies is used to arrive at conclusions for policy-making and further study.</description><creator>Li, Yue, 1968-</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>City planning -- China -- Beijing.</subject><subject>Housing -- China -- Beijing.</subject><subject>Housing -- China -- Beijing -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Space (Architecture) -- China -- Beijing -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Space between buildings in Beijing's new housing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t107m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn24v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jt075</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Juvenile prostitution is a social issue of major concern and controversy in our society. Research documenting high rates of violence, substance abuse, HIV risk-behaviour, and other such risks and problems have reinforced arguments to protect and prohibit youth from prostitution activity. However, presenting youths' experiences in prostitution as unidimensionally negative and deficiency-based potentially creates other important problems for youth, perhaps explaining criticisms of social services for being generally ineffective and, at times, aggravating youths' situations. Left out in these debates are often the voices of those who matter most, the youth. The present study has sought to hear and articulate youths' voices, suggesting that prostitution is a diverse and complex reality and that effective intervention begins with hearing voices and respecting choices. In-depth and semi-structured interviews were conducted for this study with ten street youth with experiences in prostitution as a minor and three key informants in youth protection.</description><creator>Morris, Jason.</creator><contributor>Krane, Julia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Street children -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Child prostitution -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Rethinking juvenile prostitution : insights from youths on the street</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dx29x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jt075</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht66s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A mass balance approach was used in an attempt to quantify nutrient flux to the nearshore at the West Coast, Barbados, W.I. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels of the groundwater at inland pumping stations and above beach margins, as well as in the water of the nearshore zone and approximately 2 km offshore, were obtained. Nearshore groundwater seepage rates and salinity data were also taken. This study attempted to use this raw data to estimate flushing rates, nutrient loading rates, and nutrient loss rates, to ultimately create a picture of the fate of nutrients as they travel in groundwater into the nearshore zone. Annual loading for the entire West Coast was calculated at 1.46 x 105 kg NO3---N for nitrogen and 1.19 x 103 kg PO4 3---P for phosphorus. Mean nutrient levels in groundwater above the beach margin were estimated at 969.83 muM for nitrogen and 3.63 muM for phosphorus. For nitrogen and phosphorus respectively, these levels were twice and three times higher than at the pumping stations farther inland; and there was also a fourfold and fivefold drop in nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, in the nearshore zone relative to this groundwater above the beach margin. This indicated that the dense coastal population at the West Coast was adding significant amounts of nutrient to groundwater after it had left the inland pumping stations. There were no patterns of gradation in nutrient concentrations detected within the immediate nearshore, making completion of an accurate mass balance impossible, though indicating that there was significant advection of submarine groundwater offshore, beyond the study zone. This may contribute to the poor health of West Coast reefs, where sewage and fertiliser leaching and runoff are suspected as the primary sources for nutrient input to submarine groundwater to the south and northern parts of the West Coast, respectively.</description><creator>Wellington, Christine.</creator><contributor>Rasmussen, Joseph (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Phosphorus cycle (Biogeochemistry) -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Marine pollution -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Mass budget (Geophysics)</subject><subject>Coastal zone management -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Nitrogen cycle -- Barbados.</subject><title>A nutrient mass balance for nitrogen and phosphorous for the nearshore water of the west coast of Barbados, W.I., July 1996 to May 1997 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f786s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht66s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cv87d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The prognosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) has improved markedly over recent decades, however, little research has focused on the improvement of SLE patient's quality of life. The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between disease activity, cumulative damage and self-reported quality of life in 54 patients with SLE. Disease activity was measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM-2) and cumulative damage by the Systemic Lupus International Cooperating Clinics/ACR damage index (DI). Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Euroqol (EQ-5D) self-report questionnaires. Multiple linear regression was used to identify significant predictors of patients' self reported health status. Cumulative damage was found to be associated with physical function, physical health and social functioning (SF-36); disease activity was found to have a significant association with general health (SF-36) and a weaker association on overall health status as evaluated through the 'thermometer' rating scale of the EQ-5D. Patients' ratings of ability with usual activities was strongly related to overall physical health (SF-36) as well as the physical functioning and general health subscales of the SF-36. In addition, patients' ratings of anxiety and depression were strongly related to overall mental health status (SF-36). In conclusion, physical health of SLE patients was associated with disease activity, disease damage, capacity for usual activity, and mobility.</description><creator>Wang, Chenchen, 1958-</creator><contributor>Mayo, Nancy E.

The climatology shows two main IPV sources, each being upstream of the two main centers of positive PV on the east coasts of North America and Asia. The results for the winters with a NAO (PNA) anomaly show, in particular, that the mean-winter IPV anomalies associated with these patterns also have upstream sources. The importance of the latter is not as clear as that of the continential sources that maintain the climatological centers. The mean-winter IPV advection that balances the IPV sources/sinks is composed of the advection by the time-mean flow and by the transient eddies (decomposed into high- and low-frequency components), where the former is the dominant component. The latter are found to produce a negative feedback in that they act to reduce the amplitude of the IPV anomaly. For the NAO anomaly, low-frequency transient advection is more important, while high-frequency transient advection is more statistically significant for the PNA anomaly. Both the high and low-frequency advection have comparable contributions in maintaining the climatological distribution of the stationary eddy IPV.</description><creator>Wang, Yuhui, 1970-</creator><contributor>Derome, Jacques (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Brunet, Gilbert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>The potential vorticity budget of mean winter anomalies /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v045c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tx03j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):38900</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
