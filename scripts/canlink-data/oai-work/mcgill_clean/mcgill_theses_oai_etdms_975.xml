Since acylation plays an important role in the protein-membrane interaction, CNP palmitoylation was further investigated. Seven cysteine residues in CNP were individually converted into serines and the palmitoylation was analyzed in either COS-7 cells or an in vitro acylation reaction. No single Cys to Ser mutation could reduce substantially the level of palmitoylation, which may indicate that the turnover of palmitate on CNP is high and that there are multiple palmitoylation sites. Immunostaining and subcellular fractionation showed that isoprenylation is the major factor to control the membrane association of CNP while palmitoylation may serve as a fine tuning mechanism. A double mutation of Cys 231 to Ser and Thr 374 to Pro greatly reduced CNPase activity and the level of palmitoylation. CNP was expressed in Sf9 cells and the mutant C397S was purified to near homogeneity. Since CNP contains several ATPase consensus motifs, we investigated in a preliminary way its ATPase/ATP-binding properties. CNP was affinity-photolabeled by $ lbrack alpha- sp{32}$P) 8-azido ATP in a specific and saturable way, although no apparent ATPase activity was detected. The binding of 8N3 ATP could be competed by ATP, GTP and CTP at different concentrations.</description><creator>Gao, Enoch N. (Enoch Nuo)</creator><contributor>Braun, Peter E.

There are two specific scales designed to assess neck pain. They have weaknesses and limited assessment. A Functional Cervical Scale (FCS) based on neck disorders disability was developed after literature review and consultation with patients and medical specialists. Thirty-two items were tested. Study design. Two hundred and ten patients with neck pain answered the FCS and other questionnaires on work, medication intake and quality of life. Another copy of the FCS was mailed to the subjects who had to return it in a pre-stamped envelope. Methods. Item selection analyses were done. Test-retest and internal consistency were calculated to assess reliability. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted and correlations with other measures of neck pain were calculated to assess construct validity. Results. Through item selection procedures, the number of items was reduced from 32 to 30. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for test-retest was 0.93 and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.97. Correlations for validity were good. Conclusion. FCS showed excellent reliability and good validity. The latter needs more assessment. The sensitivity to change should be estimated.</description><creator>Fortin, Luc, 1949-</creator><contributor>Esdaile, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><title>Functional cervical scale : a reliability and validity study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s447b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s4462</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r762w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:13:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Psychological mindedness refers to a person's ability to perceive relationships among thoughts, feelings, and action with the goal of learning the meanings and causes of his/her experiences and behavior. Psychological mindedness is clinically important because it influences the patient selection for and the efficacy of psychotherapy. Individuals who have difficulty symbolizing and resolving emotional conflict, and verbally expressing their emotions, are considered to lack psychological mindedness and are sometimes labelled "alexithymic." Culture also influences individual styles of emotional expression and the manner and extent to which feelings are labelled as such. Such cultural differences may be interpreted as differences in psychological mindedness. The present study examined cultural differences in styles of emotional expression and psychological mindedness by comparing two groups: Euro-Canadians and Cree Amerindians--a group that has been characterized as less verbally expressive or taciturn. In this study, 36 Cree and 36 Euro-Canadian subjects were given a verbal measure of alexithymia, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) and a pictorial measure, the Scored Archetypal Test-9 (SAT9), and measures of depressive and somatic symptomatology (the CES-D and SCL-90 Somatization Scale). Twelve subjects also received a standardized, qualitative art therapy measure, the Ulman Personality Assessment Procedure (UPAP).

These channels are formed from a family homologous proteins known as connexins (Cx). In the present study we studied connexin trafficking within the cell with particular emphasis on 1/ the mechanisms of gap junction formation and removal and on 2/ the early events associated with connexin biosynthesis. The mechanisms of gap junction formation and removal were studied by treating Normal Rat Kidney and BICR-MlR$ sb{ rm k}$ rat mammary tumour cells with ilimaquinone (IQ), a novel and reversible inhibitor of protein secretion. The effects of IQ treatment on Cx43 maturation and gap junction assembly were then examined. The events associated with biosynthesis were examined through localization of Cx32 messenger RNA to either free or membrane-bound polyribosomes in rat liver hepatocytes through Northern blot analysis. In these studies we observed that IQ inhibited gap junction formation without inhibiting trafficking of Cx43 to the cell surface. Upon removal of the drug, gap junction plaques reformed. We concluded that additional factors other than phosphorylation are necessary for Cx43 assembly into gap junctions and this process is independent of microtubules. Preliminary studies revealed Cx32 mRNA in populations of free and membrane-bound polyribosomes suggesting that Cx32 is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane both post- and co-translationally.</description><creator>Feldman, Paul Andrew</creator><contributor>Laird, Dale (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Connexin biosynthesis and ilimaquinone modulation of gap junction formation and removal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w439d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq20z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xn71m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:13:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous studies of modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of metal-plate/film portal detectors have been performed on limited combinations of front and back metal-plates. We report on these parameters for an extensive set of forty-nine front-back metal-plate combinations. The portal detector consists of a double emulsion RP (Kodak localization therapy) film placed between metal-plates: Al, Cu, brass and Pb of thicknesses varying from 0.30 to 4.80 mm. Radiation sources included a Theratron Co-60 unit, and a Varian Clinac-18 linear accelerator delivering a polyenergetic 10 MV X-ray spectrum. In terms of the absolute efficiency of the detectors, the best DQE is obtained with the detector consisting of a 1.75 mm Cu front plate and a 1.62 mm Al back plate for the Clinac-18, and with the detector consisting of a 0.95 mm Cu front plate and a 0.80 mm Cu or a 1.62 mm Al back plate for the Co-60 gamma ray source.</description><creator>Falco, Tony</creator><contributor>Fallone, B.

Event handlers are introduced as user defined procedures. An event is the procedure call by the system, triggered in our case by an update statement. Event handlers for the Relix (Relational database on UNIX) update statement have been implemented. These event handlers are of two types: the first type is that which runs before an update statement. The second type runs after an update statement. Also, event handlers have states. An event handler can be either active or inactive. Event handlers are executed when they are in the active state. Event handlers have the property of being "one-to-many", i.e. for a single event more than one event handler can be defined. Another property is non-determinism, i.e., event handlers are executed with no pre-specified order. In this thesis we present the design and implementation of event handlers in Relix. The mechanism that we introduced in Relix is equivalent to the EA model.</description><creator>El-Kays, Ahmad Ziad</creator><contributor>Merrett, T. H.

Static chambers, bubble traps, benthic chambers. piezometers, and water column and sediment profiles were used to determine the dynamics of CH$ sb4$ production, oxidation, storage, and emissions from a northern boreal beaver pond, as part of the Boreal Forest Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) from May 1 to September 15, 1994. Samples were analysed by gas chromatography, and isotopic analyses were performed by mass spectrometry. The mean flux of CH$ sb4$ from the beaver pond (155 and 320 mg CH$ sb4$ m$ sp{-2}$ d$ sp{-1}$ for vegetated and open water sites, respectively) was greater than the flux from most other northern boreal wetlands (Bubier et. al., 1995). CH$ sb4$ availability was primarily controlled by sediment temperature, and CH$ sb4$ transport was controlled by windspeed (diffusion) and atmospheric pressure (bubbles). Bubbles comprised 20 to 52% of the net annual flux comprising the remainder. A large difference in bubble flux was observed between open water (15.7 g CH$ sb4$ m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$) and vegetated sites (2.9 g CH$ sb4$ m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$), and isotopic analyses indicate that this difference is due, in part, to a difference in CH$ sb4$ production pathways between sites. Greater oxidation also reduced the CH$ sb4$ flux from shallow, vegetated sites. A preliminary CH$ sb4$ budget for the BOREAS northern study area indicates that beaver ponds contribute significantly (6% to 30%) to the regional CH$ sb4$ flux. The areal extent of beaver ponds needs to be determined for inclusion in regional and global CH$ sb4$ budgets.</description><creator>Dove, Alice E.</creator><contributor>Roulet, N. T.

This shows that the Peyer's patch cells are more responsive than the spleen to Giardia infection. Th2-type cytokines produced by Peyer's patch cells may play a protective role during the latent and acute phases. Th1-type cytokines may contribute to this production during the elimination phase. Cytokine production in response to Giardia extract in vitro was observed in mice immunized with this extract, but not in control mice. Therefore, Giardia antigen can induce cytokine production in vitro in a specific manner.</description><creator>Djamiatun, Kis</creator><contributor>Faubert, G. M.

The interface of the system should be "user friendly" and designed to minimize user work and errors. Visualization of the patient volume and dose calculation results should provide necessary formation without being confusing. A software module meeting these criteria has been implemented within the McGill Treatment Planning System (MPS). The MPS program is written in C code and compiled with CodeWarrior C/C++$ rm sp{TM}$ from MetroWerks Inc. The MPS program runs on the Apple Macintosh platform (either 68K or PowerPC series). This new software module permits dose calculation (modified Milan-Bentley method) and viewing of the patient volume in three dimensions. Patient anatomical data is acquired from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MRI) images. The accuracy of the dose calculation has been verified through comparison of the calculated results with water tank and film measurements.</description><creator>DeBlois, François</creator><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><title>Implementation of 3D external photon beam dosimetry for the McGill Treatment Planning System</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt83w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cs524</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p239q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:13:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Avalanche Photodiode (APD) is a compact and rugged device, with single photon detection capability and high quantum efficiency.

The vegetated marsh surface is composed of three major zones; the Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh, the Plantago maritima-dominated Middle marsh, and the Spartina patens-dominated high marsh. The total net primary production (NPP) of these dominant macrophytes is 860, 300 and 650 g C m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$ respectively. In all plant zones, 66% of the NPP occurs in the belowground fraction. Empirical measurements of organic matter burial indicate that the marsh sediment acts as a carbon sink, accumulating between 75 and 105 g C m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$. The tidal export of aboveground plant biomass in the form of particulate organic matter accounts for a net loss of carbon ranging from 65 to 170 g C m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$. An experiment examining the exchange of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) suggest a net annual export of roughly 500 g C m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$. The forementioned fluxes are combined with estimates of surface gas exchange and algal productivity in order to construct a carbon budget. The budget predicts a DOC export term of 365 g C m$ sp{-2}$ yr$ sp{-1}$, which is of the same order of magnitude as that obtained from the empirical DOC data. The results of this study show that the Plantago zone plays a significant role in the circulation of carbon in the Dipper Harbour salt marsh. This suggests that the patterns of carbon circulation in northern marshes may differ considerably from those in marshes further south where no distinct Plantago zone has been reported.</description><creator>Connor, Richard, 1969-</creator><contributor>Chmura, Gail L.

When tested as a flock at a non-depletable column feeder, with room for either one or two birds to feed, siblings associated with each other more often than expected by chance. Frequency of aggression between siblings at these feeders tended to be lower than expected on the basis of their association. Removal experiments showed that sibling presence had a positive effect on relative feeding success at the single column feeder: a juvenile who lost to another juvenile on a one-to-one basis tended, in the presence of its sibling, to lose less badly to, or even beat, that same juvenile. In contrast, presence of the winner's sibling tended not to affect the relative feeding success of competitors. These results support the hypothesis that pigeon siblings form aggressive alliances when competing for food that is defensible.</description><creator>Cole, Heather J.</creator><contributor>Lefebvre, Louis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Competition (Biology)</subject><subject>Kin recognition in animals</subject><subject>Altruistic behavior in animals</subject><subject>Pigeons -- Behavior</subject><title>Sibling alliances in juvenile feral pigeons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r980z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892c929</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj430674q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:13:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A total of 853 milk samples with different phenotypes of $ kappa$-casein ($ kappa$-CN) and $ beta$-lactoglobulin ($ beta$-LG) and different preheating temperatures of 30, 70, 75 and 80$ sp circ$C were used for the making of individual laboratory scale Cheddar type cheese and for the determination of coagulating properties. Data obtained from milk input, cheese output and chemical analyses were used to calculate actual, 37% moisture adjusted and Van Slyke's theoretical yields and yield efficiency. Least squares analyses of data indicated that higher 37% moisture adjusted yields and yield efficiencies were obtained with milk types VII, VIII and IX, which have the B gene for $ kappa$-CN when compared to milk types I, II and III, which have the A gene for $ kappa$-CN irrespective of preheating temperatures. Moisture adjusted yield, 10.49%, was the highest when milk type VII containing $ kappa$-CN BB and $ beta$-LG AA phenotypes was preheated at 30$ sp circ$C, whereas milk type IX, which has phenotype BB for $ kappa$-CN and BB for $ beta$-LG, had the highest adjusted yields with values of 11.36, 11.91 and 11.99% when preheated at 70, 75 and 80$ sp circ$C, respectively. When cheese was made from milk preheated at 30$ sp circ$C, total solids (64.19%), fat (35.31%) and protein (25.82%) were highest in cheese obtained from milk types IX, VII and IX, respectively, all of which have the B gene for $ kappa$-CN. These three components (61.54%, 30.85% and 24.47%) were lowest in cheese made from milk types III, III and I, respectively, all of which have the A gene for $ kappa$-CN.

(redroot pigweed) is a major weed of many crops in North America including corn, soybean, and potato. It can be readily controlled by chemical and cultural methods. However, some populations of A. retroflexus have developed resistance against the application of triazine herbicides. Biololical control could be an alternative method to control this weed species. In 1990, a Macrophoma sp. causing foliar lesions was isolated from redroot pigweed and the potential of this plant pathogenic fungus as a mycoherbicide was evaluated. Large numbers of infective propagules were produced in solid substrate fermentation with chickpeas. When inoculated with 10$ sp8$ or 10$ sp9$ conidia m$ sp{-2}$, plants at the cotyledon to 2-leaf stage showed the most severe damage. Disease developed over a wide range of dew period durations (6 hr to 24 hr) and temperature regimes (14 C to 26 C), and the most rapid and destructive disease development occurred following a 24-hr dew period at 18 C. In controlled environment studies, this Macrophoma sp. was pathogenic to the genus Amaranthus and the closely related genus Celosia.</description><creator>Chin, Alice</creator><contributor>Watson, Alan K.

It has been shown in previous studies that the exposure of the CsI to air is detrimental to the CsI photocathode response. In this work we introduce a novel spraying technique where the whole chamber is exposed to nothing but a controlled dry argon atmosphere and the ambient gas environment in which measurements are taken, i.e., methane. All results concerning the CsI are obtained relative to copper. A relative quantum efficiency of 400 to 700 was measured in the wavelength range 170-180 nm. We also investigated the reproducibility of our measurements and estimated the CsI long wavelength cut-off to be approximately 213 nm.

Five series of contaminated illite soils were prepared through adsorption tests using four single-specie 5000 ppm heavy metal solutions of Pb, Cu, Zn, or Cd and one multi-species solution containing 1250 ppm of each heavy metal. The five contaminated illite soils that were prepared contained the following levels of heavy metals per kilogram of soil: (i) 5000 mg Pb, (ii) 3490 mg Cu, (iii) 1566 mg Zn, (iv) 700 mg Cd, (v) 1186 mg Pb; 379 mg Cu; 151 mg Zn; and 125 mg Cd. The soil washing results revealed that EDTA and CDTA are equally effective in releasing heavy metals from the contaminated illite soils, with removal efficiencies ranging from 35% to 99% for the 10$ sp{-5}$ M and 10$ sp{-1}$ M solutions, respectively. The optimum pH range for all chelate concentrations and all heavy metal contaminants is between 3-5. Competition between heavy metals in the soil for the adsorption sites of EDTA and CDTA did not have an impact on the removal efficiencies attained. In addition, the heavy metal preferential adsorption sequence demonstrated by the illite soil was $ rm Pb&gt;Cu&gt;Zn&gt;Cd$ for the single-specie pollutant solutions and $ rm Pb&gt;Cu&gt;Zn approx Cd$ for the multi-species heavy metal pollutant solution, and were shown to be mainly bound to the carbonates and Fe and Mg oxides.</description><creator>Castellan, Paolo</creator><contributor>Mohamed, A.

The forcing is applied north of the critical layer. Two approaches are employed for solving this problem. First an analytic solution valid for large time is derived, using Fourier and Laplace transform techniques and asymptotic approximations. This solution exhibits the modification due to the wave packet of the corresponding solution obtained by Warn and Warn (1976) in the monochromatic case. A numerical investigation is then carried out using a finite difference scheme and a time-dependent radiation condition. It is found that the forced waeve packet is absorbed at the critical layer, and the total momentum transferred to the mean flow as a result of the absorption is observed to be proportional to the length scale of the wave packet.</description><creator>Campbell, Lucy J.</creator><contributor>Sherwin (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Moslowe (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Forced Rossby wave packets in a zonal shear flow in the presence of a critical layer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j3214.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh79b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pq09q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:13:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We used genetically T-lymphopenic rats as donors to probe the contribution of T-lymphocytes to graft immunogenicity. Graft survival (GS) of lymphopenic donors was significantly increased as compared to normal donors (median (M) = 17 days vs M = 7d, n = 10). To confirm this observation, we reconstituted 7 lymphopenic rats before organ retrieval with $10 sp7-10 sp8$ purified T-lymphocytes. GS was significantly shorter than with lymphopenic donors (M = 7d, n = 7 vs M = 17d, n = 10). Conversely, we treated 6 normal donors with R7.3 (mouse anti-rat TCR $ alpha/ beta$) monoclonal antibody (mab). GS was significantly increased as compared to normal donors (M = 23d, n = 6 vs M = 7d, n = 10). These experiments demonstrate that grafts of T-lymphopenic donors have a longer survival time. This advantage is lost after reconstitution with normal T-lymphocytes. GS is similarly prolonged after treatment of normal donors with anti-T-lymphocytes mab. Thus, donor T-lymphocytes contribute to the graft immunogenicity in this model.</description><creator>Busque, Stephan</creator><contributor>Guttmann, R. D.

The study included 75 active nest sites and 75 random sites. Univariate analyses and Generalized Linear Models were used. Nest sites differed significantly from the random sites for 87% of habitat variables measured. The model correctly classified 85.3% of the nest sites and 86.7% of the random sites. The probability of occupation of a site by a Spanish Imperial Eagle increased with tree height, angle of aperture of the wood stand, distance to paved roads, distance to urban centre and distance to water body. Four productivity parameters (laying date, number of eggs, number of nestlings and number of chicks fledged) were measured over the same 10-year period for 16 territories in the Donana Park. Spearman correlation coefficient analyses ($r sb{s}$) were used to test for relationships between territory habitat characteristics, representing microhabitat, vegetative composition, degree of human influence and land use, and productivity. Egg-laying was later in territories situated closer to urban centres (n = 16 $r sb{s}$ = $-$0,529, $P &lt; 0.05)$ and those with more kilometres of power lines (n = 16, $r sb{s}$ = 0.518, $P &lt; 0.05)$.

Immunogold labelling of C. reinhardtii sections showed that both appressed and non-appressed thylakoid membranes were labelled by each antiserum, with labelling on the non-appressed membranes being somewhat (1.7-1.8 times) higher than that on the appressed membranes. In P. sativum, anti-CP1-e labelling was 3.9 times higher on the non-appressed membranes than on the appressed ones, whereas anti-CP40 labelling was equally concentrated on both classes of membranes.

Sites were chosen to represent the different plant communities present along a productivity gradient where the water table was at or near the peat surface. Methane emissions, water table depth, and peat temperature were measured on weekly basis, while the relationship between photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net ecosystem exchange of CO$ sb2$ was determined three times during the field season, and then used to develop net ecosystem production (NEP) models at each site. Porewater methane was sampled for $ rm delta sp{13}C/ sp{12}C$ isotopic analysis once a month. Among the sites, after PAR, light CO$ sb2$ flux was primarily controlled by sedge biomass and water table position, while dark CO$ sb2$ flux was controlled by peat temperature. From early June to late August, the five sites consumed approximately 1 to 2 g $ rm CO sb2$-C m$ rm sp{-2}d sp{-1}$. Seasonal CH$ sb4$ fluxes ranged between 16 and 456 mg $ rm CH sb4 m sp{-2}d sp{-1}$, and were higher than fluxes measured at other boreal sites in the same latitude. Seasonal average NEP was a good predictor of seasonal CH$ sb4$ fluxes from the sites (r$ sp2$ = 0.50), providing a model which estimates CH$ sb4$ flux based on site productivity alone. Stable carbon isotope analysis indicates root exudates that stimulate methanogenesis are an important control on this relationship, as is a high water table, particularly in its influence on the depth of the CH$ sb4$ oxidizing layer in the peat. These results suggest NEP measurements have the potential to be used in remote sensing applications to estimate CH$ sb4$ flux from wetlands, but that their use may be restricted to inundated sites.</description><creator>Bellisario, Lianne</creator><contributor>Moore, T.

Several landrace x landrace and landrace x inbred crosses were evaluated. Test crosses were made to determine whether the landraces carry the floury-l (fl$ sb1$) allele. Most traits examined exhibited considerable variation among the landraces. Variation was also observed within many of the landraces for ear and cob colour, for endosperm texture and row number. The landraces were grouped into 10 clusters by centroid clustering analysis. Significant heterosis over the mid-parent value was observed in the crosses among landraces. Some crosses between landraces and inbreds yielded more than either parent. Crossing the landraces with the inbreds improved some agronomic characteristics, but disrupted some of the ear characteristics of the landraces.

However, spoilage occurs shortly after baking. After microbial spoilage, the main spoilage problem is staling. Therefore, methods to control staling are of great importance to the bakery industry since staling results in millions of dollars annually in lost revenues. Initial studies using a one variable at a time approach showed that enzymes, guar, algin and pectin gums and high fructose corn syrup could delay staling and resulted in an organoleptically acceptable product. Subsequent optimization studies using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach show the appropriate levels of enzyme (Novamyl), guar gum and HFCS resulted in bagels with a textural and sensorial shelf life of 6 weeks at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the cost of reformulating ($ sim$0.5 cent/bagel) is minimal and could easily be recovered through reduced production costs, reduced losses due to staling and additional sales and market areas.</description><creator>Assouad, Marie-Christine</creator><contributor>Smith, J.

Hysteresis free MOS devices with minimum interface state density of $ rm2.3 times10 sp{11} cm sp{-2} eV sp{-1}$ and oxide charge density of $ rm2.8 times10 sp{11} cm sp{-2}$ have been achieved, which are among the best results reported so far on anodized InSb. The C-V (Capacitance-Voltage) curves of these devices show that both accumulation and inversion of the InSb surface can be reached within a small bias voltage range. Quantitative information concerning the interface state density and the oxide charge density of these devices are obtained by comparing the experimental C-V curves with the theoretical calculation. The properties of the MOS structures are found to be strongly affected by the anodization conditions and fabrication procedures. The C-V curves taken at different frequencies suggest an inverted surface prior to any applied bias, which has been explained with a lateral ac current flow model. The I-V (Current-Voltage) characteristics indicate that the anodized InSb oxide is a very good electric insulator down to the thickness of 320 A. The dielectric constant of the anodized InSb oxide is dependent upon the oxide thickness and is ranging from 10.7 to 14 for samples prepared in present work.</description><creator>Zhang, Hong, 1967-</creator><contributor>Shih, I.
