The exploration process is used to acquire data, fuse measurements from different viewpoints, and construct shape models. Until now, approximate shape models, e.g. superellipsoids, have been used to represent objects in an active exploration strategy. Although these models provide an adequate characterization of 3D shape for many tasks, a more detailed representation is needed when it comes to tasks that require discrimination of similar objects. In this thesis, we explore the use of a class of deformable models, developed by Pentland and Sclaroff, to further refine the initial coarse superellipsoid description to provide a richer description of the scene. The autonomous exploration strategy used is the one developed by Whaite and Ferrie. Along the way a number of specific issues will be addressed, namely how the models are initialized, the stability of the model parameters throughout the exploration process, and the attachment of data points to the model surface. This work demonstrates the utility of the deformable models for shape interpolation and as general representations for 3D shape.</description><creator>Roymoulik, Santanu.</creator><contributor>Ferrie, F.

In this work, a wireless communication system using differential binary phase shift keyed commutation signaling has been considered for a two-wave Rayleigh fading channel. Commutation signaling code parameters that characterize the system performance (average and worst case) are revealed and codebooks have been constructed based on these parameters. For binary codebooks constructed based on average performance, the maximum probability of error may be very large at certain inter-wave delays. On the other hand, binary and four phase codebooks constructed based on the worst case performance not only ensure an acceptable maximum probability of error, but also give very good average performance. Normally, systems using codebooks that require more bandwidth expansion have better anti-multipath capability. It is also found that with the same bandwidth expansion, the anti-multipath capability is increased by using four phase codebooks instead of binary codebooks. For a performance degradation of about 3dB with respect to ideal two-fold diversity, four phase codebooks of length 4 can be used for inter-wave delays of up to nearly three times the symbol duration, while codebooks of length 8 can cope with delays as large as nearly sixteen times the symbol duration.</description><creator>Ren, Hong, 1962-</creator><contributor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Code design for broadband indoor wireless communications using commutation signaling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354h30g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h3765</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225c99f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Formation of Pb and Ca precipitates on a silica surface in the presence of sulphate and carbonate under neutral to alkaline condition is studied using zeta potential measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of carbonate on displacing sulphate is discussed. In the Pb/sulphate system, precipitates of predominantly Pb-oxide/hydroxide formed on the silica surface. In the Pb/carbonate system, the precipitates were predominantly Pb-carbonate/hydroxy carbonate. Precipitates in both the Pb/SO$ sb4$ and Pb/CO$ sb3$ systems were dispersed by addition of sufficient carbonate, the silica surface eventually becoming free of precipitates. This dispersion was considered to be due to: a high negative surface charge density on both lead carbonate and silica; nucleation being promoted at high concentrations of carbonate, resulting in small precipitates; and increased solubility at high carbonate concentrations. In the Ca system, calcium sulphate precipitates did not form on the silica particles while calcium carbonate precipitates did. The precipitates were not removed by increasing carbonate concentration. The difference from the Pb system is attributed to a low negative surface charge density on calcium carbonate compared to lead carbonate, leading to less dispersing conditions, and the higher solubility of calcium sulphate compared to lead sulphate.</description><creator>Rashchi, Fereshteh.</creator><contributor>Finch, J.

Consequently, there is an increasing demand for ultimate quality DSP products which, in turn, necessitates structured design for testability (DFT) methodologies and in particular Built-In Self Test (BIST). The classical BIST schemes usually employ the specialized test pattern generation and test response compaction circuitry, which, in consequence, introduces a significant hardware overhead and performance degradation to a design under test. In this thesis, we propose an entirely new Arithmetic Built-In Self Test (ABIST) concept that utilizes the functional blocks inherent to DSP architectures for testing the entire hardware. Arithmetic blocks such as adders and subtracters are slightly modified to perform test pattern generation and test response compaction in the BIST mode. We demonstrate that ABIST scheme is applicable to testing DSP microcontrollers, as well as regular blocks from the DSP data path like arithmetic and logic blocks and multipliers. In addition, this method provides high quality scan pattern generation and compaction for testing of random logic. The proposed ABIST scheme permits at-speed testing while introducing virtually no area overhead and no performance degradation. These characteristics make ABIST very suitable for consumer applications where the primary objective is to minimize the size of the products without sacrificing the performance. The ABIST scheme is also applicable to embedded DSP cores, where it is extremely difficult to access successive blocks externally.</description><creator>Radecka, Katarzyna.</creator><contributor>Rajski, Janusz (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Arithmetical Built-In Self Test for DSP architectures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x111x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gj439</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440v681</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Autonomous robotic operation in an unstructured or partially known environment requires sensing and sensor-based control. To overcome the problems with current "eye-in-hand" systems, miniature amplitude-based, infra-red proximity sensors are being studied. Obtaining position and velocity estimates of a rigid body with these sensors is a non-linear parameter and state estimation problem. Among the methods examined in simulation, Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) was selected for implementation. A novel approach for object localization was developed in which the object geometry is known, sensing is performed by a proximity sensing network (PSN) and the object's unknown reflective properties are estimated on-line. The method has been tested extensively in simulation and experiments in which a target object's planar position and velocity were successfully estimated. To the author's knowledge this is the first time amplitude based infra-red sensors have been used to estimate a rigid body's unknown trajectory.</description><creator>Petryk, Gregory Allen.</creator><contributor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Dynamic object localization via a proximity sensor network</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn3013340.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v681</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jw59t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Current interest in small satellites lies in the feasibility of achieving specific but limited objectives. By necessity, small spacecraft technology requires simple control schemes, where small attitude errors can be tolerated inside specified deadbands. The attitude control of a small satellite using fuzzy logic is examined in this thesis. A realistic satellite is modelled as a central rigid body with a set of flexible appendages. The continuous flexible structures are discretized using the assumed modes method. Equations governing the attitude motion and the bending vibrations of the appendages are obtained from the Lagrangian formulation, while the orbital motion is assumed to be Keplerian. The cases of thrusting and magneto-torquing are considered for the missions of three-axis and spin stabilization of the satellite, respectively. For each case, a set of control rules based on fuzzy logic is formulated to control the polarity and the switching time of the actuators. Control constraints are imposed on the actuators. Various simulations in the presence of environmental disturbances and uncontrolled vibrations of the appendages illustrate the effectiveness of the attitude fuzzy logic controllers.</description><creator>Petermann, Bertrand.</creator><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

A non-linear parallel-cascade system identification technique was recently developed to non-invasively elucidate the ankle reflex dynamics. Identification of these dynamics requires the application of stochastic signals to the ankle joint. The stretch reflex is known to be highly modulated and attenuated during on-going cyclical movements and passively applied perturbations. The aim of this study was to investigate these effects. The stretch reflex gain was found to decrease progressively as the average velocity of the applied movement increased. The velocity-mediated effects were a function of the amplitude distribution characteristics, rather than the spectral properties, of the applied motion. The experiments confirmed that although the stretch reflex response is large enough to be important its effects will depend on the functional context.</description><creator>Parameswaran, Luckshman.</creator><contributor>Kearney, Robert E.

The forward kinematics, the Jacobian, and the static force profile, as well as the gravity compensation model are examined. The experimental characterization of the mechanism leads to the determination of the inertia and inherent damping values. The first controller applied on this device has an inner loop force feedback and an outer loop position feedback. The stiffness range achieved by this controller is calculated theoretically and then confirmed experimentally. The second controller has an inner loop position feedback and an outer loop force feedback. Again the stiffness range for a virtual object for this controller is found both theoretically and then confirmed experimentally. The two controllers are then coupled into a single controller able to achieve a range of stiffness larger than that achieved by each individual controller. The degree of coupling varies, depending on the desired stiffness, to ensure stable control of the device.</description><creator>Ouellet, Alain.</creator><contributor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Control of an instrumented haptic interface</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fk073.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f325s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rv042v96c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The equations of motion of a tethered satellite system are highly nonlinear and should possess many interesting related features; yet its nonlinear dynamics has never been thoroughly investigated in previous works. This thesis analyzes the nonlinear dynamics of two-body tethered satellite systems using numerical tools of analysis such as phase plane plots, power spectral densities (PSD's), Poincare sections and first Lyapunov exponents, as well as approximate analytical methods including the method of Melnikov. Motion in the stationkeeping phase wherein the tethered system is just a gravity gradient pendulum is studied, first considering pitch motion only, and then considering the coupled pitch and roll motions. The deployment/retrieval phases are studied next. For a circular orbit, pitch stability is examined for varying exponential length rates; for the unstable cases, it is compared to an equivalent uniform length rate scheme, which showed better stability behaviour.

The linear graph method is selected to derive comprehensive models of three electrohydraulic actuation subsystems, i.e. the swing, boom and stick subsystems, on the vehicle based on modelling of individual components. A new approach is proposed, then, to integrate rigid-body dynamic models with the actuator dynamic models to result in a complete machine model. Off-line parameter identification procedures are used, including the least-square method. A series of experiments is performed to obtain numerical values for the parameters involved in the system models. The experimental setups are described in detail and new procedures are explained. The model validation studies show that the mathematical models closely represent the dynamic characteristics of the forestry machine. The concept of coordinated control in teleoperation is studied. The resolved motion rate control strategy shows superiority over conventional joint-based control in heavy-duty forestry machines. Two inverse Jacobian manipulator control schemes, based on velocity and on position servo schemes, are introduced and evaluated under various operating conditions. The results provide guidelines for the design and implementation of manipulator controllers on a forestry machine.</description><creator>Mu, Bin.</creator><contributor>Papadopoulos, E.

The tether is thought to be a part of a spinning tethered satellite system in the station-keeping phase so that the tether has a constant nominal length and is forced to spin at a constant rate about its nominal axis. Using the extended Hamilton's principle the governing equations of motion are derived retaining non-linear terms up to the third order that originate from geometric non-linearity. They are discretized by the assumed-modes method, truncated to one-mode equations, and transformed to the phase-space form. Then the method of averaging is applied. When the tether has high nominal tension, averaging with two variables results in a closed form solution, which shows dependence of the frequency contents on the initial amplitude parameters of the system. In the case of very low nominal tension, averaging with a single variable is useful to obtain the steady state and the limit steady state solutions, both of which result in a circular whirling motion like a skip-rope. Without damping, a general transverse mode appears to be quasi-periodic but it can be periodic under certain initial conditions. Numerical investigations reveal that the material damping through the longitudinal mode derives the steady state to the limit steady state. Also, several interesting shapes are observed in phase plots.</description><creator>Min, Byung No, 1967-</creator><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

Repeatable lipase production profiles were determined for two different media. Each medium gave a considerably different profile. When the broth contained oil, 60 to 80% of the lipase activity remained after freezing. All activity was lost when the broth did not contain oil. The lipase was found to be associated with the cell. Up to a certain concentration of lipase, the presence of agar caused the lipase to disassociate from the cell and diffuse into the agar. Beyond this concentration of lipase the agar was found to saturate. A new technique of level control in the cyclone reactor was used.

The measurement and control of these temperature profiles can enhance the economy of the process and the part quality. A method to measure melt temperature inside the mould cavity was developed. It consists of an insert, located in the movable plate, that can place thermocouples at different positions. The depth of the thermocouple tip is adjusted manually. These sensors offer an attractive way to perform the measurements because of their easy calibration procedure. The temperature measurements were influenced by the thermocouple tip geometry. Data were collected at different locations and depths of the mould cavity and the temperature profiles were analyzed. The temperature distribution depended on the wall temperature and the temperature of the polymer as it enters the cavity. The effect of different flow rates was also studied and it demonstrated to affect the temperature profiles. A control algorithm was developed to control the average of the peak temperatures at three locations in the cavity. The manipulated variable was the coolant temperature and the process disturbance was the front barrel temperature. The transfer functions of the controlled variable with respect to the manipulated and disturbance variables were identified and modeled. Finally two controllers were designed, tuned, simulated and implemented on the machine. The first is a static feedforward - feedback controller, and the second is a dynamic feedforward - feedback controller. The feedback loop was designed using an internal model control (IMC) algorithm. The static feedforward - feedback controller was found to have a better performance.</description><creator>Manero, Federico.</creator><contributor>Patterson, W. I.

Thermal analysis could provide a cost effective and reliable method to quantify the iron content of the alloy melt before the casting process is performed. The formation of the Al$ sb5$FeSi intermetallic can be resolvable on the cooling curves for aluminum-silicon alloys if the iron content is equal to or greater than 0.6%wt when the cooling rate is 0.10$ sp circ$C/sec. As the iron content gradually increases, the formation temperature of Al$ sb5$FeSi increases and this results in an increase in the duration of the Al$ sb5$FeSi thermal anomaly. A time based parameter associated with the Al$ sb5$FeSi thermal anomaly is also used to quantify the Fe content. Time parameters can be very accurate if the melt volume and heat extraction for the solidifying thermal analysis sample are strictly controlled. Results of Fe quantification via apparent time parameter of the Al$ sb5$FeSi crystallization for 356,319 and 413 alloys using thermal analysis has been completed for this thesis.

The influence of this transformation on the hot ductility of the steel in question was then examined. Samples were strained at rates from $ rm 3 times 10 sp{-4} s sp{-1}$ to $ rm 3 times 10 sp{-2} s sp{-1}$ after cooling to holding temperatures between the Ae$ sb3$ and the (undeformed) Ar$ sb3$ temperature. Deformation was found to raise the effective Ar$ sb3$ temperature almost to the Ae$ sb3$, and to significantly accelerate the transformation in both fine ($ sim$25 $ mu$m) and coarse ($ sim$200 $ mu$m) grained samples. At relatively small levels of undercooling ($ sim$40$ sp circ$C, it was found that deformation induced ferrite could not form outside the regions of the material that were significantly affected by the applied strain. At low strain rates and in coarse grained material, this meant that ferrite formed in narrow bands near the grain boundaries. No such restriction was found in fine grained material. In tension, it was found that, if thin bands of grain boundary ferrite were present in the microstructure, failure always occurred in this second phase. The effect of intergranular ferrite on the ductility was found to vary with the amount present; the lowest %RA value was obtained with around 10% ferrite present in the microstructure. The detrimental effect of ferrite lessened slightly as the strain rate was raised. It is concluded that, from an industrial perspective, unless unbending can be performed at strain rates in excess of $ rm 3 times 10 sp{-2} s sp{-1},$ it would be prudent to carry out this operation either above the Ae$ sb3$ or below the (undeformed) Ar$ sb3$ temperature for the steel in question.</description><creator>Lewis, John R., 1972-</creator><contributor>Jonas, J.

The essential components of the RTCAMS are the data acquisition, the graphic computation and display of the PCG envelopes and the acoustic maps. These processes are performed in parallel by distributing them in 2 digital signal processors (DSPs) on an add-on board in a personal computer (PC). Parts of the software for the DSPs are written in assembly language to improve the overall speed of the system. A real-time micro-kernel is implemented in the second DSP to improve the use of the DSP resources. As the RTCAMS uses the Microsoft$ rm sp{TM}$ Windows 3.1 operating system for its graphical user interface on a PC, a virtual device driver was developed to speed up the data transfer between the host PC and the DSPs and a double buffering technique was used to support real-time display of the graphics. Recording from 3 normal subjects was used to test the performance of the system. The preliminary results show that the system can display the spatial distribution of the PCG on the thorax at the speed of 33 frames per second, allowing the study of propagation patterns of the PCG in real time.</description><creator>Leong-Kon, Dany.</creator><contributor>Louis-Gilles, Durand (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A software system for real-time cardiac acoustic mapping /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd48b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gm88j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62fb342</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cracking is one of the most serious problems affecting concrete structures. It is important to repair them to maintain their level of service. In 1987, after experiencing problems during the injection of one of its concrete dams, Hydro-Quebec decided to carry out a research project to investigate the grouting products, equipment and procedures. This thesis is a part of these activities. The topics treated in the first chapter are concrete cracking and its investigation. Then, follows a brief description of concrete repair techniques, including examples of grouting. The next chapter describes the products, equipment and procedures used in concrete grouting. The following chapter is dedicated to laboratory simulation of the injection of concrete structures: previous experimental work is summarized and the procedures of slab injection followed for this study are explained. The experimental results and their analysis are included in the next chapter. The results of both the literature review and the laboratory study show that: (1) cement-based grouts, either Portland or microfine cement (opening $&lt;$ 0.5 mm), are more effective to repair concrete hydraulic structures than chemical grouts; (2) experimental injections of stable grouts gave results superior to those of unstable grouts; (3) superplasticizers should be added to the cement-based grout mix to improve its rheological properties while it still keeps good mechanical properties; (4) the grouting equipment and monitoring instruments play a major role in the success of an injection; (5) no method can fit all sites: in some cases, where structural integrity could be jeopardized during the injection process, structural analysis can be required to determine safe and efficient parameters.</description><creator>Lapointe, Richard, 1971-</creator><contributor>Mirza, M.

The working fluid was distilled water, with bulk temperatures in the range of 8$ sp circ$C to 31$ sp circ$C. An innovative design allows, for the first time, flow visualization over the entire heated portion of the test section. The key element of this design is a thin, electrically conductive gold-film heater suitably attached to the outside surface of a plexiglas pipe: the gold film is approximately 80% transparent to electromagnetic radiation in the visible wavelength band. This test section was mounted inside a transparent vacuum chamber to insulate it from the environment. A dye injection technique was used to visualize the mixed-convection flow patterns. The apparatus was also designed and instrumented to allow the measurement of both circumferential and axial temperature variations over the heated tube. The flow-visualization results revealed the following: (i) a steady recirculating flow pattern, followed by laminar flow instability in vertical tubes; (ii) steady spiralling flow patterns in inclined and horizontal tubes, that confirmed earlier numerical predictions. The temperature results agreed qualitatively with earlier published experimental and numerical data. Local and overall Nusselt numbers can be calculated using the data presented, but this is not within the scope of this thesis.</description><creator>Lagana, Anthony.</creator><contributor>Baliga, B.

Many physical constraints such as maximum copper trace line density, power consumption of line drivers, transmission line effects and heat dissipation, limit the maximum data throughput achievable for conventional electronic backplanes. On the other hand, photonic backplanes do not have many of the physical limitations that electronic backplanes do. Therefore, by replacing the electronic transceivers in a backplane with optical transmitters and receivers, we can circumvent many of the limitations of conventional electronic backplanes and obtain higher data traffic. This thesis examines the use of vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) as transmitters in two-dimensional free-space optical backplanes. The thesis presents design considerations, limitations of present technology and possible improvements in order to make the VCSEL-based free-space backplane system practical and realizable. To show the concept, a working backplane demonstrator (Phase II) was built using VCSEL as transmitter and metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) as receiver inside a conventional electronic backplane chassis. The design, layout and the performance of assembled Phase II system will be presented throughout the chapters as well as possible future improvements.</description><creator>Kim, Nam-Hyong.</creator><contributor>Plant, David V.

In the first specimen a central reinforcement cage was provided in the slab between the shear walls. In the second and third models this central cage was replaced by a longitudinal beam. In addition, transverse concealed beams were provided at critical wall-toe regions. The flexural capacities of the concealed transverse beams were different in the second and third specimen. All these specimens were tested under progressively increasingly relative displacements being imposed between the walls. The force-displacement characteristics, reinforcement strains and the wall deflection profiles are presented. The results of the tests were found to be in a good agreement with those of the previous studies by Taylor (8) and by Malyszko (15). The horizontal legs of the stirrups in the central cage were found to be effective in confining the excessively cracked concrete at higher displacement ductilities. The longitudinal beam along with transverse concealed beams effectively controlled the punching shear failure at the critical wall-toe regions. The transverse concealed beams were also helpful in distributing the concentrated deformations across the width of the slab.</description><creator>Khan, Mohammad Jalil.</creator><contributor>Mirza, M.

Existing industry standards such as AWWA C105 and PACE 82-3 are currently being used to evaluate the corrosivity of soils. These standards consist of various tests, whose results permit the calculation of a corrosivity index. The following tests are suggested: pH, oxidation-reduction potential, sulfide ion content, resistivity, drainage ability, soil type, and moisture content. Up to this point, no standards have incorporated chloride ion testing into their testing procedure, even though the effect of chloride ions on the corrosion rate is well documented. It is the goal of this project to determine whether there is enough evidence to suggest that chloride ion content be introduced into existing standards. In total, 153 soils were tested following the AWWA C105 and PACE 82-3 standards, as well as for the chloride ion content. Of these, 75 soils were tested using linear polarization to determine the "true" corrosivity of the soils. The analysis results showed that the information provided by the chloride ion content was not significant enough to suggest that this variable be added to the existing grids. This is due to the fact that soil resistivity, which is a required test in both standards, accounts for the presence of chloride ions. However, it should be noted that the chloride ion content is a better predictor of corrosivity than soil resistivity, and it is suggested that chloride ion content be tested whenever possible.</description><creator>Kalantzis, Eugenia.</creator><contributor>Mirza, Saeed M.

Of particular interest currently is the use of Hybrid/SEED devices implemented as smart pixel arrays to encode the electronic data onto an array of constant power beams of light. This paper presents the design and implementation of a robust, scalable and modular optical power supply spot array generator for a modulator based free-space optical backplane demonstrator. Four arrays of 8 by 4 spots of (1/e$ sp2$ irradiance) 6.47$ mu$m radii pitched at 125$ mu$m in the vertical direction and 250$ mu$m in the horizontal were required to provide the light for the optical interconnect. Tight system tolerances demanded careful optical design, elegant optomechanics, and simple but effective alignment techniques. Issues such as spot array generation, polarization, power efficiency, and power uniformity are discussed and characterization results are presented.</description><creator>Iyer, Rajiv.</creator><contributor>Plant, D.
