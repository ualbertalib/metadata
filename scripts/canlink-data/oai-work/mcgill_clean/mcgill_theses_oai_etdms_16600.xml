The measurements covered the frequency range from 30.6 mc/s to 1360 mc/s for beam voltages of 100 to 1000 volts. No such measurements have ever been reported below 200 mc/s and on the basis of these results it was possible to examine critically several theoretical methods of calculating beam-noise propagation. The magnitude of the beam current-noise varied approximately as the square root of frequency down to about 400 mc/s.</description><creator>Segal, Benny.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

To obtain evidence of such loss, the investigator must demonstrate that an individual with schizophrenia has a lower intelligence than he had at a time when the disorder was presumably absent. The task appears straightforward. A survey of the literature on this subject, however, indicates that it is not. The problem of determining whether intellectual loss occurs in schizophrenia presents certain difficulties, which relate, in general, to an insufficient knowledge concerning the nature of the disorder, and, in particular, to the following factors.</description><creator>Schwartzman, Alex.

However, for many aromatic systems the phenolic forms are unstable relative to their keto tautomers or else are excessively difficult to prepare. Thus for example, alpha- and beta- furanol and their benzoates have never been prepared, although alpha- furanol acetate has been prepared by a two-step procedure from furan. In such cases, preparation of the benzoyloxy derivative by direct substitution of the aromatic compound might be most convenient.</description><creator>Samad, Syed.

If sleep is a basic need, then the deprivation of sleep, as the deprivation of any basic need, should lead to certain physiological changes within animals and to differences in their behavior. To the author's knowledge, there are but four relevant studies of sleep loss in animals. All four studies show improved performance following sleep loss (Bunch, Cole &amp; Frerichs, 1937; Bunch, Frerichs &amp; Licklider, 1939; Gray, 1937; Licklider &amp; Bunch, 1946).

As the reviews by Bruner and Tagiuri (1954) and Taft (1955) indicate, the focus of attention in the early research was on the accuracy of one person's perception of the personality characteristics of another. Many such studies have centered on the accuracy of the guesses by one person of the way others responded to personality questionnaires. Summarizing his impressions of these investigations, Cronbach (1958) points out that the findings are "interesting, statistically significant, and exasperatingly inconsistent" (p. 353).</description><creator>Rowe, Patricia.

His father was Ahmad Shukri Pasha, and his mother was Fatima Hanum, daughter of Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad Pasha, chief of cabinet to Said Pasha, son of Mehemet Ali Pasha founder of modern Egypt. Sidky's father on the other hand was Governor of Cairo, and after the Mahdi rebellion in the Sudan became the Director of the administration of the main territories of the Sudan and its dependencies. When he retired from this position he became Under-Secretary of the Interior.</description><creator>Habib, Henry. P.</creator><contributor>Oliver, M.

This involved investigation of the immediate elastic settlement due to deformation occurring under constant volume, and consolidation as a function of pore pressure dissipation. Oedometer and Triaxial compression tests (undrained and consolidated-undrained) with pore pressure measurements were performed to obtain the values of the parameters my, the modulus of volume change, E, the elastic modulus, and pore pressure coefficient ’A’.</description><creator>Rehman, Mumtaz.

Hare (1960) has pointed out that only in comparatively recent years has there been an attempt to explain quantitatively how the various parameters of climate evolve and thus to approach the ultimate question of how it is that one climate varies from another. Most of the answers are to be found through Meteorology, and must be, since the tools required for this work have been developed there. The following is an attempt to explain what processes, and of how great a magnitude, cause temperature changes in the layers of the atmosphere below 500 mb.</description><creator>Rayner, John.

Verhoff suggested that this effect might be due to “unconscious mental comparison” of the second line with the after-image of the first. Gibson (1933) found that Ss who had worn lenses which made verticals appear curved remarked, on removing the glasses, that verticals now appeared curved in the opposite direction.</description><creator>Raman, Anne.

Part of the confusion which arose was probably due to different nomenclature of authors and compounds studied; part of it was undoubtedly due to the multiplicity of actions and variability of effects under different experimental conditions.</description><creator>Prohaska, Gertrude.</creator><contributor>Skoryna, S.
