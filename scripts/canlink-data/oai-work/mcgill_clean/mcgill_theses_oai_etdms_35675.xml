The prostate motion was  determined using an ultrasound-based patient positioning system (BAT: B-mode  Acquisition and Targeting) just after conventional patient setup. The changes in  planned biological effects due to prostate motion were calculated for the prostate  target organ and for the rectum and bladder normal tissues using TCP (tumor control  probability) and NTCP (normal tissue complication probability) calculations,  respectively.

Research has identified a number of risk  factors for suicidal behaviour, including the presence of psychiatric diagnosis, and  the comorbidity of psychiatric diagnosis. In particular, high lifetime aggression  and impulsiveness have repeatedly been implicated as risk factors for suicidal  behaviour, and have also been observed to cluster in families. This study  investigates the phenotype of suicide completion through exploration of comorbid  patterns of psychopathology and seasonality in order to gain a better understanding  of possible subgroups of suicide completers, particularly with respect to  impulsive-aggressive behaviours and their psychopathological correlates. This study  also explores the familiality of suicidal behaviour, and its relationship to  impulsive-aggressive behaviours and their psychopathological correlates. Our  findings show that suicide cases can be clustered into three different groups  according comorbidity: a low-comorbidity group, a substance-dependent group, and a  group exhibiting childhood onset of psychopathology. We also find that seasonal  variation in suicide varies according to psychopathology. Finally, we confirm that  suicide has a familial component independent of psychopathology, and find evidence  to suggest that this may be mediated by severity of suicidal ideation, and  aggressive behaviour.</description><creator>Kim, Caroline Donna</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Refining the suicide phenotype : psychopathological and familial studies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w2896.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck54r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gf06g330z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis we study the simplest types of generalized  Grassmann varieties. The study involves defining those varieties, understanding  their local structures, calculating their Zeta functions, defining cycles on those  varieties and studying their cohomology groups. We begin with the classical Grassmannian G( d, n) and then study  a special type of the Grassmannian, namely the Lagrangian Grassmannian. For a field  k and a subring R ⊂ End(kn) we study the generalized Grassmann variety G(R;  d, n) which is the set of all d-dimensional subspaces of kn that are preserved under  R. We study the local structure of the generalized Grassmann scheme F R := G(R; d,  n) and its zeta function in some particular cases. We study closely the example of a  quadratic field when R is the ring of integers.</description><creator>Kolhatkar, Ratnadha</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Grassmann varieties</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161673r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g330z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq245</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A method for obtaining a smaller bound for the post-Newtonian  parameter alpha 2 is outlined. alpha2 is a parameter in the post-Newtonian formalism  associated with violation of Lorentz invariance.

A phase-controlled electrical power regulator was developed and  connected in series with the original cycle-controlled power regulator of an  existing domestic microwave oven. The microwave oven was further modified such that  combined microwave and convectional drying can be accommodated. The system performance was evaluated. It was observed that  phase-controlled power regulator could be successfully used for quasi-continuous  (fast-switching) power regulation with the maximization of power efficiency. The  degradation of output microwave power was recorded and the nonuniform distribution  of microwave field in the cavity was also verified. The effects of phase control and cycle control were evaluated  through combined microwave and convective drying of potato samples. Results showed  that different power control methods had different impacts on drying kinetics and  product quality. In both drying modes, the drying time increased with the decrease  of microwave power density and the increase of air velocity. The drying rates of  cycle-controlled drying are significantly higher than those of phase-controlled  drying. In terms of rehydration capacity the phase-controlled drying mode produced  better results. The product colour and sensory attributes were independent of the  power control methods.</description><creator>Cheng, Wei Min, 1964-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Potatoes -- Drying.</subject><subject>Microwave drying.</subject><title>Microwave power control strategies on the drying process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn82s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547r987</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000060f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Theory of mind (ToM) is the knowledge that other people have  minds, thoughts, beliefs and values different from our own. Patients with  schizophrenia are generally thought to be impaired at tasks requiring this ability.  Frith (1992) has proposed that specific signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are  associated with dysfunction in ToM ability. The purpose of the present study was to  investigate the role of thought disorder in theory of mind and to tease out the  electrophysiological correlates of this phenomenon. Participants partook in an  intention attribution task, during which event-related potentials (ERPs) were  recorded. Patients with high ratings of thought disorder performed worse than those  with low thought disorder and significantly worse than normal subjects. ERP results  were unexpected as no differences were detected for ERPs on frontal sites. A  significant difference in the P600 component was observed on Pz. Possible  explanations for parietal activation are discussed.</description><creator>Chintoh, Araba</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Psychology, Experimental.</subject><title>Event-related potential correlates of theory of mind in schizophrenia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv18c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000060f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p095n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Few efforts have been made to understand the subjective  experiences of birthparents involved in the child welfare system, especially of  those who have had their parental rights permanently removed. The research  undertaken seeks an initial investigation of this neglected issue, providing  accounts of four birthmothers' experiences of having one or more of their children  involuntarily and permanently removed from their care as a result of child neglect.  Implicit in this research is the assumption that these mothers do indeed suffer  tremendous grief over the loss of their children, regardless of child welfare  agencies' assessments of their parenting capacities. Furthermore, the research  critically evaluates how child welfare practice and policy might serve to exacerbate  incumbent issues of loss, ultimately disenfranchising this already isolated and  stigmatized population. Therefore, this qualitative study endeavours to assist not  only child protection workers, but also the greater community in better  understanding what it is like to be a "child welfare parent" who has had  her parental rights terminated, and to be aware of the existing imbalance of power  between child welfare agencies and the clientele they serve. The study ultimately  aims to help ensure that human dignity and genuine respect are not lost in the work  of child protection.</description><creator>McKegney, Sherrie</creator><contributor>Davies, Linda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Birthmothers -- Canada.</subject><subject>Adoption -- Canada -- Psychological aspects</subject><subject>Child welfare -- Canada -- Psychological aspects</subject><title>Silenced suffering : the disenfranchised grief of birthmothers compulsorily separated from their children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs593.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p095n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483j91j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There is growing evidence of the important role that family  members play in the support and recovery of individuals diagnosed with a serious  mental illness. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) Provider Education  Program (PEP) trains providers of mental health services to work collaboratively  with families in the treatment of individuals with a mental illness. This study  examines the effect of the NAMI-PEP on Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) provider  representations of and services provided to families at Frontenac Community Mental  Health Services. Qualitative and quantitative methods of research are combined to  explore ACT provider beliefs about, feelings toward and services provided to  families before and after participating the NAMI-PEP. Findings suggest that the  NAMI-PEP is effective in initiating changes in provider representations of family at  a cognitive level. Changes in provider views are detected indicating movement toward  a strengths-based orientation and an improved understanding of the components of  collaborative practice with families. Analysis of changes to ACT practice patterns  illuminates the challenges of implementing cultural change at an organizational  level and identifies a fertile area for further research.</description><creator>Kent, Tracey</creator><contributor>Lach, Lucyna (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Mentally ill -- Care -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Mentally ill -- Family relationships.</subject><subject>National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (U.S.)</subject><title>Representations of family : the effect of the National Alliance of [i.e. for] the Mentally Ill-Provider Education Program on assertive community treatment provider representations of family</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r621f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j91j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h007c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Where individuals standing outside of the corporation have been  harmed by the acts of one of its directors or officers, the question becomes whether  they have only a claim against the corporation or whether they may have also a  personal claim against the executive inflicting the harm on them. The issue of how far it should be possible to hold directors and  officers personally liable for tort has been a contested one and even courts within  one and the same jurisdiction provide different solutions. On the one hand, there is  the general basic principle that individuals causing harm to others should be held  responsible. On the other hand, the fact that directors and officers act as agents  on behalf of the corporation might call for an exception to this basic tort law  principle. This thesis will compare the solutions proposed by Common law  (with focus on the law of Ontario) and German law as an example of a Civil law  jurisdiction. An attempt will be made to see in how far the proposed solutions are  consistent with legal principles like the separate legal entity of the corporation  and the concept of limited liability as well as with arguments related to economic  efficiency.</description><creator>Schlag, Jenny Melanie</creator><contributor>Smith, Lionel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Debtor and creditor</subject><subject>Directors of corporations</subject><subject>Tort liability of corporations</subject><subject>Chief executive officers</subject><subject>Tort liability of corporations -- Germany</subject><subject>Tort liability of corporations -- Canada</subject><title>Tort law liability of directors and officers towards third party creditors : a comparative study of common and civil law with special focus on Canada and Germany</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm60d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h007c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r9674280</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The growing recognition of obligation of Good Faith in contract  law has only increased the debate surrounding this concept and its ramification on  contract. The uneasiness about Good Faith should be attributed to the fact that Good  Faith is an open norm or vague standard, which in practice means judicial law  making. Furthermore, Good Faith suggests the teleological method of interpretation  of contract and legislation in determining the rights and the duties of the parties  to a contract. This, it is argued, would contradict the importance of certainty,  private autonomy and commercial stability. The thesis presents the development and  functions of Good Faith, in different jurisdiction, civil and common. It elaborates  the arguments and counterarguments in the Good Faith debate from the context of  major civil law and common law features. This will be mainly illustrated by maritime  law related contracts. Finally, Good Faith in a possible uniform transnational  maritime law will be discussed.</description><creator>Rosenwasser, Elior</creator><contributor>Tetley, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Maritime law</subject><subject>Good faith (International law)</subject><title>Good faith -- civil, common and maritime</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv19n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9674280</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pt34v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In 1995 the WTO began functioning as an institution that aims at  reducing the trade barriers between countries.

Nevertheless,  the nationality clause the agreements included conflicted with the Community  principle of freedom of establishment. On November 5, 2002, the European Court of Justice therefore  ruled there was indeed violation. However, the true question raised by the  agreements focused less on such violation, which was anterior to those agreements,  than on their fragmentation and the inequality they created in the Europe/United  States aviation relations. Indeed, the issue to be stressed in the judgments is linked to  the building of the external competence of the Union with regards to aviation. While  the Court refused to grant total competence to the Community, it made that of the  Member States impracticable, leading to a global mandate for the  Commission. Although the orientations of the agreements to be concluded are  foreseeable, the role the European Union will play in a potential multilateral  negotiation remains to be defined.</description><creator>Deleau, Delphine</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- European Union countries.</subject><subject>Airlines -- Deregulation -- European Union countries.</subject><title>The European court of justice 'open skies' judgments of 5 November 2002 : a Euopean contribution to the multilateral framework for International Aviation relations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn49h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k551m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848r14r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over the past few years, embryo research has been a widely  discussed topic. New techniques such as embryo stem cell research or therapeutic  cloning are considered by scientists to be very promising. Nevertheless, opponents  of these experimentations warn against the commodification of human life forms and  argue that the moral status of embryos should protect them from being destroyed  purely for research. Legislations on this topic have been enacted in most Western  countries, though they are still much criticised. Is there an adequate way of  regulating embryo research? Our argument suggests that consensus can only be  procedurally obtained. That is, we believe that only legislative assemblies should  have authority to take a position on this controversial topic, which is subject to  moral disagreement, and as such, judges should only have a minor  role.</description><creator>Champon, Benoit</creator><contributor>Gold, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Medicine -- Research -- Law and legislation</subject><subject>Human embryo -- Research -- Moral and ethical aspects</subject><subject>Stem cells -- Research -- Moral and ethical aspects</subject><title>How to regulate embryo research? : a procedural approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nh66s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r14r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pt30r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis considers the application of the principles of  distributed signal detection to the uplink of a mobile communication unit engaged in  soft handoff, when all base stations involved are equipped with multiple receiving  antennas. The system consists of a local detector at each base station and a fusion  center at the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). Optimum decision rules are derived for  systems without channel coding, as well as for systems using channel coding, over a  quasi-static spatially uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. Two different cases are  considered. In the first case, accurate estimates of the base station channel states  are available at the MSC, while in the second case only the statistics of the  channels are known. For both cases, when the system is not using channel coding the  optimum local decision rules are likelihood ratio quantizers for which the defining  thresholds are optimized numerically with respect to the probability of bit error at  the output of the MSC. With channel coding it is shown that the complexity of either  the implementation or the optimization of the optimum decision rules increases  exponentially with the frame size. Hence, for coded systems, sub-optimum  alternatives are proposed where the local decision rules are likelihood ratio  quantizers. The performances of these systems are investigated. For the uncoded  systems the probability of bit error is evaluated numerically, and for coded systems  the probability of bit error and frame error are estimated through computer  simulations. Finally, it is demonstrated that by carefully selecting the thresholds  defining the local decision rules, 8 quantization levels are sufficient to make the  performances almost identical to the performances of an optimum centralized system,  implementing at the MSC a maximum likelihood test using the actual signals received  at the involved base stations.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper  copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).</description><creator>Martin, Frederic, 1979-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Distributed detection for handoff macrodiversity in cellular communication systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1392478.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pt30r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:73666506m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the present work was to remove selectively  manganese from a neutral leach zinc-rich solution at 80ºC using the gas  mixture of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and oxygen (O2) as oxidizing agent. In order to  determine the optimum conditions for manganese removal using SO 2/O2, several  semi-batch experiments were performed, where the effects of pH, ORP, SO2/O2 ratio,  mixing intensity, etc. were investigated. Results of these tests showed that SO2/O 2  was a fast and effective oxidant for removing manganese down to ppm level provided  that the appropriate reactor design, agitation and SO 2/O2 ratio were employed. In  an attempt to improve the precipitate's characteristics, e.g. crystallinity and  solid/liquid separation, a new technique called Step-Wise Oxidative Precipitation  (S.W.O.P) was investigated using a two-reactor continuous circuit employing pH and  ORP control and precipitate recycling. These tests revealed that a birnessite-like  phase with general formula (Na0.7Ca0.3)Mn7O14·2.8H 2O was produced with  co-precipitation of a significant amount of zinc apparently via substitution. The  applied technique (S.W.O.P combined with recycling) proved effective in producing  dense particles but not on lowering zinc losses. The biggest advantage of this novel  oxidation technique was the total elimination of scaling.

It  is exposed to significant seismic hazards and ranks second in urban seismic risk in  Canada. The seismicity of Eastern Canada is controlled by intraplate earthquakes.  The damages caused by the earthquakes on infrastructures depend on the quake  magnitude, distance from the epicentre and the type of underlying soil deposit. The  surficial deposits and landscape of Montreal have been shaped by many geological  episodes. Alternate periods of glaciation and melting, deposited considerable  quantities of soft soil, and were later altered by the emergence of the Champlain  Sea, depositing clay and sand layers. Lastly, the influence of the St Lawrence River  and its secondary channels deposited fine and coarse materials on the river  banks. Unconsolidated cohesionless soil with water leads to  liquefaction phenomenon during earthquakes. Various researches have been carried out  on, the nature of soil deposits in Montreal and Microzonation of the Island of  Montreal. The objective of this thesis is to map liquefaction hazard for the Island  of Montreal. The methodology consists of using 'the Simplified procedure', developed  by Seed and Idris (1971) and updated by Youd et al., (1998), to obtain the factor of  safety against liquefaction. SHAKE2000 is used to perform the analysis. A  comprehensive data on the type of soil and standard penetration number was required  to perform this analysis, which was provided by the City of Montreal. The resulting  maps of this analysis illustrate the liquefaction hazard of the region in terms of  factor of safety against liquefaction for two earthquake magnitudes, 7.5 and  5.5.</description><creator>Pushpam Joseph, Beena John</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Liquefaction hazard mapping for the island of Montreal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h0038.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kq98k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9c67wn42k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The concurrent biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs) and transformation of heavy metals by redox reactions has been  demonstrated by several studies. The mechanisms and reactions that result in heavy  metal transformation in such systems is, however, poorly understood. This study  explored the role of metabolic intermediates, metabolic end-products, and microbial  chelators generated by a PAH-degrading microorganism, Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484,  in reducing or transforming Cr(VI). This study investigates the role of  1,2-naphthoquinone to serve as potential redox mediators in the reduction of Cr(VI)  to Cr(III). Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the extent of Cr(VI)  reduction in the presence of various concentrations of the naphthalene  biodegradation by-product 1,2-naphthoquinone, and the metabolic intermediate  1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. Rapid, but limited reduction of Cr(VI) was observed in the  presence of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. The effect of siderophore Desferrioxamine B  (DFB), a common chelator produced by the soil microorganisms, on the biodegradation  of naphthalene was also investigated. Synthesized DFB was added directly into the  test systems, and resulted in instantaneous binding to chromium (VI). The chelated  complex remained stable for a period of 4 days even when subjected to acidic  conditions.</description><creator>Ng, Nai Hong, 1979-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Investigation of the role of electron mediators and siderophores on the concurrect biodegradation of naphthalene and reduction of hexavalent chromium</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f79h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wn42k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pv63g073c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The experimental investigation of blood flow using in vitro  models is very important to derive relevant and quantitative information in order to  understand the biomechanical conditions resulting from blood flow dynamics.  Furthermore, such studies can help us analyze and evaluate flow disturbances caused  by pathologies and by cardiovascular prostheses such as aortic valves and left  ventricular assist devices (LVAD). For example, these disturbances can range from  high shear flow regions causing blood hemolysis to low shear regions resulting in  plaque deposition. Flow visualization studies represent a family of methods to study  fluid flow through cardiovascular hydraulic models using blood analogs. Thus, for  these analogs, two of the main fluid mechanical properties to be reproduced are the  bulk kinematic viscosity and shear-thinning of blood. In a first approach, a blood  model is developed to simultaneously match the kinematic viscosity of blood and the  refractive index of the material of the cardiovascular model for flow visualization  experiments. In a second approach, the development of a non-Newtonian blood analog  is presented to match the shear-thinning behavior of blood. This approach also  allows the development of a blood analog with hemolytic properties.

In the  past decades many studies of the soil deposits of the Montreal Island have taken  place without considering the influence of unconsolidated soils. The objective of  this thesis is to determine the predominant frequency and amplification of the  ground acceleration of the unconsolidated soils, on the Island of  Montreal. The methodology consists of applying the widely known Nakamura's  technique to obtain the predominant frequency of resonance. The technique consists  in calculating the ratio between the horizontal and vertical components of the  response spectra. One-dimensional analyses of soil columns are used to validate the  frequency of the first method and to estimate the amplification factors. The  analysis is carried out using Shake 91. A thorough study of the soils and their  characteristics was necessary to conduct the analysis. The final product includes  maps for the predominant frequency and amplification factors for four seismic  scenarios.</description><creator>Madriz, Ricardo Adolfo</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Seismic microzonation of the island of Montreal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf30t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4626013</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010q62t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The problems of Connection-oriented Networking Call Admission  Control (CAC) and Routing Control (RC) in Integrated Networks are formulated as  finite and infinite horizon finite-state Stochastic Dynamic Programs. In particular,  Poisson Markovian communication networks are analysed in detail. Because of the  complexity of communication networks and of the operation of some kind of  communication networks, such as the Internet, by multi-agents, it is effectively  impossible to obtain the optimal solutions. Currently it is reasonable to use  decentralized aggregation methods to obtain sub-optimal solutions for CAC and RC  communication problems. In this thesis, stochastic dynamic programming methods for  the optimal control of such network are studied. The notion of a doubly stochastic  network, which possesses Markovian aggregated dynamics, is introduced, this is  exploited in the hierarchical stochastic control of such hierarchical  networks.</description><creator>Ma, Zhongjing, 1975-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Call admission control and routing control in integrated communication networks via dynamic programming</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tm548.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q62t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pd51p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Electric power substations are very vulnerable to earthquakes.  This study has analyzed the seismic risk index of electric power substations of  Hydro-Quebec. The critical parameters responsible for vulnerability of substations  are identified by statistical analysis of field data. Correlation of different  parameters with vulnerability, sensitivity of the weighting factors of critical  parameters and sensitivity of seismic exposure levels to seismic risk index are also  studied by statistical analysis. Study shows that year of manufacture of equipment,  anchoring of heavy equipment, load-bearing system of the building, and control  systems are the four most critical parameters for vulnerability. Vulnerability of substations largely depends on the performance  of circuit breakers and control buildings during earthquakes. An analytical approach  is used to determine the seismic fragility of circuit breakers. Risk based design  concepts are used to determine the probability of failure of circuit breakers for a  range of peak ground accelerations. The fragility curves are obtained by plotting  the probability of failure as a function of peak ground acceleration. The fragility  curves are used to determine the appropriateness of circuit breakers on various  seismic zones.</description><creator>Jaigirdar, Masum Ahmed</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Seismic fragility and risk analysis of electric power substations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d34w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pd51p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712m714x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Presently, durability design of reinforced concrete structures  is dealt with in a purely deterministic way and deterioration models have not been  developed to their full potential. In particular, researchers who have investigated  corrosion and the models currently used to predict the response of concrete, have  often overlooked the effect of cracking. Cracks in concrete generally interconnect  flow paths and increase the influx of water or aggressive chemical ions into the  concrete, facilitating its deterioration. The present research program was  undertaken primarily to study the effect of the crack width on the transport of  chlorides in the concrete, which eventually leads to corrosion of the reinforcing  steel. The experimental work consisted of casting cylindrical concrete  samples, which were later subjected to a tensile stress to induce transverse  cracking in the samples. Cracks of varying widths were produced on all the specimens  (0mm i.e. two specimens were left not cracked, 0.1mm, 0.5mm, 1.0mm, and 1.5mm).</description><creator>Jefremczuk, Sandra</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Chloride ingress and transport in cracked concrete</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs54q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m714x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z831b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates a series of elementary cues, which  together are thought to constitute fundamental components of the perceptual process  arising from haptic interaction with an object. Results from a first study indicate  that direct contact between fingerpad and object is important during haptic  exploration. This was hypothesized to be so since the stereotypical contact region  that is defined between fingerpad and object during direct contact is fundamentally  different from the contact region defined through interaction of the object with an  intermediary such as a probe. In an attempt to artificially create local contact  region deformation trajectories, a servo-controlled mechanism was designed to roll a  flat plate on the fingerpad during exploration of virtual surfaces thereby mimicking  trajectories that are normally observed during direct fingerpad exploration of a  physical object. Using the mechanism, it was demonstrated that through the  presentation of this single cue an experience of touching three-dimensional shapes  could be created. The importance of additional cues, such as number of contact  points and motor control effects, on the haptic acquisition of shape information  were also investigated.</description><creator>Dostmohamed, Hanifa</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Presentation of haptic shape through contact location trajectory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb3978856.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z831b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h4940</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Large Adaptive Reflector is a Canadian design for a new  radio telescope. The receiver is held at the focus of the reflector by an aerostat  tethered to the ground by multiple tethers. One of the main goals in the design of  this system is the minimization of the motion of the receiver. Most perturbations  are produced by the action of the wind on the aerostat and transmitted to the  confluence point via the leash that connects the aerostat to the receiver. For that  reason, this work focused on leash-related stabilization techniques. Computer  simulations were used to evaluate the benefits of different passive and active  methods. Among the passive approaches studied were the use of a constant force  spring and of a passive heave compensator. The active methods evaluated included  aerostat pitch control and active heave compensation. One of the more promising  approaches, a leash made of bungee cable, was evaluated experimentally on a  prototype of the system in Penticton, BC. Finally, a pitch control mechanism was  designed. This mechanism displaces the leash attachment point on the harness to  pitch the aerostat nose up or down.</description><creator>Deschênes, François</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>A study of design improvements for a multi-tethered aerostat system /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06988039.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h4940</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n172z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:53:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Error correcting codes are of paramount importance for reliable  communications. By adding redundancy to the transmitted data they allow the decoder  to detect and correct errors. However in favorable channel conditions, a part of  this redundancy can be removed in order to increase throughput. Unfortunately most  coding schemes are poorly adapted to these higher coding rates. For example, the  decoding of block codes grows exponentially with code length. In this thesis we  propose a novel solution to this problem: selective trellis pruning. Selective trellis pruning reduces decoding complexity by  removing certain codewords from the trellis. This reduction is accomplished by  making hard decisions on the values of bits in the received sequence above the  certainty threshold. This method can produce near-optimal results with only a  fraction of the operation required by full decoding thanks to the reduced trellis  size. In this work we also introduce an innovative way of obtaining the pruned  trellis directly from a simplified version of the generator matrix. By using this  method we avoid the long process of constructing and then pruning the full  trellises, thus making the selective trellis pruning algorithm an efficient decoding  tool. Finally we apply this algorithm to the parallel concatenated turbo block code  decoder in order to reduce its complexity.</description><creator>Bertrand, Eric, 1980-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Simplified trellis decoding of block codes by selective pruning</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2685692.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n172z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35700</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
