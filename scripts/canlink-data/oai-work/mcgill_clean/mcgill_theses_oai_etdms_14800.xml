This population includes one qadloona (white) transient family which represents the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources (DNANR) of the Government of  Canada, which is responsible for the administration of Eskimo affairs in Northern Quebec. Beginning in 1959, the people of George River went through an intensive period of social change, the results of which the present author studied in the summer of 1946, which will be taken as the ethnographic present. The impetus for change came from the Government of Canada's program of social and economic development and had two main objectives; first, to gather the scattered Eskimo people together in settlements for administrative efficiency and to implement social services already existing in the rest of Canada, and second, to improve and organize the economy based upon the formation of Eskimo cooperatives.

Structural features of this type are of great interest to the geophysicist to establish relation between physical quantities measured at the surface and geometry of such structures. A subsurface fault can be diagnosed, under density contrast condition, with surface gravity measurements. The present detailed gravity survey was undertaken to determine if such a condition existed, to correlate geological information with gravity data, and to assess this data in terms of possible parameters of the fault structure. The field work was carried out in the summer months of 1964 with a Worden gravimeter. [...]</description><creator>Anwar, Muhammad Ilyas.</creator><contributor>Clark, T.

In the description of the overall transfer process the contribution from each elementary transport process has been considered.

Since the movment (uptake and outflow) of noradrenaline might be influenced by changes in heart functions, e.g. coronary flow, heart rate and cardiac contractility, attempts were made to cerrelate movement of noradrenaline  with changes in these functions. It is now clearly established that the heart can take up exogenous noradrenaline and that the absorbed noradrenaline appears to be localised at similar sites to those of the physiologically occurring amine. It has also been reported that radioactive labelled noradrenaline is retained by the heart for a long time in some type of inactive bound form [...]</description><creator>Agrawal, Krishan K.</creator><contributor>Melville, K.

These studies critically examined the education system from the points of view of the qualification of its teaching staff, the effectiveness of its administration, the adequacy of its curricula and of the instructional methods used, the suitability of its facilities, the extent of its support by the Nigerian public, and the abilities and attitudes of its students. Most of these studies found that the Nigerian education system was a wholesale "export" of the types of education that enjoyed the most esteem in Europe, particularly in England, and which was only just adequate in supplying the needs of the Christian missions for teachers and preachers and of the colonial government for clerks and workers for the subordinate ranks of the administration.

This period represents a logical phase in English social history marking at one end the start of the Reformation and at the other what might be referred to as the Elizabethan settlement of 'commonwealth' matters. In Scotland the same period witnessed the beginnings of a national awareness of social problems, together with the steady growth of the reform movement culminating in the Reformation of 1560 and the compilation of the first Book of Discipline.

The limestones of the Deschambault outcrop in a discontinuous belt on the northwest side of the St. Lawrence River from Montreal to a point just beyond Quebec City (Figure 1).

For the purpose of analysis the jet is replaced by a continuous sink of strength equivalent to the inflow into the jet. When a jet flows over a surface of an aerofoil the effective camber of the aerofoil is increased due to the downwash velocity associated with jet entrainment. This increases the lift attained by the aerofoil as well as the nose down pitching moment. [...]</description><creator>Wygnanski, Israel.</creator><contributor>Newman, B.

In studying the properties of sliding superconducting contact resistance, contacts with their supérconducting members separated by a thin layer of copper, nickel or lead oxide were used. The contact resistance as a function of applied contact current, of contact sliding speed and of contact pressure has been measured in order to arrive at some definite conclusions in regard to obtaining a reproducible low loss contact with a long operating life. The sliding contact resistance was periodic in nature, the comparison of contact resistance was by their average values rather than their peak values; an integrator was employed to facilitate the averaging operation. The magnitude of sliding contact resistance was found to be approximately one-thousandth of the normal resistance at liquid air temperature. The main cause of sliding resistance was considered to be an effect of surface eddy current which quenched each microscopic contact. At very low applied contact current and slow sliding speed, no sliding contact resistance was detected. [...]</description><creator>Wong, Oliver Nai Fung.</creator><contributor>Farnell, G.
