Scarce any man thought of himself so seriously or of life so holily, as to sniff at the writer's art. Poetry was felt to be true. Great poets spoke out in the Drama with a frank strength, - mirrored forth human nature with reality and ideality. "Look in thine heart and write", the keynote of those sonnets in which Sir Philip Sidney gives expression to his ideal passion, might have been Marlowe's motto, or S&amp;akspere1s, or Ben Jonson's. Despite isolated detractors like Gossen, poetry was never in danger of being discountenanced by the intelligent Elizabethan ; it could claim the attention of all sane and able men, and the devotion of the highest genius.

If you UNSCOTCH us you will find us damned mischievous Englishmen. The restless and yet laborious and constantly watchful character of the people, their desire for speculation in politics or anything else, only restrained by some proud feelings about their own country, now become antiquated, and which bold measures will tend much to destroy, will make them under a wrong direction, the most formidable revolutionists who ever took the field of innovation."  Scott is obviously prejudiced by national and party feeling, combined with his natural conservatism. His words not only indicate the confusion between the terms liberalism and revolution, common in the minds of those who feared Jacobinism, but also suggest an interesting relationship between England and Scotland.

It represents the full bloom of the Greek genius for philosophy. To the Greeks, the possibility of a mortal acquiring a connected view of things which might explain all existence, presented a problem of intense interest, and it must be admitted that, as a people, they did more to advance toward such a view than: the members of any other single race. And in the theories of Plato we find the highest point to which Greek philosophy; attained. Leaving entirely the world of sense, he constructs a great overfloating Kingdom of Ideas of which ordinary so- called "objects" are really but images or adumbrations.

The absorption of gas by a liquid is what is ordinarily known as the solution of the gas by the liquid. The absorption of gas by a solid, sometimes called "occlusion," includes (1) the mechanical retention and adhesion of the gas or vapour in the crevices between particles of the solid, and (2) in the capillary spaces of individual particles, and also (3) the "'adsorption," or condensation upon the surface of the solid, of the gaseous molecules, this condensation being due to molecular attraction between the gas and solid.
