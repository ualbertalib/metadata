Two early phage encoded gene products directly involved in this process include the transposase (gene A) and ner proteins. We have cloned, overexpressed and visualized the ner proteins of both phages under the control of the lac UV5 transcriptional promoter and determined (using the band competition assay) that each is a site specific DNA-binding protein. We also physically mapped these ner operator sites by DNase I-footprinting and found minor DNA sequence conservation. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the D108 ner gene revealed little homology at the DNA level but up to 48% conservation of the amino acids of the ner proteins. However, the ner proteins could not specifically bind to each other's operators. Competition experiments and the spatial organization and strength of the early and repressor promoters suggests the evolution of a stronger binding D108 ner protein and hence a difference in the manner that these phages may regulate the expression of their early and repressor gene promoters. In addition, gel filtration experiments showed that both purified proteins behave as monomers in solution with a native molecular weight of 8 kDa. We have also cloned and visualized proteins containing various amino terminal portions of the D108 transposase under lac UV5 transcriptional control and shown that the 13 kDa amino terminus (which may form two bi-$ alpha$-helical structures) contains a two component sequence specific DNA-binding domain. In addition, we have purified a Mu A$ sp prime$-$ sp prime$bla fusion protein containing 13 kDa of the amino terminus of the Mu transposase and shown that it can bind to the Mu att R site but in a different manner compared to the entire 70 kDa transposase. This binding suggests the possible recognition of the sequence 5$ sp prime$-PuCGAAA-3' which appears to be conserved at the ends of all class II transposons.</description><creator>Tolias, Peter P.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Functional protein-DNA interactions of the ner and transposase proteins from bacteriophages Mu and D108</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903068b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp95r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm67k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of lung deformation upon its mechanical properties was studied by measuring the quasi-static (Cstat) and dynamic (Cdyn) compliances of excised newborn piglet lungs deformed by a vertical pleural surface pressure gradient. Cstat was not affected by deformation. Cdyn was less than Cstat in the deformed and undeformed lungs but the difference was greater in the deformed lungs. This behavior suggests that distortion of the chest wall may increase the external (PV) work of breathing in newborns. The contribution of lung viscoelasticity to the difference between Cstat and Cdyn of the undeformed lung was examined by measuring stress relaxation, Cstat, and Cdyn of excised lungs from newborn kittens and adult cats. The relative difference between Cdyn and Cstat and the magnitude of stress relaxation decreased with age, indicating that the viscous nature of the newborn's lungs causes larger, rate dependent changes in its compliance compared to the adult's. Age related changes in the viscoelastic properties of the rat respiratory system were examined in rats between 1 and 40 days old. The rate of stress relaxation increased in the first week and thereafter decreased. Mean rates of stress relaxation were used to predict rate dependent changes in the passive recoil pressure of the respiratory system using an empirical model of viscoelasticity. Predictions were close to actual values suggesting that frequency dependent changes in the dynamic compliance of the newborn's respiratory system can occur independently of mechanisms involving the distribution of ventilation.</description><creator>Sullivan, Kevin J.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Factors affecting the compliance of the lungs and respiratory system in newborn mammals</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pg94c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm67k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w37637556</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous studies have established that sensitivity (IgE antibody response) to Ra5S, a 5 kd protein of short ragweed pollen, is significantly associated with host possession of HLA-Dw2/DR2 (Bias et al., 1979; March et al., 1982a; Coulter, 1983). The present work was undertaken to determine a possible association between HLA and sensitivity to Ra5G, an Ra5S homologue from giant ragweed pollen. The DR2 allele was also implicated in sensitivity to Ra5G, on the basis of co-sensitivity to both proteins (Goodfriend et al., 1985). Further analysis with an enlarged RW allergic population demonstrated that sensitivity to Ra5G and Ra5S is associated with separate alleles: DRw52 and DR2 respectively. Results consistent with the same sensitivity/DR associations were obtained in immunoabsorption studies with sera from co-sensitive individuals. As HLA-DR2 and DRw52 have identical alpha but different beta chains, it was considered that IgE antibody responses to Ra5S and Ra5G are associated with distinct DR-beta genes.</description><creator>Coulter-Hennekens, Kelsye</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>HLA associations with specific immune responses : the Ra5 ragweed allergen model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558d994.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37637556</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278t72t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines whether pairs of same-sex siblings labeled differently (one "gifted", one "not gifted") deidentify more than pairs of same-sex siblings who are labeled the same (both "gifted"). It further investigates patterns of perceived similarity between the siblings and patterns of parent identification to establish how these influence parents' perceptions of their children as "gifted" or "not gifted". Deidentification did not appear to vary depending on whether children were labeled the same or differently. However, females produced higher measures of deidentification than males--with girls labeled the same producing the highest scores of all. All parents tended to see siblings as contrasting. They also showed a tendency to split parent identify with their children--each parent identified with a different child. In 39 out of 40 cases if parents perceived themselves as having been gifted students, then the children they identified with were labeled as "gifted". This parental labeling seemed to occur well before any formal identification and was maintained in the face of contrary evidence. For this group different labeling was not associated with poor sibling interaction. Poor sibling relationships appear to co-occur with poor marital relationships.</description><creator>Grenier, Marcella Evan.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Gifted children -- Identification -- Research.</subject><subject>Parent and child</subject><subject>Brothers and sisters</subject><title>Patterns of sibling deidentification and parent identification in families with gifted children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m485s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t72t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579s92p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The title compound was synthesized and its chemistry studied for the first time.

At low heating rates v, 0.5  12 K/h, it cannot be detected in the usual DSC runs made at v = 600 K/h or higher. The crystallinity found including fraction (III) (0.84-0.94) upgrades the calorimetric crystallinity to the values found by techniques not involving melting. Arrested melting which occurs between fractions (II) and (III) reveals the existence of a network whose cohesive junctions are unmelted and stabilized by strain. The amount of fraction (III) which is about 20% in the nascent sample increases to about a third of all crystals in a sample submitted to cycles of slow melting and slow crystallization. Fraction (III) is stable in the presence of a solvent. However, its concentration in the sample can be made to vary between 5 and 25% by the appropriate choice of the solvent and thermal history. The network is stabilized during the dissolution of fraction (II) in decalin while it is reduced if the solvent is trichlorobenzene. Other thermal histories minimize the effect of solvent on the partition of the crystals between fractions (II) and (III). Crystallization in a temperature gradient is effective in diminishing fraction (III) and increasing fraction (II). A hypothesis to explain the high crystallinity of gels obtained by quenching is proposed. The metastable states obtained during dissolution do not revert to the equilibrium state when the solvent is evaporated. Mechanical properties such as drawability and also the melting trace of the dried gels are affected by the solvent-induced changes in the melting pattern. The amount of fraction (III) appears to be a good test of drawability. The dissolution traces at low v provide a much-needed quantitative characterization of UHMWPE gels, the crystals formed on quenching having a dissolution trace distinguishable from those grown isothermally or under shear. Since fraction (III) results from a general process of melting, its occurrence in other polymers is expected and indeed has been found in preliminary experiments on poly-4-methylpentenel (P4MP1) and polypropylene (PP).

Discontinuous wall-frame structures are studied to assess the effects of the discontinuities on the horizontal interaction, and on the structures' lateral stiffness. The discontinuities include stepped walls or frames, curtailed walls, and different configurations of stiffened-storey frames. In each case, a continuum solution is developed and used to describe the behaviour of the structure, and to evaluate the effects of the discontinuities. Corresponding discrete finite elements analyses are also performed to verify the accuracy of the algebraic solutions and to determine the nature and magnitude of the resulting effects. For stepped and curtailed wall-frame structures, it is found that the walls can be reduced or curtailed without modifying significantly the overall horizontal interaction and lateral stiffness. It is found that for stiffened-storey frame structures, the horizontal interaction and lateral stiffness are significantly increased. This constitutes an entirely new type of high-rise wall-frame structure of greater efficiency.</description><creator>Nollet, Marie-José</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Behaviour of wall-frame structures : a study of the interactive behaviour of continuous and discontinuous wall-frame structures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d9705.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg416</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87pr030</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Following melt alloying and chlorine fluxing in reverberatory-like aluminum holding furnaces, it is common practice to allow the melt to settle for about an hour prior to casting operations. The purpose of this procedure is to allow inclusions to settle to the surface bottom or to float out to an overlying layer of dross. Mathematical modelling of this process reveals that significant natural convection currents are generated, particularly during the early part of this holding period, and that as these currents gradually diminish, so does the rate of precipitation of inclusions. A 6.25 ton pilot scale holding furnace was used to test the model's predictions of changes in metal quality with holding time. Satisfactory agreement was observed between predicted and "LiMCA"$ sp1$ measured changes in inclusion density levels of (Ti-V)B$ sb2$.

Change of base within this 2-fibration is given by the left adjoint to the restriction functor. Pitts' pullback theorem (Pi) is important to descent in this context, and a new and more natural proof of it is obtained. As in (Pi), the proof herein depends on Pare's (P2) results on generated topologies. The present context is 2-categorical, and an abstract 2-descent theorem is obtained. Its first use is to show that a geometric morphism which is of effective descent for cocomplete categories remains so for toposes. Studying toposes as cocomplete categories is analogous to studying locales as sup-lattices. Pure geometric morphisms are introduced in terms of the cocontinuous dual of a cocomplete category. They are shown to be of effective descent for cocomplete categories. Hence, a new proof of Moerdijk's (M5) version of a classification theorem for toposes originally due to Bunge (B4) is obtained.</description><creator>Funk, Jonathon</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Descent for cocomplete categories</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9997391.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq04f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10wq87s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The heat transfer characteristics of turbulent impinging jets, typical of those used in paper machine cross machine direction caliper profile control were measured. The effect of jet entrainement on the impingement heat transfer by unconfined jets was successfully scaled using a jet thermal entrainement factor. The addition of a confinement plate to an existing unconfined impinging jet control system was shown to improve the average heat transfer by 33% and 80% for a nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing of 2 and 1 respectively. The thermal deformation of calender roll under control actuators was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i.e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness. The results indicate that control actuator spacings less than 0.2m provide negligible control advantage. Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize the magnitude of the response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the top roll, each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators. When two calenders are used in succession, the actuators should be placed in the first stack. Calender roll design must be considered when choosing the location for control actuators.</description><creator>Journeaux, Ian A.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Impinging jet heat transfer and thermal deformation for calender rolls</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d7181.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wq87s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537191f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The synthesis of 95, a non-hydrolyzable dinucleotide analogue bearing an internucleoside thioether linkage, is described.

Mantle xenoliths brought to the surface by alkaline lavas at 6 volcanic centers along the northwestern margin of North America provide a way to estimate the contents of these volatiles in the upper mantle. Carbon (C), hydrogen (H$ sb2$) and nitrogen (N$ sb2$) are contained as several C-H-N phases in these xenoliths and lavas; light isotopic C-H-N, C in carbonates, C and N$ sb2$ in fluid inclusions, and dissolved C, H$ sb2$ and N$ sb2$ in anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The light isotopic C-H-N phase, which represents 30 to 95 % of the volatiles extracted from these xenoliths by combustion, contributes 10 to 250 ppm C and 10 to 100 ppm H$ sb2$, with $ delta sp{13}$C and $ delta$D values ranging from $-$31 to $-$23$ perthous$, and $-$150 to $-$100$ perthous$, respectively. This phase is composed of C-H-N hydrocarbon molecules, which are thought to occur along grain boundaries or fractures. Calcite contributes between 1 to 24 ppm C in the temperature range 600-800$ sp circ$C but reaches up to 240 ppm in host volcanic rocks. Carbon of mantle origin is present as a supercritical CO$ sb2$-rich fluid contained in inclusions within the minerals of the xenoliths. Maximum pressures of entrapment are estimated from fluid densities in type I "primary" inclusions to range from 11 to 14 kb, in agreement with the spinel lherzolite stability field of these host xenoliths. The hydrogen content extracted at temperatures $&gt;$600$ sp circ$C from anhydrous spinel lherzolite and harzburgite xenoliths ranges from 3 to 15 ppm H$ sb2$, and from 10 to 25 ppm H$ sb2$ in anhydrous pyroxenites. The H$ sb2$ content extracted at temperatures $&gt;$600$ sp circ$C from xenoliths containing hydrous minerals varies from 18 to 345 ppm H$ sb2$. Nitrogen reaches 8 ppm in the xenolith most enriched in fluid inclusions and 58 ppm in phlogopites from an amphibole clinopyroxenite. Partial melting calculations indicate that the C, H$ sb2$ and N$ sb2$ contents of primary MORB magmas derived from a mantle source similar to the anhydrous spinel lherzolite of this study would contain 4-145 ppm C, 20-215 ppm H$ sb2$ and 0.2-7.0 ppm N$ sb2$. The isotopic signature ranges of C, H$ sb2$ and N$ sb2$ in the upper mantle beneath the northwestern margin of North America are estimated to be; $-$10 to $-$4$ perthous$, $-$95 to $-$45$ perthous$, and $-$5 to +1.5$ perthous$ respectively, and to contain between 3 and 7 ppm C and 7 to 30 ppm H$ sb2$ with an average content of 4 ppm C and 8 ppm H$ sb2$. If these latter values are representative of the Earth's mantle as a whole, then the Earth is significantly more degassed than previously estimated.

It locates the first serious Anglo-American treatment of infidelity in the novels of Henry James and Ford Madox Ford; and it situates these writers for the first time in their immediate legal context. The dominant mode through which infidelity was discursively defined during this period was simultaneously legal and sensational: the publication of "Divorce Court" trials in the daily newspapers. The implication of this context for the novel is twofold. The focus on narration from the perspective of the betrayed party prompts a local questioning of knowledge (of knowing one's spouse), and a more general questioning of the epistemoloigcal premises of the realist novel itself. The novels considered here make clear the limitations of a legal discourse committed to a disinterested record of "what happened." In the process, they illustrate several of the narrative innovations most distinctive to the modernist novel. Secondly, what will be called an "aesthetics of suspicion" and "domestic surveillance" distinguishes James's and Ford's novels from the central critical tradition which reads the representation of infidelity as subversive of social norms. Instead, these novels reinforce, thematically and formally, the legal policing of infidelity. Doubt of both conjugal and narrative fidelity, then, becomes the means through which the legal policing of infidelity in the divorce court is covertly extended in the novel.</description><creator>Leckie, Barbara</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Adultery in literature</subject><title>Infidelity, the novel, and the law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zf201.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv25j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f416q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Radial gas holdup profiles were determined in 50 cm and 91 cm dia. flotation columns. The local gas holdup was measured using an electrical conductivity technique, which is described in detail. The effect of gas rate and axial location on the profiles was investigated. The relative variation in gas holdup was about 20%. The profiles were axially symmetric but of complex shape: parabolic, saddle and 'W' shapes were observed. For the case of a parabolic profile, the shear stress model was solved to give liquid circulation velocity profiles; no solution was found for the other gas holdup profile shapes. Measurement of radial gas holdup profiles may prove useful in evaluating sparger systems. For example, in the pilot column, one off-centre sparger gave a non-symmetrical shape but nevertheless did distribute the gas relatively evenly. Liquid residence time distributions (RTD) were measured for various operating and design conditions using the pulse tracer technique. Application of the one-dimensional plug flow axial dispersion model and the use of the vessel dispersion number $N sb{ rm d}$ to quantify the degree of mixing was evaluated. A numerical solution to the axial dispersion model with closed-closed boundary conditions using the finite difference method is recommended for column RTD studies. Compartment models were also evaluated: the N perfect tanks-in-series model did not fit the data but a backflow compartment model was successful. The effect of gas rate, liquid rate, column length, feed percent solids and column verticality on $N sb{ rm d}$ was studied. It was found that $N sb{ rm d}$ increased with gas rate and decreased with liquid rate and column length. Percent solids and verticality had a minor effect on $N sb{ rm d}.$ New correlations to predict $N sb{ rm d}$ were developed and compared with previous correlations.</description><creator>Xu, Manqiu</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Radial gas holdup profile and mixing in the collection zone of flotation columns</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j16b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f416q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bg257f87z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The gas-phase synthesis of phosphorous trioxide from phosphorus vapour and steam at high temperatures to produce phosphorous acid by a subsequent quench with cold water was studied. A complete experimental laboratory, containing a heavily-insulated chemical reactor, phosphorus vapour feed system and product recovery systems, was designed and constructed for this work. A plasma torch supplied the sensible heat and heat of reaction for the desired oxide formation. The effects of the steam-to-phosphorus (H$ sb2$O/P$ sb4$) ratio, temperature, plasma gas composition and flowrate, quench flowrate and position on the production rate of phosphorous acid and on its purity in the liquid effluent were examined. A study of the concentration and temperature profiles within the reactor was first performed in order to gain a basic understanding of the mixing of two impinging jets with a plasma tailflame at the jet expansion zone and improve the design of the reactor to better achieve the production of phosphorous acid. High-purity phosphorous acid, 90-95%, was produced at H$ sb2$O/P$ sb4$ ratios from 6 to 10, at temperatures above 1350 K. Phosphoric acid was the major impurity in the acid product. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations showed excellent agreement with the experimental results. These calculations also predicted that this purity could be improved to 98.5% with the addition of hydrogen to the reaction system (H$ sb2$/P$ sb4$ = 10). The use of nitrogen as the plasma gas provided a relatively inexpensive gas source and did not produce phosphorus nitrides. The position, flowrate and degree of atomisation of the water quench was critical to the production rate of phosphorous acid.</description><creator>Bronet, Murray S.</creator><contributor>Gauvin, W.

The suitability of the guinea pig animal model was established by demonstrating collagenolysis in the uterine cervix similar to the changes reported in women by light and electron microscopy. By 50 days gestation, there was a 50% decrease in collagen content in the cervix. At parturition (68 $ pm$ 2 days) there was a 6-fold increase in procollagenase, a 26-fold increase in the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) and a 2-fold increase in net collagenase activity in cervical extracts. Cervices in organ culture obtained at birth produced 2.9 times more procollagenase, 1.6 times more TIMP and a 10-fold increase in net collagenase activity when compared to nonpregnant or 25 days pregnant animals. Estradiol stimulated the production of procollagenase, TIMP and net collagenase activity in cervical organ cultures. Using primary monolayer cervical cell cultures derived from 50 day pregnant guinea pigs, procollagenase enzyme and its mRNA were stimulated up to 2-fold by recombinant human interleukin 1$ beta$ (IL-1$ beta$), estrogens and progesterone. Procollagenase production was completely abolished by cycloheximide and by actinomycin D indicating the need for translation and transcription respectively. The mechanism of signal transduction of procollagenase was also investigated. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum (R4718) that specifically reacts with epitopes on denatured and degraded $ alpha$2 chain of guinea pig type I collagen was used to demonstrate degradation of type I collagen in the extracellular matrix of the dilated cervix at parturition.

Gene specific hybridization probes have been used to determine that the three mdr genes are linked on a chromosomal segment of 625 kilobases, with the gene order and orientation: (5$ sp prime$) mdr3 (3$ sp prime$)-(5$ sp prime$) mdr1 (3$ sp prime$)-(3$ sp prime$) mdr2 (5$ sp prime$). In independently derived cell lines, we observed that the emergence of multidrug resistance is linked to the overexpression of either and mdr1 or the mdr3 gene. The mdr1 gene has been isolated and its genomic organization determined: the gene spans 68 kilobases, is split into 28 exons encoding discrete predicted domains of the protein, and appears to originate from the duplication of an intron-containing ancestor gene. The mdr1 promoter has been cloned, sequenced, and the transcription start site localized. The transcriptional activities of 5$ sp prime$ deletion fragments from the mdr1 promoter fused to a reporter gene have been tested by transient transfection in a panel of mouse cell lines. These studies have allowed the identification of proximal and distal regions in the mdr1 promoter, containing basal and cell-specific transcriptional activities.</description><creator>Raymond, Martine</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>The mouse multidrug resistance mdr gene family : structure, evolution, and expression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d05z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz22g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k5667</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation is a study of the first three plays that Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote for the operatic stage: Iphis and La Decouverte du nouveau monde, both examples of the genre tragedie lyrique, and Les Muses galantes, an opera-ballet. Semiotic and poetic analyses bring to light striking resemblances between the dramatic situations depicted in the operas and the personal drama of the young Rousseau in love. As a whole, the operas reveal two distinct portraits of the self in love. The first, painted in colours of passion, reveals a self implicated in triangular relationships that are resolved through the abnegation of desire; the second, brushed in shades of contentment, devotion, and fidelity, celebrate the delights of requited love. These two portraits are studied in the light of Rousseau's principal writings in order to demonstrate how the early operatic works reflect true images of an ever evolving self in love.</description><creator>Bermingham, Ronald P.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, 1712-1778 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Le théâtre de jeunesse de Rousseau : portrait du "moi" en amoureux</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c504.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k5667</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rh73z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the interaction of religion and politics in Bangladesh in light of the hypothesis that the nature of the particular process of Islamization of the state of Bangladesh, leading to its present semi-Islamic status, has been a function of three independent variables: the specific nature of Islam in the society; the configuration of political interests; and the international environment.

These industries have a number of common features which inter-relate to produce a unique configuration. Foremost among the attributes that make up this configuration is the sparsity and magnitude of transactions on which the industry must subsist. The decrease in the number of transactions, and the increase in their size, results in a "thin" industry. The sparsity and size of transactions combine to produce complex, unstable, and highly interconnected environments. These environmental conditions motivate firms to develop external linkages with other organizations. The successful management of external linkages will frequently depend on knowledge and experience obtained in previous relationships. Many of the problems created by external linkages can only be resolved once they are formed. At the same time, the knowledge required to resolve these problems calls for previous experience. The dissertation is divided into two parts. In the first three chapters we explore thin industries as a type and as an environment. In the remaining three chapters we look at the ramifications of interorganizational learning on the management of external linkages. In the concluding chapter we discuss the implications of thin industries to the study and practice of strategic management. Three issues in particular are singled out: the decline of organizational autonomy, the limits of competition, and new directions for theory building.

The first part is a comparative study of the evolution of body size, multicellularity and segregated soma. The allometry of morphological characters, development, life history and the life cycle are also considered. The second part is an experimental test of the potential role of mutation as a determinant of the course of evolution. Mutation is directional for all the characters studied. The variances and covariances created by mutation are compared to those of 30 species of Volvocaceae; the correspondence between the two depends upon the characted examined. In the third part, the growth of germ cells grown with and without a soma is compared. The response to nutrient concentration of cells grown with an intact soma is steeper than that of cells grown without a soma. This result demonstrates a physiological advantage of soma in Volvox, attributable to a division of labour between 'source' and 'sink'.</description><creator>Koufopanou, Vasso, 1957-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Volvocales -- Evolution.</subject><subject>Green algae -- Evolution.</subject><title>Evolution and development in the flagellate green algae (Chlorophyta, Volvocales)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dw232.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s0901</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wg65d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A connectionist architecture is developed that can be used for modeling choice probabilities and reaction times in psychophysics and word recognition.

The new learning procedure is interpreted as a selective attention mechanism, and leads to a better model of learning in simple identification tasks than the standard back-propagation.
